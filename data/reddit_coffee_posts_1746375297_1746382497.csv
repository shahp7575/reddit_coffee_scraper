I'm excited to embark on the renovation of my loft, a space I've cherished for the past decade. As the owner of a General Contracting business specializing in semi-spec residential, with a touch of commercial and custom projects, I have the resources to bring this vision to life.

**The Unit**

Originally a factory built in the 1870s and converted into residential units in the 2010s, my corner unit boasts impressive 16-foot ceilings within its 511 square feet, creating a surprisingly spacious feel. Four expansive 8-foot windows, including one in the bathroom, along with two exposed brick walls, flood the space with natural light, a feature I intend to maximize. A skylight, slightly offset from the center, further enhances the bright atmosphere. Due to its corner location and previous vacancy, the original flooring suffered elemental damage and was replaced with a standard hardwood. For your reference, I've attached the existing and proposed layouts, along with current photos

**New Layout**

My primary goal is to introduce a loft area above the bedroom and partially over the shower. This addition will allow for a full walk-in closet on the main floor without altering the location of my existing stacked washer and dryer. Furthermore, it will enable me to relocate the water heater and HVAC unit into dedicated closets/areas on the first floor, thereby opening up the living space considerably. Currently, the water heater is situated above the washer/dryer, and the HVAC is above the existing shower. While I'm not a structural engineer, I plan to consult with one to finalize the loft design. I have acquired an 8"" x 8"" solid oak beam that will span 17 feet, with one end bearing into the 1' 8"" thick brick wall. A preliminary sketch of the floor system is attached. I will be exploring options for floor trusses to accommodate the HVAC ductwork. The existing hardwood floors will be sanded and refinished to match the new loft flooring, for which I will need to select a stain. Additionally, all drywall will be removed to incorporate spray foam insulation for enhanced sound dampening.

**Design Ideas**

This is where I'm seeking your expertise. While I have a strong construction background, interior finishes are an area where I'd appreciate guidance to ensure I honor the loft's history while integrating modern design elements.

**Living Room**

Upon entering, you step directly into the living room. I envision a bohemian-inspired aesthetic, perhaps with a plush, L-shaped couch. For a coffee table, I'm considering a substantial wood block to maximize the usable space in front of the sofa. A large flat-screen television with surround sound is a must. A low-voltage specialist will assist in concealing the wiring, and the receiver/router will be housed above the built-in chase in the kitchen area, towards the center of the unit. I'm open to suggestions for specific finishes in this space.

**Kitchen**

The kitchen is a crucial area for me. As gas is not an option, I'm leaning towards a color palette of dark green and natural wood. My proposed layout features dark green lower cabinets and natural wood upper cabinets, with the natural wood extending down from the refrigerator/pantry. Adjacent to the pantry, I plan to include a small wet bar/coffee station. The floating shelves will be either reclaimed wood or a matching wood tone from the cabinet manufacturer. I was thinking some classic looking backslash full height on the cooktop side and some funky tile for the wet bar area. The built-in range hood will be painted to match the green cabinets and will house a recirculating fan, so external ventilation isn't required. I've indicated three pendant lights over the peninsula. I'm also considering a large, multi-string hanging light fixture to visually connect the living room and kitchen (an example fixture is below). The loft floor system will accommodate my HVAC ducts and will enter into my living/kitchen space as an HVAC chase, which, as you can see in the photos, currently acts as a cap piece to the kitchen cabinets. My initial thought is to keep this chase white (register caps are also below). The HVAC chase above the stovetop/hood will serve as the dryer vent to the exterior. The existing one is a 6"" circular duct that has the penetrations in place already. The perpendicular beam above the kitchen is a non-structural element that can house electrical wiring, while the parallel beam is structural. Here are some initial thoughts for appliances and fixtures(not finalized just ideas):

* **Inspirations:** Photos response below

I would appreciate countertop ideas. I'm considering a different countertop for the wet bar, perhaps with a leathered finish and a unique backsplash. While white offers a classic look, I'm open to more creative suggestions. Built-in stools that can fold away when not in use are also on my wish list. Recessed lighting will be incorporated throughout

**Bedroom**

The bedroom design presents some unique challenges. Due to space constraints, I plan to install a ship ladder-style staircase with slightly deeper treads (around 6"") and an 8"" rise. I'm envisioning thick wooden treads and a single metal railing on the left side. Two flanking sconce lights will illuminate the stairwell. The exposed oak beam will be a prominent design feature, with the finished loft floor butting directly into it. I plan for a king-sized bed with tandem pendant lights above the nightstands. To maximize natural light, I'd like to incorporate two 4'x4' casement windows into the side of the loft framing, taking advantage of the excellent sunset light from the bathroom window. At the main structural beam, the head height will be approximately 6'1"" to 6'4"", with precise dimensions to be determined after consulting with the structural engineer regarding the floor system design. A freestanding bathtub is currently a dream. While my initial calculations suggest the oak beam could support a marble soaking tub (around 1200 lbs fully filled), I will await the structural engineer's approval. I'm considering a gravel and teak step detail around the tub – I'm unsure if this would be considered dated. The wall adjacent to the bathtub will feature a striking moss wall (material details in the bathroom section). The loft flooring will be a close match to the 3 ½"" wide plank hardwood on the main floor. Lastly, if I have room in the budget I want to the make the open area to below a catamaran net hangout spot. If not, it will just be metal railing

* **Gravel inspiration photos:**  Photos in response

**Closet**

The closet space will be compact. To allow natural light to filter in above, I plan to shorten the wall height by approximately one foot beneath the oak beam. Recessed lighting will be installed throughout the area. I'm designing a 10-foot run of double hanging closet space with a single hanging rod and built-in shelving below. The HVAC closet will be located in the corner next to the stairs. While it might be most practical to design this solely as a utility closet, I've also considered orienting it sideways with a 2'x2' service door on one side and a countertop on top inside. The return air vent will be in the hallway, necessitating a chase within the floor system to route ventilation throughout the unit. While the water heater likely won't be enormous, I'm planning for potential larger units. I briefly considered electric tankless water heaters, but initial research suggests they may not be the most reliable option. A tankless system would, however, save space in the closet. The stacked washer and dryer will be located next to this closet. Currently, the existing space simply opens into the closet area.

**Bathroom**

The bathroom is a space I envision as a personal sanctuary. I plan to continue the natural wood cabinet chosen for the kitchen as a floating vanity in the bathroom. For the countertop, I'm considering either the same material as the main kitchen countertop but with a leathered finish, or matching the wet bar countertop. I'd like to use a circular above-counter sink with faucets mounted on the countertop rather than the wall. Above the vanity, I plan to install a nearly full-width, 10-foot tall mirror, slightly offset from the wall to accommodate an LED strip around the back for ambient lighting. This should enhance the natural light and potentially reflect some towards the bathtub above via the window. I also want to incorporate two pendant lights hanging from the ceiling. For the remaining drywall behind the mirror, I'm considering a pastel color. Given the 16-foot ceilings in the bathroom entry area, I'm drawn to the idea of a full-height moss tile installation on the interior drywall. Research indicates that preserved moss requires no maintenance or watering. I believe this juxtaposed with the brick in the bathroom and shower area would create a striking and bold aesthetic. In the shower, I want to tie in the bathtub's design with a teak floor and a roughly 4-inch band of gravel around the perimeter. The shower will feature a frameless glass enclosure extending to the ceiling. To protect the brick from moisture and enhance its industrial look, I will apply a matte base sealer. I've included three niches in the moss wall, where I envision incorporating some unique tiles. I will also need to determine a finish for the shower curb. Toilet is next to shower.

**Conclusion**

I will gladly provide any further details needed in specific areas. Please bear with me; while I am a seasoned general contractor, my imagination can sometimes run wild, and I truly value your expert guidance in bringing this renovation to fruition.

Thanks for taking a moment to read a bit about me. Here's what I'm looking for and a little about who I am:

# The Goal

I'm seeking a long-term relationship—the kind that leads to settling down, building lasting roots, and growing together emotionally, intellectually, and yes, physically. I want a connection that feels intense and deeply fulfilling, like that yearning, movie-style kind of love.

Physical attraction is important to me—definitely not everything, but a meaningful piece of the puzzle. I’d love for that spark to be mutual from the get-go, so here’s [me](https://imgur.com/a/t6yPlHU), [me again](https://imgur.com/a/vNWwLMe), and [once more](https://imgur.com/a/ziknQbf).  
You don’t have to send a pic right away, but it’s encouraged—ideally within your first message or two so we can both gauge that side of compatibility early on.

# About Me

* 5’10” | 170 lbs | Fit & active. I’m into weightlifting, indoor cycling, and running. Fitness is a big part of my life, and I'd love to share that lifestyle with someone who feels the same. If you're also big into wellness and movement, that’s a huge bonus.
* Work: I’m a board operator at a chemical plant (picture a big desk, 8 screens). It’s a stable, well-paying job that lets me enjoy a comfortable middle-class lifestyle.
* Gaming: I prefer gaming with others—co-op and multiplayer stuff especially. Always down to try new ones!
* Books: Currently reading a James Madison biography. I’m working my way through U.S. presidents, but I also love fantasy. Favorites include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones.
* Music: Huge music lover! I go to festivals often—best so far was Odesza’s Last Goodbye tour.

# About You

You live in the U.S. (distance is OK to start—we’ll close that gap if things go well, I'm from Texas). You’re curious, open-minded, and thoughtful—someone with strong opinions but open ears. You find the joy in little things, are motivated in love and life, and want to grow together with someone long-term.

Bonus points if:

* You're into fitness and would love to work out or stay active together.
* You’re a talker (I’m a yapper, so I get along best with other yappers).
* You like adventures just as much as cozy weekends in.
* You’d totally dress up for a renaissance fair and send me your favorite memes.

Let’s chat over coffee (mine’s black). Late-night talks, weekend trips, and Netflix binges await.

Preemptions be damned, because we finally got the anniversary party, and let’s just say… Dana Leslie Whatever-Her-Name-Is-This-Hour made sure it was unforgettable.

We kicked off the week with everyone stressing out over Ashley and Derek moving in together. Ashley’s main concerns? His hideous decor (that named chair, Herbert, really needs to be set on fire), and the logistics of sharing a shower. Derek’s solution: just share it at the same time. Problem solved, and possibly rated PG-13. They’re cute. Basic, but cute.

Meanwhile, Ashley’s mom is also having a crisis over the couple’s tiny apartment and Derek’s “big ol’ fireman’s pole.” No, not a euphemism — unless it is? It’s hard to tell on this show anymore.

Over at Uptown, Vernon wants Anita to accept an offer for a comeback concert, but she’s hesitant. She’s worried her voice has aged, but Vernon hits her with, “Like fine wine,” and honestly? That Fine Wine Tour idea sounds legit. Too bad Anita’s still haunted by her messy breakup with the Articulettes. Apparently, things with Tracy and Sharon ended badly — and Anita still carries that guilt.

Elsewhere, Martin’s being haunted too — by his recurring nightmare about “that night.” He then wakes to a different sort of nightmare when Chelsea shows up to talk threesomes. Yep. She reveals she’s caught feelings for Allison — a married woman who was previously part of a hook-up — and might be gay? Bi? Chelsea’s not sure, but she’s definitely intrigued. And so is Allison, apparently, because their meetup at Uptown ends with Allison very down for a party of two.

And then… there’s Leslie.

When she corners Martin and Vernon at Orphey Gene’s with a bizarre Bigfoot rant, nobody can pretend she’s just “quirky” anymore. Later, she tells Eva that it was all a calculated performance — but Eva’s not on board. Leslie’s decided the entire Dupree clan deserves vengeance now, not just Ted and Nicole, and Eva’s growing increasingly uneasy with her mother’s mission.

Meanwhile, Ted tries to get frisky with Nicole before the anniversary party, but between Eva’s appetizer  crisis and Mona’s landscaping PowerPoint (don’t ask), he’s lucky to even make a toast. Still, he ends the night covered in whipped cream and strawberries, so we’ll call that a win.

Thursday brings us to party prep chaos. Eva tries (again) to talk Leslie down, but Leslie’s fully in villain monologue mode, comparing her scheme to a rollercoaster. (“You’re scared to death, sure you’re going to die” — ma’am, this is a black tie event not an amusement park.)

Dani and Andre are dancing around going public with their relationship, while Kat is on high alert for a mysterious wig-wearing woman skulking around the country club. She nearly catches Leslie hiding in a supply closet but just misses her — because Leslie has already slipped out and is watching Ted and Nicole like a deranged wedding crasher.

But here’s where it gets good. Ted and Nicole are being absolute sweethearts, giving each other sentimental jewelry, while Eva is living her best life — being offered jobs left and right and finally getting some recognition. So naturally, this is the moment Leslie decides to blow it all up.

Eva tries to stop her, telling Leslie that the Duprees have already accepted her. But Leslie is not moved. She locks Eva in the closet and marches her chaotic self straight into the dining room like she owns the place.

Friday’s episode is where all hell breaks loose.

Leslie — sorry, Dana — lets it all out in front of the stunned guests. One by one, people start realizing they’ve already met her under different aliases. Kat’s furious, Martin’s confused, Mona’s mortified. Vernon tries to do damage control, claiming it’s a “medical issue,” but Leslie is way past the point of being handled.

She declares Ted her “lover,” reducing Nicole to tears, and then hits the group with the real bombshell: she was the nice waitress at the coffee shop when Martin was a kid. Oh, and she had Ted’s baby. And Bill Hamilton (of course) was involved in the cover-up, allegedly threatening her life and offering hush money to make the whole thing disappear. (He also supposedly threatened to sell the baby on the black market. Sir?)

That baby? Eva.

Yeah. Leslie drops the mic by revealing that Eva is Ted’s daughter. Eva is horrified — not just by the news, but by the fact that Leslie lied about Ted rejecting her. The whole time, Eva believed Ted knew about her and didn’t want her, but it turns out… maybe he never even knew.

Eva begs Ted for forgiveness, but he’s done. He tells her he should’ve listened to Kat (who is basically vibrating with vindication), and Leslie turns on Eva with a cold, “You made the wrong choice, little girl.” Brutal.

Back at home, Ted tries to chase down Nicole, but she’s too hurt. She tells him to explain everything to Kat, and Kat demands to know the truth. Ted confesses he doesn’t know if Eva is his daughter — only that Leslie claimed to be pregnant, then disappeared. That’s all Nicole needs to hear before storming out.

Meanwhile, over at Garland Memorial, Vanessa is recovering from a sketchy bean sprout salad, with Doug loyally by her side. She might look like she’s one foot from the grave, but when she scrolls through her phone and sees the party carnage in real time, she bolts upright like someone hit her with jumper cables.

Doug tries to get her to slow down, warning her not to fly off the handle without knowing the full story. And then, with all the subtlety of a dagger to the ribs, he adds, “People stray. I don’t think I need to tell you that.” Vanessa glares but doesn’t flinch. Doug reminds her that she’s always talked like she had a more worldly, flexible view of relationships. Vanessa’s response is ice cold: “Some couples have understandings. That’s what keeps them together.” Doug knows exactly whose marriage she’s referencing — and Vanessa knows that he knows. But none of that matters right now. Vanessa is getting out of that hospital, and Ted Dupree just made her enemies list.

The rest of the family meets at Vernon and Anita’s for an emergency strategy session. Dani and Andre steal a sneaky kiss, but it goes unnoticed, and Andre confronts Eva on the way out. “Guess this makes us cousins?” he says — which is… not exactly the moment, Andre.

At Dupree Manor, Naomi refuses to believe Bill would threaten a woman, but Dani points out something very important: we don’t actually know for sure that Eva is even Ted’s kid. And how did Kat see through Eva from the jump?

While the family is reeling, guess who shows up at the front door like it’s just another Tuesday? Yep — Leslie. Classic cliffhanger. 

And that does it for this week, with Leslie’s truth bombs still echoing through the country club, relationships are shattered, secrets are out, and nobody’s walking away unscathed. Nicole’s heartbroken, Eva’s reeling, Kat’s vindicated (but still furious), and Ted’s whole world might’ve just imploded — and that’s before Vanessa even gets there. If this is how BTG ends a short week, we can’t even imagine how next week starts. Buckle up, because the fallout is just beginning.

1keq87g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondtheGatesonCBS/comments/1keq87g/btg_recap_week_of_april_28th_may_2nd_2025_catch/,BTG Recap Week of April 28th - May 2nd 2025 Catch Up Before Week 11,"It may have been a short week on BTG, but these three episodes brought the drama. Preemptions be damned, because we finally got the anniversary party, and let’s just say… Dana Leslie Whatever-Her-Name-Is-This-Hour made sure it was unforgettable.

We kicked off the week with everyone stressing out over Ashley and Derek moving in together. Ashley’s main concerns? His hideous decor (that named chair, Herbert, really needs to be set on fire), and the logistics of sharing a shower. Derek’s solution: just share it at the same time. Problem solved, and possibly rated PG-13. They’re cute. Basic, but cute.

Meanwhile, Ashley’s mom is also having a crisis over the couple’s tiny apartment and Derek’s “big ol’ fireman’s pole.” No, not a euphemism — unless it is? It’s hard to tell on this show anymore.

Over at Uptown, Vernon wants Anita to accept an offer for a comeback concert, but she’s hesitant. She’s worried her voice has aged, but Vernon hits her with, “Like fine wine,” and honestly? That Fine Wine Tour idea sounds legit. Too bad Anita’s still haunted by her messy breakup with the Articulettes. Apparently, things with Tracy and Sharon ended badly — and Anita still carries that guilt.

Elsewhere, Martin’s being haunted too — by his recurring nightmare about “that night.” He then wakes to a different sort of nightmare when Chelsea shows up to talk threesomes. Yep. She reveals she’s caught feelings for Allison — a married woman who was previously part of a hook-up — and might be gay? Bi? Chelsea’s not sure, but she’s definitely intrigued. And so is Allison, apparently, because their meetup at Uptown ends with Allison very down for a party of two.

And then… there’s Leslie.

When she corners Martin and Vernon at Orphey Gene’s with a bizarre Bigfoot rant, nobody can pretend she’s just “quirky” anymore. Later, she tells Eva that it was all a calculated performance — but Eva’s not on board. Leslie’s decided the entire Dupree clan deserves vengeance now, not just Ted and Nicole, and Eva’s growing increasingly uneasy with her mother’s mission.

Meanwhile, Ted tries to get frisky with Nicole before the anniversary party, but between Eva’s appetizer  crisis and Mona’s landscaping PowerPoint (don’t ask), he’s lucky to even make a toast. Still, he ends the night covered in whipped cream and strawberries, so we’ll call that a win.

Thursday brings us to party prep chaos. Eva tries (again) to talk Leslie down, but Leslie’s fully in villain monologue mode, comparing her scheme to a rollercoaster. (“You’re scared to death, sure you’re going to die” — ma’am, this is a black tie event not an amusement park.)

Dani and Andre are dancing around going public with their relationship, while Kat is on high alert for a mysterious wig-wearing woman skulking around the country club. She nearly catches Leslie hiding in a supply closet but just misses her — because Leslie has already slipped out and is watching Ted and Nicole like a deranged wedding crasher.

But here’s where it gets good. Ted and Nicole are being absolute sweethearts, giving each other sentimental jewelry, while Eva is living her best life — being offered jobs left and right and finally getting some recognition. So naturally, this is the moment Leslie decides to blow it all up.

Eva tries to stop her, telling Leslie that the Duprees have already accepted her. But Leslie is not moved. She locks Eva in the closet and marches her chaotic self straight into the dining room like she owns the place.

Friday’s episode is where all hell breaks loose.

Leslie — sorry, Dana — lets it all out in front of the stunned guests. One by one, people start realizing they’ve already met her under different aliases. Kat’s furious, Martin’s confused, Mona’s mortified. Vernon tries to do damage control, claiming it’s a “medical issue,” but Leslie is way past the point of being handled.

She declares Ted her “lover,” reducing Nicole to tears, and then hits the group with the real bombshell: she was the nice waitress at the coffee shop when Martin was a kid. Oh, and she had Ted’s baby. And Bill Hamilton (of course) was involved in the cover-up, allegedly threatening her life and offering hush money to make the whole thing disappear.

I'm tired of ""friendships"" that developed into an occasional superficial coffee meet-up every six months or so. I'm looking for the kind of connection where time moves too fast, or we lose track of it completely by sharing moments of adventure, laughter, spontaneity, and quiet magic, not just the usual uni/work complaints. Someone who still believes that friendships can feel like being 16 again—exploring, laughing, getting lost in conversation, etc

I’m sociable and quirky. I love to laugh around and be humorous about life (basically yapping hahah) but I also enjoy balancing it with meaningful conversations about a wide range of topics. I love to play volleyball (i go to many of the hochschulsport classes actually). I love to explore new cafés and brunch spots to do some work/study or even reading or just plain yapping hahah. I absolutely love cooking and baking, even better when done together so we can feast on whatever culinary masterpiece we manage to create haha. 

I am a native French and English speaker but also study every day to become fluent in German so it would be ideal if you are German or speak German fluently so that I can also practice. I moved here recently so my purpose is to fully integrate to Hamburg, not to stay in my international bubble.

If what I wrote resonates with you, send me a message :)

After a breakup I had crazy separation anxiety which led to uncontrollable weeping, then I had an existential nervous breakdown that brought on more of the same plus existential ocd and chronic health/death anxiety.

A month or so ago I accidentally had too much caffeine, then a few nights later I had a little too much magnesium which started drops in blood pressure, now I have acid reflux with vagus nerve irritation that feels like a heart attack all the time.

Two weeks ago I took just a third of a scoop of some preworkout that had a lot of ginseng in it and had a very bad day. Since then I've had a little caffeine maybe three times and each time I go into a low-grade panic attack in my body. I get the shakes, feel like my heart is skipping, panicked thoughts, etc. You guys know all the symptoms.

Not sure why it suddenly all went into my body but I'm cutting out caffeine completely now. Any tips? Is my body just traumatized by my stupid supplement experimentation? Is it possible for this to clear up and go back to coffee making me want to sleep?",1,1746381859.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I’m 28 and live in Northeastern Pennsylvania. I work in IT—steady job, stable life, and I’ve got my own place that I share with my orange tabby, Scooby. He’s basically the boss around here.

I’m more of a quiet, introverted type at first, but once I’m comfortable, I’m funny, warm, and loyal as hell. I’m a homebody by nature—I like slow mornings, background music, good coffee, and nights spent gaming or watching something with someone I click with. That said, with the right person, I’d genuinely love to push out of my comfort zone more and experience new things together.

I mostly play single-player games—Elden Ring, Zelda, Metroid Prime, Yakuza, stuff with great stories or a good challenge. I like real conversation, thoughtful people, and meaningful connection. Intelligence is massively attractive to me, but passion even moreso. When someone tells me about something they love, and you see that spark in their eyes, that twinkle? Yeah, that.

I’m 5’8”, got a bit of a gut, just being upfront. Not overall heavy, but yeah, it’s there. I’ve started to focus more on my health and want to tone up over time. I want to begin being more social, and while a post on Reddit is almost a laughable way to start, I figure why not? Can't imagine the worst that can happen being anything more than me typing this up, hitting post, nothing happens and life goes on, so why not?

Long-term, I’d love to meet someone to build something serious with, but I know that kind of connection doesn’t just appear out of nowhere. So I’m open to just talking, seeing where things go, and letting it grow naturally if it clicks.

I'm not big into politics. I generally lean to the right. Politics are not a deal breaker to me. Someone who shares the same general values of working hard for what you want in life and being fiercely loyal to those you love, and doing all you can to protect them, is important to me. Someone who takes steps to get where they want to be.

If you’re kind, emotionally grounded, and think we might vibe, feel free to say hey. Worst case? We have a good conversation and share a few laughs. Best case? Who knows.",1,1746381659.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1keq31m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1keq31m/xywav_experience_after_first_night/,Xywav Experience After First Night,"After a long, long nine month battle with my insurance company, I finally have this medication in my hands. I wanted to write about my first time experience to see if anyone with the same dosage had similar or different experiences. 

My regimens is 3g twice nightly. I was excited, but also VERY nervous beforehand, which probably didn’t help later on in the night. I work a 12 hour shift three times a week, so I ate lunch at work much earlier than I normally do at 2:30PM (normally eat at 4:30). Got home at 8:15PM, chilled out a bit with my fiance and puppy, and then setup the two doses for the night and got into bed. Took the first one and started feeling some anxiousness after a few minutes, and then I just felt high for another few minutes until lights out. 

I woke up to my fiance shaking me awake and my alarm going off so I could take my second dose. I set an alarm for like 2 and and half hours later. It was absolutely horrible and so weird lol. I can only compare it to being the drunkest a human body can handle. The room was spinning like crazy, extremely nauseous, felt the color leave my face. He had to help sit me up because I was so tingly it was hard to move my limbs. This didn’t last long though, I started feeling better after 10 minutes and was able to take about 75% of my second dose. I was afraid to take the full second dose because I didn’t want to choke in my sleep (which didn’t happen). I was out again very, very quickly. Maybe took a minute or two. 

Let me say though, this medication absolutely works (for me at least). With no alarm, I woke up almost exactly five hours later, and I felt absolutely revitalized. Instead of struggling for 90 minutes to get awake enough to drive to work, I was out of bed and fresh in five minutes. I almost cried. The only symptoms I have felt so far in the current day are a little less of an appetite without the nausea and a little brain fog, but after taking my usual Modafinil this fog blew away a bit. My fiancé said I was snoring a bit in the night, but I am negative for any sleep apnea from earlier sleep studies. We have a pulse oximeter on hand (pun intended) when he had pneumonia years ago, and he said I never went below 97%. He checked throughout the night for me, which I was very thankful for. 

I started feeling tired a few hours after waking up, even with some Modafinil and coffee, so I also had a 2 hour nap earlier. it seems like all the REM that was reset in the night was concentrated in that nap. Had a segment of an unnerving sleep paraylsis episode but mostly just very vivid dreams. 

I will have to work on spacing out my doses to be able to take the second dose on my own down the road, but so far the benefits are outweighing the symptoms I had.

These heat-resistant mats not only serve as countertop protectors but also double as appliance sliders, which feels like solving two annoying kitchen problems with a single solution. I'll admit, I wasn't convinced at first that something so seemingly simple could be this helpful, but after daily use for the past few weeks, I can confidently say these mats have earned their keep.

**Design and Versatility**  
The design stands out for its practicality. Each mat in the set comes in different sizes, 8""x8"", 10""x12"", and 12""x14"". This variety makes it perfect for different kitchen appliances like my air fryer, coffee maker, and even the occasional hot pan. The black color and sleek finish allow it to blend seamlessly with my modern kitchen décor. It’s easy to roll or fold the mats for storage, and cutting them to a custom size is not just advertised—it’s actually quite simple to achieve. I’ve trimmed one for a small bread machine, and it worked perfectly without compromising the edges.

**Ease of Use**  
I’ve been using these mats under heavier appliances like my Vitamix blender and stand mixer, and sliding them across the countertop no longer feels like a wrestling match. Even with my less-than-burly upper body strength, I can move these appliances smoothly in any direction. This sliding feature has also saved my countertop from potential scratches and scuff marks. Plus, they do their job without being annoyingly thick or bulky.

**Check the [Cooks Innovations V1903B](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cc7g729p/) price on Amazon now.**

**Upsides**  
A few aspects really stood out:  
- The mats are genuinely heat resistant and can double as hot pads for plates, pans, or pots straight out of the oven or off the stove.  
- Cleaning is incredibly simple. I’ve tossed them in the dishwasher once, but usually, a quick wipe with a damp cloth works perfectly.  
- Being lightweight doesn’t take away from their sturdiness. They hold up well even under my larger kitchen gadgets.  

**Negatives**  
There were a couple of things that I would consider less favorable:  
- The mats initially had a slightly rubbery smell. Thankfully, this aired out within a day or two.  
- The edges, while durable, aren’t slip-proof on particularly slick countertops, and there was occasional need for repositioning.  

**Strengths Against Peer Products**  
I previously tried silicone mats and kitchen appliance mats from other brands, but those didn’t handle high heat as well and tended to wear down after a few months. They also lacked the sliding function that this product nails so effectively. The closest competitor, a well-known silicone mat brand, offers decent heat resistance but isn’t as durable for frequent appliance sliding. Similarly, generic rubber mats failed the test when placed under heavier appliances like an air fryer—they just didn’t budge!

Where this particular option excels is its ability to combine multiple uses without sacrificing on any one feature. It trumps most alternatives including silicone mats and felt sliders, owing to its heat resistance, scratch prevention, and smooth gliding. Sure, there are more premium solutions out there, but unless you want a designer mat for some reason, you’re really paying for functionality here—where this product delivers.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When comparing products in a similar category, these mats strike a sweet spot between quality and affordability. They justify their cost by saving you potential money on countertop repairs and extending the amount of time you can use your appliances without hassle. You’re investing in convenience more than anything else. Although pricing fluctuates, this product’s durability ensures you won’t end up frequently replacing it, which makes the purchase worth every penny.

The way the sunlight hit my floor this morning.

It’s weird how many beautiful things you miss when you’re constantly chasing something next.

I love her.,"Look, we did a video call — she never wanted to turn on the camera, always said her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism. Our conversations were super one-sided. We planned to meet at the park, then she canceled because she said she hurt her leg.

She told me I was treating her differently because she had autism, and told me stories about her ex who abandoned her, how she got replaced by another guy, and about her cats and autistic nephews.

One day after I got mugged and almost lost her number, she barely reacted, saying she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She got super angry once when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex.

I invited her to the movies because she kept saying we’d never go out. First she said no because she was embarrassed, then after I insisted, she agreed — but the next day she hit me with, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Anyway, we went to the movies, kissed, spent the afternoon together.

She was super protective of her phone, wouldn’t share Instagram (only gave it after we broke up). Another time, at the mall, she gave me chocolate and we went to a motel. There, she suddenly got reactive, said we couldn’t turn on the lights, acted super shy, then her mood just flipped.

When I tried to meet her family, she clearly didn’t want me to. One time her sister dropped her at my house, and I made a joke that she didn’t want to go out because she was “being difficult” — she got furious. We played a game once, I criticized it, she got mad and quit.

She brought me chocolate again, but soon after started talking about breaking up. She invited me to a party, then said she wasn’t going, then changed her mind again. When I asked if she even wanted me there, she told me to come only at 6 PM. I showed up earlier, her sister saw me and called me up. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend — and then randomly said, “Let’s download an app to find you a hot girl!”

Later, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. After all this, I called her and broke up — she cried, blocked me, later texted saying I “sent her to the psych ward” (CAPS), that I took away her happiness. But then she messaged again, saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but then I found her on a dating app. She claimed she was looking for her friend’s ex, but when I confronted her, she told me to go find someone else. I told her I loved her, she said she wished I’d been with her at this place she visited. She invited me to her mom’s birthday — I didn’t go. Her mom called me, asking if I loved her. Then her mom invited me over for coffee.

We kept talking, but then she told me her dad was mad at me. I got upset, vented online — she saw it, and told me I “used” her, that she only did everything because she was insecure and autistic, that she prayed for me every day. Then she blocked me and disappeared.

Get nescafe \(the tin\), one spoonful of water, the instant coffee, shake, then add water, ice and whatever else you want.

Below is an essay that got an Emory admit and conditional Cornell acceptance. The author talks about how the noise in their life is essential and that they love to create and enjoy it.

What does this author do well?

1. Uses easy to understand language like noise to show lessons learned (“armed with knife-like precision”)
2. Uses the length of the paragraph to allude to the on-going noise.
3. Uses cooking sounds as the driving metaphor — look at the language used “boisterous arias” “ringing in the background” “hum of commons”

Read a strong paragraph from the essay below:

Yet, noise is a misnomer for the sound that accompanies my days. Dinner is a hum of my mother’s commands that include setting the table and cutting mountains of green string beans. As her appointed sous-chef, I marvel how her boisterous arias of chopping and sizzling turns into béarnaise sauce in less than 20 minutes. I will never admit that her cooking, of all things, has shown me how to multitask and organize myself: calmly and armed with knife-like precision. Sometimes, Jeopardy is ringing in the background while I try to set the record for fastest table setting at dinner. My grandmother and me team up to beat my Dad, seeing who can answer the most Jeopardy questions. The shouts of our victory only make the kitchen louder, as my Mom yells above all of us to wash our hands.

I’m a 50-year-old woman from the heartlandborn and raised in Iowa. Life has taught me to value the simple things: a good cup of coffee, a kind conversation, and someone who makes you laugh even on the hard days. I’m here hoping to find a genuine, kind-hearted man who’s also looking for a lifelong connection not just a fling, but a real partnership.

I’ve lived a full life so far raising children, building a career, and learning more about who I am along the way. I consider myself emotionally intelligent, loyal, and a great listener. I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect you to be either. What matters most to me is honesty, respect, and someone who wants to build a future together, one step at a time.

I enjoy gardening, cooking, reading, and taking quiet walks in the evening. I’m open to trying new things, whether that’s a new recipe or a road trip to somewhere we’ve never been. I believe the best relationships are built on mutual effort, shared values, and a willingness to grow together.

If you’re someone who’s emotionally mature, stable, and ready to invest in something meaningful, I’d love to hear from you. Age isn’t everything, but if you’re somewhere between 45 and 60 and value connection over convenience, we might just get along.

Multiple times a day I would order on the app and pick up. The Starbucks around me were notoriously bad at giving me the wrong drink, not adding sugar to my drink etc. but I still went all the time. One day I checked the app and I had 300 (I think that was the number )stars meaning any free food or beverage so I redeemed it and went about my day the next day I saw the star was still there.. so I ordered a sandwich…next day.. same thing. I didn’t feel bad because I had spent so much money there and often had to throw away wrong drinks or would check my order to find food I paid for missing.. I figured a few free items would balance it out. 

I started ordering a drink and waiting five minutes before ordering something else. I went mad with power. I ordered a sandwich at one store and would get a coffee for my friend at another down the road. I was so popular with my friends in this era. 

I was having  trouble finding work so besides my unhealthy sugar coffee addiction the food being free was helpful. My sister guilted me all the time telling me it was wrong but would still call and ask “hey I’m on my way to work can you order me a coffee?” As if she didn’t know how it would be paid for..

One day about 8 months in I started to feel a little guilty and I literally said out loud “hmmm maybe I should stop” and magically THAT day the stars disappeared and I had no more rewards.

1kepl6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kepl6b/best_friend_stole_the_love_of_my_life/,Best Friend Stole the Love of My Life,"TLDR; she fell first, I fell harder. My bsf knew I had feelings for months. When I ask her out and she defers for later but with hope, he swoops in, breaks up with his gf and I catch them all over each other. 

Ok so here's a timeline and for reference, I'm a guy in college. I've been in the same friend group with this girl for nearly a year, but we never started getting to know each other until October 2024, and when we did, we instantly connected on all levels. My best friend had always been closer to her than I have and she always seemed to trust him more or be comfortable around him more, but he never got the romantic connection I did cause he was in a relationship (UNTIL HE BROKE UP WITH HIS GF IN MARCH).

October 2024: She started flirting with me as a joke but I just played it off. However, we started getting to know each other and spending a lot of alone time together like grabbing coffee, studying, etc, and we got along so well. We could have conversations for days and never get bored of each other and she caught feelings first. We started going to the gym together everyday and she would always compliment me and call me attractive things. I feel so happy spending time with her.

November 2024: She asked me if I would say yes if she asked me out and I said idk (bad response) but only cause I wanted to know her for a longer period of time. But we continued spending time with each other. When we would go out in our friend group, she and I would take selfies with each other (I've even princess carried her lmao) and show me romantic songs that she loved. Around this point, I started catching feelings and I fell in love with her. I also told my best friend about my feelings and he said he would try to be a wing man for me and kinda set us up. I was getting back from Thanksgiving in LA a bit early so she invited me to spend the last day of Thanksgiving Break in her hometown of NYC so I bought train tickets from the university and I went. It was an amazing day in the city, and I also met her brother and parents for dinner in the evening and they liked me too (I think her brother caught on that I liked her lol). I brought her some West Coast themed gifts (my personal favorite was a glass jar I had filled with sand and seashells from my favorite beach and she still has it on her desk, and I labeled it with the beach name and date). Even other people in our friend group catch onto my feelings and encourage her and I to get together.

December 2024: At this point, I knew she was the love of my life and not just a crush as we got even closer and FaceTimed almost every day when we were away on break. Thus, I planned to ask her out after break in January. 

January 2025 (PLOT THICKENS): I ask her out, but she takes a couple days to respond and tells me that she likes the dynamic of our friend group as is and wants to hold off on a relationship until after Summer, but she likes me and would be interested later. I respect her choice with hope for the future, and we continue to get along well as usual in our friend group. However, my best friend tells me that he wanted to tell me not to ask her out for the exact reasons that she mentioned and that he had talked to her last night about everything cause I asked her out in sort of an obvious way in front of our friend group. I thought this was strange but whatever; he was already in a relationship so I doubt he would try to get with her. They had always been closer than me so. 

February 2025-March 2025 (HELL BREAKS LOSE): Everything is going well, we get along as usual, but those two are spending a lot more alone time with each other like grabbing food, going to the gym, studying, etc. It's like they're practically with each other 24/7. I also see her a little less often but we do get along well whenever we do. I tell him that I could see him getting together with her if he breaks up with his girlfriend but he tells me he'd never do that to me. But in the beginning of March, my best friend breaks up with his girlfriend and all of us are there to console him and make sure his mental health is okay, myself included. Part A of my prediction of him getting with her was right. At the end of March during final exam week as we are studying one night, I walk in on her all over him on a couch and it looks as though they had just made out or something. She immediately leaves when she sees me and I ask my best friend what the hell I just watched. Part B of my prediction was right. He talks to me, and tells me that she and him recognized that they have feelings for each other and that in the moment, those feelings were getting ""heated"" and that they decided to re-evaluate being in a relationship in a few months. I started connecting the dots with how he told me in January to not ask her out and how those two have been closer for much longer than me. My heart was broken but it hurt even worse considering this was my best friend. And, I was sure they would get together since they've been spending time with each other 24/7 for the last couple months. I don't say anything much to him in response cause I can't call dibs on a person and I have to respect her feelings, but I tell him that there's nothing I can do.

April 2025 (MY ANAKIN SKYWALKER-ISH ARC): I spend less and less time with the group as usual but they notice and invite me whenever we go out but I decline a lot more often. But during the times that I do, even seeing my best friend and her together (even wearing matching outfits and taking pictures together) visibly makes me look sick and I feel even more heartbroken. That used to be us. I try to come to outings with them every once in a while but just seeing them makes me depressed and makes me go insane. But whenever I do spend one on one time with her like in conversation, I immediately feel delighted, my depression halts, and I don't care about anything in the world but her. I'm addicted. So last week, I decide that I just can't spend time with them like this and I tell my best friend and my crush separately that while I value my relationships with them and I always will, that seeing them together like this hurts and that I need space, and I make my best friend eat his words as he said he'd never do that to me and he just did. They both act empathetic as usual and apologize, and reach out if there's anything they can do. My best friend (not sure if he's trying to get on my good side) has nothing to say other than sorry and acts surprised that I am treating him this nice after all this cause according to him, he doesn't ""deserve it."" I apologize on my part of not telling them sooner that I've been wanting space this entire month and fade away.

Now, I have no clue what to do. They're still in my friend group and I've stopped texting or talking to them, even avoiding them in public, but I hate being alone. I'm depressed, without motivation and can't imagine living a life without her and without being her girlfriend and husband and I feel sick that it's likely going to be my best friend living the life I wanted to have with her even after I've been telling him for months how in love I have been with this girl. And we are going to be in school together for a long time as all three of us are in a combined degree program. I'm not even angry at her cause I love her so much, but I do feel betrayed by my best friend.",1,1746380404.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The institutions are coming for Bitcoin, and you know who’s at the front of the line? Michael Saylor, the man, the myth, the MicroStrategy co-founder. He’s been hoovering up Bitcoin like my vacuum on a Monday morning.

He’s dropped a cool $1.4 billion on 15,355 BTC - not bad. With this latest buy, MicroStrategy now holds 553,555 BTC worth around $15 billion in unrealized gains. Talk about a crypto goldmine!

## Does Saylor’s Buying Strategy Amount to Manipulation?

Now, do we think he’s trying to manipulate the market? I mean… the man’s got the funds! Institutions have the resources to move the needle, and it's definitely raised eyebrows. The last thing we want is a bunch of corporate overlords playing Monopoly with our beloved Bitcoin.

## Synthetic Halving: The New Buzzword

And then there’s this term: synthetic halving. It's like Bitcoin's annual holiday event, but instead of gift cards, it’s a 2,087 BTC shopping spree every day, which is way more than the daily 450 BTC mined. Could lead to some serious price pumpage, but also chaos and instability. So… great?

## Risks of Corporate Treasury Bitcoin Strategy

But wait, there’s more! Companies adopting Bitcoin like it’s some trendy new coffee blend need to think twice. The volatility, the regulations, and the need for a crypto-savvy IT guy—it's a lot to manage.

Buckle up, folks! The crypto market trends are changing faster than I can say “HODL.” Let’s see where this ride takes us.

I was gifted a brand new Gaggia Classic Evo Pro for Christmas by my lovely partner. I wanted a machine that wouldn't cost the earth, make decent espresso out of the box (with a few workarounds), but provide a platform to 'grow into' and be able to modify as needed as I got more experienced.

It's been great. I've made some great tasting coffee, and really gotten into both the enjoyment and hobby of espresso.

Recently though, my machine has developed a bit of an issue. It started a few weeks ago with a dripping from the steam wand. Quick research put me at ease - it's apparently very common - to the point where there are 'drip catcher' mods. So I figured that was just part of the package.

But it's gotten worse in the past few days. As the water gets up to temperature, the dripping is pretty rapid. And now, after steaming milk, after turning the knob to the off position, steam continues to 'leak' as though it's not fully closed off. Also, when the water is at steam temp, the group head drips.

I've heard that solenoid blockage might be the issue. But I descale regularly (every few weeks), and have only had the machine for a few months. I wasn't intending on having to take the thing apart this early to fix issues, and am a little dubious of doing so and voiding warranties etc unless absolutely necessary.

Before going down warranty and servicing routes, is there anything (fairly) simple that I could try to fix the issue that I might have missed? Thank you for any help!

1kepjt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kepjt3/i_fell_for_the_wrong_boy/,I fell for the wrong boy.,"Dust and Brew, the cute coffee shop in the middle of town, was an introvert's dream.

It was cozy.

Tables spread out like flowers, seats for petals, fairy lights hanging low.

The menu was a creative variety of plant-themed drinks.

The baristas wore green aprons over short-sleeved tees.

One of the guys, a brunette sitting on the counter with his legs swinging, didn't even look at me. The other sat on a stool, idly reading a book.

A pretty blonde, *Blue*, served me “Bloomshot Brew” with a hollow smile that didn’t reach her eyes. 

I kept going back.

The brunette served me my second visit. He held my gaze the entire time, completely silent, dumping too much milk in my Flower Mocha. 

His lips were curved slightly, like he was smirking. 

Still, I downed the whole thing, licking the froth from my lips. 

His smile noticeably faded, expression darkening.

The reader guy was cute. Sandy blonde hair falling in his eyes, and freckles. 

His nametag said, “Jules.”

He regarded me with a raised brow when I ordered another mystical-sounding drink.

“What's your book about?” I asked, flirting.

“Fairies,” Jules murmured, meeting my gaze. 

“One loses their species in a fae war. They're the last of their kind, so they set out to rebuild.” He shot me a smile, flipping a page. “I'm only halfway through, but so far they're *killing* it.” 

He pushed a second coffee brew in front of me with a wink. “That's on the house.”

I was about to take it before the scowling brunette snatched it and dumped it down the sink. “We’re not a charity,” he croaked, pointing to the door. “I think you should leave.”

Jules rolled his eyes. “Ignore Ronan,” he smiled. “Night.”

Asshole.

On my way home, I sneezed. Once. 

Twice. 

Three times. 

I glimpsed it speckled on my palms, glistening yellow dust sparkling across my skin. 

I sneezed again, and blood splattered, streaked with yellow. Fuck. I started forward, but my legs buckled, sending me to the ground. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, agony contorting through me, until I ran my fingers down my back, slick red warmth coating my hands. 

I slipped my fingers through the raw flaps of flesh, finding something breaking through, delicate, like glass, twisting me apart.

Wings.

Footsteps were suddenly so loud. I clamped my hands over my ears.

“Don't worry, it's just your body changing.” I sensed Jules getting closer, kneeling next to me. 

“This isn't even the painful part. Soon, you'll shrink to the size of a thumbnail, and your internal organs will go, ‘Pop!’ But don’t worry. Magic is coursing through your blood. By nightfall, your memories will fade. Just like Blue. Oh, sweet Blue. She's still a little foggy headed.” 

I felt him run his fingers through my hair, pressing his face into my scalp, razor sharp teeth pricking me. “I think that fairy is doing a *great* job of rebuilding his species,” he murmured, chuckling.

Caution tape fluttered at the entrance, sagging between rusted nails and bubbled mud. Someone had hammered a “DO NOT ENTER” sign above the door in yellow spray paint. I stepped under it without hesitation.

Behind me, Rivas and Ewing exchanged a glance, but neither stopped me. 

We entered single file.

Inside, numbered evidence markers littered the concrete floor like confetti from a party no one wanted to remember. 8. 14. 27. All the way into the main chamber.

But the couch was gone.

The television? Gone.


I spun slowly in place, nausea creeping up my throat.

“This isn’t right,” I said. “This isn’t what it looked like.”

I started walking faster. Rivas called after me, but I didn’t stop. I turned left—then right—then down the hall I remembered, where the fake apartment had been. The door I’d opened. The kitchen. The bedroom where I slept. The bedroom where the children slept. 

Nothing.

There wasn’t even a door anymore—just exposed beams and collapsed drywall.

“No, no, no—this is wrong!” I grabbed the closest evidence marker and flung it. It clattered against the wall and bounced into a puddle. “You changed it. You changed everything.

“Melanie,” Rivas tried, “we didn’t touch anything. This is exactly how it looked when our team came through. We have pictures—”

“You’re lying!” I shouted. “I was here. There was a couch. You guys found me in that pink bedroom. Where is it?!”

I took off down another hallway. My boots hit the floor in harsh, wet slaps. I found the room. I knew the room. I could draw it from memory—the headshots pinned to the walls, the strange trophies, the printed article about me.

The room was empty.

Not just cleared out. Empty.

Dust. Rubble. Water damage.

Nothing.

No photos. No camera. 

The weight of it all crashed in like a wave. I gripped the doorframe and leaned forward, trembling. “They erased it,” I whispered. “They scrubbed it clean. They want me to think I imagined it.”

Rivas stepped up behind me but kept his distance. “Why would we do that?”

“I don’t know,” I snapped.

Ewing finally spoke, calm and too smooth. “That’s not what’s happening, Melanie. You’re exhausted. You’ve been through trauma. We believe you saw something—”

“You don’t believe anything,” I said. My voice cracked. “You’re making me doubt myself. And I won’t let you.”

I turned back through the hallway. The place felt smaller now. Wrong. Like I’d stepped into a parallel version of my own memories, warped and gutted.

“I’m leaving,” I said.

“Where do you want to go?”

I didn’t hesitate. “The airport.”

Neither of them argued.

As I walked ahead of them, the evidence markers blurred in my peripheral vision like the last fragments of a dream.

“I need to make a call,” Ewing said. “Go ahead, get in the car. We’ll be out in a second.”

I didn’t look at him. Just walked.


I closed the cruiser door behind me and sank into the passenger seat, my body tense, my hands still shaking.

From the corner of my eye, through the cracked side mirror, I saw movement near the bunker entrance.

Rivas and Ewing stood just outside, facing each other. At first it looked like nothing—just a conversation. But then I saw the way Rivas’s shoulders squared, the way Ewing stepped in too close.

It was an argument.

There were no raised voices from this distance, but I didn’t need to hear them to feel the tension. Rivas jabbed a finger toward the woods, then toward the car—toward me. Ewing shook his head once, slow and deliberate, like someone trying to keep control. Rivas said something else, sharper this time. His mouth moved fast.

Ewing didn’t respond right away. Then he took a step forward.

Rivas backed off.


Whatever they were fighting about, it wasn’t nothing. I don’t think it was about the case itself either. It was about me.

I looked away quickly, heart hammering, trying not to overthink it—but the silence inside the car only made it worse. Made it louder.


A few minutes later, Ewing opened the driver’s door and slid into his seat. Rivas followed and got in the passenger side.

“I spoke with my Sergeant,” he said. “Told him about your request. You’re clear to leave the state.”

I blinked at him. “Okay.”

“I was thinking…” He glanced over, voice light, almost casual. “I could fly down with you. Just for a day or two. I’d like to speak with local detectives there, see if there’s any overlap—similar cases, sightings, patterns. Might help connect dots, if this guy’s got history.”

It took me a second to process it.

“You’d… come with me?”

“Only if you want me to.” He shrugged. “Honestly, I figured it might be good for you. Someone in your corner. Might help ground everything, considering what just happened back there.”

I let out a shaky breath. He might be the only one in the state that believes me. 

He smiled faintly. “Besides,” he said, putting the car in gear, “I’ve always wanted to see Kentucky. Maybe we’ll even hit Gizmos while we’re there.”

My stomach flipped.

I turned my head slowly. “What?”

He didn’t seem to notice the shift in my tone. “That’s your favorite coffee place, right?”

The inside of the cruiser suddenly felt too small. My heartbeat was in my ears.

“How do you know that?” I asked.

He paused.

Just for a second.

Then smiled again, this time softer. “You told me. Back at the hospital, remember? You said you missed real coffee—mentioned the name.”

I forced a laugh, but it sounded brittle. “Oh yeah, that is my favorite place. Well, was. One of the pictures I found was of me walking out of there before I moved here.” I swallowed hard, trying to steady my voice. “Maybe it’s time I just go to Dunkin’ Donuts or something.”

Ewing’s fingers tightened briefly on the steering wheel. “Don’t let it get to you, Melanie. Whatever you saw, whatever’s happened—it’s all been overwhelming. You’ve been through a lot. It’s only natural for things to get muddled.”

I blinked a few times, forcing myself to look away from the window, focusing on the road ahead instead. “Yeah… sure.”

After a few minutes of silence, Ewing glanced at me, his expression softening just a little. “ After we drop Rivas back off at the station, I’m going to swing by my place and grab a few things,” he said. “Then we’ll go pick up your stuff from the hotel, and we can head out.”

I nodded.

We dropped Rivas off at the station.

He nodded once to Ewing, didn’t look at me, and closed the door behind him without a word.

It wasn’t until we were halfway down the road—trees blurring past, the sky beginning to dim—that I realized something.

He hadn’t said a single word to either of us the entire ride back.

Not one.

And that silence felt louder now that I noticed it.

We pulled up a narrow gravel road, the tires crunching over wet muddy stone. About halfway up the mountain, tucked between clusters of spruce and skeletal birch, Ewing’s home sat about 100 yards back from the road. It was one of those sleek, modern tiny homes—black steel siding, big windows, a little chimney coughing smoke into the pale sky.

I had considered getting one of those myself once, back when I was still dreaming about a future here. When I was picking out my own place, I’d chosen a trailer instead. It was cheaper. Easier. Turns out it didn’t matter anyway.

As soon as the car came to a stop, I felt it. The shift in my stomach. The awareness of how close we were to everything I was trying to escape. My home. His.

“Just a second,” Ewing said as he climbed out. “Won’t be long.”

He jogged up the short footpath, boots sloshing in the mud. The wind moved through the trees like it was whispering something.

I stayed in the car, every second growing more panicked than the last.. I couldn’t stop staring at the woods and imagining him watching within it. I dialed Ewing’s 
number with numb fingers.


Melanie?” he answered, sounding confused.

“Can you please hurry?” I whispered. “This is… it’s too close.”

A pause. “Shit. Yeah. I didn’t think—I’m sorry. I’ll be right out.”

But minutes passed. And when the door opened again, I saw him—Ewing—step out, smiling. He turned back toward someone inside.

A woman followed.

I couldn’t see her features much but she was tall and had long dark hair. She leaned in close and he kissed her softly.

And that’s when I saw it.

Around her neck, draped loosely like it had been thrown on in a hurry, was a red scarf.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a fork, knife, and spoon set involves careful consideration of several factors. Quality, durability, design, and ergonomics all play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a set for everyday use or special occasions.

**Material Quality:** The material used in crafting a flatware set significantly impacts its longevity and aesthetic appeal. Stainless steel is the most common choice, with 18/10 stainless steel, containing 18% chromium and 10% nickel, offering excellent corrosion resistance and a brilliant shine. Other materials, like sterling silver or gold-plated options, are available for a more luxurious touch, though they require more maintenance.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Flatware designs range from classic and timeless to modern and minimalist. The handle shape, weight distribution, and overall visual appeal contribute to the dining experience. Some sets feature intricate detailing, while others prioritize clean lines and a simple silhouette. The chosen design should complement your existing dinnerware and personal style.

**Durability and Construction:** A well-constructed flatware set should withstand the rigors of daily use without bending, warping, or tarnishing easily. The thickness of the metal and the quality of the welds or joints are indicators of durability. Sets with a heavier gauge tend to be more robust and resistant to damage.

**Ergonomics and Comfort:** The feel of the flatware in your hand is a crucial factor. The handle should be comfortable to grip, and the weight should be balanced for ease of use. Consider the length and width of the handles, as well as the shape of the spoon bowl and fork tines, to ensure a comfortable and efficient dining experience.

**Finishing and Polishing:** The quality of the finishing and polishing contributes to the overall appearance and feel of the flatware. A smooth, even finish enhances the tactile experience and prevents food from sticking to the surface. Look for sets with a high-quality polish that resists fingerprints and water spots.

**Set Composition and Versatility:** The composition of the flatware set should match your dining needs. Standard sets typically include dinner forks, salad forks, dinner knives, dinner spoons, and teaspoons. However, specialized sets may also include serving utensils, steak knives, or other specialty items. Consider the versatility of the set for both casual meals and formal occasions.

 ## Core Benefits

A high-quality fork, knife, and spoon set offers more than just functionality; it enhances the dining experience and provides long-term value.

**Enhanced Dining Experience:** Using well-designed and comfortable flatware elevates the overall dining experience. The feel of the utensils in your hand, the way they cut through food, and their visual appeal contribute to a more enjoyable and satisfying meal. A beautiful flatware set can transform an ordinary meal into a special occasion.

**Improved Food Presentation:** The right flatware can complement your dinnerware and enhance the presentation of your food. Whether you're hosting a formal dinner party or enjoying a casual meal with family, elegant flatware adds a touch of sophistication to the table setting. A well-chosen set can elevate the aesthetic appeal of your culinary creations.

**Durability and Longevity:** Investing in a high-quality flatware set ensures years of reliable use. Durable materials and sturdy construction prevent bending, warping, and tarnishing, making the set a worthwhile investment. A well-cared-for set can last for decades, providing lasting value and enjoyment.

**Hygienic and Safe:** High-quality stainless steel is non-reactive and resistant to corrosion, making it a hygienic and safe choice for flatware. The smooth, non-porous surface prevents bacteria from harboring, ensuring food safety. Stainless steel is also easy to clean and sanitize, further promoting hygiene.

**Versatility for All Occasions:** A versatile flatware set can be used for both casual meals and formal gatherings. The design should be appropriate for a variety of table settings and culinary styles. A well-chosen set can adapt to different occasions, providing a cohesive and elegant look.

 ## FAQs Section

Understanding the common questions consumers have about fork, knife, and spoon sets can help alleviate concerns and guide purchase decisions.

**What is the best type of stainless steel for flatware?**
    18/10 stainless steel is generally considered the best option for flatware due to its high chromium and nickel content. This composition provides excellent corrosion resistance, a brilliant shine, and a durable surface that resists scratches and stains.

**How do I properly care for and clean my stainless steel flatware?**
    To maintain the appearance of your stainless steel flatware, hand washing is recommended, especially for sets with decorative finishes. If using a dishwasher, avoid harsh detergents and ensure the flatware is completely dry before storing.

1kepgeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kepgeo/explore_why_the_bodum_bistro_1145101us_electric/,Explore why the Bodum Bistro 11451-01US electric kettle review reveals its top features!,"The Bodum 11451-01US Bistro kettle truly aligns with my minimalist kitchen aesthetic. This 17-ounce electric marvel is the ideal companion for anyone looking for a compact, efficient, and BPA-free option to fulfill their tea or coffee boiling needs. I tested it thoroughly for a week, mostly using it to prepare my morning tea and, on a couple of rushed evenings, for instant soups. My experience with this kettle has been pleasant, but there are important aspects to keep in mind.

**Clean and Compact Design**  
The first thing I noticed was its sleek and glossy black finish, which effortlessly complements my kitchen counter. Its compact size makes it perfect for small kitchens or even for taking it on the go, such as to a dorm room or RV. Although it only holds 17 ounces, this capacity is sufficient for about four cups of boiling water. On most mornings, I managed to prepare tea for myself and my partner without needing a second round.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design fits small spaces easily.  
- Quick boiling at just about four minutes for the maximum capacity.  
- BPA-free materials provide peace of mind.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
This kettle thrives on simplicity. The on/off switch cleverly integrates into the handle, ensuring a snug grip without any fumbling. I truly appreciate the unexposed heating element, which is safely concealed under the base. This means I didn’t have to worry about where to place a hot kettle. The water level indicator is also a lifesaver for portioning—great for someone like me, who constantly overestimates amounts. Its automatic shut-off and anti-boil dry system ensure safety, which is a feature my clumsy self couldn’t value more.

**Power and Performance**  
With a 700-watt capacity, it heats water rapidly and efficiently. Whether I used it for tea, coffee, or instant noodles, the results were consistent, boiling water in just minutes. The lack of noise during operation is another fantastic aspect. Compared to my old kettle, this felt almost silent, only announcing its completion with a subtle alert.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- No temperature control for different beverages.  
- Non-removable lid makes cleaning harder.  

The absence of temperature control might not bother an average user; however, tea aficionados might miss the ability to fine-tune settings based on tea type.

**Safety Features**  
With its automatic shut-off feature activated post-boiling, the kettle feels like a safe addition to any home. A bonus for families with kids or pets is the BPA-free plastic construction, which provides reassurance for healthier boiling. Testing anti-boil-dry tech gave me confidence it wouldn't accidentally heat in an empty state due to forgetfulness.

**Market Rivals**  
The Bodum Bistro faces stiff competition from heavyweights like the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle and the Cuisinart DK-17. Compared to Hamilton Beach, this kettle wins on size and portability, but it lacks temperature presets—a strong point of its rival. The Cuisinart DK-17 offers a more premium feel with its stainless steel body, though it’s far bulkier. In my view, the Bistro’s compact design and utilitarian focus make it a prime choice for portable use or smaller households. Still, its inability to facilitate thorough interior cleaning might disappoint someone accustomed to Cuisinart’s sleek, all-metal models.

**Quality for Price**  
For its price and feature combination, this kettle is quite appealing. Its performance fits the bill perfectly for single-person households or couples. If you're someone who values simplicity and efficiency over frills, it makes an excellent choice. While it lacks a few competitor bells and whistles, its unique compactness and lightweight frame are not to be underestimated.

1kepf4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1kepf4i/the_seat_of_ambition/,The seat of ambition,"This is a story inspired by my trip to New York. I saw segmented seats in public transit area and some homeless people at 2. Instead of sleeping on chairs, the homeless slept on the ground. Hence the creation of the story.


The subway station smelled of stale urine and damp concrete, a familiar stench that clung to Jonas’s threadbare coat as he slumped onto the segmented seat. The cold metal dug into his hips, the armrests jabbing his ribs, making sleep impossible. Hours ago, he’d been laid off—his desk at City Hall cleared out with a single email. Now, jobless, penniless, and stranded after missing the last train, he was trapped in this miserable limbo.


Jonas shifted, trying to curl his lanky frame across the chair’s unforgiving segments, but the armrests—his armrests—bit into his side. He’d been to a bar earlier, drowning his frustration in cheap whiskey after the HR meeting. The alcohol dulled the sting of his firing but sharpened his anger at the world, at himself. Missing the train was just the final kick in the teeth. Now, staring at the flickering fluorescent lights above, he couldn’t escape the irony.

His mind drifted, bitter and hazy, to how he’d ended up here. 10years ago, Jonas had been a young designer in New York, mediocre but ambitious, sketching blueprints with dreams of leaving a mark. He’d bounced between architecture firms and design studios, each rejection chipping away at his confidence. His work was competent but uninspired—his ambition far outstripped his talent.

Eventually, he landed a safe job in the city’s public works department, pushing papers for infrastructure projects. It was steady, but it didn’t free him from his mediocrity. He remained a cog, his grand visions buried under bureaucracy.
Then came the mayor’s call for solutions to the “homeless problem.” Vagrants were sleeping on subway benches, cluttering the city’s image, and the mayor, eyeing re-election, needed a fix. 

Jonas, desperate for a break, had a spark of inspiration late one night over instant coffee and a stale donut. Why not redesign the benches? Replace the long, flat seats with segmented chairs, each divided by armrests to make lying down impossible. It was simple, effective, and ruthless—a design to deter without saying it outright.

He’d poured his heart into the proposal, sketching detailed designs and writing a pitch that buzzed with purpose. Bypassing his boss, Jonas seized a rare chance to present directly to the mayor. The mayor, a pragmatic man with a sharp smile, loved it. “Genius,” he’d called it, clapping Jonas on the shoulder. In a swift move, the mayor fired Jonas’s supervisor and handed him the role. Jonas, now a rising star, pushed his “defensive design” across the city’s transit system.

Segmented chairs sprouted in subway stations, bus stops, and parks. The homeless were displaced, the city looked cleaner, and the public approved. The mayor sailed to re-election, and Jonas was his golden boy.
For a while, Jonas felt alive. His design wasn’t beautiful, but it worked. He’d finally made a mark. But pride has a shelf life, and his began to sour. The accolades faded, and the city moved on to new problems.

Then came the AI. Last year, the municipal department adopted an advanced design algorithm to optimize public spaces. The AI, with its cold efficiency, proposed a radical shift: replace the segmented chairs with flat, continuous benches. It called the change “compassionate, human-centered design,” arguing that inclusive spaces better served the city’s soul—and its voters. The public ate it up. Activists praised the move, X posts celebrated the “end of hostile architecture,” and the mayor, ever the opportunist, championed the AI’s plan. Jonas’s signature design was deemed cruel, obsolete. Worse, the AI was poised to take over his entire job.

This morning, the mayor had called him in. “You did good work, Jonas,” he’d said, not meeting his eyes. “But the city needs fresh ideas.” By noon, Jonas was out, his career reduced to a cardboard box of office supplies. The AI’s benches were already being installed, and the mayor’s approval ratings were climbing. Another re-election loomed.

Now, Jonas sat on his own creation, the segmented chair that had once been his triumph. He tried to sleep, but the armrests pressed into his spine, a cruel reminder of his fall. The station was quiet, save for the hum of a distant train. He thought of the new benches—flat, welcoming, designed to let people like him rest. The city would move forward, kinder on paper, while he was left behind, a footnote in its story. Jonas closed his eyes, not sleeping, but sinking into the weight of his own design, wondering if ambition had ever been worth the cost.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The frozen cup market is diverse, with varying features and designs. Understanding these features is crucial in selecting the right cup for your needs.

**Material and Construction:** The quality of materials used in constructing a frozen cup directly affects its durability and ability to maintain temperature. Most frozen cups are made from BPA-free plastic, ensuring they are safe for contact with food and beverages. The double-walled construction is crucial for insulation and keeping drinks cold for extended periods. Some premium cups utilize stainless steel for the inner layer, providing even better insulation and durability.

The double-wall design prevents condensation from forming on the outside of the cup, keeping your hands dry and comfortable. Look for cups with secure seals to prevent leakage of the freezing gel or liquid inside. The thickness of the plastic or stainless steel also contributes to the cup鈥檚 ability to withstand regular use and accidental drops. Some cups feature a textured exterior for a better grip, while others have a smooth finish for a sleek look.

**Freezing Gel/Liquid Composition:** The freezing medium inside the cup is responsible for keeping your beverages cold. Most frozen cups use a non-toxic gel or liquid that freezes quickly and retains coldness for an extended period. The specific composition of this freezing medium can vary, with some formulas designed to freeze faster or stay colder for longer than others.

It is important to ensure that the freezing medium is non-toxic and food-grade, as a leak could potentially contaminate your drink. Some cups use a saline solution, which is generally considered safe and effective. The volume of the freezing medium also affects how long the cup can keep your drinks cold. A larger volume generally means a longer cooling period.

**Capacity and Size:** Frozen cups come in various sizes and capacities to suit different beverage types and serving sizes. Common capacities range from 12 ounces to 20 ounces. Choosing the right size depends on your typical beverage consumption and the type of drinks you prefer.

Smaller cups are ideal for individual servings of juice, soda, or cocktails, while larger cups are better suited for iced tea, coffee, or smoothies. Consider the cup's dimensions as well, particularly if you need it to fit in a car cup holder or other specific spaces. The overall size and shape of the cup can also affect how comfortable it is to hold.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the design and aesthetics of a frozen cup contribute to its overall appeal. Frozen cups come in a wide range of colors, patterns, and styles to match personal preferences. Some cups feature transparent or translucent designs, allowing you to see the frozen gel or liquid inside.

Others have solid colors or decorative patterns. Ergonomic designs with comfortable grips are also important for ease of use. Some cups come with lids and straws, adding to their convenience and portability. The overall aesthetic appeal of the cup can enhance your drinking experience and make it a more enjoyable addition to your daily routine.

 ## Core Benefits

Frozen cups offer numerous practical benefits that enhance your beverage enjoyment.

**Extended Cooling Duration:** The primary benefit of a frozen cup is its ability to keep drinks cold for significantly longer periods compared to traditional cups or glasses. This eliminates the need for ice, preventing dilution and preserving the original flavor of your beverage. This is particularly beneficial for outdoor activities, picnics, or any situation where you want to enjoy a cold drink without constant ice refills.

Imagine enjoying a refreshing iced coffee on a hot summer day, without worrying about it becoming lukewarm within minutes. Frozen cups provide consistent cooling for an hour or more, depending on the ambient temperature and the cup's design. This ensures that your drink remains enjoyable from the first sip to the last.

**No Dilution of Drinks:** Unlike ice, frozen cups do not dilute your beverages as they chill them. This preserves the original flavor and concentration of your drink, ensuring a consistently enjoyable taste. This is particularly important for beverages like cocktails, juices, and iced tea, where dilution can significantly alter the flavor profile.

With a frozen cup, you can savor the full flavor of your favorite cocktail without it becoming watery as the ice melts. This is a significant advantage for those who appreciate the nuanced flavors of their beverages and want to avoid the compromise that comes with using ice.

**Convenience and Portability:** Frozen cups are easy to use and highly portable. Simply place the cup in the freezer for a few hours, and it is ready to keep your drinks cold. This eliminates the need to constantly refill ice trays or carry around bulky ice chests. Their compact design and portability make them ideal for travel, picnics, and other outdoor activities.

You can easily pack a frozen cup in your bag and take it to the beach, the park, or the office, ensuring you always have a cold drink readily available. Some frozen cups come with lids and straws, further enhancing their portability and preventing spills. Their ease of use and convenience make them a practical and versatile addition to your everyday life.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about frozen cups.

**How long do frozen cups typically stay cold?**
The duration for which a frozen cup stays cold varies depending on factors such as the ambient temperature, the starting temperature of the beverage, and the cup's design and construction. Generally, a well-insulated frozen cup can keep a drink cold for 1 to 3 hours.

**Are frozen cups dishwasher safe?**
It depends on the specific cup. Many frozen cups are hand-wash only to prevent damage to the freezing gel or the cup's seals. Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines. Some models may be top-rack dishwasher safe, but it's always best to err on the side of caution.

**Can I use a frozen cup for hot beverages?**
While frozen cups are designed primarily for cold beverages, some models may be able to withstand moderate heat. However, exposing them to extremely hot liquids can damage the freezing gel or the cup's construction. Check the manufacturer's specifications to determine if the cup is suitable for hot beverages. Using a frozen cup for hot drinks is generally not recommended unless the manufacturer explicitly states it is safe.

**What should I do if the freezing gel leaks from the cup?**
If the freezing gel leaks from the cup, discontinue use immediately. Ensure that the gel is non-toxic, but avoid ingesting it. Clean the cup thoroughly and dispose of it properly. Contact the manufacturer for possible replacement or warranty information. It's essential to prioritize safety and avoid using a damaged frozen cup.

1kepbqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1kepbqt/investigate_how_luminette_3_light_therapy_glasses/,Investigate how Luminette 3 light therapy glasses stack up in reviews!,"Testing out the Luminette 3 Light Therapy Glasses for the past few weeks has been a fascinating experience for me as someone who struggles with erratic sleep patterns and a touch of the winter blues. The promise of wearable light therapy intrigued me, especially the potential to address sleep problems, seasonal mood shifts, and low energy. This portable therapy gadget seemed like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but I was eager to give it a fair shot and see if it lived up to its claims.

**Lightweight and Innovative Design**
As I unpacked the glasses, I was immediately impressed by the sleek and lightweight design. Measuring just 0.39 inches thick and weighing 0.42 ounces, the device sits comfortably on my face. I especially liked how it came with multiple nose pads, which meant I could swap them out for the perfect fit. Considering I wear glasses already, I was a little skeptical about layering these on top. However, the wearable therapy tool integrates seamlessly with both contact lenses and regular glasses. Less-than-stylish? Maybe. But functional? Absolutely. 

[Check Luminette 3 Light Therapy Glasses - Wearable Light Therapy Lamp deals on Amazon now.](https://agegene.com/link/b0cbrt3srn/)

**Portability and On-the-Go Usability**
A big selling point for these therapy glasses is how portable and convenient they are. The package includes a micro-USB cable and a US plug charger, so recharging it is straightforward. I tried wearing the glasses while doing everything from folding laundry to sipping my morning coffee. Surprisingly, the device stayed snug on my face through all the small, everyday movements. Each charge offered me enough battery life for 5-10 light therapy sessions, which translated into multiple days without having to worry about finding an outlet. Working an office-based job, I found the ability to multitask while receiving light therapy incredibly beneficial.

**Adjustable Light Intensity Levels**
One of the features that stood out to me was the device's three intensity settings—500 lux, 1000 lux, and 1500 lux. Starting at the lowest level made sense for me initially, as I wasn’t sure how my eyes would react to the enriched blue-white LED light. Adjusting was very simple thanks to the intuitive on-off button, but I must admit, a couple of times I struggled to turn it on right away as the button can feel a bit unresponsive. For best results, I scheduled a daily therapy session in the mornings at the highest setting. While there were no fireworks in the sky immediately after, I noticed gradual but meaningful improvements in my mood and energy levels.

**Effectiveness and Results**
Within a week of daily use, I began to notice significant changes. Waking up felt less like dragging a boulder out of bed, and mornings became more manageable. This gadget genuinely seemed to “brighten” my mood—pun intended! For years, I’ve struggled with feeling groggy throughout the day, but the light therapy helped my alertness and focus in the afternoons. I even caught myself being less irritable in stressful moments—a pleasant surprise. However, users should keep in mind that consistency is key here; missing a few days noticeably reduced the effectiveness for me.

**Strengths**
- Freedom to multitask while using.
- Comfortable and lightweight fit.
- Battery life supports up to 10 sessions on a single charge.
- Features multiple intensity levels, suitable for different preferences.
- Positive impact on seasonal mood improvements and sleep patterns.
- Certified as a “zero-risk” device based on European safety standards.

**Drawbacks**
- The on-off button sometimes doesn’t respond well.
- Feels tight at the temples for extended wear.
- Nose pads, while adjustable, might dig into the skin after prolonged use.

**Product Competitors**
Looking at alternative products, the AYO wearable light therapy device emerges as a strong competitor in this category. It’s lighter than the Luminette 3 and features an auto-on function when you wear it, providing an added layer of convenience. However, the Luminette edges out with its three adjustable light intensity settings, which I found essential for customizing comfort during therapy sessions. The AYO also seemed to cause more headaches for certain users due to improper positioning of its flexible nose piece. Both are innovative, but the Luminette’s price-to-quality ratio feels more balanced for what it accomplishes in mood and sleep regulation.

**Smart Spending**
With wearable light therapy being quite the niche market, the initial cost of such glasses might feel steep at first. However, knowing the practical advantages it offers—ease of use, effectiveness, and durability—the investment does feel justified. It’s like purchasing a compact, portable version of those big light therapy boxes that command more space and don’t offer mobility. While the Luminette might not be for everyone, especially those who value aesthetics higher than utility, the benefits far outweigh the financial commitment for sleep and mood sufferers like me.

A lot of supplements promise the world but deliver disappointment. But what happened after I actually tried MITOLYN? Let’s just say: **my body, energy, and life haven't been the same since**. In this honest 2025 review, I’m going to share **my complete personal experience**, **what I liked**, **what could be better**, and most importantly — why I believe MITOLYN is **worth every penny**.

# 🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

* I was tired all the time.
* My focus was fading.
* My joints ached.
* I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.
* And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence**.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and a **real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **restore mitochondrial health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a **science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement**. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences **energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance**, and even **longevity**.

Key benefits they promise:

* Boost energy naturally
* Improve focus and brain performance
* Support healthy weight management
* Reduce joint pain and inflammation
* Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a **too-good-to-be-true checklist**. But I gave it a shot.

# 🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the **premium, research-backed ingredients** that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

* **CoQ10** – Supports cellular energy and heart health
* **PQQ** – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Improves mental clarity and memory
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress
* **Resveratrol** – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties
* **Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12** – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a **synergistic formula** that targets the **root cause of fatigue and aging** — mitochondrial decline.

# ✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

# ✅ Week 1:

* Slight increase in morning energy
* Clearer mental focus during work
* No crash in the afternoon like before

# ✅ Week 2:

* Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed
* Digestion felt smoother
* Less brain fog
* I started to feel “lighter”

# ✅ Week 3:

* My energy levels felt **stable and strong all day**
* I could **focus better at work for longer periods**
* My workouts improved — less joint pain
* I noticed a **mood boost** too — more optimistic

# ✅ Week 4:

* I felt like **I got my younger self back**
* I stopped reaching for coffee
* My weight dropped by 3 pounds
* I felt **clear-headed, more active, and even happier**

# 💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

* ⚡ **Energy:** I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.
* 🧠 **Focus**: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.
* 🔥 **Metabolism**: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.
* 💪 **Recovery**: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.
* 🦴 **Joint Relief**: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.
* ✨ **Overall Mood:** I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

# 😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the **downsides** — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

# 1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a **science-backed long-term upgrade**.

# 2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — **it’s worth the investment**.

# 3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN **sells out often**. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

# 💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, **yes**.  
If you’re:

* Feeling constantly tired
* Struggling with brain fog or poor memory
* Battling joint pain
* Gaining unwanted weight
* Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

Then MITOLYN can literally be the **missing piece** in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works **deep inside your cells** to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are **real and lasting**.

# 🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN is not a gimmick.**  
It’s a **premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement** that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the **#1 product I recommend**. Period.

People say it can boost your energy, sharpen your mind, and help your body run better. With so many glowing reviews, I couldn’t help but wonder: could this actually be the answer I was looking for? So, I decided to try MITOLYN myself for three whole months—even though it wasn’t cheap! I wanted to see if it would really make a difference in my life. Here’s my honest MITOLYN review and everything you need to know if you’re thinking about giving it a shot.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

MITOLYN isn’t just another supplement sitting on my shelf. It’s become a part of my daily life, and I’ve never felt better. My energy is up, my mind is clearer, and I’m enjoying life so much more.

I wasted so much time and money on things that never worked, but MITOLYN delivered real results. If you’re ready to invest in yourself and see what you’re truly capable of, I can’t recommend it enough.

Thank you for reading our **Java Burn review** ...

Some mornings you feel like a soggy piece of toast—warm, useless, and just waiting to be rescued by coffee. Been there. It’s exhausting, physically and mentally.

Tired of energy crashes, random cravings, and a waistband that’s clinging on for dear life? That’s where Java Burn steps in—with zero flavor and, thankfully, zero drama.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Java Burn  
**Category:** Health & Wellness ➝ Weight Loss Supplements  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

============

============

# 🔍 What is Java Burn & How Does It Work?

**Java Burn** is a **fat burning coffee powder** that blends invisibly into your morning cup. It supports fat loss, energy, and focus—all without adding calories.

It claims to **increase metabolism naturally** by working with your coffee’s caffeine, not against it. Think of it as a co-pilot, not a replacement.

Unlike pills or flavored drinks, this is a **healthy coffee enhancer** that won’t mess with your brew. It doesn’t clump, doesn’t float, and doesn’t judge your coffee habits.

This isn’t just one of the **best supplements to mix with coffee**, it might be the only one you’ll finish the pouch off without regret.

It’s marketed as a **coffee metabolism booster supplement** that makes your cup do more than just wake you up. And it actually follows through.

# 👤 Personal Experience with Java Burn (from Lisa)

Lisa and I used to share a co-working space back when I was freelancing full-time—she’s a freelance UX designer and full-blown coffee snob with a side hustle teaching yoga.

We bonded over burnt espresso shots and long rants about slow metabolism after 30.

She was the one who nudged me toward Java Burn. “It’s not a miracle,” she warned, “but it *does* help me stay out of the snack drawer between client calls.”

Lisa started mixing **Java Burn** into her morning pour-over during a particularly intense stretch of back-to-back deadlines.

After about four days, she noticed her energy stayed more even—no 3 p.m. crashes, and her usual impulse to stress-eat a granola bar? MIA.

She didn’t change anything else—same yoga classes, same avocado toast obsession—but over the next month, she said her leggings started feeling just a bit looser. Nothing drastic, just a steady shift.

“It’s the first time I’ve lost weight without feeling like I was punishing myself,” she said, which coming from Lisa, is high praise.

Her only gripe? On mornings she skipped breakfast (usually after a late night prototyping marathon), it made her feel a bit too wired. Once she paired it with even a small snack, things leveled out fast.

So yeah—real person, real coffee, real results.

# ✅ Pros and Cons

# Pros

🟢 Clean mix-in for coffee, no aftertaste—definitely a **natural supplement to mix with coffee for energ**y  
🟢 Steady energy with ingredients like **L-theanin**e, **chromiu**m, and **green tea extrac**t  
🟢 Legit **weight loss supplement that works with coffe**e, not just more hype

# Cons

🔴 Can cause **side effect**s like jitters if taken on an empty stomach  
🔴 Not ideal for people who avoid caffeine entirely  
🔴 No local stores carry it—online orders only

# 🧬 Ingredients Breakdown

Let’s talk ingredients. Java Burn keeps it clean with a short **ingredients list**—no mystery blends, no lab experiments.

Key players include **green tea extract (EGCG)**, **chlorogenic acid**, **L-theanine**, **L-carnitine**, **chromium**, and **vitamins B6 & B12**.

Together, they form a **daily supplement for energy and metabolism** that feels like fuel—not fire.

If you want to **make your coffee help you lose weight**, this combo has scientific backing and no sugar bombs in sight.

# 🎯 Who Java Burn Is For (And Who It’s Not)

It’s perfect if you already drink coffee and want to **boost metabolism with your morning brew**—without adding another pill to your routine.

If you're after a **metabolism booster without jitters**, though, you’ll want to pair it with food. Caffeine still hits hard on an empty stomach.

The product is called Java Burn and really popular on ClickBank. The problem is that it is not scientifically backed. It also has a lot of negative reviews on Amazon and YouTube.

Hi, \[NAME\].

Have you ever dreaded stepping on a weighing scale because you feared the number staring back at you?

Ever looked at yourself in the mirror, sighed deeply and thought, “I have to do better”?

But what if those feelings of dread and disappointment went away after making a simple change in your coffee?

My name is John Barban and I’ve spent 20 years developing products that improve metabolic health and aid weight loss. Recently, I stumbled across a natural & powerful formula that will optimise your metabolism and have your fat-burning furnace burning round the clock.

In the formula, one of the key ingredients is Chromium, a mineral that regulates your blood sugar levels and reduces cravings for carbohydrates and sweets. 

And that is just one of the many natural ingredients in Java Burn.

After a single packet of Java Burn seamlessly blends into your coffee, burning calories and managing your hunger will be easier than ever.

If you're reading this, you're probably like me just a few months ago — frustrated, bloated, and desperate for real gut relief. Let me be 100% honest: I was skeptical about Prime Biome. I’ve wasted money on “gut health” supplements in the past that either did nothing or made things worse. But something about Prime Biome’s claims, reviews, and science-backed ingredients made me give it one last shot. And I’m so glad I did.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

This is my **real and raw experience** with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for **120 days straight**, I can confidently say this product **changed my life** — and in this review, I’ll break down:

* My personal gut struggles
* What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days
* Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)
* Why I believe this is the only gut health supplement worth your time in 2025

# 🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by **Prime Biome**, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

* **Soil-based probiotics (SBOs)** that survive stomach acid
* **Bacillus coagulans** — clinically shown to improve gut flora
* **Turmeric extract** for inflammation
* **Digestive enzymes**
* And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

# 🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

# Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that **gut rebalancing** sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt *lighter*, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

# Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — **my cravings were disappearing**. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

# Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

# Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.

# ⚠️ My Complaints — And Honest Thoughts

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:

1. **The Price** At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.
2. **Initial Detox Symptoms** The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.
3. **It’s Not Sold in Stores** I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their **\[official website\]** — fast shipping and fresh stock.

# ✅ Why I Recommend Prime Biome to Everyone

If you’ve ever struggled with:

* Chronic bloating
* Inconsistent bowel movements
* Brain fog and fatigue
* Sugar cravings
* Skin breakouts linked to gut issues
* Anxiety or mood swings...

… then **Prime Biome** could be the missing piece.

This is **not just another probiotic** — it’s a **scientifically formulated gut repair system** that works with your body, not against it. The soil-based organisms, enzyme blend, and anti-inflammatory agents are what make it unique.

And here’s the kicker — **it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee**. So even if it doesn’t work for you, there’s zero risk.

# ⭐ Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

Yes. A thousand times YES.

I’ve tried over 12 gut products in the last 5 years. None of them made a difference long-term. Prime Biome is the only supplement that delivered visible, emotional, and digestive transformation — and continues to work **4 months in**.

Don’t waste another year feeling sluggish, bloated, and helpless.

This is your sign to take control of your gut health today — your body will thank you, your mind will feel clearer, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

👉 **My advice? Get the 3-bottle bundle**. You’ll save money, have enough to truly see results, and you’re covered with their refund policy anyway.

My Struggle with Gut Issues

For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.

My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.

First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?

PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.

What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.

Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion

I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.

The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.

Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity

By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.

On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.

One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.

Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone

By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.

What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.

I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.

Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It

So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:

Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.

Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.

Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.

Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.

No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You

What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.

Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.

The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome

If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.

I’ve wasted so much money over the years on dental products that promised the world and delivered absolutely nothing. From fancy toothpaste to expensive mouthwashes and even whitening strips that burned my gums – nothing ever gave me that *fresh, clean, healthy smile* I was craving.

But then I discovered **ProDentim**, and everything changed.

# The Struggle Before ProDentim

My oral health was a nightmare.

Bleeding gums, bad breath no matter how much I brushed, tooth sensitivity, and a feeling like my mouth was never clean. I brushed twice a day. I flossed. I even used a tongue scraper. Still – my gums stayed inflamed, and my dentist kept hinting at early gum disease.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

And don’t even get me started on the **dental bills**. Every visit was hundreds of dollars, and I felt like I was constantly fighting a losing battle.

The worst part? I felt embarrassed. I’d cover my mouth when I laughed. I avoided smiling in pictures. I lost confidence, and it affected my social life and self-esteem.

I knew something had to change.

# The Turning Point – Discovering ProDentim

I came across ProDentim while researching natural solutions for oral health. I noticed thousands of 5-star reviews. Real people claiming it saved their gums, whitened their teeth, eliminated bad breath, and even improved their digestion.

At first, I thought – *""No way. A probiotic for your teeth? Sounds too good to be true.""*

But then I read how ProDentim works.

Unlike other oral products that destroy both *bad* and *good* bacteria in your mouth (yes, that includes some mouthwashes!), **ProDentim uses 3.5 billion CFUs of good bacteria** to restore the natural microbiome in your mouth. That’s the community of helpful bacteria that actually *protects* your gums and teeth.

That clicked for me.

I realized I’d been killing my mouth’s natural defenses for years with harsh chemicals – and ProDentim was offering a totally different, *smarter* solution.

So I gave it a shot.

# My Experience – Week by Week Results

# Week 1: Fresh Breath & A Cleaner Feeling

I started taking one tablet every morning, letting it dissolve slowly in my mouth as recommended.

By the *third day*, I noticed something. My mouth felt cleaner *longer*. My breath was fresher throughout the day. I even asked my husband, and he agreed – no more morning breath!

That alone felt like a win.

# Week 2: Gum Relief and No More Bleeding

This was the week that shocked me. My gums had been bleeding during brushing for *years*. Suddenly – no more blood. The inflammation started to calm down. They weren’t as red or puffy. And flossing wasn’t painful anymore.

I couldn’t believe it. I hadn’t changed anything else in my routine – just added ProDentim.

# Week 4: Brighter Smile, Stronger Teeth

I started noticing my teeth looked *whiter*. Not like artificial, bleached white – but a healthy, natural brightness. Even my coffee stains were fading. My sensitivity reduced too, and I could eat ice cream again without wincing.

Every time I looked in the mirror, I smiled bigger.

# Week 6 and Beyond: A Complete Transformation

After about 6 weeks, my mouth health felt completely reborn. My dentist noticed too during my next cleaning. He asked me what I was doing differently – because my gums looked amazing, and there was almost no plaque buildup.

The best part? I feel **more confident than ever**. I laugh freely. I smile in every picture. I talk to people up close without second-guessing myself.

# Why ProDentim Works – The Secret Behind the Success

Here’s what sets ProDentim apart:

* ✅ **3.5 Billion CFUs of Targeted Probiotics** – These strains are specifically chosen to support gum health, fresh breath, and strong teeth.
* ✅ **Clinically Proven Ingredients** like *Lactobacillus Paracasei*, *BLIS M-18*, and *Lactobacillus Reuteri* – which are backed by science for their oral health benefits.
* ✅ **Natural & Non-GMO Formula** – No chemicals, no stimulants, no habit-forming ingredients.
* ✅ **Bonus Benefits** – I even noticed better digestion and immunity. Turns out, oral health and gut health are connected!

# What I Love About ProDentim (And You Will Too)

* **It’s super easy to use** – Just one tablet in the morning. No need to change your whole routine.
* **No side effects** – I had zero digestive discomfort, and it didn’t interfere with any medications.
* **Affordable** – Compared to dental bills, this is a no-brainer. Plus, they often run discounts on their official site.
* **Risk-free** – They offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, so there’s literally no risk in trying it.

# Who Should Use ProDentim?

If you’re dealing with:

* Bad breath
* Bleeding or swollen gums
* Tooth sensitivity
* Plaque buildup
* Yellow or stained teeth
* Fear of gum disease or tooth loss

Or if you just want **healthier teeth and a naturally beautiful smile**, **ProDentim is for you**.

# Final Thoughts – My Only Regret

Honestly, my only regret is not starting ProDentim sooner. I wasted years and hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars on ineffective solutions, when all I needed was to restore balance in my mouth’s microbiome.

ProDentim didn’t just improve my oral health – it restored my confidence, improved my social life, and gave me a reason to smile again.

If you're reading this and still on the fence, take it from someone who’s been there – **try ProDentim today.** You’ll be amazed at the transformation.

Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion  
  
I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.  
The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.  
  
Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity  
By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.  
  
On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.  
One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.  
  
  
Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone  
  
By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.  
  
What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.  
I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.  
  
  
  
  
Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It  
  
So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:  
Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.  
Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.  
Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.  
Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.  
  
No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You  
  
What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.  
Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.  
  
  
The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome  
  
If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.  
I’ve tried countless other products over the years, but none have come close to the results I’ve seen with PrimeBiome. If you’re looking for something that actually works, with scientifically-backed ingredients and long-lasting results, this is the product for you.  
Don’t wait any longer to experience the transformation PrimeBiome can offer. Your gut, your energy, and your life will thank you.

I never thought I'd be writing a review like this. In fact, I used to be the person who avoided smiling in photos, kept my mouth slightly closed when laughing, and constantly worried about bad breath—even after brushing. My teeth weren’t falling out or anything drastic, but they just didn’t feel healthy. I had bleeding gums, sensitive teeth, and this constant “fuzzy” feeling on my tongue no matter how often I brushed.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

I tried all the typical fixes—fancy electric toothbrushes, special toothpastes, mouthwashes that burned my mouth, flossing religiously. You name it. Nothing seemed to work long-term.

That’s when I stumbled upon ProDentim.

And I have to say: ProDentim didn’t just improve my oral health—it completely transformed it.

If you’ve been struggling like I was, please keep reading. Because I’m going to share my full experience, why I think this product is so different, and why it’s something I wish I had found years earlier.

The Struggle: A Silent Confidence Killer

Let’s be honest—your mouth is one of the first things people notice about you. Whether you’re speaking, smiling, or laughing, your oral health is always on display.

For years, I had issues with:

Bleeding gums during brushing

Occasional bad breath (even with mints)

Tooth sensitivity to cold and hot

A constant dry or “coated” feeling on my tongue

And an overall lack of confidence in how my mouth felt

And the most frustrating part? I was doing everything right—brushing twice a day, flossing, using mouthwash. Still, something felt off. And dental visits? They were always followed by guilt trips and expensive cleanings that left me feeling worse.

The Discovery: A Different Kind of Oral Health Solution

I first heard about ProDentim through a health podcast. They were discussing the surprising fact that dental problems aren't always caused by ""bad brushing""—but by an imbalance in the good and bad bacteria in our mouths.

That caught my attention. I knew about gut health and probiotics, but it never occurred to me that our mouths have a microbiome too.

The speaker explained how traditional products—especially alcohol-based mouthwashes and chemical-laden toothpaste—can actually kill the good bacteria in your mouth, leaving the bad ones to dominate. This imbalance causes bad breath, plaque buildup, bleeding gums, and other problems.

Enter ProDentim—a probiotic supplement specifically designed for oral health.

Instead of scrubbing and killing everything, ProDentim works by repopulating your mouth with healthy bacteria, supporting gums, teeth, and breath from the inside out.

That made so much sense to me.

I ordered a 3-bottle bundle right away.

What Happened After I Started Taking ProDentim

Each ProDentim tablet is a soft chewable that tastes like peppermint. You take one daily, ideally in the morning after brushing. It takes about 30 seconds to dissolve, and then you just go about your day.

I noticed changes faster than I expected.

Week 1: A Noticeable Freshness

After just a few days, my mouth started feeling cleaner—not from the burning of mouthwash, but a natural, lasting kind of freshness. My tongue felt cleaner, and I didn't wake up with that “morning breath” I used to dread.

Even after coffee and lunch, I noticed my breath stayed fresher longer. This was a small thing, but it gave me a huge boost in confidence during meetings.

Week 2: Gum Sensitivity Improving

By the second week, something amazing happened—I brushed my teeth and there was no bleeding. None. I had gotten so used to that bit of pink in the sink that I assumed it was normal. But with ProDentim, it just… stopped.

My gums looked pinker and healthier, and my sensitivity to hot and cold foods started to fade. I even bit into an ice cream cone without wincing!

Week 4: The Full Transformation

After a month, I was hooked.

My gums were no longer swollen or tender

My breath stayed fresh all day, even without gum or mints

My teeth felt smoother and looked whiter (even though this isn’t technically a whitening product)

I had zero pain or discomfort when eating or drinking

And most importantly—I smiled with full confidence again

It’s hard to explain how powerful that is. I felt more confident, more attractive, and more free than I had in years. All from a tiny chewable tablet.

Why ProDentim Works (What’s Inside Matters)

The reason ProDentim works so well is because of its carefully chosen natural ingredients and probiotic strains. Here are a few that stood out to me:

Lactobacillus Paracasei: Supports gum health and reduces inflammation

Lactobacillus Reuteri: Helps with bad breath and balances oral flora

BLIS M-18 and BLIS K-12: Two powerful strains that protect teeth and freshen breath

Inulin: A prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria and supports balance

Peppermint and Malic Acid: Natural ingredients that support a clean, fresh mouth feel

Everything is clinically backed, non-GMO, and made in an FDA-approved facility. That gave me a lot of peace of mind, especially since I was putting this into my body daily.

A Few Tips for Best Results

If you're planning to try ProDentim (and you absolutely should), here are a few things I recommend:

Be consistent. Take one tablet every morning. It’s easy and becomes second nature.

Let it dissolve slowly. Don’t chew and swallow too fast—let it work its magic in your mouth.

Give it time. I saw changes in the first week, but the real magic happened around weeks 3–4.

Also, pair it with a gentle, fluoride-free toothpaste if possible. I noticed better results when I stopped using harsh chemical-based pastes.

Final Thoughts: This is the Oral Health Secret No One Tells You About

I never imagined I’d find something that would fix so many issues—bad breath, bleeding gums, sensitivity, and confidence—all in one product.

But ProDentim did that for me.

And what’s wild is: it’s not a pill, not a paste, not a rinse. It’s a natural probiotic formula that simply restores balance to your mouth—something that years of brushing and flossing couldn’t do.

If you’ve been suffering silently with oral discomfort, if you avoid smiling fully, or if you’re tired of gum pain, embarrassing breath, or expensive dental visits—this is your answer.

It’s affordable, easy to use, and best of all—it actually works.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Verdict: An absolute game-changer. I’ll never go a day without it again.

My Struggle with Gut Issues  
  
For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.  
My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.  
  
First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?  
  
PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.  
  
What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains.

1kep6a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCosmicWheelSister/comments/1kep6a2/sumatra_slim_belly_tonic_review_my_60day_honest/,Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic Review: My 60-Day Honest Experience (Results & Red Flags),"# Introduction: Why I Tried This Viral “Weight Loss Tonic”

Let’s be real: I rolled my eyes when I first saw ads for Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic. *“Overnight fat-burning while you sleep?”* *“Fix your metabolism with blue light blocking?”* It sounded like another TikTok gimmick. But after battling stubborn belly fat for years (thanks, desk job), I caved.

Spoiler: It wasn’t magic, but I *did* notice some surprising changes. Here’s my raw, no-BS take after 60 days.

# My Before-and-After Results: What Actually Happened

**Week 1-2:**

* **The Hype:** Mixed. The tropical berry flavor was pleasant, but I felt zero difference. No energy boost, no appetite suppression. Just… meh.
* **Sleep:** Okay, fine—I *did* fall asleep faster thanks to the valerian root. But was that worth $69?

**Week 3-4:**

* **Weight Loss:** Down 2.5 lbs. Not groundbreaking, but my late-night sugar cravings *did* drop.
* **Energy:** Still waiting for that “metabolism surge” they promised.

**Week 5-8:**

* **Final Results:** Total 6 lbs lost. My jeans fit better, but let’s be clear—this isn’t a “melt belly fat overnight” solution.
* **The Real Win:** My sleep quality improved *dramatically*. I stopped waking up at 3 AM.

**Before/After Stats:**

* Starting Weight: 167 lbs → Ending Weight: 161 lbs
* Waist: 34” → 32.5”

# The Good, The Bad, and The Sketchy

 **Pros:**

* **Better Sleep:** Valerian root + hops = legit chill vibes.
* **No Jitters:** Unlike caffeine-heavy fat burners.
* **Subtle Appetite Control:** 5-HTP helped curb my snack attacks.

 **Cons:**

* **Slow Results:** Took 3 weeks to see *any* change.
* **Pricey:** $69/month adds up fast.
* **Taste:** After 60 days, the “tropical” flavor got old.

 **Red Flags:**

* **Counterfeit Products:** I almost bought a fake bottle on Amazon. *Always* use the official website.
* **Vague “Science”:** The blue light metabolism claims feel stretched.

# Ingredients Breakdown: What’s Inside?

The label touts “8 natural metabolism boosters,” but let’s dissect the key players:

1. **Valerian Root & Hops:** Sleep enhancers (worked for me).
2. **Berberine:** Studied for blood sugar support—might aid fat loss indirectly.
3. **5-HTP:** Mood/appetite regulator (subtle but noticeable).
4. **Lutein:** For blue light protection? Unconvinced.

**Missing?** Dosage details. How much berberine are we *actually* getting?

# The Scam Complaints (And How to Avoid Them)

I dug into Reddit and Walmart reviews—here’s the tea:

* **Amazon/Ebay Risks:** Multiple users reported fake tonics with no effects. *One person said, “Tasted like cough syrup.”*
* **Refund Issues:** Some couldn’t reclaim money after bad batches.

**Protect Yourself:**

* Buy ONLY from the Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic official site.
* Use their 60-day refund policy (I tested it—they replied in 2 days).

# FAQ: Your Burning Questions Answered

**1.** ***“Is this a scam?”***  
Not entirely, but counterfeit versions are rampant. Stick to the official source.

**2.** ***“Can I take it with coffee?”***  
Yes, but avoid pairing with other stimulants (jitters risk).

**3.** ***“How fast does it work?”***  
Patience required. I saw tiny changes after 3 weeks.

# Final Verdict: Would I Recommend It?

**For Sleep & Mild Weight Loss:** Maybe. If you struggle with stress-eating or insomnia, the ingredients *could* help.

**For Rapid Fat Loss:** Nope. Pair it with diet changes and exercise for real results.

**My Rating:** 3/5. It’s *not* a miracle, but it’s not a total scam either. Proceed with realistic expectations.

**Got Questions?** Drop them below! And if you’ve tried Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic, share your story—let’s keep it real.

**P.S.** Always consult your doctor before trying supplements, especially if you’re on meds.

My Struggle with Gut Issues  
  
For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.  
My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.  
  
First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?  
  
PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.  
  
What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.  
Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion  
  
I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.  
The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.  
  
Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity  
By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.  
  
On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.  
One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.  
  
  
Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone  
  
By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.  
  
What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.  
I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.  
  
  
  
  
Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It  
  
So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:  
Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.  
Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.  
Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.  
Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.  
  
No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You  
  
What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.  
  
  
Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone  
  
By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.  
  
What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.  
I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.  
  
  
  
  
Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It  
  
So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:  
Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.  
Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.  
Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.  
Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.  
  
No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You  
  
What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.  
Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.  
  
  
The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome  
  
If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.  
I’ve tried countless other products over the years, but none have come close to the results I’ve seen with PrimeBiome. If you’re looking for something that actually works, with scientifically-backed ingredients and long-lasting results, this is the product for you.  
Don’t wait any longer to experience the transformation PrimeBiome can offer. Your gut, your energy, and your life will thank you.

I thought about small domestic electric roasters to roast for my personal consumption (800g-1kg per month) 
I am really passionate about the world of coffee. I am thinking about the future, perhaps roasting to perhaps sell in markets and around me. 
I prefer to invest in something fairly high quality from the start because I am used to consuming coffee from large European roasters so I would not want to be disappointed by results that are too average. I also don't want to tinker too much so a ready-made roaster is also a criterion. 

I spotted 3 models:

- Kaffelogic Nano 7: opportunity to purchase a used model for $800
Possibility of roasting small quantities to experiment further but capacity limited to 120g but 200g with boost kit for $200 more. 

- Kaleido Sniper M1: capacity at 50-200g without needing a kit but $1300

- Skywalker v2: capacity of 300-500g and $900 maybe a little less. But 300g minimum is less flexible for testing different roasting profiles. But the advantage is that it is more scalable in the future if I want to do more volume.

From my point of view, the Kaffelogic seems to me the best option to discover roasting and if I want to do more volume one day it might be time to invest directly in an Aillio Bullet R1 or R2 Pro. 
And conversely if I don't want to go any further I should be able to resell the Kaffelogic without losing too much money...

# I Was Tired of Feeling Tired

For years, I struggled with low energy. I’d wake up exhausted, drag myself through the day, and crash by 7 PM. My brain felt foggy, my body felt heavy, and I just assumed this was part of getting older. I tried all kinds of “solutions” – more sleep, more coffee, expensive vitamins, diet changes – but nothing worked for more than a few days.

What’s worse? My doctor ran blood tests and told me everything looked “normal.” But I didn’t feel normal. I felt like I was slowly fading.

That’s when I stumbled upon **MITOLYN**.

# Skeptical but Desperate

Let me be honest – I was skeptical at first. I’m very careful with what I put in my body, and I’ve fallen for my fair share of “miracle supplements” that turned out to be duds. But something about MITOLYN caught my eye. The science behind it. The focus on mitochondria – the energy-producing engines of our cells. It made sense.

As I dug deeper, I learned that MITOLYN wasn’t some random pill filled with caffeine or synthetic garbage. It’s formulated specifically to **recharge your mitochondria**, which are directly responsible for your body’s energy, cellular health, and even aging.

I read reviews from other users. People like me – tired, frustrated, losing hope – who said MITOLYN gave them their lives back. I thought, “What do I have to lose?”

So, I ordered my first bottle.

# The First Week: Subtle But Real

When I got the bottle, I was immediately impressed with the packaging and quality. It didn’t look or feel like a cheap supplement. It was clear that MITOLYN was made with care.

I started taking it daily – just as recommended.

After the first three days, I wasn’t bouncing off the walls or anything, but I noticed a subtle shift. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons. My mind felt a little clearer. I wasn’t constantly craving sugar or caffeine to keep me going.

By the end of the first week, I could tell something was changing – slowly, but surely.

# Week Two and Beyond: Transformation

Week two is when the real magic started. I woke up one morning and realized I wasn’t tired. That might sound small, but for someone who hadn’t felt *rested* in years, it was monumental. I got out of bed with energy. I didn’t dread the day ahead – I looked forward to it.

As days went on, I started:

* Working more efficiently
* Remembering things better
* Thinking more clearly
* Sleeping deeper
* Feeling lighter, happier, and more confident

My friends and family noticed too. My wife asked if I’d started working out again (I hadn’t – yet). My coworkers asked if I was on vacation or had some kind of glow-up. I just smiled and said, “I found something that works.”

MITOLYN didn’t just boost my energy. It *restored* me.

# What Makes MITOLYN Different?

There are a lot of supplements out there promising the world. But MITOLYN is different – and here’s why:

# 1. Backed by Real Science

MITOLYN is based on cutting-edge research into mitochondrial health – the real root of energy and vitality. While other supplements treat symptoms, MITOLYN targets the core of your cells to enhance energy production naturally.

# 2. Premium, Potent Ingredients

No fillers, no junk. MITOLYN uses ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and other proven compounds that are specifically known to support mitochondrial function, cellular repair, and overall vitality. You feel the quality from day one.

# 3. Sustainable Energy, Not a Crash

Unlike caffeine-based “boosters,” MITOLYN gives you sustainable, all-day energy without the crash. I never feel jittery, overstimulated, or anxious. Just steady, clean power.

# 4. Real Results for Real People

MITOLYN has thousands of loyal customers who’ve experienced results just like mine. It’s not hype – it’s a movement. And once you try it, you’ll understand why so many people are hooked.

# The Unexpected Bonus: Mental Clarity & Mood Boost

One benefit I didn’t expect was how much better my *mood* became. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy – it lifted my mental fog, reduced my stress, and made me feel optimistic again. My productivity skyrocketed. My relationships improved. I even started exercising again because I finally had the motivation.

It’s not an exaggeration to say that MITOLYN helped me rediscover my passion for life.

# Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If any of the following sound like you, you NEED MITOLYN:

* You feel tired all the time, no matter how much sleep you get
* You rely on coffee, energy drinks, or sugar to function
* You suffer from brain fog or memory problems
* You’ve noticed signs of aging, weakness, or slower recovery
* You want to feel like *yourself* again – sharp, strong, and full of life

Whether you’re in your 30s, 50s, or 70s, it’s never too late to recharge your body from the inside out.

# One Warning: You Might Never Want to Stop

I’ve been taking MITOLYN for three months now, and I don’t plan on stopping. It’s become a part of my daily wellness routine, and I’ve never felt better. I used to dread aging – now, I’m excited about what’s ahead.

If you try MITOLYN, be ready: you might become a customer for life.

# Final Thoughts: Buy It. Right Now.

I don’t make recommendations lightly. But MITOLYN is hands down one of the best decisions I’ve ever made for my health.

If you’ve been feeling sluggish, stressed, mentally cloudy, or just not like yourself – do yourself a favor and try MITOLYN today. You have nothing to lose and **everything** to gain.

I’m not being paid to say this. I’m just a grateful customer who got their life back – and I hope the same for you.

👉 Don’t wait. Your body, your mind, and your future self will thank you.

🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.



I was tired all the time.



My focus was fading.



My joints ached.



I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.



And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.



Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.



That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.



⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.



Key benefits they promise:



Boost energy naturally



Improve focus and brain performance



Support healthy weight management



Reduce joint pain and inflammation



Fight cellular aging



To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.



🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.



Some of the star ingredients include:



CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health



PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria



Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory



Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress



Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties



Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production



Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.



✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:



✅ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy



Clearer mental focus during work



No crash in the afternoon like before



✅ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed



Digestion felt smoother



Less brain fog



I started to feel “lighter”



✅ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day



I could focus better at work for longer periods



My workouts improved — less joint pain



I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic



✅ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back



I stopped reaching for coffee



My weight dropped by 3 pounds



I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier



💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:



⚡ Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.



🧠 Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.



🔥 Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.



💪 Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.



🦴 Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.



✨ Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.



😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:



1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.



2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.



3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.



💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:



Feeling constantly tired



Struggling with brain fog or poor memory



Battling joint pain



Gaining unwanted weight



Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”



Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.



Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.



🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

I never thought I'd be writing a review like this. But after what MITOLYN has done for my health, energy, and overall quality of life, I feel it’s my duty to tell the world.

# I Was Tired of Feeling Tired

For years, I struggled with low energy. I’d wake up exhausted, drag myself through the day, and crash by 7 PM. My brain felt foggy, my body felt heavy, and I just assumed this was part of getting older. I tried all kinds of “solutions” – more sleep, more coffee, expensive vitamins, diet changes – but nothing worked for more than a few days.

What’s worse? My doctor ran blood tests and told me everything looked “normal.” But I didn’t feel normal. I felt like I was slowly fading.

That’s when I stumbled upon **MITOLYN**.

# Skeptical but Desperate

Let me be honest – I was skeptical at first. I’m very careful with what I put in my body, and I’ve fallen for my fair share of “miracle supplements” that turned out to be duds. But something about MITOLYN caught my eye. The science behind it. The focus on mitochondria – the energy-producing engines of our cells. It made sense.

As I dug deeper, I learned that MITOLYN wasn’t some random pill filled with caffeine or synthetic garbage. It’s formulated specifically to **recharge your mitochondria**, which are directly responsible for your body’s energy, cellular health, and even aging.

I read reviews from other users. People like me – tired, frustrated, losing hope – who said MITOLYN gave them their lives back. I thought, “What do I have to lose?”

So, I ordered my first bottle.

# The First Week: Subtle But Real

When I got the bottle, I was immediately impressed with the packaging and quality. It didn’t look or feel like a cheap supplement. It was clear that MITOLYN was made with care.

I started taking it daily – just as recommended.

After the first three days, I wasn’t bouncing off the walls or anything, but I noticed a subtle shift. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons. My mind felt a little clearer. I wasn’t constantly craving sugar or caffeine to keep me going.

By the end of the first week, I could tell something was changing – slowly, but surely.

# Week Two and Beyond: Transformation

Week two is when the real magic started. I woke up one morning and realized I wasn’t tired. That might sound small, but for someone who hadn’t felt *rested* in years, it was monumental. I got out of bed with energy. I didn’t dread the day ahead – I looked forward to it.

As days went on, I started:

* Working more efficiently
* Remembering things better
* Thinking more clearly
* Sleeping deeper
* Feeling lighter, happier, and more confident

My friends and family noticed too. My wife asked if I’d started working out again (I hadn’t – yet). My coworkers asked if I was on vacation or had some kind of glow-up. I just smiled and said, “I found something that works.”

MITOLYN didn’t just boost my energy. It *restored* me.

# What Makes MITOLYN Different?

There are a lot of supplements out there promising the world. But MITOLYN is different – and here’s why:

# 1. Backed by Real Science

MITOLYN is based on cutting-edge research into mitochondrial health – the real root of energy and vitality. While other supplements treat symptoms, MITOLYN targets the core of your cells to enhance energy production naturally.

# 2. Premium, Potent Ingredients

No fillers, no junk. MITOLYN uses ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and other proven compounds that are specifically known to support mitochondrial function, cellular repair, and overall vitality. You feel the quality from day one.

# 3. Sustainable Energy, Not a Crash

Unlike caffeine-based “boosters,” MITOLYN gives you sustainable, all-day energy without the crash. I never feel jittery, overstimulated, or anxious. Just steady, clean power.

# 4. Real Results for Real People

MITOLYN has thousands of loyal customers who’ve experienced results just like mine. It’s not hype – it’s a movement. And once you try it, you’ll understand why so many people are hooked.

# The Unexpected Bonus: Mental Clarity & Mood Boost

One benefit I didn’t expect was how much better my *mood* became. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy – it lifted my mental fog, reduced my stress, and made me feel optimistic again. My productivity skyrocketed. My relationships improved. I even started exercising again because I finally had the motivation.

It’s not an exaggeration to say that MITOLYN helped me rediscover my passion for life.

# Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If any of the following sound like you, you NEED MITOLYN:

* You feel tired all the time, no matter how much sleep you get
* You rely on coffee, energy drinks, or sugar to function
* You suffer from brain fog or memory problems
* You’ve noticed signs of aging, weakness, or slower recovery
* You want to feel like *yourself* again – sharp, strong, and full of life

Whether you’re in your 30s, 50s, or 70s, it’s never too late to recharge your body from the inside out.

# One Warning: You Might Never Want to Stop

I’ve been taking MITOLYN for three months now, and I don’t plan on stopping. It’s become a part of my daily wellness routine, and I’ve never felt better. I used to dread aging – now, I’m excited about what’s ahead.

If you try MITOLYN, be ready: you might become a customer for life.

# Final Thoughts: Buy It. Right Now.

I don’t make recommendations lightly. But MITOLYN is hands down one of the best decisions I’ve ever made for my health.

If you’ve been feeling sluggish, stressed, mentally cloudy, or just not like yourself – do yourself a favor and try MITOLYN today. You have nothing to lose and **everything** to gain.

I’m not being paid to say this. I’m just a grateful customer who got their life back – and I hope the same for you.

👉 Don’t wait. Your body, your mind, and your future self will thank you.

I’ve tried countless supplements promising better digestion, more energy, and improved immunity. From cheap probiotics at the pharmacy to expensive “gut health kits” from trendy online brands, nothing truly worked. Some gave me short-term relief. Others did absolutely nothing. And a few even made me feel worse.

Then, I stumbled upon **PrimeBiome**.

At first, I dismissed it as just another overhyped supplement. But something caught my eye: **100 billion CFUs** of **clinically proven probiotic strains** per serving, backed by **real scientific studies** and **thousands of raving customer reviews**. I decided to give it one last shot before giving up on probiotics entirely.

And let me tell you: **PrimeBiome didn’t just meet my expectations – it shattered them.**

# ✅ What Makes PrimeBiome So Different?

Before I dive into my personal results, let’s talk about **why PrimeBiome works when others don’t**.

Most probiotic supplements die in your stomach acid before they can even reach your gut. PrimeBiome uses a **patented delivery system** that protects the probiotics all the way through your digestive system. That means more good bacteria actually make it where they’re supposed to go – your intestines.

It’s also packed with **11 of the most powerful, scientifically studied probiotic strains**, including **Lactobacillus acidophilus**, **Bifidobacterium longum**, and **Lactobacillus rhamnosus** – all known for supporting gut health, reducing bloating, boosting immunity, and even improving mood.

And with **100 billion CFUs per capsule**, PrimeBiome contains up to **50 times more live cultures than the average probiotic**.

This isn’t just another capsule. **This is a clinical-grade gut health formula** designed to completely rebalance your microbiome and transform your health from the inside out.

# 🧬 My Results After 30 Days

I started taking **1 PrimeBiome capsule daily with breakfast**.

# Week 1:

* Within 3 days, I noticed something incredible: **no more bloating after meals.**
* My stomach felt flatter, lighter, and more comfortable.
* I was regular again – no constipation, no irregularity. It felt like my digestion finally clicked into place.

# Week 2:

* My energy levels began skyrocketing. I no longer needed 3 cups of coffee to get through the day.
* My brain fog lifted. I was more focused, alert, and even more motivated at work.
* And surprisingly, I noticed I was sleeping deeper and waking up more refreshed.

# Week 3:

* I wasn’t getting sick like everyone else around me. Normally, I’d catch a cold when the weather shifted – not this time.
* My skin started clearing up. Even my eczema patches became less inflamed.
* My mood was noticeably better. Fewer anxiety episodes. More calm. I felt like myself again.

# Week 4:

* I lost 6 pounds – without changing my diet.
* My sugar cravings dropped dramatically. I actually wanted healthier foods.
* My stomach felt like it belonged to a completely different person – light, pain-free, and balanced.

Finally have narrowed my grinder search down to two options, the Mazzer Philos or the Ceado E6C Chameleon. If anyone has experience with these, I'd love your input. I currently have the Eureka Mignon Zero which I love, but on certain coffees I can't grind fine enough. I drink mostly espresso (medium, sometimes light, cortado for my wife), and occasionally make pour over for guests. Here's what I'm looking for in a grinder...

* Build quality
* Low retention
* Relatively quiet
* Lots of ""runway"" to dial fine enough for lighter roasts (I'm currently almost at burr chirp on my Eureka
* Strong motor (I like being able to grind an 18g does in about 10 seconds or less, silly preference, I know)
* Easy access to clean

The Mazzer looks readily available while the E6C I can only find on Whole Latte Love and they're sold out (they think in about 6 weeks or so they'll have more). Thank you all so much for any input and cheers!",1,1746379202.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m constantly on the lookout for something that not only promises to boost my energy, improve my focus, or enhance my overall well-being, but something that actually delivers on those promises. Enter Nagano Tonic—a product that has completely changed the game for me.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



From the moment I first heard about Nagano Tonic, I was intrigued. Hailing from the pristine mountains of Nagano, Japan, it carries with it the promise of pure, natural ingredients sourced from one of the cleanest and most biodiverse regions on the planet. Nagano is known for its rich, centuries-old traditions of herbal healing, and the tonic blends some of the best elements of this wisdom with cutting-edge science. I’ve always been skeptical of “miracle” products, so I approached Nagano Tonic with a mix of hope and caution.



But after using this product for just a few weeks, I can confidently say that it has far exceeded any of my expectations.



The First Impressions: Quality and Taste

When I first opened the bottle, I was immediately impressed by the sleek, elegant packaging. It’s clear that the company behind Nagano Tonic values both the aesthetics and the quality of the product. The dark, amber-colored liquid inside exudes a sense of purity and natural goodness. You can almost feel the richness of the ingredients through the bottle.



As for the taste—let’s just say it’s not your average health drink. Unlike many other tonics or supplements I’ve tried in the past that taste either overly synthetic or bitter, Nagano Tonic has a surprisingly refreshing, earthy flavor with subtle hints of green tea and Japanese herbs. It’s not overpowering, and there’s a smoothness to it that makes it easy to drink every day. I personally enjoy it chilled, but I’ve also mixed it into smoothies for an extra health boost.



Immediate Effects: Energy, Clarity, and Focus

I’ve always been a person with a bit of a “midday slump.” It’s the time when my energy dips and my brain becomes foggy, making it hard to stay focused and productive. Since I started incorporating Nagano Tonic into my daily routine, that midday crash has become a thing of the past. Within 30 minutes of drinking a small serving in the morning, I felt an almost instant surge of clean, sustained energy. It wasn’t the jittery, caffeine-like energy that you get from a cup of coffee. Instead, it was a calm, steady sense of alertness that lasted for hours.



The difference was palpable. My mind felt sharper, clearer, and more focused. I found myself able to power through tasks with much more efficiency and without that nagging feeling of burnout that usually sets in after a few hours of work.



What I really love about Nagano Tonic is that it doesn’t just offer an energy boost—it also seems to improve my mental clarity and focus. This is particularly noticeable when I have to dive into complex work or creative tasks. It’s as though my brain is firing on all cylinders, and I feel more capable of tackling difficult problems. I’ve been more productive, creative, and even more organized, and I can only attribute it to this incredible tonic.



Long-Term Benefits: Health, Immunity, and Vitality

After using Nagano Tonic for a few weeks, I started noticing even more profound changes. I’m no longer plagued by those annoying little aches and pains that tend to accumulate as we age, especially around my joints. I’m not saying Nagano Tonic is a “miracle cure,” but it certainly seems to have a positive impact on my overall mobility and well-being. My recovery times after workouts have improved, and I’ve felt generally more flexible and agile.



Additionally, I’ve noticed improvements in my immune system. I’ve always had a sensitive stomach and would often find myself catching colds or feeling a little run-down. Since incorporating Nagano Tonic into my routine, I’ve felt stronger and more resilient. I don’t know if it's the tonic’s potent combination of antioxidants, vitamins, and adaptogens, or the balance of minerals it provides, but I’ve been able to fight off the usual seasonal bugs without a hitch. The company claims that the tonic helps boost the immune system, and based on my experience, I’d say it’s true.



But perhaps one of the most remarkable long-term benefits I’ve experienced is an overall increase in my vitality. I wake up feeling more refreshed, sleep more deeply, and have more energy throughout the day. Even my skin seems healthier, glowing with a subtle radiance that I didn’t expect to see at my age. If I had to sum it up, I’d say Nagano Tonic has given me a much-needed “reboot” of vitality.



Ingredients You Can Trust

One of the most impressive things about Nagano Tonic is the transparency around its ingredients. Each bottle is made with natural, high-quality components that are ethically sourced from the mountains of Nagano. The tonic contains traditional herbs like ginseng, turmeric, gingko biloba, and matcha, all of which are known for their potent health benefits. What sets Nagano Tonic apart is its dedication to using organic and wildcrafted ingredients that are free from artificial additives, preservatives, and fillers.



It’s rare to find a product in today’s wellness market that is both so effective and so clean. You can truly feel confident knowing that you’re nourishing your body with the purest ingredients available.



The Cost: Worth Every Penny

Now, let’s talk about the cost. When I first saw the price of Nagano Tonic, I won’t lie, I was a little hesitant. But after experiencing the benefits firsthand, I can honestly say that it’s worth every penny. It’s not just a drink—it’s an investment in your health. The effects it’s had on my energy, clarity, immune system, and general well-being make it a valuable addition to my daily routine.



In fact, I consider it a non-negotiable part of my wellness regimen now. I’ve tried countless products that promise results but deliver nothing more than temporary fixes, but Nagano Tonic is the real deal. It’s something I truly look forward to each day, and I can’t imagine going back to life without it.



The Bottom Line: Should You Buy Nagano Tonic?

If you’re looking for a natural, effective way to boost your energy, improve your mental clarity, and support your overall health, then Nagano Tonic is a must-have. It’s a product that I wholeheartedly recommend, and one that I’ll continue to use for the long haul. It’s not just a wellness trend—it’s a genuinely transformative product that works.

I’m constantly on the lookout for something that not only promises to boost my energy, improve my focus, or enhance my overall well-being, but something that actually delivers on those promises. Enter Nagano Tonic—a product that has completely changed the game for me.

From the moment I first heard about Nagano Tonic, I was intrigued. Hailing from the pristine mountains of Nagano, Japan, it carries with it the promise of pure, natural ingredients sourced from one of the cleanest and most biodiverse regions on the planet. Nagano is known for its rich, centuries-old traditions of herbal healing, and the tonic blends some of the best elements of this wisdom with cutting-edge science. I’ve always been skeptical of “miracle” products, so I approached Nagano Tonic with a mix of hope and caution.



But after using this product for just a few weeks, I can confidently say that it has far exceeded any of my expectations.



The First Impressions: Quality and Taste

When I first opened the bottle, I was immediately impressed by the sleek, elegant packaging. It’s clear that the company behind Nagano Tonic values both the aesthetics and the quality of the product. The dark, amber-colored liquid inside exudes a sense of purity and natural goodness. You can almost feel the richness of the ingredients through the bottle.



As for the taste—let’s just say it’s not your average health drink. Unlike many other tonics or supplements I’ve tried in the past that taste either overly synthetic or bitter, Nagano Tonic has a surprisingly refreshing, earthy flavor with subtle hints of green tea and Japanese herbs. It’s not overpowering, and there’s a smoothness to it that makes it easy to drink every day. I personally enjoy it chilled, but I’ve also mixed it into smoothies for an extra health boost.



Immediate Effects: Energy, Clarity, and Focus

I’ve always been a person with a bit of a “midday slump.” It’s the time when my energy dips and my brain becomes foggy, making it hard to stay focused and productive. Since I started incorporating Nagano Tonic into my daily routine, that midday crash has become a thing of the past. Within 30 minutes of drinking a small serving in the morning, I felt an almost instant surge of clean, sustained energy. It wasn’t the jittery, caffeine-like energy that you get from a cup of coffee. Instead, it was a calm, steady sense of alertness that lasted for hours.



The difference was palpable. My mind felt sharper, clearer, and more focused. I found myself able to power through tasks with much more efficiency and without that nagging feeling of burnout that usually sets in after a few hours of work.



What I really love about Nagano Tonic is that it doesn’t just offer an energy boost—it also seems to improve my mental clarity and focus. This is particularly noticeable when I have to dive into complex work or creative tasks. It’s as though my brain is firing on all cylinders, and I feel more capable of tackling difficult problems. I’ve been more productive, creative, and even more organized, and I can only attribute it to this incredible tonic.



Long-Term Benefits: Health, Immunity, and Vitality

After using Nagano Tonic for a few weeks, I started noticing even more profound changes. I’m no longer plagued by those annoying little aches and pains that tend to accumulate as we age, especially around my joints. I’m not saying Nagano Tonic is a “miracle cure,” but it certainly seems to have a positive impact on my overall mobility and well-being. My recovery times after workouts have improved, and I’ve felt generally more flexible and agile.



Additionally, I’ve noticed improvements in my immune system. I’ve always had a sensitive stomach and would often find myself catching colds or feeling a little run-down. Since incorporating Nagano Tonic into my routine, I’ve felt stronger and more resilient. I don’t know if it's the tonic’s potent combination of antioxidants, vitamins, and adaptogens, or the balance of minerals it provides, but I’ve been able to fight off the usual seasonal bugs without a hitch. The company claims that the tonic helps boost the immune system, and based on my experience, I’d say it’s true.



But perhaps one of the most remarkable long-term benefits I’ve experienced is an overall increase in my vitality. I wake up feeling more refreshed, sleep more deeply, and have more energy throughout the day. Even my skin seems healthier, glowing with a subtle radiance that I didn’t expect to see at my age. If I had to sum it up, I’d say Nagano Tonic has given me a much-needed “reboot” of vitality.



Ingredients You Can Trust

One of the most impressive things about Nagano Tonic is the transparency around its ingredients. Each bottle is made with natural, high-quality components that are ethically sourced from the mountains of Nagano. The tonic contains traditional herbs like ginseng, turmeric, gingko biloba, and matcha, all of which are known for their potent health benefits. What sets Nagano Tonic apart is its dedication to using organic and wildcrafted ingredients that are free from artificial additives, preservatives, and fillers.



It’s rare to find a product in today’s wellness market that is both so effective and so clean. You can truly feel confident knowing that you’re nourishing your body with the purest ingredients available.



The Cost: Worth Every Penny

Now, let’s talk about the cost. When I first saw the price of Nagano Tonic, I won’t lie, I was a little hesitant. But after experiencing the benefits firsthand, I can honestly say that it’s worth every penny. It’s not just a drink—it’s an investment in your health. The effects it’s had on my energy, clarity, immune system, and general well-being make it a valuable addition to my daily routine.



In fact, I consider it a non-negotiable part of my wellness regimen now. I’ve tried countless products that promise results but deliver nothing more than temporary fixes, but Nagano Tonic is the real deal. It’s something I truly look forward to each day, and I can’t imagine going back to life without it.



The Bottom Line: Should You Buy Nagano Tonic?

If you’re looking for a natural, effective way to boost your energy, improve your mental clarity, and support your overall health, then Nagano Tonic is a must-have. It’s a product that I wholeheartedly recommend, and one that I’ll continue to use for the long haul. It’s not just a wellness trend—it’s a genuinely transformative product that works.

If you are interested in our social media pursuits or IRL events, please check my profile, join the tg, or our subreddit. 

So, lets get it started:

**Kendu Energy**

Kendu Energy is an energy drink company spearheaded by a chad called Mike, there are others that help him with distribution, like a chad called Sam Synth, who deals with American distribution. Kendu Energy currently has 2 different types, full sugar and sugar free, this ensures that Kendu Energy is inclusive to those who avoid sugar. Kendu Energy has recently changed their box, which was designed by StaySeaArt and MrWhite. I have personally tried the full sugar Kendu Energy and would heavily recommend it to everyone.

**Kendu Coffee**

Kendu coffee sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee, which is farmed in Brazil. Kendu Coffee is roasted to perfection, packed in eco friendly products and is ethically sourced. What is not to love?  
Kendu Coffee is available for both wholesale and one off purchases with Whole Bean, Espresso, French Press and Filter available, to fit all your coffee needs.

**Kendu Merch**

Kendu Merch is a clothing company that has a very wide catalogue of various different items including:T-shirts, hoodies, tank tops, shoes, shorts, yoga pants. crop tops and other accessories. These different clothes have great, creative designs that allows you to shill Kendu on the go.

**Kendu Beer**

Although Kendu Beer is not out yet, there will be multiple different kinds with all varying percentages, I believe there is a triple named Cerberus in the works, with Hopping Dog already set. I am very excited for Kendu Beer and cannot wait to drink it in the sun!

**Kendu Games**

The team making this consists of ex Bioware and AAA game developers. Leadership has committed a portion of net profit after tax back into Kendu. Some portions will be put into the Community Treasury and others into the Kendu Games Treasury. This will be very beneficial at growing Kendu's price steadily, whilst making us more stable. Some details have been released and the main character is called Kippa with a companion calld Yuni. This game will be released on Steam and I am very excited.

Embroidered Kendu patches and they look so good. They are made with high quality materials and have a very professional design.

**Some Comments**

All of these products are being created by average holders, with very creative ideas. Kendu is decentralised and there is no ""team"", this is very important because it shows how dedicated Kendu's community is and this is all being done at 12 million market cap!!! I can guarantee plenty of other products are in the works and some maybe sidelined until people's Kendu bags go up in value, there is gonna be a surge of products being released as Kendu booms past ATH and into the billions. All of these products push Kendu significantly forward, retail will love IRL products because it gives a product something physical. No other coin has come close to what Kendu has accomplished IRL and we are still so cheap, Kendu is gonna skyrocket and you should position yourself accordingly. Die hard communities always win and Kendu is not an exception

I have a delonghi coffee machine where it seems the grinder jammed, causing a line fuse to blow. (My multimeter doesn't detect continuity). It's a small green thing with the letters ""2 1/2 ALF"", I've found these things [here](https://www.amazon.com/10Pcs-Pico-Fuse-2-5A-125V/dp/B07SFK4F9H) which is how I figured it's a fuse.

Now I dont know enough about electronics to be confident here, hence my question might be silly, but can I replace that fuse by cutting it off close to the green part, and soldering on the glass fuse to the two wire ends? Cause that's something I could do now, instead of waiting for delivery.

On the return (this morning) we arrived at Chicago Union Station nice and early and entered through the Adams Street entrance to get a coffee before settling into our seats.  We followed the signs from the food court to ""all trains"" and read the departure board that said our train left from track 8 ""on time"".  It was the same place we arrived the day before so all seemed well.  We waited patiently, at track 8, until the sign changed from 'on time' to 'departed' but we were not on a train.

The lady at the customer service desk was incredulous that we went to the wrong place and couldn't care less that we followed the signs and departure board information.  She insisted it could not have said what it did.

The manager we talked to later also couldn't care less and was far more interested in his cell phone as he lounged in his chair than anything we had to say.  He shrugged his shoulders about the incorrect/inaccurate signage and departure board.  I told him we lost a whole day because of the bad information and he then mustered a bit of a 'sorry about that'.

I've not wanted to belive the overwhelmingly bad opinions about Amtrak that I've heard but based on our experience now giving it a try, I have to agree with them.  Not good.  Amtrak has problems, at least in Chicago.

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",11,1746378547.0,godot,1,0.92,False

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",3,1746378537.0,madeWithGodot,0,1.0,False
1keoto7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1keoto7/tips_that_worked_for_me_over_the_years/,Tips that worked for me over the years,"Using this post to share the best tips I’ve accumulated in the past few years as a frequent flyer (and psychologist). Hope they help someone out there.

1. Get hooked on a binge-worthy show right before you fly (probably my #1 advice) 
Start watching it 2–3 episodes in advance so you’re already emotionally invested. The second I’m past security, I start watching and don’t stop until I land. It creates a sort of “alternate timeline” that distracts my brain completely. noise-cancelling headphones + something light and happy

2. Sit up front, near the stewards
There’s way less turbulence in the front rows. Being near the cabin crew also helps - watching them calmly go about their day grounds me. If you can, pick a seat with extra legroom, it helps mentally and physically.

3. Prep your comfort kit
Small bag with snacks, book or Kindle, mini-games, whatever brings comfort. Hydrate often, skip coffee if you can, and try to eat something nutritious beforehand. Gut health is very much linked to anxiety - don’t underestimate it.

4. Breathing exercise for turbulence or panic
→ 5 seconds in (through the nose)
→ 5 second hold
→ 5 seconds out (through the mouth)
Repeat for a few minutes.

Some background:
I’ve been flying since I was a kid, but a horrible flight over India where the turbulence felt like we turned sideways made me fear flying. It wasn’t a full phobia at the time, but over the years my anxiety around flying got worse, sometimes to the point of trembling or feeling like I’d pass out. Flying when I’m already stressed makes it worse, but unfortunately, avoiding it isn’t an option for me. So I’ve tried a lot, and these are the tips that stuck.

PS: This group has helped me so much over time. Big thanks to all of you - especially the pilots who take time to reassure us. 😌 It gets better!

1.I cannot concentrate on tasks and procrastinate a lot
I've tried multiple books ,videos and random advice nothing works
2.I constant sense of urgency for eg if I'm watching a video I use 2x or simply skip to get answers.
3.I do the leg bounce thing and it seems to increase when I'm trying my best to focus.
4.I don't forget important appointments or anything but I cannot focus on anything else if I have something to look forward to.
5.I heard skin picking is a symptom I do that too I have scars all over my arms and face due to that.
6.If I'm on a call or something I don't interrupt but I do predict what the other person is going to say and not say it out loud But I do get the say it Out loud urge
7. And have to control that It usually takes me a beat to process something that is said directly like I do hear what the other person is saying but cannot understand and say what just to realise what they actually said before them repeating .
8.And I have a constant thought chain like I can jump from one thought to another but if something is bothering me I cannot stop thinking about it for eg right now I am wondering if I need a diagnosis or do I need to try harder.
9.And I often leave things unfinished like having a cabinet door left open or forgetting why I opened a drawer.
10.Also since I am a student I often have to re-read a paragraph very frequently because I couldn't process the first time like it feels like random words at first and then makes sense the second time.
11..And I daydream a lot too.
12. Lastly I use coffee as a way to stimulate my Brain before a task ( I literally tell people I'm heating up my brain as if it is an engine or something)

It’s helped, but I still have big bouts of mood swings, inability to concentrate, make decisions, super self conscious all the time, exhaustion no matter how much I sleep, etc. I started seeing a therapist who believes I am also one of the women who was misdiagnosed and missed the ADHD diagnosis. So how we have been working on that cognitively, but I’ve wanted to try a medication. However, I’m concerned about stimulants because I’m very sensitive to coffee, prednisone, and even Sudafed, I get jittery and anxious, increased heart rate. I saw a psychiatrist (nurse practitioner) who literally ran down a survey of yes no questions and said they wouldn’t prescribe a stimulant unless I took this big diagnostic test that showed an adhd diagnosis. Even though my therapist has already made that diagnosis. So she prescribed Strattera, 40mg and I’m just very concerned about adding it to my current meds. Also reading about strattera makes me nervous about the side effects. I’m also wondering if my anxiety is a side effect of adhd, and the Lexapro is a downer, would the adhd meds fight with that?

1keoqi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCosmicWheelSister/comments/1keoqi9/prime_biome_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest/,Prime Biome Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"If you’re like me, you’ve probably tried your fair share of supplements hoping to see *real* results — smoother skin, better joint comfort, stronger hair, or just a more youthful, energized feeling. After turning 30, I started looking for something beyond the typical vitamins and protein shakes, and that’s when I stumbled across **Prime Biome**.

Now that I’ve used **Prime Biome collagen peptides** daily for the last 90 days, I wanted to share a no-BS, Reddit-style review for anyone considering it. Spoiler: it actually worked better than I expected.

# What Is Prime Biome?

**Prime Biome** is a **hydrolyzed collagen supplement** designed to support healthy skin, joints, hair, nails, and overall aging. It's marketed as a way to help restore collagen levels naturally — something that starts declining as early as our mid-20s.

Each scoop contains **Type I and Type III collagen peptides**, which are the types most closely linked to skin elasticity, hydration, and joint function. It’s made with **grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine collagen**, which I appreciated from a quality standpoint.

# Why I Decided to Try It

I originally started looking into collagen for **joint pain and skin health**. My knees were starting to ache more after workouts, and I was also noticing:

* Dullness and fine lines creeping in
* Thinner hair and slower growth
* Weak nails that chipped easily

I read through a lot of Prime Biome reviews and compared it to other collagen powders like Vital Proteins and Ancient Nutrition. What caught my eye was that Prime Biome:

* Has **no added sugars or fillers**
* Mixes easily (even in cold drinks)
* Contains only **pure collagen peptides**
* Is flavorless — so I could mix it with coffee or smoothies

# How I Used It

Simple: I added **1 scoop of Prime Biome** to my morning coffee every day. It dissolves completely with no taste or texture issues. Sometimes I’d mix it into oatmeal or smoothies, but coffee became my go-to.

# My Experience: Week-by-Week Breakdown

# Weeks 1–2

No major changes — collagen takes time. That said, I did notice slightly better digestion and no bloating after using it in coffee. No side effects at all.

# Weeks 3–4

Nails started growing faster and were noticeably stronger. Hair felt softer, and my skin seemed a little more hydrated. Not dramatic, but a good sign.

# Month 2

Here’s where it got interesting. I noticed:

* My **knee and hip joints** didn’t ache as much after long walks or workouts
* My **skin looked smoother**, especially around the eyes and forehead
* My **hair was thicker at the roots** and had more volume

I even got a few unsolicited compliments on my “glow” — which, if you’ve ever had dull skin, you know feels amazing.

# Month 3

The benefits kept building:

* Skin elasticity and firmness noticeably improved
* I stopped needing to reapply moisturizer midday
* Joint pain was basically gone
* Hair was growing faster, and I saw less breakage
* My confidence went up — I just *felt* better overall

# The Benefits I Noticed (Real Talk)

✅ **Improved Skin Texture & Hydration**  
Within 6 weeks, I saw smoother, bouncier skin. Fine lines were still there, but softer. My face looked more “awake” and even.

✅ **Stronger Joints**  
I didn’t expect much here, but wow. My knees and shoulders feel so much better. No creaking or post-workout soreness like before.

✅ **Healthier Hair & Nails**  
Nails don’t chip anymore. Hair feels fuller and less brittle. Even my lashes seemed a bit thicker?

✅ **Digestive Support**  
Some days I noticed easier digestion, especially when I took it with breakfast.

✅ **Boosted Confidence**  
Honestly, looking better made me feel better. It’s not magic, but it gave me visible results that motivated me to keep going with my self-care.

# Prime Biome Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Clean, simple formula (just collagen peptides)
* No sugar, fillers, or weird aftertaste
* Dissolves easily in hot or cold drinks
* Noticeable improvements to skin, joints, and hair
* Sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised cows
* Affordable compared to similar brands

**Cons:**

* Not vegan (collagen is animal-based)
* Takes at least 4–6 weeks to notice results
* No added nutrients (just collagen — some may prefer added vitamins)

# How Does It Compare to Other Collagen Supplements?

I’ve tried Vital Proteins and Great Lakes before. Prime Biome mixes *way* better (no clumps), and I actually saw faster results. It also didn’t upset my stomach like some flavored collagens do.

The fact that it’s **unflavored and pure** makes it super versatile. You can add it to coffee, smoothies, yogurt, even soup — and you won’t notice it’s there.

# Who Should Try Prime Biome?

Prime Biome is great if you:

* Want to improve your skin texture and reduce early signs of aging
* Have mild joint discomfort or stiffness
* Want to support hair growth and nail strength
* Are looking for a clean, unflavored collagen powder without additives
* Prefer a minimalist supplement (1 scoop, no BS)

It’s not a miracle product, but if you’re consistent, it can absolutely make a visible difference in your appearance and comfort.

# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

**Absolutely.**

After 90 days, I’m genuinely impressed. My skin looks more hydrated and firm, my joints feel better, and my hair and nails are thriving. The best part? It became part of my routine without effort. No pills, no weird taste — just one scoop in coffee.

I’m going to keep using Prime Biome long-term. If you’re curious, I’d say **give it 60–90 days and track your progress**. Take pics. You’ll probably be surprised.",1,1746378259.0,TheCosmicWheelSister,1,1.0,False

It made me so uncomfortable to sit at a table with my parents where they could clearly see my girlfriend’s nipples. I tried talking to her about it - I tried to approach it very carefully and say things along the line of “I know it’s generally frowned upon to ask you, a woman, to dress a certain way, but it makes me very uncomfortable when you don’t have a bra on around my parents.” It didn’t go well and it’s still an issue for me.

My almost 60 year old parents do not want to see their son’s girlfriend’s nipples at the dinner table (my mom has made comments in public about women with their nipples out - never about my gf though but she also would never make a comment about her). Why does she then go see my parents or go out with our friends and have her nipples out? She can’t articulate it. I don’t understand the desire to do it. I don’t think she does either. It’s literally nothing more than “I can do what I want as a woman and you can’t tell me otherwise.” And I think it’s even worse now since I said something. 

I love this woman with all my heart and I want to marry her. However, I really dislike this as I believe it’s unattractive, inappropriate, and can make others uncomfortable. I personally am uncomfortable when woman have their nipples visible in public, like at a grocery store, a nice restaurant, or a coffee shop. I think it’s very revealing and again, a little trashy. 

I feel like there needs to be some kind of compromise here. As adults in a serious, mature relationship, there has to be some level of “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do that,” right?

So, AITA for thinking it’s inappropriate and asking her to stop? Appreciate any feedback, thanks. ",0,1746378118.0,AmItheAsshole,180,0.41,False

I thought I would put myself out there and hopefully meet someone.

I am a very mature for my age 23 year old. I was born and raised in IL on a small one acre farm in a little farmhouse where I currently still live. I've had a pretty quiet life and lately I've been enjoying the simple things in life the most. It just gets a little lonesome at times. 

I am looking for a person who would be interested in forming a genuine connection and friendship and possibly something more intimate and flirtatious if we get comfortable. It's been a few years since I've had anyone to flirt with or where we both had a situation where we were comfortable sharing intimacy and I would love to find that again. One of the biggest things I'm attracted to physically are soft thighs, especially when I'm cold and need warmth. 🤣

I work full time during the week as a building maintenance tech at a tech corporation and I rather enjoy my job. I have weekends off. When I'm not at work, I'm typically relaxing at home. The only downside to my job is that my only coworkers are three men, and I don't get to meet people very easily because of working the off shift. 

Some of my interests are photography, nature walks, bird photography and wildlife, camping, cooking and baking, listening to music, the outdoors, relaxing and being comfy, aviation and flight simulation, technical stuff, fixing things and being handy, going to cute thrift shops and coffee shops, and animals. My favorite season is the Autumn and I absolutely can't wait for it. I could live in a tiny cabin in the woods with a wood stove or wood burning fireplace and be happy. 🤣🍁🏠 I'm a very peaceful person and quite the homebody. 

I am a pretty well rounded person and I'm always respectful and kind. I'll always be mindful of your feelings and boundaries, especially with anything more intimate as it's important to me. 

Physically I'm average healthy weight, pale skin, brown hair, wears glasses.

I'm currently just relaxing in bed after since it's my day off haha. If I seem like someone you'd like to connect with, then I'd love to hear from you!

Let’s be real — the supplement world is full of hype. Every brand promises glowing skin, stronger joints, better digestion, and miracle results. So when I kept seeing ads and Reddit mentions about **Prime Biome**, I was skeptical. But after doing some research and seeing a lot of positive Prime Biome reviews, I decided to try it for myself.

Fast forward **90 days later**, I can confidently say it’s one of the better health supplements I’ve tried. Here’s everything you need to know before trying it — from ingredients and taste to real-world results and who I think it’s actually for.

# What Is Prime Biome?

**Prime Biome** is a **collagen-based supplement** designed to support:

* Skin elasticity and hydration
* Joint health and recovery
* Hair and nail strength
* Gut health and digestion

It primarily features **hydrolyzed collagen peptides** (which are easier for the body to absorb), along with a blend of other ingredients like hyaluronic acid and probiotics.

It’s marketed as a **multi-benefit anti-aging and recovery supplement**, and from my experience — that’s a pretty accurate description.

# Why I Tried Prime Biome (and What I Was Looking For)

I'm in my mid-30s, and like a lot of people at this stage, I’ve started noticing:

* More stiffness in my joints after workouts
* My skin not looking quite as firm or hydrated
* Digestive issues more often (especially with dairy or stress)
* Slower post-workout recovery

I wasn’t expecting a miracle cure, but I wanted something that supported long-term wellness — not just a quick energy boost. The idea of a collagen + probiotic combo caught my interest, so I gave Prime Biome a shot.

# Prime Biome Ingredients (What’s Inside the Scoop?)

What really sold me was the **clean, science-backed formula**. Here's a quick breakdown of what you’re getting:

# 🧬 Hydrolyzed Collagen Peptides (Types I & III)

These are the real stars. Collagen Types I & III support skin, bones, joints, and tendons. Hydrolyzed means it’s broken down for better absorption. After age 25, we naturally lose collagen — this helps replenish it.

# 💧 Hyaluronic Acid

Attracts and retains moisture in your skin and joints. Great for that “plump” skin look and joint lubrication.

# 🦠 Probiotics (Lactobacillus Acidophilus)

Gut health is tied to everything — mood, immunity, skin, digestion. A smart addition for improving absorption and reducing bloating.

# 🌿 Vitamin C & Zinc

Both are critical for natural collagen synthesis. They help your body make better use of the collagen peptides you’re taking.

# 🧂 Electrolytes (Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium)

These support hydration, especially important if you're active or sweating often. Also help with digestion and nutrient uptake.

Bonus: It’s **gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free**, and has **zero sugar or artificial junk**.

# Taste and Mixability

I got the **unflavored version**, and honestly, it blends super easily into coffee, smoothies, or oatmeal. No gritty texture or weird aftertaste. If you’ve ever tried bad collagen before, you know how much of a win this is.

There’s also a **chocolate version** if you want to mix it with milk or almond milk — tastes kind of like light cocoa. Great for a post-workout shake.

# My 90-Day Experience with Prime Biome

Here’s how it went, broken down by month:

# Week 1–2

Not much changed right away, but my digestion felt a little better — less bloating after meals. My skin felt slightly softer but it could’ve been placebo at this stage.

# Week 3–4

This is when I started noticing subtle but real changes. My knees (which usually crack when I squat) were smoother. I was less sore after workouts. My skin started looking more even and hydrated — fewer dry patches.

# Month 2

Things continued to improve. My nails stopped breaking, my skin had a more “glowy” tone, and digestion felt more regular. I also felt more flexible during yoga/stretching.

# Month 3

Results really stacked here. My skin looked noticeably healthier — even friends commented. My joints felt looser and more mobile, especially in the morning. Even my hair looked shinier. It wasn’t dramatic like a commercial, but it was definitely noticeable.

# Real Benefits I Experienced

✅ **Smoother, Hydrated Skin**  
Less dryness, more glow. Especially around the eyes and cheeks — felt plumper and more elastic.

✅ **Improved Joint Comfort**  
I’m not an athlete, but I work out 4–5x/week. This helped reduce post-workout soreness and that stiff, achy feeling in the knees and shoulders.

✅ **Stronger Nails & Hair**  
My nails grew faster and didn’t break like they used to. Hair looked shinier and healthier.

✅ **Better Digestion**  
Way less bloating, better bathroom regularity (TMI but true), and less indigestion from heavier meals.

✅ **Faster Recovery**  
Less soreness after workouts, and I didn’t feel as “run down” the next day.

# Pros and Cons of Prime Biome

**Pros**

* Clean ingredients backed by real research
* Combines collagen + probiotics + vitamins (multi-targeted support)
* Great mixability — easy to add into daily routine
* Noticeable improvements over time (esp. skin and joints)
* Free from artificial flavors, dairy, soy, or gluten

**Cons**  
– Not cheap (\~$45/month)  
– Results take a few weeks (not instant)  
– Only available online (official website or Amazon)

# Who Should Try Prime Biome?

Based on my results and research, **Prime Biome** is ideal if you:

* Are 25+ and noticing joint stiffness or skin dullness
* Want to improve recovery, gut health, and aging from the inside out
* Struggle with bloating or digestion
* Are looking for a collagen product that actually *absorbs* and works

If you’re under 25 and expecting huge changes immediately, you might not notice much. But if you're starting to feel the early signs of aging or just want to stay ahead of the curve, Prime Biome is a great long-term wellness add-on.

# Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

In my opinion: **Yes, it’s totally worth it — if you’re consistent.**

It’s not a flashy stim or a “miracle cure,” but it *works* — slowly, steadily, and naturally. It supports your skin, joints, digestion, and overall recovery in a noticeable way. The longer I stayed on it, the more benefits I saw.

Brutally honest Post Mortem of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe","# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. 

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere. You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases.

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. 

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",35,1746377910.0,gamedev,6,0.84,False

See, I'm a widower. It's been well over a year since my wife died and when I think about her, I still cry. I was her primary caretaker for the last few years of her life (I helped her eat, bath, dress and even go to the bathroom). 

We were together for almost 24 years and I still miss her to death. But I'm **very** lonely. I'm falling apart and need to get out of the house and have some fun. I *still* feel like I'm cheating a little by trying to make a bumble account - as silly as that sounds.

I'm trying to keep it light and not as someone who's gonna talk about his late wife and cry. I'm gonna mark the profile as ""something casual"" or something along those lines. I don't want to give the impression that I'm gonna be their next husband.  I'm just looking for a lady friend(s) to go for coffee, lunch, dinner or whatever. 

I'm a middle aged dude, btw. I don't even know if Bumble is right for me. ",3,1746377687.0,Bumble,5,1.0,False
1keoi1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1keoi1w/uncover_if_the_elite_gourmet_single_serve_coffee/,Uncover if the Elite Gourmet Single Serve Coffee Maker EHC113M is worth your time review!,"The Elite Gourmet EHC113M Personal Single-Serve Compact Coffee Maker Brewer immediately caught my interest with its sleek and compact mint-colored design. I've been using it for over two weeks now, and it's become my go-to for a quick caffeine boost during both my early-morning rush and lazy weekend afternoons. While there are plenty of lovable things about this little coffee maker, not everything is perfect.

**Compact and Convenient Design**

The size of this coffee machine is one of its standout features. Measuring only 6.5 inches by 5 inches by 9.5 inches, it fit effortlessly onto my cramped countertop without making everything feel cluttered. Dorm rooms, office desks, or even small kitchen setups would benefit from its portable design. The mint color is a cute touch—my cousin even commented that it added a pop of personality to my kitchen. It’s lightweight, and I found it easy to tuck away in a cupboard when needed. Still, the build feels sturdy enough for daily use, which is crucial for something I rely on regularly.

**Good Points**

- Compact and lightweight design fits into small spaces.
- Stylish mint color adds charm to any kitchen decor.
- Durable and sturdy for everyday use.

**Fast Brewing Performance**

Speed matters in the morning, and this little machine delivers in under 60 seconds. Just add your favorite coffee grounds, press the button, and it chugs along efficiently to brew a 14-ounce cup. I used the accompanying reusable filter, which is a nice sustainable touch—no more hunting for paper filters or creating unnecessary waste. The one-touch operation is user-friendly, and for someone like me who’s usually half-asleep pre-coffee, this is a lifesaver. The temperature of the coffee was just right; no complaints of it being lukewarm or scalding hot. However, I noticed the brewing time could sometimes extend slightly beyond 60 seconds, particularly when I packed the filter a bit fuller than usual.

**Reusable Filter Makes a Difference**

Eliminating paper filters by including a removable and reusable one was a smart move. The filter is sturdy and easy to clean. I appreciated this eco-friendly choice, and I even tried it with loose-leaf tea—it worked surprisingly well! On some busy mornings though, cleaning the filter felt like a small chore I didn’t want to deal with. It’s dishwasher safe, so that’s helpful, though I usually gave it a quick rinse instead.

**Safety Features Provide Peace of Mind**

Safety measures are often overlooked in smaller appliances, but this machine includes an auto shut-off and thermal reset switch, protecting it from overheating. It’s a thoughtful feature, especially since I’m the kind of person who forgets I’ve left things running in my rush to leave for work. It’s small details like this that make it suitable for an absent-minded user or even a teenager brewing their first coffee.

**Negatives**

- Reusable filter requires frequent cleaning after each use.
- Brewing time may vary slightly based on the amount of grounds used.
- The travel mug doesn’t retain heat for particularly long periods.

**Included Travel Mug**

One of the best additions to this coffee maker is the 14-ounce stainless steel travel mug that fits snugly under the coffee dispenser. It’s not just convenient; it’s a rather clever design that eliminates messy spills. I took the mug along for school drop-offs and it slid easily into the car's cupholder. However, if you’re hoping for extended warmth, it’s not the most insulated mug out there. My coffee stayed hot for approximately 1.5 hours. After that, lukewarm coffee it was. But hey, for the daily coffee-on-the-go routine, it still does the job.

**Other Options**

While this coffee maker is stellar in many ways, it’s hard to ignore its competitors. Keurig’s smaller single-serve options like the K-Mini offer similar convenience but carry the flexibility of pod brewing for less clean-up. On the other hand, pod-based models lose out on sustainability since the reusable filter here reduces waste. Hamilton Beach also provides budget-friendly single-serve machines, but they lack the aesthetic appeal this model brings. If I were comparing, this machine might not have the extreme durability that I’ve seen in pricier Breville brands, but it definitely holds its own as a compact, stylish, and economic choice.

**Value Assessment**

For its feature set and usability, the price feels well-earned—especially for someone living in a small apartment or needing a casual coffee solution. While it might not boast all the bells and whistles of high-end espresso machines, it handles the basics flawlessly. If you’re okay with a few compromises, like manually cleaning the filter and slightly variable brew times, there’s a lot to love here.

Family and I (wife and two kids (8 and 10)) are traveling to Europe this summer and will be in London for a few nights.  Do folks have recommendations for family friendly restaurants that are akin to fine dining in London?  We'll take a cab or the tube - so we are not concerned about distance.  I had almost booked Gymkhana until I got to the last pop-up stated that they do not allow kids under 16 for dinner service.  We may still try to walk in to Gymkhana for lunch service depending on when our flight lands.  In terms of cuisine, we are flexible but want to avoid French, Modern French, African,  and anything one would consider off the beaten path.  Although both of our kids are well-behaved, one is very resistant to trying different foods.  So, that knocks out most of the Michelin-starred restaurants and those with age restrictions.  We are doing Quilon on one of the nights.  We will probably try Devine Restaurant & Coffee if we can make it there.  Dishoom is not an option (multiple familly members and friends have been underwhelmed).  Other things off the list include liver, sweet meat and calamari.  Thanks in advance.

Edit: Looking to avoid pubs and chains.  Maybe something like a local/mom-and-pop restaurant that is farm-to-table and may cater a little towards children.  Otherwise, looking for something that would serve as a nice sit-down dinner with some easy options for kids while we enjoy more adult food and beverages.  ",0,1746377489.0,uktravel,11,0.14,False
1keofbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1keofbr/why_choose_ispring_cua4_ultrafiltration_system/,Why Choose iSpring CU-A4 Ultrafiltration System Review for Clean Under-Sink Water?,"Testing water filtration systems has become a bit of a personal side project for me lately, especially because clean, great-tasting water is a non-negotiable in my home. The iSpring CU-A4 0.01μm Ultra-Filtration Under Sink Water Filter System has been the latest test subject on my kitchen sink, and I have to say, it’s been an impressive addition—though not without its quirks. Here’s a breakdown of my experience with this product, highlighting its features and any room for improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**

At first glance, the compact design of this under-sink water filtration system immediately stood out. It measures a manageable 10.63"" x 4.33"" x 12.6"", making it an ideal fit even for those with slightly cramped cabinetry. The tankless design is a game-changer, freeing up more storage space under the sink. Its brushed nickel faucet pairs cleanly with most kitchen aesthetics; in fact, it blends in so well with my countertop that it looked like it belonged from day one. 

The system is robust yet lightweight at just 2 kilograms and like most modern appliances, installation was straightforward thanks to the “push-to-connect” fittings. Everything needed for the install was in the box, and I appreciated the attention to detail here. However, while the plastic tubing is functional, it doesn’t quite exude premium quality. Over time, I’d keep an eye on its durability.

**Advantages**

- Includes a premium, rust-resistant brushed nickel faucet
- Compact tankless design saves significant kitchen space  
- Easy-to-install with push fittings and twist-on, twist-off filter cartridges  
- Manufactured to NSF/ANSI safety and water quality standards  

[Check iSpring CU-A4 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b009aejwzg/)

**Water Filtration Performance**

Performance-wise, the 4-stage filtration process is what gives this system its wow factor. It uses a PP Sediment Filter, Ultrafiltration membrane, KDF/GAC Filter, and Fine Activated Carbon Filter in succession. This combination effectively removes chlorine, lead, and other problematic contaminants while retaining healthy minerals. I’ve noticed a definite improvement in the taste and clarity of the water, and it’s a relief knowing impurities like hydrogen sulfide and heavy metals are being dealt with.

The 0.01-micron ultrafiltration membrane stood out for me. It’s a visible commitment to providing ultra-clean water—a must for fussy taste buds or if you’re prepping baby bottles like my sister does. What I didn’t fully realize until later is that this is not a Reverse Osmosis system, so it doesn’t reduce TDS (Total Dissolved Solids). If reducing TDS is crucial to you, this might be a limitation worth thinking about.

**Flexibility in Usage**

Versatility is where this product truly shines. I’ve connected it to the kitchen sink’s cold water line, but the flexibility doesn’t stop there. It seamlessly supports multiple uses, from filling up water for my fridge dispenser to making filtered coffee. I’ve even tried it with a portable tea kettle, and the improvement in flavor is noticeable. No wastewater is created during filtration, making it an environmentally kinder choice.

Despite being easy to set up and flexible, filter replacement could be a frequent task depending on the water quality in your area. The filters claim a lifespan of 6 to 12 months, but in regions with high water contaminants, the lower end of that range might be more realistic.

**Pluses**

- Removes harmful contaminants without stripping essential minerals  
- No wastewater during operation—a more eco-friendly solution  
- Compact and modular design for multiple setups  

**Negatives**

- Does not reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), unlike RO systems  
- Plastic tubing could use sturdier construction  
- Filter replacements might be too frequent for heavily polluted water sources  

**Competing Products**

Browsing the market for alternatives, the iSpring CU-A4 holds its own with the absence of a tank and eco-friendliness in filtration. Compared to a traditional Reverse Osmosis system like the APEC ROES-50, it stands out in terms of space-saving design and quicker installation. On the other hand, the APEC system offers TDS reduction, which could be more relevant for consumers seeking ultra-pure water. Another comparable option is the Waterdrop TSU system. While Waterdrop leads in sleek design, iSpring wins with its outperforming 0.01-micron ultrafiltration membrane, which seems a tad better at targeting finer particles. 

Still, every household is unique in its water quality, so knowing your priorities—whether it’s water clarity, mineral retention, or advanced purification—will guide the better choice.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

In terms of price performance, this product delivers incredible value for those who don’t require a Reverse Osmosis system but still want high-quality filtration. Its upfront cost aligns with mid-range filtration systems, and the individual replacement filters are reasonably priced. However, recurring expenses for filter replacements could add up if you have subpar municipal water. Comparing it to competing brands, the affordability paired with ease of maintenance makes it a popular choice among budget-conscious buyers. I’d call this a sensible investment unless TDS reduction is non-negotiable in your household.

50M, single, earning about £135K per year. I have worked for big US tech companies for more than 15 years, so I have had a high income consistently. I have always saved a significant part of my income (probably more than 50%) and little lifestyle creep. Living the same now as I was 10 years ago, apart from some more expensive travel/holidays.

Saved even more since Covid, as WFH 95% of the time, so no commute cost, having to buy lunch, coffees etc.

Pension:

* SIPP/work pension: £680K
* In a global index tracker and 10% bonds, low fee, around 0.15% per year all included
* Contributing the maximum per year (£60K, £5K per month). No unused past allowance. Employer contribution is around 11%, including employer NI saved from salary sacrifice
* Also have a defined benefit pension (raising with inflation) worth about £1,000 per month, from age 57
* Already qualify for probably 85% of the state pension age 67

ISA:

* £350K
* in global index tracker and 20% bonds (more in bonds than the pension, since likely to be used first). Low fee, around 0.13% all included
* Contributing the maximum per year (£20K), although I have kept in cash for now for the ISA opened in April this year

GIA/other investments (including a small portion of P2P loans and BTC): £156K

Cash (savings and Premium Bonds): £45K

Property: worth about £400K, mortgage paid

Car: owned, paid

No debt.

In term of living expenses:

* Minimum needed for bills/food/insurance/basic car maintenance/subscriptions etc.: around £1,200 per month
* Would ideally like to have up to £60K per year of RE income, so that I can do more expensive hobbies and travel the world in good conditions. Also need money for a new car at some point, house repairs etc.
* May also consider a private medical insurance (which I have always had through work)

Should I stop working soon, or is it worth doing a few more years to get more ""headspace""?

Ideally, I would move to part time (4 or 3 days per week) but not really possible in my job/offered by my employer. I can't really see myself doing another job/retraining.

Any optimisation I should do when it comes to preparing for RE?

1keoecv,https://v.redd.it/7jf00s5qgsye1,"Thinking of being confirmed or received? Here's a snapshot of what I experienced yesterday at St. Mark's Cathedral in Seattle, WA.","I've attended Christ Episcopal Church in Tacoma, WA for a little over a year. As an exvangelical with a long list of complaints about *the church*, it took me a very long time to work up enough courage to go into a church. I had been away from church for 8 years. Never planned on returning.

This next part may sound a little cheesy, but I am 100% sincere, and I know that others can relate!

It was like I had a void of meaning in my life that I just couldn't fill. I looked for meaning and fulfillment in many other places. No dice. I missed church. It took a long time to admit that to myself but that's what it was. The funny thing is that I missed church before I missed God.

I knew that if I ever tried going back to church, an Episcopal community would be my best option.

Christ Church in Tacoma has a facility with amazing brutalist architecture and the community of people was warm and welcoming without being pushy in any way. I took my time over the course of the year. I got to know people, met with the priest multiple times over coffee or beer, and established a couple of meaningful friendships.

I am still on my spiritual journey - always will be - and many days I still don't ""believe"" in all the core tenets of the faith, but the past year has been the most healing season I've ever been through.

I'm so happy to officially be a part of a local church where I can experience spiritual connection in sacred space, and don't have to compromise my values or intellectual honesty to be a member.",8,1746377401.0,Episcopalian,1,1.0,False
1keoe30,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCosmicWheelSister/comments/1keoe30/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest_customer/,MITOLYN Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"I’m not usually the type to write long supplement reviews, but after using **Mitolyn** daily for 90 days and seeing clear, consistent improvements in my energy, focus, and recovery — I felt like I owed it to the community to share a full breakdown.

If you’re like me, you’re probably researching this because you’ve seen **Mitolyn reviews** online or heard it mentioned in biohacking and wellness circles. Maybe you’re skeptical (I was too). So here’s my honest experience, the science behind it, and whether it’s worth trying.

# What Is Mitolyn?

**Mitolyn** is a **mitochondrial support supplement** that targets energy production at the cellular level. It’s not a stimulant. It’s not a pre-workout. It’s designed to help your body produce *natural, sustainable energy* by improving how your mitochondria function.

Mitochondria are the “powerhouses” of your cells. When they work well, you feel energized, mentally sharp, and resilient. When they’re sluggish, you feel drained, foggy, and moody. Mitolyn aims to help with that.

# Why I Started Taking Mitolyn

I’m in my early 30s, work remotely in tech, and I’m also into fitness. But over the last year, I started noticing:

* Low energy in the morning, even with 7–8 hours of sleep
* Midday brain fog that made it hard to focus
* Mood swings and occasional anxiety
* Poor recovery after workouts

I didn’t want to rely on more caffeine or quick fixes. I wanted something that would actually support my *baseline health and energy*. That’s when I came across Mitolyn.

After reading through several **Mitolyn supplement reviews**, including a few on Reddit, I saw that it wasn’t just hype — there was actual science behind the formula.

# Mitolyn Ingredients (And Why They Matter)

What impressed me is how targeted the ingredients are. Each one supports mitochondrial health and overall cellular performance:

* **CoQ10:** Critical for producing ATP (your body’s cellular fuel). Supports heart and brain health.
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** Stimulates new mitochondria formation — which means more energy capacity.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR):** Helps convert fat into energy, supports focus and memory.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA):** Antioxidant that protects cells and enhances energy metabolism.
* **Resveratrol:** Anti-aging, anti-inflammatory compound found in red wine. Supports brain and cardiovascular health.
* **Magnesium, B6, B12:** Essential vitamins and minerals for nervous system function and energy metabolism.

No artificial fillers, gluten, or unnecessary junk. It’s vegan and non-GMO too.

# My 90-Day Experience with Mitolyn

# Week 1–2:

The first two weeks were subtle. No jitters, no crashes — just a slight increase in alertness. I noticed I wasn’t reaching for my second cup of coffee as early as usual. Sleep quality improved a bit too.

# Week 3–4:

I began waking up earlier, naturally. My focus during deep work blocks was sharper. I was remembering things better, and I had fewer of those “blank moments” mid-sentence. Workouts felt easier to push through, and I didn’t feel totally drained after.

# Month 2:

This is where Mitolyn started to shine. I wasn’t feeling just “less tired” — I felt genuinely energized. I was working longer without burnout, handling stress better, and had more motivation to get things done — not just work, but life in general.

# Month 3:

By this point, Mitolyn had become part of my daily routine. I had consistent energy from morning until late evening, better mental stamina during meetings or creative work, and improved performance at the gym. My mood swings were noticeably reduced, and I felt mentally “lighter.”

# What Changed for Me After 90 Days

✅ **Consistent, Natural Energy** – No more relying on caffeine for that midday “kick.” I feel fueled from within.  
✅ **Clearer Thinking** – Improved focus, faster memory recall, and better attention span.  
✅ **Better Mood** – I’m noticeably calmer and more emotionally balanced.  
✅ **Improved Recovery** – I recover faster from workouts and don’t feel as sore or depleted.  
✅ **Deeper Sleep** – I fall asleep faster and wake up feeling more refreshed.

Mitolyn doesn’t hit you like an energy drink. It *restores* energy. That’s a big difference.

# Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

**✅ Pros:**

* Clean, science-backed formula
* No stimulants, jitters, or crashes
* Energy and focus build gradually over time
* Gluten-free, vegan, and made in the USA
* Helps improve both physical and mental performance

**❌ Cons:**

* Not cheap (\~$50/month)
* Takes a couple weeks to feel the full effects
* Only available online (I bought from their official website)

# Who Should Try Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a great fit if:

* You deal with **chronic fatigue**, brain fog, or poor focus
* You want a **long-term solution** instead of stimulants
* You’re into **longevity, biohacking**, or general wellness
* You’re active and want better **workout recovery**
* You care about **mitochondrial health** and real energy production

If you're looking for a quick boost like a pre-workout or energy drink, this isn’t that. It’s for people who want to feel better *every day*, not just for an hour.

# Final Verdict: Is Mitolyn Worth It?

**Yes — 100% worth it for me.**

After 90 days, I can say with confidence that Mitolyn delivered on its promises. It didn’t just *mask* symptoms of low energy — it addressed the root causes by supporting my body’s own energy systems.

I feel more clear-headed, productive, and balanced than I have in a long time. It’s not hype — it’s smart supplementation.",1,1746377380.0,TheCosmicWheelSister,1,1.0,False

      For context, I, (22F) and my partner, (23M) have been living together for around two months now as I recently had a surgery. Things have been kind of rough for months leading up to it & they aren’t improved by the situation so I’m worried I might just be aggravated by the proximity and being an AH for no real reason. 
    Night before last, we were sitting on the couch and he reached across me to grab something off of the coffee table and I was hit with some crazy BO, so I asked him if he had showered yet (he worked all day Friday & had only been home for a few hours) and he told me he hadn’t and wasn’t planning on it. I let him know that he should probably think about it since I could smell him and he got up and put deodorant on. Did not shower.
       Last night I got back to his apartment after spending the day with a friend of mine at a street festival. I was showing him some of the things that I bought while out, and everything was okay until I mentioned that I was going to go ahead and hop in the shower. He told me that he wasn’t interested in getting in and I asked if he had showered that day already, since he hadn’t the night before. He said no & I suggested he get in since I could smell him the night before on the couch. He got defensive and told me that it wasn’t my place to be asking him to shower & that I shouldn’t be doing that. It just seemed to really piss him off, and I told him that I didn’t really think I was wrong for asking my partner to keep up basic hygiene and to shower once in 48 hours. He told me I was being rude and from there, it just escalated into a huge fight. Am I asking too much/ am I the asshole?

I was just in europe and would have to order an americano, there they seemed to give them in much smaller cups. I found it quite strong but really liked it, here in canada they use more water I assume. 

I really enjoyed the stronger coffee. If i wanted that here should i order a small and just say maybe double the water to espresso? Or typically are the amounts of espresso sized with the order you make? So small = 1 shot, medium = 2 shots etc.",4,1746377311.0,barista,5,1.0,False

The last time my fasting glucose was taken was about 2 years ago where it was 90 mg/dL, so it's safe to say that I have been prediabetic for about possibly a year now (maybe even 2). Even half a slice of cheesecake will make me feel like literal garbage the next day nowadays.

  
My goal of course is to ELIMINATE this prediabetes (remission is not enough) and put my body back to default settings where I *could* go back to eating the same food that got me here (obviously not in the quantities and frequency that got me here) but without having to freak out about abnormal glucose spikes as if my health is on the line.

I have developed a plan to minimize the amount of carbs ingested and to build as much muscle mass as possible along with partaking in intermittent fasting. 2 meals a day, both followed by a post-meal walk. This is something I plan on doing for a minimum of 3-4 months plus longer if needed.

*  Breakfast 9am: Black coffee along with either avocado toast (w/ keto bread) or a 3-egged omelet (alternating every other day) along with a handful of almonds/walnuts.
*  1 or 2pm: Either a light jog or weight training (alternating every other day) 6 days a week.
* 3pm: Green tea.
*  Dinner 5pm: This can consist of bean chili with chicken or spinach/okra with roti (a flat bread made of whole wheat flour, which I'm iffy on including). I'm still trying to figure this one out. Maybe I'll throw in some salmon.

I somehow need to incorporate cinnamon in there (either in the form of capsules or just put it in my coffee). I will preclude fruit from this diet unless I have a *really* bad craving for something sweet which should not happen too often.

I would appreciate your thoughts/opinions on this and if it's good, how long should I do this for to confidently undo the insulin resistance that my body has built up? If there is anything else to add, I would appreciate that too!",1,1746377287.0,prediabetes,1,1.0,False

I don't think I struggle too much with social cues.   That said, I sometimes don't pick up on polite euphemisms, which may be tied into my trouble with directions.

NVLD has made for awkward social situations not just because of the aforementioned social cues, but because of my visual-motor difficulties. Can anyone relate? Anyone have advice?

1. Sometimes when eating with people, I'm messy with food and drinks. I won't realize a glass is close to the edge of the table, I'm reaching way too far to get food from a platter, etc. Family members occasionally try to help by correcting/warning me, which is embarrassing, even though it's only when necessary. (I'd be even more upset if they let me spill wine on white carpet.)

One time,  I spilled coffee all over myself during a business lunch. Luckily, the woman I was meeting with was nice about it. It really doesn't help that coffee places fill drinks RIGHT up to the brim, and I don't always put lids on very tightly.

What went wrong, and which decisions are we happy with to this day? Learn from our mistakes - Post Mortem of We. The Refugees","# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",3,1746377275.0,GameWritingLab,0,1.0,False

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda.

However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",2,1746377254.0,Solo_Roleplaying,0,1.0,False

What went wrong and what would we have done differently? Which decisions are we still happy with today? The Case of We. The Refugees","# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",3,1746377228.0,narrativedesign,0,1.0,False

So, life throws you lemons, right? A daily dose,

Like stepping on LEGOs with bare toes.

Your coffee spills, your Wi-Fi's a mess,

Your patience dwindles, causing much stress.

Your boss sends an email, late on a Friday,

My weekend is ruined! your brain wants to say.

Your trousers rip, right down the backside,

You feel the urge to just run and hide.

The image suggested, quite wise and profound,

Control your reaction, keep feet on the ground.

It's key to your happiness, all that you chase,

A calm, collected, utterly serene face.

But my face? Oh dear! It goes red like a beet,

My internal monologue is far from sweet.

A stubbed toe? A yell! That could wake up the dead,

A traffic jam? Grumbles fill up my head!

Someone takes my parking spot? Oh the humanity!

My reaction goes from zero to pure insanity.

My carefully planned dinner goes utterly wrong?

I might just weep loudly, singing a sad song.

This 'controlling response,' it sounds rather grand,

Like holding a wild tiger within your own hand.

My tiger's a toddler, quite easily vexed,

By minor inconveniences, severely perplexed.

But wait! A small thought begins to arise,

Perhaps raging wildly isn't that wise.

It doesn't fix coffee, or mend the torn seam,

It just makes you feel like a hot, angry stream.

So next time a minor catastrophe's near,

Before I unleash my internal fear,

I'll try to remember, though it feels strange and new,

Just breathe... maybe count... and not turn bright blue.

It won't be perfect, I'll likely still sigh,

Or mutter just slightly beneath a wry eye.

But less fiery explosions, less dramatic falls,

Might mean more happiness, answering life's calls.

So here's to us humans, imperfect and bold,

Whose reactions are sometimes quite a sight to behold.

Let's practice some calm, though it feels like a quest,

And give our poor, palpitating hearts a nice rest!

# 🧬 What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a **mitochondrial support supplement**. Your mitochondria are essentially the “powerhouses” of your cells, responsible for producing ATP — the energy currency of the body.

When your mitochondria slow down, you feel it: fatigue, brain fog, poor recovery, and low motivation. MITOLYN’s formula is designed to **optimize cellular energy production**, support brain health, and promote overall vitality.

It’s not a stimulant. It doesn’t “pep you up” short-term. It works from the inside out to restore natural energy — and that’s exactly what I was looking for.

# 🧪 What’s in MITOLYN?

One of the first things that impressed me was the formula. It’s not just thrown together — every ingredient plays a role in mitochondrial health:

* **CoQ10**: Crucial for ATP production. It helps cells use oxygen more efficiently and is known for heart and brain benefits.
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**: Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis — the creation of new mitochondria. Think of it as giving your cells more engines.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)**: A nootropic and mitochondrial booster that helps convert fat into usable energy. Also supports mood and focus.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**: Powerful antioxidant that regenerates other antioxidants and supports metabolism.
* **Resveratrol**: Found in red wine, it helps with inflammation and cellular health.
* **Magnesium, B6, B12**: Core nutrients that support nerve function, energy metabolism, and brain performance.

Everything is well-dosed (not fairy dusted), non-GMO, and free from junk fillers. The label’s clean and transparent — always a good sign.

# 🔍 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I'm in my early 30s, work a high-stress job, and was feeling *tired all the time* despite getting 7–8 hours of sleep. I wasn’t looking for a quick caffeine hit — I wanted something that helped me bounce back naturally.

After reading MITOLYN reviews and researching the science behind mitochondrial health, I figured I’d give it a real 90-day trial.

# 🗓️ My 90-Day MITOLYN Experience (Week by Week)

**Week 1–2:**  
Not much happened at first. No “kick.” But I didn’t feel worse either, and I appreciated that there were zero side effects. My sleep quality started improving slightly.

**Week 3–4:**  
This is where I started noticing changes. My focus during work was sharper, and I had fewer afternoon slumps. I was waking up more refreshed and didn’t need my second cup of coffee.

**Month 2:**  
Huge progress. I was getting through the day with stable energy, no more 3pm brain fog, and better recovery after workouts. My mood was also more stable — less reactive, more “even.”

**Month 3:**  
At this point, MITOLYN felt like it was running in the background, powering everything. I didn’t feel hyped — just *clear*. Focus, memory recall, and motivation were all consistently better than before. I was sleeping deeper and actually waking up without dragging.

# ✅ Results I Noticed

After 90 days, here’s what improved for me:

* **Energy**: Stable, all-day energy without the caffeine rollercoaster.
* **Mental clarity**: Easier to focus, multitask, and stay productive.
* **Mood**: More resilient and less anxious, especially under stress.
* **Workout performance**: Faster recovery and more motivation to exercise.
* **Sleep**: Deeper sleep and less grogginess in the morning.
* **Caffeine reduction**: I went from 3 coffees to 1 without feeling it.

# 👍 Pros and 👎 Cons

**Pros**  
✅ Science-backed ingredients at proper doses  
✅ No stimulants, crashes, or dependency  
✅ Gradual, real improvements in mental/physical performance  
✅ Transparent label — no proprietary blends  
✅ Gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO

**Cons**  
❌ Doesn’t work instantly — takes 2–4 weeks to notice  
❌ Not cheap (\~$50/month)  
❌ Only available online (official site, Amazon)

# 🧠 Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I’d recommend MITOLYN to anyone who:

* Feels chronically low energy despite sleeping
* Wants to reduce brain fog and boost productivity
* Works in a mentally demanding job
* Struggles with workout recovery
* Wants long-term cellular health, not just a quick fix

It’s especially useful if you’re 30+ and starting to feel like you’re not recovering as quickly — mentally or physically — as you used to.

# ⭐ Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

**Absolutely.**

It’s rare to find a supplement that delivers slow, steady, *real* benefits without side effects, but MITOLYN does. It’s not a miracle pill — you won’t feel superhuman overnight. But if you’re consistent, you’ll start to notice real changes in how you think, move, and recover.

After 90 days, I’m more productive, less foggy, and not reliant on caffeine like before. It’s now a permanent part of my supplement stack.

If you’re serious about *long-term energy and cognitive support*, MITOLYN is 100% worth a try.

# 🔍 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I'm in my early 30s, work a high-stress job, and was feeling *tired all the time* despite getting 7–8 hours of sleep. I wasn’t looking for a quick caffeine hit — I wanted something that helped me bounce back naturally.

After reading MITOLYN reviews and researching the science behind mitochondrial health, I figured I’d give it a real 90-day trial.

# 🗓️ My 90-Day MITOLYN Experience (Week by Week)

**Week 1–2:**  
Not much happened at first. No “kick.” But I didn’t feel worse either, and I appreciated that there were zero side effects. My sleep quality started improving slightly.

**Week 3–4:**  
This is where I started noticing changes. My focus during work was sharper, and I had fewer afternoon slumps. I was waking up more refreshed and didn’t need my second cup of coffee.

**Month 2:**  
Huge progress. I was getting through the day with stable energy, no more 3pm brain fog, and better recovery after workouts. My mood was also more stable — less reactive, more “even.”

**Month 3:**  
At this point, MITOLYN felt like it was running in the background, powering everything. I didn’t feel hyped — just *clear*. Focus, memory recall, and motivation were all consistently better than before. I was sleeping deeper and actually waking up without dragging.

# ✅ Results I Noticed

After 90 days, here’s what improved for me:

* **Energy**: Stable, all-day energy without the caffeine rollercoaster.
* **Mental clarity**: Easier to focus, multitask, and stay productive.
* **Mood**: More resilient and less anxious, especially under stress.
* **Workout performance**: Faster recovery and more motivation to exercise.
* **Sleep**: Deeper sleep and less grogginess in the morning.
* **Caffeine reduction**: I went from 3 coffees to 1 without feeling it.

# 👍 Pros and 👎 Cons

**Pros**  
✅ Science-backed ingredients at proper doses  
✅ No stimulants, crashes, or dependency  
✅ Gradual, real improvements in mental/physical performance  
✅ Transparent label — no proprietary blends  
✅ Gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO

**Cons**  
❌ Doesn’t work instantly — takes 2–4 weeks to notice  
❌ Not cheap (\~$50/month)  
❌ Only available online (official site, Amazon)

# 🧠 Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I’d recommend MITOLYN to anyone who:

* Feels chronically low energy despite sleeping
* Wants to reduce brain fog and boost productivity
* Works in a mentally demanding job
* Struggles with workout recovery
* Wants long-term cellular health, not just a quick fix

It’s especially useful if you’re 30+ and starting to feel like you’re not recovering as quickly — mentally or physically — as you used to.

# ⭐ Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

**Absolutely.**

It’s rare to find a supplement that delivers slow, steady, *real* benefits without side effects, but MITOLYN does. It’s not a miracle pill — you won’t feel superhuman overnight. But if you’re consistent, you’ll start to notice real changes in how you think, move, and recover.

After 90 days, I’m more productive, less foggy, and not reliant on caffeine like before. It’s now a permanent part of my supplement stack.

If you’re serious about *long-term energy and cognitive support*, MITOLYN is 100% worth a try.",1,1746377157.0,TheCosmicWheelSister,1,1.0,False

Honest Post Mortem of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe (warning: it's a long read!)","# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",5,1746377140.0,IndieDev,3,0.73,False

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfspeed\_stonk/comments/1k17qpp/hodl\_strategy\_for\_the\_win\_i\_feel\_it\_is\_time\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfspeed_stonk/comments/1k17qpp/hodl_strategy_for_the_win_i_feel_it_is_time_to/)

I am also going to reiterate that if this thing goes live, I will immediately begin deleting ALL posts that are irrelevant. We will all be worked up but feel free to use the “Daily Thread” to voice your enthusiasm and reserve the main thread for MAJOR announcements. At the end of the trading session, we can reconvene and share thoughts. I won’t delete everything, but I will try to have some degree of control over what we will need to filter through.

I have said that I will make my best effort to post here (time permitting), but believe me, in the heat of battle, you might find yourselves on your own. Try to have your own plans in place so you do not need to rely on others to help you make decisions.

Regarding last Friday, I think we already started to see some of “their” reactions. I made this post a couple of days ago and I would encourage you to go back and re-read this one as well. They can use virtually ANY reason to start rejecting our orders and all they have to do is call them “Disruptive Trading Practices).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfspeed\_stonk/comments/1kaj7kb/i\_think\_we\_need\_to\_talk\_about\_disruptive\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfspeed_stonk/comments/1kaj7kb/i_think_we_need_to_talk_about_disruptive_trading/)

I had TWO of these on Friday. One on the Buy side, and then Exercising on a contract:

https://preview.redd.it/i0ik42svmsye1.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=580f4e05373e7f75bd27a548ceaac42a50d0875e

1)      Look at the VERY first order at the bottom of that screen grab. I submitted a “limit” order for 500 contracts. That order did not fill instantly so I IMMEDIATELY cancelled that order and re-submitted it as a Market order and it immediately filled. Remember from the post I linked above, they are NOT going to fill your Limit orders. When everyone is submitting at “Market”, the MM gets to keep the entire spread. When this thing goes live, you had better take my advice and set your “defaults” to fill at the Market prices or you are going to be a spectator all day!

2)      I also submitted an order for 50 CALLS. I don’t generally buy 50 CALLS at a time. I had already filled two orders for 100 CALLS each, and one order for 500 that all filled without a problem but this 50 CALL order was only partially filled. They filled 20 and I had to go in with a second order to fill the remaining 30. This could be “normal” under “normal” trading conditions, but my point here is to make sure that you are watching your fills and if something doesn’t fill correctly, you MUST be prepared to IMMEDIATELY re-submit your orders. A missed-fill, or a partial-fill could cost you tens-of-thousands, or maybe even HUNDREDS-OF-THOUSANDS of dollars as we get further into this thing…..and I’m not joking. I’m going to post my “Ladder” strategy for you in a couple of hours.

3)      The 50 contracts above (at the $4.5 strike) for me was just a trade thinking we were going to see a surge in buying into the close (I thought the guys in the white hats might start exercising those 120,000 contracts – 12 million shares – on Friday afternoon.) I was not really planning to exercise MY trade, I just wanted to jump in, and then duck out…but “someone” REALLY did not want to deliver those 12 million shares on Friday afternoon so they came in HARD to crush this thing down under $4.5. As the stock price was nearing $4.5 (it was at $4.55 when I submitted my order to exercise.) I was prepared to take possession of 5,000 shares if I exercised. They did NOT fill my order and it took about 5 – 10 minutes for the price to drop from $4.55 down below $4.5. Those BASTARDS intentionally did not fill my order because they did NOT want to deliver MY shares either. I was watching someone else in the comments who had the same problem, but here was the difference between our two trades (he did not fill). Once the stock dropped below $4.5, Schwab kicked out 100% of EVERY order to exercise. They didn’t just “not fill” the orders. They DELETED every single order in the queue. And here is their verbiage: “REJECTED: This is an out-of-the-money contract – please give us a call.”

Yes, they were correct. It WAS an out of the money Contract…..because they MADE it an out of the money contract. Once the stock price went below $4.5 they deleted EVERY order from the queue so I immediately queued up my next order waiting for the stock price to creep back above $4.5 and because u/deeepwaterz was single handedly holding up the entire Market on Friday (I owe you a beer Brother), I had a couple of other opportunities to re-submit my order to exercise. I re-submitted my order as the stock was teetering on $4.5 and Schwab rejected my second order to exercise because as I hit “send” on my second order, the stock dropped to something like $4.4901. So, I queued up my third order and just as u/deepwaterz submitted his order for another 10,924 shares, when I submitted my third order, I was the FIRST order in the queue and my order to exercise filled at EXACTLY $4.5. You can look at the time stamps on the orders to see how long this entire process took.

My point is that if you submit your order and then get up to go to the bathroom or to get a cup of coffee, you should expect to lose $5,000  - $10,000 per trade. You MUST be prepared to submit, and re-submit your orders. And if they do not fill, lower the size of your order. But keep trying. THIS IS A FULLY AUTOMATED ORDER SYSTEM. If it does not fill IMMEDIATELY with one of the Market Makers, it is immediately routed to another MM. This is nearly an INSTANT process and if your order does not fill instantly, CANX it and re-submit it. My order to exercise FILLED. The other Gentleman’s order did NOT fill. Schwab can legally CANX your order(s) and you do not have any recourse. Regardless of how much money it costs you. Schwab can just say that they were “trying to protect your best interests”. They give you a phone number to call them, and they will put that order in FOR you. Well guess what? In the heat of battle, you will NOT have time to stop what you are doing to give your Broker a phone call. You may not have time to get up to go to the bathroom. The system is AUTOMATED. Keep submitting until you get your fill.

There are a couple of other “dumb” housekeeping rules that I would encourage you to undertake each morning before the market opens. Take a few minutes to shut down your computer and re-boot it. I know this sounds dumb, but as the memory on your computers fill up, you could see some slow-down in your computing power.

If you do not have a backup power source for your computer (and internet), you might want to consider it. If you had a power outage at the absolutely wrong minute of your lives, it could cost you a LOT of money….if your plan is to “trade” this thing aggressively. If you are someone who travels for a living, be prepared to find your closest coffee shop. Call your boss and tell them you have car problems, or an upset stomach. I would have fired you if I caught you doing that, but it may not matter if you make $50 million dollars.

My point is to make sure you have a plan in place because if you can get everything right, this thing could provide you with life-changing money. Get it wrong, and you will definitely be disappointed with yourselves.

If you have any more ideas, post them in the comments. If we are all working together, we stand to make a LOT of money together. Also let us know what “obstacles” they threw at YOU on Friday.

1keo9i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/1keo9i9/magnesium/,Magnesium,"I am finding massive cognitive changes when I heavily dose on magnesium supplements. I can go from snippy to smiling very quickly, but let me explain.

I have been putting magnesium citrate into my homemade electrolyte drink, among other salts, because I get cramps so easily. But I have had trouble getting the proportions right. I ran out, and finally just made a lemonade with a gram or so of the magnesium in alone, to help with some Charlie horses. My whole body felt tingles, my muscles kept twitching involuntarily and then releasing like I'd had a massage. It made me very sleepy, too. The cramps evaporated, and my mood elevated amazingly, though I became drowsy. I have always tried to keep the salts in proportion, because I have heard that imbalances can be very unhealthy. But now I suspect I have a chronic magnesium deficit, which seems a pretty common problem.

I have had my electrolyte levels tested several times, because cramping is a serious problem for me, but they always show normal. Doctors have only blown my complaints off and said nothing is wrong with me. And yet, after any serious exercise I can become completely debilitated by massively painful full body cramps, like a Charlie horse in my whole body. I can't straighten or bend without causing the cramps to shift to different muscle groups. It's all I can do to get to some pickle juice and then put Gatorade or similar in my body and hope it helps. It takes electrolytes and about an hour for the cramping to go away. And it hurts bad enough to make me stand very still and cry in the meantime -- a truly horrible thing to wake up to in the middle of the night.

Plus I have always had anger issues, too. There are good reasons, which I have gone into elsewhere, but I don't want to compound this discussion. The magnesium seems to have real effect on my anger management as well. There are visual changes, too, as if I had gotten high or something, colors become less gaudy but also more vibrant, and it's as if details are clearer somehow. I don't know how much is psychosomatic and how much is a real cognitive effect, but I go from grumpy to whistling in no time. With constant goosebumps and body shivers.

I'm assuming I have a massive cellular deficit of magnesium that doesn't show up in blood serum. According to the internet, supplementing daily will eventually build the supply back up, but it could take as much as a year if the deficit is substantial. There is a headachy feeling when I take too much, but it goes away if I take a calcium supplement or just a cheap antacid tablet.

My question is about the anger, though. Is this actually having a mediating effect or am I reaching? It seems to make me feel substantially better, less angry, and it feels like stress relief. But is it just a drug-like effect? Or a placebo, psychologically? Am I masking anger or is there a known effect here? My anger issues are pernicious and ongoing, as my situation cannot change and I have reason to feel my anger continually renewed. But magnesium now seems to greatly help. I just don't want to set myself up for false expectations, thinking my attitude can be improved by simple supplementation if that isn't so.

So far, I am definitely finding that increasing my magnesium intake helps, as a supplement seems to stop acute anger attacks and helps with dehydration, which also seems to lead to a poorer disposition in myself. Is this real? It really feels like taking drugs, the effect is so immediate. It's been a few weeks now, and I definitely find my attitude crashes after coffee or pop or alcohol, but seems to get right back on track with just a magnesium supplement. I don't get so sleepy anymore, but the goosebumps and muscle twitching still happens. My flexibility is returning and I only get cramps in my hands sometimes now, though those go away after supplements, too.

Is there a massive cognitive role for magnesium? I know about the muscle channels and the magnesium/calcium nerve cascades to fire muscles. But are there synaptic uses for magnesium, maybe? Or other cerebral systems that may be misbehaving? I had a crying jag the other day, for no apparent reason, just out of the blue while watching TV. It was very cathartic, but had no connection to anything. I'm wondering if my brain is readjusting to a new chemical balance. Would magnesium actually have such an effect?

There are a number of things that might have impaired my ability to uptake magnesium, and honestly it seems like my body flushes it out more quickly than I absorb it. I can definitely feel a difference when I have my morning coffee now, and a supplement in midmorning helps my mood from crashing. It all seems too easy and very unlike anything I have ever read about. Obviously magnesium supplements cannot be a panacea for anger issues, yet it seems a major component that has gone overlooked in me. But I don't really know. Is this possible or am I conflating something else?",4,1746377056.0,Anger,0,1.0,False
1keo8yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1keo8yd/two_years_since_the_premiere_of_our_debut_game/,Two years since the premiere of our debut game. What went wrong and what worked? Postem Mortem of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe (critical project analysis and data sharing),"# Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead.

The Refugees*).

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",2,1746376954.0,IndieGaming,1,1.0,False

It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message.

Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",2,1746376921.0,politicalgames,0,1.0,False

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda.

Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance.

All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",1,1746376900.0,StoryRichGames,0,1.0,False

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.*

* **A Static, Uninviting Prologue**

The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.

Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:

*The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.*

* **No Saving Option**

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.

We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.

This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for *We. The Refugees*, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for *Venus Rave* — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in *We. The Refugees*). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.",1,1746376887.0,gamebooks,0,1.0,False

When we started working on [We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/), we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.

This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.

Let’s start at the beginning.

# The Origins of the Game

The idea behind *We. The Refugees* goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on *The Witcher 3* at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by *This War of Mine* from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called ""meaningful game."" All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. 

At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.

That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the [documentary film ](https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm)showcasing our development and creative process.

But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of *We. The Refugees*. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.

# Budget and Production

The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the *We. The Refugees* video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.

The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:

First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The *Witcher 3*’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.

Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.

We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:

*Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.*

Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.

We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.

# Marketing and Wishlists

For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.

Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. You can see that spike here - it’s the biggest one:

https://preview.redd.it/xbntaknhgjye1.jpg?width=1095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae8539ab26f571cb32b341af6c4b13771c588d9

From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.

That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere.

https://preview.redd.it/9ylqyrwigjye1.jpg?width=1265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6b504f540f2be9ca746c3b988ba5f9ec97b230

You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases:

https://preview.redd.it/9wrm1w2mgjye1.jpg?width=1243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b16029f3948a06d6b0e0c61cba9d226331b6e6

It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. 

Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.

After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. Here are our actual wishlist stats:

https://preview.redd.it/z6mfgzipgjye1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d0bd63c7471e5b3354f50246eb0d073139db8c

During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.

# Sales

Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.

https://preview.redd.it/bbhzxzltgjye1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53bc40d9b2bf6757bef350199926e8d5b484881a

China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaspbvgjye1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f82551334205a9ef2a6b74f41bba86a3a5c67329

Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.

We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you'd expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.

Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.

# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

* **No Map or True Exploration**

*We. The Refugees* is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.

* **Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading**

Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn't have overlooked them.

* **Personality Traits with No Real Impact**

The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.

* **Mispositioned Pitch**

From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.

Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.

* **A Problematic Protagonist**

We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.

The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily.

The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.

* **Late and Weak Marketing**

We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:

*Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.*

**Final Thoughts on Mistakes**

If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.

Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.

# Closing Thoughts

Two years after launch, we’re proud of how [We. The Refugees](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/) has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals.

1keo5a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1keo5a7/i_sucked_at_socializing_and_conversation_for/,"I sucked at socializing and conversation for years. So I built a complete step-by-step guide on how to be better at socializing, connecting, and being more interesting","Here is a conversation guide for those who struggle with talking to people. It is made easier to remember using acronyms and a format that I made based off of the EMT patient assessment style.

**Scene size-up:** determines how you react to the scenario

**ENAME**

**Environment**: where are you and what is the appropriate approach for socializing

**Number of people**: how many people are there and how many do you expect to speak to

**Additional**: are you with anyone you know or surrounded by people you don’t know

**Mechanism of socializing**: should you be formal or casual

**Exit**: should you stay or leave the situation

**General impression:** determines how the person reacts or feels about you

**ARDI:** ranking of the individual’s **genuineness & interest(G&I)** in you

**Approaches**: person approaches and engages in conversation & talks to you first

**Reciprocates**: you approach the person and they show visible interest, smiles, responds with longer answers

**Dismissive**: you approach, they answer dryly without asking about you. They give short answers. Little emotion or smiling. They appear uninterested in you and make little openings for you to continue the conversation

**Ignores**: They do not acknowledge you or try to make conversation.

If A / R, continue the conversation. G&I = 1/2 *means Genuinely interested rank 1 or 2*

If D / I, avoid attempting further conversation unless they later on seem interested in you. Politely excuse yourself from talking with them. Don’t completely ignore them, just respect their privacy and avoid prying them rather than taking it personally. You may end up vibing with them later. G&I = 3/4 *rank 3 or 4*

*G&I < 3 continue, G&I > 3 stop*

One time there was a girl who would be dry and dismissive to me in class, but only approach to talk to me if she needed help or if I got a good score on an exam. This is an example of oscillating G&I, so be careful about fake bitches like these.

Tip: G&I can sometimes be confusing, some people are dismissive first then approach, or approach first then become dismissive or even ignore. Observe how often they do each and base it off of that. Sometimes it has to do with what they think of you later on, if you offended them, or if they are just a fake bitch like that. 

**Primary assessment - Connection establishment**

**EASER:** Cycled Conversation Building & Techniques: 

**Establish** presence & warmth: open relaxed confident body language with appropriate eye contact; have a kind, positive, or neutral expression, keep your voice steady, smooth, warm, and calm. Say their name, builds trust

**Ask** easy entry, light ego boosting questions; ask about their skills, make them feel competent, respected, smart, special; don’t overglaze, just make them feel good around you

**Show** active listening; nod, mirror their emotions lightly, repeat key words, echo validation

**Encourage** with empathy & light self disclosure; mention that you respect what they said, or something about them; tell them how you genuinely feel about what they said and be humble

**Re engage** with a loop back question; ask about something their shared, continue digging about it

Tip: avoid overdoing any of these, read the room and do this steadily, you’ll get better at it with practice

**FLEW**: Alternative conversation builder

**Follow**: respond to what they say instead of changing topics too soon or seeming uninterested in what they said

**Listen**: be present, listen and understand what they said instead of focusing on what to say next

**Echo**: repeat keyword, add something about what they said, offer something relatable or connective about their experience

**Weave**: introduce slight topic shifts smoothly, say how the current topic reminds you of something else

**BOND:** Connecting deeper & making friends

**Balance**: share about yourself, but don’t dominate or overshare in the conversation

**Openness**: show slight vulnerability, make them feel less tense or intimidated around you

**Novelty**: suggest doing something together, coffee, studying, or event

**Depth**: gradually move from surface topics like hobbies/studies to deeper ones like values/goals

Tip: for novelty, recognize the mood and read the room, make sure they are clearly interested in you as well and want to be friends with you as well. Refer back to general impression, if they are often more approachable rather than just reciprocating or dismissive, it is likely they will want to do stuff with you.

Don’t overdo openness with a person not that close to you, being too vulnerable and sharing your biggest embarrassments will make them think low of you and may weird them out.

For conversation: **EASER/FLEW → BOND**

Primary assessment tip: For most conversations and socializing scenarios, primary assessment is the most important and should be prioritized first, because showing your interest in them will facilitate their interest in you. 

**Secondary assessment - Self Introduction**

**SPARK**

**Stories**: answer questions with mini stories and anecdotes, be creative, use appropriate and moderate humor

**Personality**: show your quirks, preferences, opinions, unique perspectives, demonstrates how you are different

**Amusement**: add your humor style, be witty but not try hard or overdoing it, light sarcasm, self aware humor, moderately mild self deprecation jokes work well

**Relatability**: say things that make people agree with you or have similar experiences with, use common experiences or feelings like anxiety, procrastination, stress, pet peeves, irritations, things you hate

**Kick**: end with a hook or twist, make your answer memorable, give a creative answer to a boring answer. Ask a follow up question to the other person, regarding their experience 

Secondary assessment tip: secondary assessment becomes important when a person first approaches you and some starts asking about you, showing interest. It’s important to be entertaining, relatable, and authentic. Especially for scenarios that are dependent on the person getting to know you, being appealing with your personality becomes more important. Secondary assessment is significantly more difficult than primary because it is unpredictable since you are not in control of the questions, requiring improvisation and thinking on the spot. It requires tons of practice to master. Remain calm, remember your practice, and think before answering.

Best way to practice for secondary assessment is to prepare, practice, and recite premade responses for common questions people might ask you. Set up interesting or funny stories to tell, things to say about yourself, what you do, things that get people hooked. 

**Bonus tips, research, evidence, & science that make people like/trust you**

**Reciprocity & disclosure**: open up a little bit to encourage others to open up a little bit more about themselves, because they only talk about themselves deeply if they trust you

* If you never say anything about yourself and just ask questions then they won’t trust you

**Liking & Similarity**:people like others who are similar or genuinely validate them

**Active listening**: Make people feel heard and not judged to build psychological safety and trust

**Curiosity driven questions**: asking follow up questions increases likability & perceived intelligence

* The more you dig about the subject, the more you seem interested and knowledgeable/open about the subject 

**CWA**: Charismatic impression

**Competence**: confidence, intelligence, ability, skills, effectiveness, availability / willingness to help others

**Warmth**: likability, emotional intelligence, friendliness, relatability, humor, empathy

**Authenticity**: genuineness, humility, not being fake or pretentious, unique, voicing opinions

Having all 3 makes you the charismatic goat

Sports water bottle
It's insulated. The size is just right for me. It's suitable for carrying during sports, and it's also great for taking coffee with me when going out.

CK underwear
It's really beyond my expectations. It's made of 100% pure cotton!

Adidas knee-high socks
The quality is really good. They are softer than I expected, and they are a great choice.

Denim shorts
I have to say that the texture of these denim shorts is top-notch. They fit me perfectly. The stitching and the workmanship of the zipper are excellent, and the color is very sophisticated. I can make a lot of different outfits with them.

Always do what you should do denim long pants
To be honest, I wasn't really interested in black denim pants originally. Since the price was so good, I picked one up by the way. But I was so surprised when I got it. The texture is very high-end. It's a straight-leg denim pant and it's very comfortable. I've changed my opinion of this brand.

GD blue T-shirt
No surprises. It performs steadily as always. The print is made of rubber.

GD black denim shorts
This style has been on my shopping list for a long time, but I didn't really like it when I got the actual item. It's too tight, and the size runs small for me.

RHUDE T-shirt
This color is perfect for summer. The size I bought fits me very well, and it looks great on me. The texture of the shirt is just right, not too thick.

Acne studios long-sleeved black T-shirt
The cutting of the shirt is just so-so, but the texture is good. I don't think it looks as good as in the picture, but luckily it's not expensive.

Acne studios
This is definitely a qualified white T-shirt. Both the texture and the workmanship are top-notch. I think I'll wear it quite often.

Acne studios white long-sleeved T-shirt
Just like the black one, I don't really like this one either.

Supreme black T-shirt
It's of high quality, but the logo is not reflective.

Sunglasses
I prepared these sunglasses for my trip. I think they are quite good.

Saint T-shirt
It has a special color. The print with the donut makes the overall color look very pleasant. Most importantly, the price is really good, so it's a great choice.

A TEE
Both the print and the details are excellent. No need to say more. This is the second time I've bought this T-shirt.

RHUDE black T-shirt
Compared to the other one, this one has the classic big logo. It goes well with everything, and the texture is also top-notch.

They expect me to always be strong, but the moment I show any vulnerability, I'm ignored or mocked. I've dealt with mental health issues since being diagnosed with High Functioning Autism at 7. While my mom did her best to support me, it caused jealousy in my older sister, who emotionally abused me throughout my childhood—mocking my disability, insulting people I liked, and making me feel unsafe in my own home. That abuse has left lasting damage, especially in how I relate to women. (no I am not an incel)

The only person I could truly talk to was my grandfather. He understood me and gave me a safe space to be myself. When he died in 2015, it broke me. I began overeating and struggling with depression, which worsened my self-esteem.

Most of my friendships have felt one-sided—people using me and dropping me when I’m no longer useful. Physical injuries in high school made me the target of jokes and judgment. Even now, I hide my pain to avoid ridicule.

Last year, my best friend betrayed me, spreading lies after I asked a girl out for coffee. That shattered me and led to a drinking problem. I felt completely alone—judged by teachers and peers, receiving no support, only stares and whispers.

Last night, a friend I’ve supported through his mental health struggles for over a year told me to fuck off out of nowhere. I’ve always been there for him, and I don’t understand what I did to deserve that. It’s left me feeling angry to the point that it scares me, especially with university starting in September.

1keo2wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1keo2wt/what_makes_jura_24232_filter_cartridge_a_mustbuy/,What Makes Jura 24232 Filter Cartridge a Must-Buy? Detailed Review Inside!,"The Jura 24232 Filter Cartridge Claris Smart+ Water Filters - Pack of 6 is a product I wouldn’t have initially given much thought to. But having tested it out extensively, it turns out these filters are a lot more essential and impressive than they seem on the surface. The idea of upgrading the quality of water I use daily for coffee had me genuinely intrigued. I wanted to see if this pack of six could live up to its promise of better-tasting coffee and improved machine longevity.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the design feels minimal and functional. It’s made from high-grade plastic and feels sturdy in hand, which is assuring for something that’s going to sit in the water tank of my beloved coffee machine. Each cartridge fits perfectly into my Jura E6, and installation doesn’t require any awkward maneuvers or tools. The lower end of each filter has an innovative addition: a depot with natural active ingredients aimed at reducing limescale deposits in the tank. I tested this claim by leaving one filter in the tank for over two weeks; the results? Noticeably fewer limescale traces compared to standard filters I've used before.

**Compatible Coffee Machines**  
Compatibility plays a big role, as not everyone owns a new Jura coffee machine. I personally used the filters in my older Jura S8 model, and they fit smoothly. They’re compatible with multiple Jura machines, such as the Z8, Z6, J6, WE6, and even the ENA8. Knowing that users with both new and slightly older Jura machines can rely on these cartridges is a huge plus.  

[Ready to buy Jura 24232? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0blw8sg27/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
The water taste transformation is immediately noticeable. My morning coffee has always been good, but after using these filters, it’s achieved a clarity and richness that feels gourmet. These filters stabilize the water through ion exchange and activated carbon technology. I found them particularly effective at filtering tap water, which typically contains impurities like chlorine. Surprisingly, the minerals essential for flavor were retained, so the water still had that perfect balance for coffee.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Touching on the feature I loved the most—RFID technology! The filter communicates directly with my coffee machine, ensuring that the device automatically detects when a filter is inserted. It also tracks filter usage and alerts me when it’s time to replace it. I didn’t even have to set any reminders! Having this kind of automation in a coffee setup simplifies an otherwise tedious aspect of filter management. Maintenance, too, becomes hassle-free since the filters prevent limescale buildup inside the machine, removing the need for frequent descaling cycles.

**Positives**  
- Seamless compatibility with a range of Jura machines.  
- Noticeable improvement in coffee taste with freshly filtered water.  
- RFID technology automates filter detection and usage tracking.  

**Negatives**  
- These filters only work with Jura-specific coffee machines, limiting usage for other non-Jura devices.  
- The higher price point compared to standard coffee machine filters may turn away some users.  
- Condensed water in the packaging was slightly annoying, although not a dealbreaker.

**Other Options**  
Looking across the water filtration landscape, there are a few competitors that could rival this product. Brita offers excellent universal filters that come at a lower cost. However, the Jura Claris Smart+ filters outshine Brita by addressing the unique needs of coffee machines, particularly through the prevention of scale buildup. Another option is the BWT filter, which also claims mineral retention, but lacks the advanced RFID convenience, making filter replacement tracking a manual chore.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Although priced higher than generic filters, I would say the Jura 24232 offers excellent cost-efficiency for its features, especially for users deeply invested in their coffee machine’s longevity. After breaking it down, the additional expense can be justified in terms of the improved coffee quality and reduced machine maintenance costs.

3. Melatonin 💊
- I take 1-2mg per night 
- this helps me to fall asleep 

4. Sport: 10k steps / 5km run / sports 🚴‍♂️
- everyday I try to move my body and run 2-3x per week at least 5km run 
- however I only do physical / high intensity sport in the morning as if I do it in the evening I don’t sleep well 

5. No food after 7pm 🕖 
- j have dinner between 5-7pm and then have no food 
- this has helped me with digestion 

6. Tracking with Oura 
- I have tried a few things and have used my Oura ring to test and iterate what works for me 

7. No work computer after 7pm 📆
- no work after 7pm otherwise I get stressed and the blue light has impact on my sleep 

8. Magnesium 
- I take a pill of magnesium every night 
- I’m still tracking to see if it has some impact but I have not see negative impact so far 

9. Being ok if a night is ‘bad’

Pretty lowkey person and loved my coffee shops. Is there anything like this up here that isn’t downtown Kelowna? Where should I look to live before deciding if I want to move back?

1kenuac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norwich/comments/1kenuac/norwich_is_an_incredible_city_for_coffee/,Norwich is an incredible city for coffee.,"I'm just recently reflecting on the incredible selection of specialty shops that there are to choose from in Norwich. From the mellow and stylish vibes of Mitre, to the social and welcoming Buffalo Coffee Brewers, there are truly so many good shops, each doing their own thing in their own special way.

And that's not even mentioning all the other amazing spots (Brownies and Coffee is a hidden gem honestly) as well as having a local roasters such as strangers.

It's so good to see a thriving local scene, and there really is community around it - the interactions and conversations I've had with the kind and friendly baristas in all these shops makes the experience that much more welcoming.

I've only been in Norwich a few years, and before coming here I never really *loved* coffee, but this city has certainly given me a much greater appreciation.",25,1746375975.0,Norwich,9,0.88,False

I'm tired. Very. So I forced myself to go home early. So much paperwork. There was so much that I really thought of bringing a match and burning the papers on my desk... but I couldn't... but if I could. I picked up my guitar and sat on the balcony of my room. Then I saw her again. She was there in their garden, digging the soil. Maybe she’s planting vegetables. I'm just not sure if she’s planning to sell the vegetable in the market. She’s so weird, right? I strummed my guitar to the tune of ""Back to the Old House"" by The Smiths. A little something to cheer up someone planting root crops.

I noticed she paused. She even looked around. But she never looked in my direction, even though I'm on the second floor of our house. She knows it's me. Because I always sing ""Back to the Old House"" to her whenever I see her and have my guitar with me. I’m somewhat thankful to her because, in a way, she pushed me to learn how to play the guitar. I’ll tell you what happened next time. She went inside their house, probably annoyed with me. I love teasing her.

Because it's the only way she notices me, even if it's in a grumpy way. Sigh! The truth is... I want to talk to her again like we did in high school. Although we weren't close, I could talk to her properly. Not like now. It's awkward. It's my fault why we're like this now. From the beginning, I set my mind not to like her.. I know she doesn't like people like me. Well, she didn't exactly say that. But it kind of seems that way, doesn't it? It's not normal in the eyes of others, those who think that this kind of sexuality is a sickness of the mind and soul. I had two girlfriends.

One finished an education degree, and the other took up psychology. After four years, she was sent to a mental hospital. Yes, a mental hospital, because her aunt placed her there to work. I never courted any of them. The relationship lasted. But. It was an on-and-off setup, and eventually, it didn't work out. I'm happy too because they've found real men who make them happy now. Let's go back to Historia. I never admitted to anyone, not even to my friends, that I liked her. But I don't know how my friends could tell that I liked someone, even when I was blatantly ignoring her? That's why I'm too embarrassed to talk to Historia, and now she doesn't even acknowledge me. I tried talking to her before, pretending to ask something, and she did answer, but she gave me this look -\_- I even told her before that she's not my type because she started suspecting it too.

Since then, I haven't dared to talk to her, afraid of embarrassment. And I also don't want her to think I actually like her because I know she doesn't. What’s annoying is that she's okay with others like me. She laughs, talks normally, but with me? It's so unnerving. I want to ask the wall of their house why she ignores me, even though I can’t think of any wrong I’ve done to her. Then with others, she's the one who initiates the talk. It’s so painful! But I have to ignore my feelings for her so I don't feel the pain as much. I’m also a victim of her ""seen zone"" in the chatbox. But she never unfriended or blocked me on Facebook.

Rest day.

Mikasa and I are at the court. Mikasa, by the way, is my neighbor. Annie and Sasha, are with me. We’re playing basketball.

“Bro... there’s something I need to tell you,” Annie said.

She’s dribbling while I’m guarding her.. I’m waiting for the right moment to steal the ball.

“What is it?” I asked without taking my eyes off the ball.

“Historia...”

“If you think I’m going to lose focus just because you mentioned her name, you’re wrong!” I said with a laugh.

I was trying to steal the ball from her dribble.

“Historia has a boyfriend,” she said.

I was stunned.

It’s probably still loading in my brain what Annie just said.

I swallowed and gaped. I only heard the sound of the ball bouncing against the rim.

“Where did you find out?” I quickly recovered from my reaction.

Maybe Annie is just joking.

Maybe?

I hope so.

“I saw them at the mall yesterday, being sweet to each other,” she answered.

Her face was serious; it might actually be true.

“Yeah, dude, actually I saw her too yesterday,” Mikasa said as she approached, with Sasha following, showing sympathy as well.

“This isn’t a joke, right?!” I confirmed.

Our group often plays pranks on each other.

“This isn’t a joke,” Annie said. she even patted me on the back.

So did Mikasa.

Sasha joined in with a pat.

The painful pat.

More painful than the slowly growing ache I felt.

I’m sure.

I’ll think about this, later, before I go to sleep.

I took a deep breath, as deep as I could.

Maybe it will lessen the pain I’m feeling.

Then…

I smiled at them as if nothing happened.

FAKE SMILE.

I took the ball from Mikasa and started dribbling it again.

“Are you okay, bro?” Mikasa’s voice had a hint of concern.

“Of course! I don’t even like Historia, so it’s no big deal.”

If denials were like lightning, I’d probably be struck by now.

The truth is…

It’s just painful.

I slowly walked up to my room. I smuggled three bottles of different flavors of Alcohol.

I bought them from the corner store; I thought if I bought them from Carla Yeager, she’d ask too many questions and then tell my mom. Because I don’t really drink.

Since I’m broken-hearted right now.

I’ll drink and be sentimental.

That’s what broken-hearted people do, right? But I’ve never done this with any of my exes.

Just with Historia, who isn’t even my ex.

I opened my iPod.

I took a swig of the alcohol, which is 10% or 14%, I’m not sure.

“I don’t want to know… 🎶 Who she is and where you went… I won’t ask anymore… So you don’t have to admit anything…” 🎶

Oh! Even the song is emo, but I’m singing along too.

I finished one bottle and then opened another.

I drank it down without stopping.

After a few gulps, someone knocked repeatedly.

“Ymir! Have you seen my list?”

I was startled by mom’s knocking.

Oh no! The alcohol got inside my my nose!

“Urgghh! Aaahh! I-I haven’t!” I answered in a panic.

The alcohol was still dripping from my nose.

The truth is...

It made me tear up.

Monday Madness. Overload. I don't know if I’m drunk or just overwhelmed. But my head hurts and I still feel heavy. I have a lot to do at the office today because of Monday madness! I went downstairs for breakfast. There was already food on the table. I sat down. Made a cup of L.A. Coffee. My favorite. Then I heard a door open. Right after that, Hange came down.

She was scratching herself. I was about to take a bite when she hit me on the head. ""Bonehead!"" she called. Tss! she can never forget the nickname a girl acquaintance gave me at the mall. I just frowned at her and took a bite. ""Why your music was too dramatic last night? Did you get rejected?"" She asked with a grin. ""Stop it!"" I replied, annoyed. I forgot to mention that I'm open with my family. I confessed it through a joke. Anyway. It was already obvious, but I really couldn't admit it back then. So I thought I'd gradually admit it by joking about it. I even joked to mom that I got a girl  pregnant. Her eyes widened at what she heard. Then she realized that I’m actually a girl.

As for Papa, he didn’t have a violent reaction. Actually, he’s also partly to blame for who I am now. He used to buy me toys meant for boys when I was young. So, he probably expected it. As for Hange, she’s just a great tease and a villain in my love life. I finished my meal. Brushed my teeth. Took a shower. Got dressed. And then went to work.

""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" my coworker greeted. Hitch. She's bisexual. I’m sure she’s going to ask me about Historia again. ""How’s my Historia?"" I knew it. Her Historia? Tsk! Should I kick her? Unfortunately, when Historia was looking for our house, she asked for directions from Hitch. That’s why she’s like this now. She’s also gone a bit crazy. I didn’t answer her, just went straight to my table and shook my head. A pile of paperwork. My headache got worse. Ugh! I don’t want to think about Historia right now; I have too much work. I’ll just let the feelings simmer for now.

""Why do you have a paper bag?"" she asked again. ""This? It’s nothing."" I put a the alcohol away. At least my drinking has some benefit. ""She liked my post on Facebook."" Okay. It’s her again. So, she like the post of others but not mine! Such a bummer! ""Okay."" ""Please, stop talking about our neighbor; she’s taken!"" I blurted out, delivering the painful truth. ""Really?! She’s taken? Since when?!""

""Didn't you know? Aren’t you close? Ask her yourself."" Tss! I turned back to my work. She finally quieted down. I noticed she was also upset. She wasn’t talking properly to our other office mates anymore. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Poor Hitch. She’s hurt by the news too.",1,1746375541.0,ymirxhistoria,0,1.0,False
1kennxr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kennxr,It was really nice meeting everyone who made it despite the weather.,"
As planned, I headed to Museum Café early. It was still quiet when I arrived, so I spent some time looking around—and I must say, the place has a really cool and aesthetic vibe all around. The ambience is great, and the prices are super convenient and budget-friendly, right from coffee to pizzas.

They’re managing the café really well, and what stood out the most was the hospitality. Everyone—from the cooks to the in-charge—spoke so warmly and relatably. It made the experience even better. I’d definitely love to visit again (and again!).

Then, out of nowhere, the weather surprised us with strong winds and sudden rain across the city. Luckily, it cleared up after a few minutes, leaving behind a chill and pleasant evening.

People started arriving, and we kicked things off with some fun icebreaker conversations over snacks at the café. After that, we headed to the beach, roamed around, walked by the shore, and enjoyed mojitos, spring potatoes, and ice creams.

We wrapped up the day on a really good note—with new connections, great weather, and wholesome vibes.

1kenmgd,https://i.redd.it/wmeujsotcsye1.jpeg,The search for Lonnie Hovis (Coffee Pot Cup),"Hi all, 

I'm working on a story about the Coffee Pot Cup and I was wondering if anyone has any contact information for Lonnie Hovis. Looks like he has the Cup.

Curious to know if he will be bringing it to Wednesday's US Open Cup game vs. Charleston and how it will work since it's not at Blackbaud (every game but the 2008 US Open Cup Final was played at Blackbaud and this is the first game played between the two teams since Blackbaud was shut down -- RIP!)

I was also trying to find out how the trophy was handled (or the drinking from the ""cup"") was handled when the teams drew 1-1 in the last game in 2014. Maybe the two supporters groups just split the cost and shared the beer? 

From what I gather, the losing team provides the beer to fill up the ""cup"" and the winners get to drink from it -- right?

We had been together for about a year and in my mind I thought we were exclusive. Turns out, only I was the exclusive one, but that's a story for another time. He had a traveling job that took him all around the state of Texas so he was only home about 10 days a month. When he was home, he would stay at my house. I thought things were great. That was until my birthday came up. He started acting funny, very distant and cold. We didn't do anything for my birthday. No dinner, flowers, nothing. I don't expect the world to stop spinning on my birthday but I didn't even get a card and he never even wished me a happy birthday. He was home for a few days then back to work he went. So I started to put distance between us for a few weeks. Fast-forward to the next time he came home. He still came to my house for a few days so I thought things would go back to normal. Nope. Still distant. Couple days later he left for work again so I started thinking he was just using me for a place to stay while he was in town so he wouldn't have to stay at his mom's house. I worked 6-2 at a nursing home so I was already gone when he left. When I got home I noticed he emptied his wallet and left the papers (receipts and other random crap) on my coffee table. In that little pile was a small piece of paper that had his ex-girlfriend's (we'll call her Sarah) login info to her social media accounts. Weird. No wonder why they broke up if they distrusted one another so much that they needed to have the login to the other person's account lmao. I took that paper and went to his mom's house to use her laptop (this was 2011). I got in! In his phone he had deleted chats between them so I didn't know they were talking. She deleted nothing. They had been hooking up for a couple months. She would drive to wherever he was and stay with him at the motels. She had even messaged him photos of the times they spent together. Come to find out they had gone to a bar together for St. Patrick's Day when he had told me that he couldn't come home because he was on ""storm duty"". I was fuming. But she was also hooking up with other men. MANY other men. As a matter of fact, a couple of them were MARRIED! And she knew they were married because she would also meet them at motels. Disgusting. And again she shared pics of the encounters with them. If you're going to cheat, why would you be stupid enough to photograph that? AnyWho, I came across a chat between her and her Best friend’s fiancé. Of course I opened it, at this point I'm INVESTED. She was seeing him too behind her friends’ back! (who was pregnant at the time by the way). I saw the pictures and my heart dropped. I knew I had to do something. This b**ch has gone too far. I saved the pics then went to the best friend's fb and posted them from the homewrecker's account for everyone to see. Of course they had a gazillion mutual friends so half of the county saw those pictures. I didn't tell anyone for several years but looking back now, I still would've done the same thing.
