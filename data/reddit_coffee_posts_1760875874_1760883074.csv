In fact, it all happened at the end after the kiss with Tyler, but before that, Wednesday was in love with Tyler the barista, not the monster.

I don't understand why they insist that Wednesday must be desperately in love with a purely """"evil"""" side and not with the person who, after all, made her coffee and went on dates.

So what's the point of Tyler showing that ""gentle"" side by talking about a couple's evolution if we're then told that Wednesday actually wanted to kiss Tyler's monster/dark side?

She kissed Tyler thinking she was in front of a genuinely kind and cheerful person.

Have they completely disowned Tyler's genuine, kind side?

Desdemona’s Auto & Repair, just off the highway. The air hums with the metallic heartbeat of the shop. Ratchets clicking, compressors sighing, and the radio fighting static to play a love song from 30 years ago. The air is filled with the scent of oil, rubber, and coffee burned halfway to asphalt.

 

Desdemona crouches under the hood of a rust-red sedan that looks like it’s seen the apocalypse twice. Her coveralls are rolled to the knee; grease smudges her cheek like war paint. She hums along with the radio, tapping a wrench against the fender in time.

 

The first thing slips. A socket wrench. Hits the floor with a metallic clang. Dez frowns, grabs it, shakes her hand.

 

“C’mon, grip. Don’t start that jazz again.”

 

She goes back to work. Loosens another bolt. The bolt falls straight through her fingers.

 

“Okay. Weird.”

 

The next thing goes, a rag, the ratchet, then the screwdriver. Each drop punctuates the hum of the garage like off-beat percussion.

 

Her hands feel wrong. Not weak, exactly just unreliable. Like the messages from her brain are taking the long way around.

 

She pauses, breathes, leans on the car. The world feels a little too bright, the light bouncing off chrome in hard flashes.

 

“Not now,” she mutters. “Not at work. Please not now.”

 

She tries to pick up the wrench again, but it slides right out of her palm. A familiar spark shivers up her arm that faint electric warning.

 

The air thickens. The shop hum becomes a low drone. Everything slows. Her reflection in the windshield flattens all color, no depth. Like the world’s been painted over in glossy enamel. A customer walks in with a muffled voice, far away. Dez turns to answer and the floor tilts sideways.

 

The metal shelves sway. The fluorescent lights pulse. Each sound distorts, rubber mallets, clanging chains, someone’s laugh turning syrupy and slow. She feels her knees unlock. The wrench slips one last time, hitting the ground just before she does.

 

There’s a moment of impossible stillness. There’s the smell of oil and hot steel, the sound of her own breath catching and then the world folds in on itself. Colors bleed into each other. Everything becomes dream-bright and flat.

 

And then nothing. Sweet, dark, merciful nothing.

 

The garage goes still for a beat. The air compressor kicks once and cuts out, leaving the silence heavy enough to feel.

 

From the back office, Rick hears the wrench hit concrete. Then another.

He doesn’t think much of it until he hears the thud.

 

He’s already halfway across the bay when he spots her. Desdemona is crumpled beside the sedan, her hair half out of its band, the spilled tools radiating away from her like dropped stars.

 

“Dez?”

 

He’s at her side in two steps, dropping to his knees. Her eyes are open, unfocused. He knows that look. The glassy, far-away stare that says the lights are on but the connection’s flickering.

 

Rick talks more to keep the air steady than to reach her, “Okay, it’s me. You’re down, I’m here. No rush, yeah?”

 

He checks for breath, steady. Pulse? Fast but strong. There’s a smear of grease across her cheek that he wipes away with the hem of his sleeve.

 

Her hand twitches once against the floor, fingers curling as if grabbing for the wrench. He catches it instead.

 

“No tools right now, Dez. Just hang tight.”

 

The overhead lights strobe once, the kind of flicker he’s always hated. Too much like a glitch. He moves without thinking, sliding a crate under her head, flipping the main switch on the wall to cut the worst of the fluorescents.

 

Dimmer now. Quieter. Better. He counts under his breath, “One… two… breathe… three…”

 

The seconds stretch long and thin. Then she exhales a shaky, shuddering sigh and the focus starts to crawl back into her eyes.

 

“Hey,” he says softly. “You with me?”

 

Dez blinks. Her lips move, barely a whisper, “Dropped… everything.”

 

“Yeah. I noticed. You scared the hell outta me.”

 

She tries to laugh; it comes out a rasp. He hands her a bottle of water from the bench. She takes it, still trembling, half the cap spilling down her front.

 

Rick crouches beside her until the tremors fade. When she finally speaks again, it’s small, like she’s talking through a fog.

 

“It felt like… like the world turned flat. Like a dream that knew it was about to end.”

 

Rick nods, “I’ve seen that one play out before.”

 

“You stayed?”

 

“Where else am I gonna go? Someone’s gotta keep the machines from stealing your job.”

 

That gets her to smile. Faint, lopsided, but real. He glances at the cracked snow globe decal on the tool chest, shakes his head.

 

“You and gravity need counseling.”

 

She laughs properly this time, weak but alive.

 

He stands, offers her a hand.

 

“C’mon. Let’s get you on the couch in the office. I’ll finish the oil change and you can yell at me for doing it wrong later.”

 

She lets him pull her up. The lights buzz overhead, steadier now.

 

As they walk toward the office, her grip tightens on his sleeve. Grounding, human, necessary.

 

“Thanks, Rick.”

 

“Anytime. But next time, maybe skip the dramatic collapse? You’ve already proven your point.”

 

“What point?”

 

He laughs, “That even gravity’s got a crush on you.”

 

She snorts, elbowing him weakly. He grins. The sound of the radio fades back in, some forgotten love song still looping under the hum of the shop.

 

Outside, the highway roars on. Indifferent, alive and inside the little garage, life clicks back into place.",1,1760882923.0,Epilepsy_Universe,0,1.0,False

When zooble said that I thought about the only confirmed couple kinger and his wife . How dose one get a love life in the circus if you can’t make love . But I looked at kingers room setup and thought wait a minute. Kinger is the most likely the only person who doesn’t go to room to sleep or hang out in. Everyone else is confirmed to go to their rooms because Jax’s says stuff about leaving things in rooms and seeing sorts of things in episode one and two . But Kingers room is never explored ( yet) by us or Jax never mentioned anything about kingers room having weird stuff or anything. Kinger builds his room with pillows . you would think that he would do because it’s dark if he dose . Now to be fair everyone else room seems to be turned on all the time like how Pomni woke up in episode 2 in a room that’s on . But in episode 6 it shows that a room has switch by Jax’s . So what if every room has one . Then why the pillow fort then in episode 3 there was a flash back of him and his wife in the fort . The fort has been used before Kinger became crazy ( now he could have been crazy during the same time as his wife being around but stick with me ) . So why the fort ? Why pillows? Then everything comes together. You know else pillows can do . Muffle sounds . What if Kinger and his wife tried  experimenting with the dark and pillows. What if the only way to get any privacy from cane was to make a dark room with sound padding. Cane I think would know what having late night coffee is. After all he talks about no 18 pus names or explicit content allowed in episode one. Also he avoided the moon for a reason . What if the fort was built to do the dirty in secret from cane . It’s dark to keep cane from watching and muffled to a point where cane doesn’t think any bad is happening. Now I know it seems like it’s impossible since there is no proof of genitalia to get naughty. But it does seem like if you put some thought into it, you do anything. Episode 6 Kinger put some thought about a healing butterfly . Ragatha even pointed out cane never said anything about that . So what if doing things behind private rooms is possible if you think about. Kinger in the first episode says that the curious gives off sensation of eating and sleeping without the actual gaining the benefits . what if you could give off the sensation of different kind ( if you know what I mean) is possible. Now this theory is a long shot because of business part of it . But it’s is just a theory . ",1,1760882875.0,GameTheorists,1,1.0,False
1oaqjdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oaqjdr/making_my_toxic_mil_move_out/,Making my toxic MIL move out,"Alright.

3 names on the deed to this house. Me. My husband. My mother in-law. We've lived in this house for a year.

Turns out she's a covert narcissist and is feeding off my husband for supply. Makes him miserable every day. Rude. Demeaning. Plucks at his self worth. If called out on it she acts like he ran her over with his car. Has DARVO down to a science.

She tried it with me but I became pregnant pretty soon after we moved in and I didn't want to be accused of ""being hormonal"" so I kept myself in check and only treated MIL with complete neutrality.

Shes annoying as Hell, though. Her room and office are an absolute mess. Stinks up the rest of the house. She keeps the heat on 85 degrees because she's always freezing but doesn't want to sleep under covers. Listens to AI generated K dramas on full blast, as well as talking on speakerphone because she is hard of hearing. Refuses to get hearing aids because she ""likes her silent world."" 

It's not her world anymore, though. My baby is 4 months old.

She hasn't spoken to me since beginning of September because of a Facebook post I made asking for help with the baby and she felt that gave a perception that she's an unhelpful grandmother. She doesn't help with the baby at all, though. She just doesn't like people *knowing that.*

Anyway, the loud sounds that wake the baby from his naps, the smells, the heat. The tension. It's not good for him. SHE HAS TO GO.

She did leave. For 2 weeks, but came back. She keeps telling my husband she knows he doesn't want her in our son's life (covert narcissist!) And instead of doing anything about it he PLACATES HER saying it's less of a headache.

She eats my cooking. She actually eats more of it than I do. I don't even get to try my cooking half the time because I cosleep with the baby and I have to put him down by the time I'm finished making dinner. She eats the leftovers before I get a chance. Husband told me the beef stew was awesome. I have to take his word for it.

Anyway I'm getting off track. She needs to go. Husband won't convince her to leave.

What are my options?? I can't just leave because I'm jobless and have a 4 month old baby. No one has room for me, the baby, and my cat. Would a shelter even take us in? Is that a thing?

If I confront her and demand she leaves, would that work? She's a narcissist, I worry that will give her supply and make her want to stay. She'll cry to my husband and he'll tell me I'm making things worse.

I can't kick her out. This is her house, too.

Do I sabotage? Make the food so spicy she can't eat it? Put salt in the coffee maker!? I'm losing my mind! I'm so tired of my husband complaining about her but refusing to do anything about it.

Also, we can't afford to move out ourselves. Rent around here is too high on his salary alone and even if I got a job it wouldn't cover the cost of childcare.

You'd think her ignoring me and my son's existence would make it easier but it doesn't. She still eats everything and cranks up the heat and talks trash about me over the phone and plays loud music during nap time.

She needs to go for HIS sake. She's bad news for him. If she'll stop talking to me over a FB post, what will she do when he pisses her off on his own? If she even acknowledges him!!

Can you imagine? He's 3 and asks me why grandma doesn't speak to him?? Nope. Can't let that happen.",1,1760882854.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1oaqj8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/mlmscams/comments/1oaqj8a/think_i_got_caught_up_in_one_of_those_business/,Think I got caught up in one of those “business mentorship” schemes after meeting someone at Walmart,"Ok so it wouldn’t let me post in the antiMLM subreddit so I figured this was next best option.

So this all started randomly when I was shopping at Walmart and this guy complimented my Hey Dude shoes. We talked for a bit, and I honestly thought I made a new friend. I didn’t realize at the time he probably saw me more as a business lead than a potential friend.

He started telling me about this couple who’s “mentoring” him and his girlfriend, and they supposedly retired in their early 30s and live this amazing life because of their business.

Next thing I know, I’m sitting through a couple coffee-shop meetings where he’s explaining this system that honestly sounds like a pyramid setup. Then he invited me to these “info sessions” on Wednesdays at 7:30, business-casual dress required. I went to a few, and the energy was… weird. Everyone seemed confused but pretending to get it. The speakers kept saying stuff like “you earned your seat here,” even though I only ended up there because of that random Walmart conversation.

Should I mention during the info session, they were literally explaining things drawing the “business triangle”, my intuition believes that if draw a pyramid or a triangle of any sort to explain how the business works, then its a pyramid scheme

The biggest red flag was when he gave me a budget sheet to fill out, and later tried to sell me on a $500 “business plan.” I’m currently unemployed, so that’s not happening. I told him I’d think about it, but he and his girlfriend started trying to find me a job just so I could join, and that’s when it really hit me how desperate they were.

He’s genuinely been nice to me, which makes this harder, especially since I’ve been feeling lonely. But I wanted a real friend, not a business partner right now.

Is it possible this will be something that will last? Is it just a fleeting feeling that has since passed. Maybe it was just gas and you just needed a hearty burp. Or perhaps you were just filling the empty space in your day. 

You were careful, mature, measured; I was reckless, diving headlong, wanting to lay everything out. I promised myself I would always give 100%. It is hard to stand naked before the world knowing I am not perfect, but I have to give of myself to get back. Knowing I have baggage, pain and fear, but I also have a soul that wants connection and a heart that craves something more…

You said you’re looking for casual but are open to more. I have been busy dissecting, ruminating, overthinking... Was that your way of letting me down gently? Did I read the signs all wrong? Were you asking me to leave when I stayed for coffee? Should I have snuck out before dawn? Do I talk too much in the morning? Should I have let you sleep more instead? Should I have even come home with you or was I too easy. Do you, like all men, prefer the chase? Now that you tasted some of me, will you come back for more or I will you stay away.

What parts are important to a machine and what kind of models would you recommend I look for on the second hand market?

Do i look for old vintage multigroup professional machines, or would you recommend me manual ones? Or just the electric single group?

I’m a beginner in the world of espresso and have recently purchased a Dedica EC 685 machine. Up until now, I’ve been using pre-ground coffee, but I’m eager to start grinding fresh beans.

I’ve been looking into hand grinders and came across the AVX 1065. It features:

* 48mm steel conical burrs
* 30 grind settings
* Suitable for filter coffee, moka pots, and espresso

From what I can tell, AVX is a Hungarian company that seems to produce fairly high-quality products at a reasonable price, which makes me feel confident about trying it out.

My question is: Would it be beneficial to purchase this grinder now, or should I wait until I get a spouted unpressurized portafilter? I’m considering the grinder as a first step, but I’m unsure if it will make a significant difference in my espresso quality without the new portafilter.

My budget is around \[€80\]

Kahit working hours, natawag siya. I'd rather sleep or literally rest lang talaga instead of catching up. We still talked, pero bandang October 5 di na ko nakaka-reply masyado and nakakasagot ng tawag. During that week din kasi ay busy, may competition and of course, sinabi ko naman sa kanya yun. Sinabi ko rin na I need time for myself muna. Pero parang wala, sunod-sunod pa rin ang calls, umaabot na sa point na ayoko na magbukas ng social media apps kasi laging nagri-ring yung phone ko. 

Nito lang, she just came back. Tumatawag if nasan ako and coffee kami saglit. I said, ""Di ako pwede, sorry."" Ang reply nya ay, ""K."" Then asked if I'm cutting her off na ba, and she's been known to be somebody na difficult to he friends with kaya naiintindihan nya. Ang sabi ko, ""Bawal na bang tumanggi?

Hi there, I apologize for this lengthy monologue, but I desperately need  the help to loose this weight I’ve been carrying for far too long. I have tried everything diet wise to loose weight and have been unsuccessful. I honestly think I’m in a constant state of fight or flight and it’s due to hormones and cortisol levels and some mental block from living with some constant form of stress that I don’t even notice because it’s my way of life.s Anyway here it goes! My biggest concerns are.

1. Water. I LOVE WATER! I drink a gallon of water a day if not more. It’s so satisfying to me and I love to gulp as much as I feel I need. I think this will be the hardest struggle for me. How much water can you drink at one time? Plus if I drink too much then I won’t be able to eat food.
2. Hair loss: I’m 44 and I can already see my hair thinning out. I don’t want to get any thinner. What has worked for others to maintain hair strength?
3. Alcohol: I do currently enjoy adult beverages a few times a week. I prefer white wines and Bourbon. But I’m a bit of a bourbon snob and the only thing you add to a glass of Bourbon is an ice cube maybe. It is something that’s sipped and drank over time. Do I have to give up Bourbon? I’m also concerned because addiction runs heavy in my family. And I am just learning about this passive addiction that can come from drinking alcohol. If you could manage alcohol before. Why would it become a potential addiction problem after surgery?
4. Supplements. I currently take mostly all liposomal liquid supplements and quite a few of them. Are there supplements that are forbidden? I know that there are preferred bariatric supplements that the doctor recommends. Could somebody share the list with me so I could start doing research? Why wouldn’t I be able to take my current supplements if they are better than the one suggested? I’m also super picky in supplements. Most of them are worthless.
5. Lose skin. I’ve never had loose skin. My sister had the bypass surgery and was kind of soft and loose before surgery so she had a significant amount of loose skin. She went to Mexico and had it all removed. I think she looks like Frankenstein. But she’s the happiest she’s ever been in her entire life So I guess I compare myself to her situation. I need to probably lose 125-150 pounds. I’ve also had two children and they destroyed my stomach so I know that it is going to be a puddle of loose skin. Plus I have this bodacious booty. What is going to happen to it? Does your booty get all saggy? I’ve never had a saggy booty. I feel like that will mentally mess with me more than anything. I currently do not hate myself or have body dysmorphia issues or look at myself in any disgusting way. I know that will change for me once I start losing weight getting loose skin and losing my hair . I’m scared of that. I don’t want to ever think of myself as something other than beautiful. I have done a tremendous amount of healing from a long line of physical, emotional and mental abuse from the people who were supposed to love me the most in my life. It took some major shadow work to break free from the false agreements, I allowed myself to believe. I don’t ever want think of myself as that person again.
6. Energy level. I am a hard-working queen. I am a full-time single mother of two children that are highly active in athletics and band. I own a full-time business that is extremely stressful and unpredictable. I also recently opened up a second business that is my true passion. That is like an ultimate dopamine rush, but also extremely stressful. My day starts at 5am and usually ends around 12am. If I can get to sleep by midnight, I’m a happy camper. I don’t usually get much sleep 4 to 5 hours. It is normal for me and I function quite well. I don’t drink coffee and I don’t need it. I’m on my feet the entire day. I average on an easy day 10,000 steps on a normal day 15,000. I have ADHD and I can get overwhelmed with the magnitude of my responsibilities already. So having mental clarity, and enough energy to pull through is important. I feel like sometimes my cognitive function is declining. I’m terrified that I will not have the mental and physical energy be to maintain my lifestyle. How long does it take to get back to normal? I’ve never taken more than six weeks off of work and that was to deliver my children. My jobs are very physically demanding. I work in surgery and lift  a lot of heavy totes and trays. Do you fully recover all your stamina back? What is the required amount of time that they want you to stay home and with my kind of job do you think I could go back quicker if I was recovering well?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. There’s one thing that I know for sure with being in this group and reading every single one of the posts is that there are very few regrets, lots of mental fortitude in the beginning, and a bunch of happy humans after. I may love myself. I may think that I am beautiful, but I am not comfortable in my own skin anymore so I have to do something. My weight is starting to show in my A1c levels and my high blood pressure. Which I don’t currently take medicine for because it makes me sick. So instead of stroking out from stress and high BP.  I’m thinking this surgery is my safest, quickest way to get out of the danger zone.

So I go to the back door, he scratches his cute little Mochi paws on the door, I let him out, I make my coffee. Then I hear some short little barks, letting me know he’s done. 

Then I let him inside and I sit on the couch with my coffee. Mochi RUNS up the dog stairs and he curls up at my feet. 

It was like we had a whole morning together.  


PS after that I had to go get his highness, Snuggie, out of bed and carry him outside to do his business . He’s so spoiled. I love them both. They are totally different personalities. I’ll post their pics in the comments. ",4,1760882343.0,Pomeranians,1,1.0,False

**Go to the Second Slide**

Asaru: Woo, only three episodes and I'm stumped! I wanna go home and sleep already! But the last one for today and I can finally go..

Asaru: Mmm, seems like she isn't here.. I guess I can take just a little nap.. Yeah, only for a couple minutes.

**Go to the Third Slide**

Betelgeuse: Asaru.. Wake up

Asaru: H-huh! Hello! Betelgeuse right? Welcome! Anyways, we should start the Interview right now! *sets up the camera*

Asaru: Apologies for sleeping by the way! Today's been really exhaustive and I didn't have any sleep yesterday.. 

Betelgeuse: Don't worry about it. 

**3. 2. 1. Start!**

Asaru: Anyways, Betelgeuse! Tell me about yourself, your interests and why you're in Tracen Academy!

Betelgeuse: This is going to be a long story.. 

Asaru: it doesn't matter! I promise I won't go to sleep again!

Betelgeuse: alright.. I'll reintroduce myself, my name is Betelgeuse.  I was formerly ""The Sage of Magic Affinity Attribute Research"".

Asaru: A sage? What is that? 

Betelgeuse: In my country. The Sage Position is a leader of a department under The Grand Sage governing the nation.

Asaru: Alright, then why'd you enter Tracen? Seems like you've had a pretty great life over there!

Betelgeuse: One day.. An experiment went wrong where a Chimera Girl wrecked havoc in my country, my department was tasked to protect everyone. But there were too many casualties.

**Go to Slide Four**

Asaru: *snoring and sleep talking:* *interesting! I. Ive misse-*

Betelgeuse: I've questioned my position.. But my Apprentice solved the crisis.. I've realized how fragile us humans were, and I vowed to find the truth and make us even stronger. 

Asaru: *ahh... can you go faster..*

Betelgeuse: sure.. *I guess.* I conducted illegal experiments secretly, but I got found and exiled by none other than **The Grand Sage** who was my former apprentice.

Betelgeuse: Asaru. Are you sleeptalking?

**Go to slide five**

Asaru: Oough, Sorry! I was having a very great dream.. *too great..*, but please continue! 

Betelgeuse: Alright.. So even though I was exiled, I still am trying to complete my mission to uncover every secret. 

Asaru: Ooh. Interesting, so tell me! How'd you become a witch?

**Go to Slide Six**

Betelgeuse: Well, In my nation, every witch is bestowned a title as soon they get their witch hat. 

Asaru: I assume you only get a witch hat if you complete some sort of tests?

Betelgeuse: exactly, my title was ""The Evil Witch"" when I was given my hat.

Asaru: That's, kinda weird. Did you get a new one?

Betelgeuse: I did get another title called ""The Stardust Witch"".. But I was the only one to be bestowed a negative title amongst the other witches.

Asaru: Well don't worry about it! Past is the past amirite! 

Betelgeuse: though people here in Tracen Academy seems to be scared of me for some reason..

Asaru: I don't really see it though!

Cameraman: *Asaru, her smile is extremely eerie, and her eyes are empty with the gigantic eyebags. How are you not shaking right now talking to her?*

Asaru: What? No way! She seems really cool actually!

Betelgeuse: ... My relationships with other people in Tracen Academy do vary.

Asaru: wh-what? I haven't said anything yet?

Betelgeuse: hmm. Almond Eye said I was creepy. While Narita Tai-

Asaru: NARITA TAISHIN?! WHERE!

Betelgeuse: ... Was the first to visit my office. While Sweep Tosho, Sweep Tosho is interesting, she wears a witch hat too. It feels like something is causing me to mentor her. She said she wanted to learn Black Magic, and I did want to teach her. But she isn't my trainee at the moment. I do want to train her sometime in the future though..

Asaru: Ookay then.. That's interesting. Anything else?

Betelgeuse: Well Manhattan Cafe's one. I had her coffee and it tasted exquisite. Sure is great huh. I gave her one some of my potions as Halloween Decoration.

Asaru: That's definently not safe for a cafe in Halloween

Betelgeuse: Calm down. The liquid inside was just food poisoning.

Asaru: ahh. Alright alright. I see! That's pretty cool, a witch in Tracen Academy. If you become Sweep toshos Trainer then you two would be an unstoppable duo!

Betelgeuse: ... Is that all for the interview?

Asaru: w-well. Yeah I guess..

Betelgeuse: alright. I'll leave now, it was relatively short compared to the other two.

Asaru: okay.. Bye Betelgeuse!

Betelgeuse: Bye >! Asara. !<

Asaru*?*: Wh-WHAT! H-How dare you call me by my real name! How'd you even know it anyways!

**Go to Slide 7**

*Editors Note: The Asaru Fun Facts post was posted without Asaru's knowledge nor consent. Refer to Fact #1 as to why she acted like that.*

Asaru*?*: That Stupid Witch! She truly knows everything huh.. *looks at camera man* Did you plan this!

Cameraman: *N-no! We didn't do anything, we're not even sure how she knew the information at all!*

Asaru: *Damnit*.. Whatever, I'm going home and I'm going to sleep! *and changing my clothes as soon i get home!*

Camerawoman: *she's really gullible huh.. Wait did she say something about-*

1oaqap5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oaqap5/feeling_lonely/,Feeling lonely,"M25. Feeling lonely ever since my girlfriend broke up with me. I thought she was the one. I stick to a routine that benefits my physical and mental health. 

However, my loneliness compounds when I get no matches on dating apps, and not having many opportunities in public such as my run club I go to or seeing anyone at my coffee shop. 

It’s weird because it’s not like I can do much different. I stick to a routine where I’m physically healthy and that of which meets my mental health needs as well as journaling, eating, healthy, etc. It seems hopeless in the female domain of finding someone because everywhere I look, there’s no one. And it’s not even like I’m putting much pressure on at times. Any advice my worst fear is to grow old and not have a family.

I believe relationships shouldn’t start with “Hey, how are you?” but with a spark of curiosity, a laugh over something absurd, or a deep dive into why the world feels the way it does. I’m looking for someone who’s up for both.

About me: I'm from, and live in Bangalore, work as a Research & Policy Analyst, and spend my days thinking about global issues, human rights, and occasionally, which movie best describes my mood. I’m childfree by choice, love coffee, books, and meaningful conversations, and I care deeply about justice, equality, and the stories of people often overlooked.

I’m introspective, sometimes sarcastic, and occasionally hopelessly romantic. I value honesty, curiosity, and someone who’s not afraid to challenge me

What I’m looking for: someone who’s thoughtful, warm, and confident enough to laugh at my quirks and push me to think differently. Someone who is CF, loves coffee, and can geek out over random topics for hours.

No rigid expectations. No checklist. Just a real connection, built on friendship, curiosity, and romance along the way.

1oaq4sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oaq4sv/mood_finally_stable_on_lamotrigine_but_really/,"Mood finally stable on Lamotrigine, but really struggling with sleep!","I've been on Lamotrigine for 3 months now to treat bipolar II. I started on 25 mg and gradually increased to 200 mg (100 mg twice a day) a month ago.

**On the good side:**  
Overall, my mood is very stable while still allowing me to feel joyful or sad when appropriate, instead of the crazy lows of depression and the highs of hypomania.  
I also still feel able to function normally intellectually, no major problems with memory or concentration.

**On the bad side:**  
I've been having very vivid dreams, and I wake up 2–3 times a night, mostly because of nightmares. One time I even had intense night sweats, the first time in my life that I can remember having those!

Additionally, I’ve noticed a decreased need for sleep. I used to sleep easily for 7–8 hours when stable, but now I barely sleep 4-5 hours a night. The weird part is that I’m not tired at all during the day. I keep yawning though, like my body’s telling me it’s tired, but I don’t actually *feel* sleepy (which never happened before).

Honestly, it’s been kind of useful. I don’t need coffee or anything and I’m awake and functional all day. I even pulled an all-nighter once and only needed a 2-hour nap the next day.

I tried sleeping pills for a week. They helped, but as soon as I stopped, the same problems came back. These issues have been ongoing since I started the treatment.

In the long run, I know this can’t be sustainable, even if I don’t *feel* tired, my body definitely needs rest.

**Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to go back to normal? Or do you have any tips for coping with this?**

The sleeping pills I took are recommended to use only 1 week, and I defintely don't want to depend on them in the long run! Also, I defintely know it's not hypomania, because 1) it doesn't last that long, and 2)I don't haev any other symptomes of when I was hypomanic (unbearable amount of energy, racing thoughts, excessive socialbility, etc).",2,1760881797.0,bipolar2,1,1.0,False
1oaq4m9,https://youtu.be/QyTs2-0leiI,4 Very Scary TRUE Midnight Long Haul Trucker Horror Stories,"# ""False Rescue"":

I’d been on the road for twelve hours straight, hauling a full load of lumber from Minnesota toward the Canadian border. The sun was sinking low, the light flattening into that golden haze that makes everything look quiet and distant. The town I was passing through felt half-asleep—just a handful of cars rolling down Main Street, a few porch lights flickering on early. I was bone-tired, running mostly on caffeine and habit, when I noticed her.

A girl stood on the shoulder of the highway, thumb out, backpack slung over one shoulder. She couldn’t have been more than sixteen. She wore denim shorts, a thin shirt, no jacket—completely unprepared for how quickly the air turned icy up here after sunset. I remembered what the old-timers always said: *Never pick up strangers.* Too many stories that started like this and ended ugly.

But something about her—small frame, nervous stance, the way she kept glancing down the empty road—made it hard to just keep driving. The nearest town was still miles off, and once the dark came down, she’d be alone out there. Against my better judgment, I slowed and pulled onto the shoulder.

She climbed up into the cab with a relieved smile. “Thanks so much,” she said, brushing her hair from her face. “I’m Katie. Got separated from my friends on a trip, and I just need to get to the next town over. My parents don’t even know I’m out here. I really don’t want to freak them out.”

“Tom,” I said, shifting back into gear. “You’re lucky I came by before dark. What happened?”

She gave a casual shrug, twisting a strand of her hair. “We were hiking. I wandered off the path, got turned around. By the time I found the road, they were gone. You’re the first one who stopped.”

She talked easily enough, and for a while, it felt normal—two strangers making small talk to fill the silence. She asked how long I’d been a trucker, if it ever got lonely.

“Sometimes,” I said. “But I’ve got the radio, my thoughts, the hum of the road. Beats sitting in an office all day.”

She laughed softly. “Still… doesn’t it ever scare you? Being out here alone?”

I chuckled. “Nah. The road’s the safest part. It’s people you gotta watch out for.”

When she smiled at that, it didn’t reach her eyes.

Twilight crept in fast. The sky bruised purple, the road a gray ribbon stretching endlessly through fields and forest. She shifted beside me. “Do you have any water?”

“Yeah,” I said, grabbing a bottle from the cooler behind the seat and passing it over. She took a slow sip, eyes fixed on the horizon.

Then suddenly, she straightened. “Wait—slow down.”

I eased off the gas. Up ahead, something was sprawled across both lanes. Three shapes. People. Lying motionless.

“What the hell…” I muttered. No wrecked car, no lights, no skid marks. Just bodies, pale and still under the dying light.

“Looks like an accident,” Katie said, voice tight. “We have to help them.”

Every instinct told me to stop—but something didn’t add up. It was too clean, too staged. I’d heard the stories: fake accidents, highway setups, traps for truckers.

I kept my foot hovering above the brake. “We’ll call it in,” I said finally, reaching for the radio mic. “Let the state patrol handle it.”

“No!” she snapped, sharper than I expected. “You don’t have time for that. They might be dying.”

Her tone wasn’t panicked—it was commanding. My stomach sank.

“I’ll just get help started,” I said, keying the mic. “This is Tom, northbound on Route 61—got possible injured parties on the road, sending coordinates now—”

Before I could finish, she lunged for the radio, yanking at the cord. “Stop! Don’t call anyone! We can handle this ourselves!”

“What the hell are you doing?” I shoved her back, fighting to keep control as the truck swerved slightly.

Her eyes had changed. No more friendly kid—just cold calculation. “Turn around,” she said, low and steady. “My friends are waiting.”

“Your *friends*?” I said, heart hammering. In the mirror, one of the “bodies” ahead suddenly sat up, looking right at us before scrambling to the side of the road. Not injured at all.

That’s when it hit me. The setup. The hitchhiker. The “accident.”

“You’re in on this,” I said quietly.

She smiled then—a sharp, unsettling grin. “Just pull over at the next spot, and no one gets hurt.”

Not a chance. I pressed the accelerator instead. The truck roared forward, and she realized I wasn’t stopping. She started shouting, pounding the dashboard. “Let me out! Right now!”

“Not happening,” I said. My pulse was a drum in my ears. “We’re heading to the checkpoint up ahead.”

Her expression flickered, panic flashing behind her defiance. “You can’t take me there,” she said. “Please. Don’t let them see me.”

But I kept going. And then I saw the flashing lights ahead—the border checkpoint. Relief hit like oxygen after drowning.

Two officers stepped forward as I rolled to a stop. Flashlights caught my face, then hers.

“Evening,” one said. “License and logs, please.”

I handed them over, nodding toward Katie. “Picked her up hitchhiking. Said she was lost. Then I ran into… something weird back there. People on the road.”

Before the officer could reply, Katie burst into tears. “He forced me in! He wouldn’t let me go!”

I froze. For a second, even I almost believed her—the performance was that good. But the cops didn’t flinch. They’d seen it before. One radioed in, while the other motioned us both out.

Within minutes, the truth came out. “Katie” wasn’t Katie at all. Her real name was Corey—seventeen, escaped from a nearby youth facility with five others. The three lying across the road were part of her crew, trying to ambush the first truck that stopped.

“You got lucky,” one officer told me later, as they loaded her into the back of a cruiser. She fought and screamed the whole time, kicking the door hard enough to make it rattle. “If you’d pulled over, they’d have had you. They were armed with knives.”

They questioned me for hours, checked the truck, made sure my story matched up. When they finally cleared me, the lot was empty except for my rig and the lingering echo of that girl’s voice, still shouting from inside the patrol car.

I drove through the night, hands tight on the wheel. The road looked the same, but it didn’t *feel* the same. Every shadow seemed to breathe, every flicker of headlights made my chest tighten.

I’ve hauled thousands of miles since then—but I never stopped for a hitchhiker again.

Because out here, you learn fast: the real danger doesn’t always hide in the dark. Sometimes, it smiles and thanks you for the ride.





# ""Road Pirate"":

I was rolling west down Interstate 40, hauling a load of electronics from Tulsa to Phoenix. Midnight had come and gone, and the desert highway stretched ahead like a black ribbon under a washed-out moon. I’d been driving for hours — just me, the low hum of the engine, and the rhythmic thump of tires against asphalt. The world felt empty, stripped down to headlights, yellow lines, and shadows that seemed to move when I wasn’t looking.

The CB radio crackled every now and then — distant voices, truckers passing through other states, talking about weather, fuel prices, or some diner two hundred miles away. It was comforting noise, the kind that made you feel less alone out there in all that dark space.

Then, out of nowhere, a voice cut through clear as crystal:  
“Breaker, breaker — red semi with the blue cab. You copy?”

I reached for the mic, surprised. My rig, *Red Runner*, was pretty distinctive, but it wasn’t common for someone to call me out specifically.  
“Yeah, this is Red Runner,” I said. “What’s up?”

The reply came low and rough, like gravel in a throat that had smoked too many cigarettes.  
“Saw you back at the last fuel stop. Nice rig you got. Bet that load’s worth a fortune.”

I frowned. The last stop had been nearly an hour ago — a lonely gas station near the state line with flickering lights and one sleepy attendant. I didn’t remember anyone hanging around.  
“Appreciate it,” I said cautiously. “You need something?”

The voice chuckled — slow and deliberate, like he was savoring it. “Nah, just admiring. You alone tonight? No partner riding shotgun?”

Something about the question made my skin crawl. “Yeah,” I said. “Solo run. Why?”

“Good to know,” he murmured. “Desert gets lonely. Ever pick up riders?”

I hesitated. The CB static filled the silence between us. “Not my thing. Stay safe out there.”

I hung the mic back up and turned the volume down. My gut told me something wasn’t right. A few minutes passed. Then, the radio hissed again.

“Red Runner,” the voice drawled. “You got nice tires on that rig. Look brand new. Wouldn’t want one to go flat out here.”

My fingers tightened around the wheel. My tires *were* new — two days old, installed in Oklahoma City. No one could’ve known that unless they’d seen me up close. I checked my mirrors. The night behind me was a stretch of black nothing. No headlights. No movement.

“Who is this?” I said into the mic. “You following me?”

That same chuckle, lower now. “Maybe. Or maybe I’m ahead. Why don’t you pull off at the next exit, and we’ll chat face to face?”

“Not interested,” I snapped.

“Come on,” he coaxed. “I know you’re tired. Saw you yawn at the pump. Let’s share a cup of coffee. I got stories that’ll make your hair stand up.”

A cold sweat prickled down my neck. He *had* been there, watching. Maybe from the shadows, behind a pump, or sitting in a parked car. My heart thudded faster. I pushed the rig to seventy-five, the diesel roaring against the desert wind.

For twenty long minutes, silence. Just the highway again, stretching forever. I started to think maybe it was a prank — some bored driver with nothing better to do.

Then I saw them. Headlights in the rearview mirror — faint, then brighter, then too close. A dark sedan, no markings, high beams flickering in a strange rhythm.

The CB came alive again.  
“See me now, Red Runner? Nice and close.”

“Back off,” I barked. “I don’t know what you want, but I’m not stopping.”

“Oh, but you are,” the voice said. “Pull over. Let’s see what you’re hauling.”

A pulse of fear shot through me. I’d heard stories about road pirates — guys who scouted truck stops, targeted lone drivers with valuable cargo. Some were thieves. Some just… weren’t right in the head.

The sedan crept alongside my trailer, pacing me perfectly. Its windows were pitch black. It edged closer until the wheels scraped the lane divider, trying to nudge me toward the shoulder.

“Hey!” I yelled into the mic. “Back off before someone gets hurt!”

The laughter that followed was hollow, distorted through the speaker. “Don’t make this harder than it has to be.”

My adrenaline spiked. Up ahead, a sign flashed: **Rest Area — 5 Miles**. If I could make it there, maybe there’d be lights, cameras, other drivers. I pressed the pedal down, engine screaming.

The sedan dropped back — then slammed into my rear bumper. The impact jolted the cab so hard my teeth clacked together. I gripped the wheel, wrestling the rig straight.

“Stop that!” I shouted.

“That’s the idea,” he said coolly. “Pull over, or I’ll make you.”

I could smell burning rubber. Three miles. My mirrors showed his headlights steady, relentless. Two miles. I prayed another trucker might be ahead. One mile. I spotted the faint glow of streetlights — salvation.

I took the exit hard, tires screeching, the trailer swaying dangerously. The sedan followed.

The rest area was small — a few parking spots, a bathroom building, one vending machine humming in the corner. But there was another semi parked at the far end, engine idling.

I pulled up fast, slammed on the brakes, locked my doors. My hands shook as I grabbed the tire iron from under the seat. The phone barely had service, but I punched in 911 anyway.

“Come on, come on,” I muttered.

Behind me, the sedan stopped. The door opened. A man stepped out — tall, lean, dressed in dark clothes. His hat brim cast his face in shadow. He walked toward my cab like he had all the time in the world.

“Get out,” he called, his voice the same one from the CB. “We need to talk.”

“No way,” I shouted. “Stay back!”

He smiled faintly. “You think that iron’s gonna save you? I’ve done this before. Easy pickings on lonely nights.”

My call connected. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“There’s a guy harassing me — I-40 rest area, mile marker 212. He’s been following me and trying to ram my truck. Send help, please!”

He heard me. His grin widened. “Cops? Out here? You’ll be bones before they show.” He pulled a knife — long, gleaming under the rest area lights.

Before I could react, headlights flared behind him. The other semi’s engine revved, its horn blaring like a thunderclap. A big man climbed out, shouting, “Hey! What’s going on over there?”

The stranger froze, turning toward him.

“Nothing,” he said smoothly. “Just a chat.”

“Doesn’t look like it,” the other driver said, shining a flashlight on him. “You okay, buddy?”

“Yeah!” I called, heart pounding. “He’s been stalking me for miles!”

The man hesitated — then slipped the knife into his jacket pocket, his smile gone. “Fine,” he muttered. “Your loss.” He got back into his car, slammed the door, and sped off into the dark, gravel spitting from his tires.

The other trucker came closer, eyes wide. “You all right? That guy looked like trouble.”

I nodded shakily. “Thanks for stepping in. He was trying to force me off the road.”

“Seen types like that before,” he said grimly. “Road pirates. They pick their marks — solo runs, late nights, easy cargo. You call it in?”

“Yeah. They’re sending a trooper.”

We waited together, both of us keeping an eye on the road. Fifteen minutes later, a patrol car pulled up. I gave my statement, described the car — black sedan, dented front bumper. The trooper nodded. “We’ve had reports on him. Targets truckers, sometimes gets violent. You’re lucky you didn’t pull over.”

That night, I checked into a cheap motel nearby. Couldn’t sleep. Every headlight outside made me tense.

By morning, I heard over the CB that they’d caught the guy at a checkpoint. Knife, duct tape, stolen electronics, even a gun. He’d done it three times that month. One of his victims hadn’t walked away.

I still haul freight, but I take different routes now. I keep the CB off at night. And when my gut tells me something’s wrong, I listen.

Because out there, in the black miles between towns, there are worse things than loneliness waiting on the road.





# ""The Other Driver"":

I pulled my big rig off the interstate just past midnight, the hum of the engine fading as I coasted into a lonely rest area somewhere in western Nebraska. The highway behind me was a black ribbon stretching into forever, not a single pair of headlights for miles. I’d been driving twelve hours straight, and fatigue was starting to gnaw at the edges of my focus. I figured I’d stretch my legs, sip some coffee from my thermos, and give the straps on my load a quick check before pushing on through the night.

The rest stop was small—two cracked parking spots, a couple of battered picnic tables, and a flickering sodium lamp that threw everything into a sickly orange glow. The place felt wrong the moment I stopped. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that swallows sound.

Another truck sat at the far end of the lot—a weathered blue Kenworth, paint faded to chalk, no company name or DOT numbers on the side. The cab was dark, no sign of movement. I figured the driver was inside catching sleep.

When I stepped out of my cab, the night air hit me sharp and cold. I stretched, joints popping, and started my usual routine—walking the length of the trailer, tugging on the straps. That’s when I saw it.

Near the edge of the lot, just beyond the halo of the lights, something dark smeared across the concrete, glistening faintly. Oil, I thought. Probably leaked from some junker that parked here earlier. But when I crouched closer and hit it with my flashlight, my stomach dropped. It wasn’t oil. The color was wrong—thicker, darker, red with that wet sheen that only one thing has.

Blood. Fresh.

I followed the trail with my light until it disappeared beneath a low bush near the picnic area. That’s when I saw it—the outline of a shoe sticking out from the shadows. A small sneaker, white with a pink stripe, smeared with dirt. Still attached to a foot.

My breath caught. “Oh, Jesus…”

I brushed the branches aside, my hand shaking. A young woman lay half on her side, half face-down, eyes wide open, staring at nothing. Her clothes were torn, her neck bruised dark and ugly. She couldn’t have been more than twenty.

My brain tried to make sense of it. Maybe an accident. Maybe she’d fallen. But deep down, I knew. There was nothing accidental about this.

I stumbled back, fumbling for my phone. No bars. Of course not—middle of nowhere. My pulse pounded so loud I could barely think.

“Hello?” I shouted, my voice cracking. “Anyone here?”

Silence. Just the wind against the trees.

I bolted for my cab, locked the doors, and grabbed the CB mic. “Breaker, breaker, this is Big Red, eastbound on I-80, near mile marker 250. I got a situation—found a body at the rest area. Need help ASAP. Over.”

Static filled the cab for a long moment. Then a low voice came through, rough and unhurried. “Say again, Big Red? You found a what?”

“A body. A woman. She’s dead.”

The man chuckled faintly, a dry sound that made my skin crawl. “You sure she’s not just drunk, sleeping it off?”

“Listen, I know what I saw. She’s dead. Call it in if you can hear me.”

Another pause. Then: “Alright, buddy. I’ll handle it. Stay put.”

I sat there, staring at the dark Kenworth across the lot. Its engine coughed to life, headlights flashing briefly before going dark again. A door creaked open.

A man climbed down—tall, broad-shouldered, flannel shirt hanging loose, jeans dusty from the road. He moved with a slow, deliberate confidence. The kind that doesn’t come from fear.

“You the one on the CB?” he asked, stopping a few feet from my window. The glow from the light caught his face—scruff, a baseball cap pulled low, and a long scar running down his cheek.

“Yeah,” I said, keeping my doors locked tight. “Did you call the cops?”

He nodded, looking toward the bushes. “Sure did. They’ll be here soon.” He turned back to me. “What’d you see exactly?”

My mouth went dry. “A woman. Looked like she was strangled. Clothes torn. You didn’t hear anything?”

He shrugged. “Been sleeping. Long haul from Texas. Name’s Tom.”

“Bill,” I lied automatically.

Tom lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in his eyes. “These highways get rough after dark. Lotta folks pick up hitchhikers. Sometimes it goes bad.”

I forced a nod, trying to sound casual. “You see any tonight?”

“Yeah,” he said, exhaling smoke through his nose. “Blonde girl, red jacket. Pretty thing. Offered her a ride. She said no. Guess she had other plans.”

My stomach twisted. The girl by the bush had blonde hair. Red jacket.

He must’ve seen the change in my face, because he smiled—a slow, humorless stretch of his lips. “You alright, Bill? You look like you seen a ghost.”

“I’m fine,” I said, though my voice trembled. “Just waiting for the cops.”

Tom’s grin widened. “You sure they’re coming? Out here, it can take hours.”

He turned and walked back toward his truck, flicking the cigarette into the dirt. The ember hissed out. He climbed in but didn’t shut the door. Just sat there, engine rumbling, lights off. Watching.

I tried the phone again. Still nothing. My chest felt tight, the kind of fear that gets inside your ribs and won’t let go.

I started the rig. The engine’s roar felt like the only solid thing in the world. I threw it in gear and rolled out of the lot. In the mirror, the blue Kenworth came alive, headlights snapping on, high beams flooding my cab.

Over the CB, his voice returned, colder now. “Where you going, Bill? Thought we were waiting together.”

“I need signal,” I said, keeping my tone even.

“Signal, huh? You didn’t touch anything back there, did you?”

My heart pounded. “No.”

“Good,” he said. “Wouldn’t want prints on something that isn’t yours.”

The words hit me like ice water. I floored it. The highway stretched out, black and endless. His rig stayed on me, lights burning in my mirrors.

“Tell me,” he said softly over the radio, “you ever pick up strays, Bill? Girls who need a ride?”

“No,” I lied.

“Good. You never know what you’ll find in your truck when the sun comes up.”

I saw lights ahead—a gas station, maybe two miles off. I swerved into the exit lane, tires howling. Tom followed, but slower this time.

I parked by the pumps where a couple of cars sat, people moving inside under bright fluorescent light. My phone buzzed to life—two bars.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I didn’t look away from the road. “This is Bill Turner, I found a murdered woman at the rest stop off I-80, mile marker 250. There’s a man following me—blue Kenworth, driver named Tom, scar on his face. I think he’s the one.”

Tom’s truck idled at the edge of the lot, his silhouette barely visible. After a long moment, he revved the engine once and pulled away, vanishing into the dark Nebraska night.

When the police arrived twenty minutes later, they confirmed what I already knew. The girl was dead—strangled, matching the description of a missing hitchhiker from two states over. They ran the name, the truck, the scar. Turned out “Tom” wasn’t Tom at all. He’d been using fake credentials for years, bouncing from state to state. A drifter. A ghost.

They caught him three days later in Kansas. His cab was a nightmare—bloodstains under the mattress, hair caught in the vent, duct tape and rope hidden in the sleeper. He’d done it before.

Now, whenever I’m parked on a dark stretch of interstate and see headlights pull in behind me, I can’t help but think of that night. The hum of a diesel engine. The flicker of a lighter.  
And a voice on the CB, low and calm, asking, *“You sure she’s not just sleeping it off?”*





# ""The Red Rig"":

I’ve been a long-haul trucker for twelve years now. Crossed most of the country—north, south, coast to coast—hauling everything from furniture to steel, machine parts, and produce. It’s a good life if you can stand the solitude. The road becomes your home, the hum of the tires your heartbeat. But those long nights—those stretches of blacktop where it’s just you and the endless dark—sometimes they start to feel like something’s watching from out there.

There’s one trip I’ll never forget. The kind that changed how I look at every rest area and unmarked rig I pass. It was a routine haul from Chicago to Denver, trailer full of auto parts. I left just after sunset, planning to push through the night to make good time.

By the time I crossed into Iowa, the world had gone flat and empty. The moon hung low, dull and pale over the fields, and the highway stretched out like a ribbon with no end. My eyes burned from staring into the dark, the yellow lines blurring together. I decided to pull off for a few minutes, just to stretch, pour another cup of coffee, and clear my head.

The rest area I found was small—one of those lonely little pull-offs that feel forgotten by time. A flickering sign. A cracked sidewalk leading to a squat restroom building. The air smelled like dust and diesel. There were only two rigs parked there: mine and another—an older red semi with no markings, sitting under the only working sodium light. The glow made the paint look wet, like fresh blood.

I figured the other driver was sleeping. Most of us do when we can. I shut off my engine, grabbed my thermos, and stepped out. The night was silent except for the far-off moan of traffic and the ticking of my cooling engine. The kind of quiet that feels too big, too hollow.

That’s when I heard footsteps.

I turned and saw a man walking toward me from the direction of the red rig. Tall—had to be six-four, easy—and built heavy, like someone who’d spent his life hauling chains and tires. His jeans were dark with grease stains, and a faded flannel hung loose over a barrel chest. He wore a cap pulled low, shadowing his face, but his grin caught the light when he lifted a hand in greeting.

“Hey, buddy,” he called out, voice rough like gravel. “You got a minute? My rig’s acting up—battery, I think. Won’t turn over.”

I nodded automatically. Out here, we help each other. It’s a kind of unspoken code. “Yeah, sure. Let’s take a look.”

He led me around to the front of his truck. The hood was already open. I leaned in with my flashlight, expecting to see corrosion or loose cables—but the engine was spotless. Cleaner than mine by far. That was the first thing that felt off. The second was the smell. Faint, metallic, sharp—like copper or rust.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the cab door hanging slightly open. Inside, on the passenger seat, sat a duffel bag, half unzipped. Coils of rope spilled out, tangled with rolls of duct tape. At first, I told myself it made sense—cargo securement gear, maybe—but there was too much of it. Too neat. Too deliberate.

He must’ve seen me looking, because his tone shifted like a knife sliding out of a sheath. “You see something you like?”

I straightened up slowly. “Just checking connections. Might be a bad wire.”

His grin vanished. “You don’t need to go nowhere. We can figure it out together.”

Something in the way he said it—soft, but final—made my skin crawl. My gut told me to move, to get away, but I forced a calm smile. “Tell you what,” I said, “I got better tools in my rig. Give me a sec.”

He stepped forward, blocking my path. “You’re not listening, friend. Stay here.”

His eyes were dead flat in the dim light—like something cold was staring out from behind them.

He kept talking as he moved closer, his words spilling faster, his tone turning almost casual again. “You know, I pick up hitchhikers sometimes. Keeps the nights from feeling so damn long. Last one was a young woman, outta Omaha. Talked a lot. Pretty thing.”

My chest tightened. “That right?”

“Yeah,” he said, smiling again. “People go missing all the time on these highways. Most folks don’t even notice.”

He laughed—a dry, low sound that made my blood run cold.

That’s when I saw it. On the floor of the cab, half in shadow, a dark stain. Thick. Dried. And beside it, a small shoe. Women’s. Torn strap.

Everything in me locked up for half a second. Then instinct kicked in. I stepped back. “I think your alternator’s bad,” I said evenly. “Best call it in.”

Before I could turn, his hand shot out, grabbing my arm. His grip was vice-strong. “You’re not going anywhere yet,” he rasped. “We just started talking.”

“Let go,” I said, voice rising.

He didn’t.

I wrenched free and bolted. My boots pounded the asphalt as he shouted behind me. I dove into my cab, slammed the door, locked it, and hit the ignition. The diesel roared to life as his fist smashed against the glass. His face pressed to the window, twisted and furious.

“Open up!” he yelled. “We ain’t done!”

I threw it in gear and peeled out, tires screaming. My trailer fishtailed before catching traction. In the mirror, I saw him sprinting back to his rig. Headlights flared on behind me.

He was following.

The next hour was a nightmare of flashing lights and roaring engines. The red semi stayed right on me, closing the distance, his headlights flaring in my mirrors like the eyes of something feral. I pushed the rig harder than I ever had, hitting ninety, maybe more.

I grabbed my CB, switched to Channel 19. My voice shook as I called out:  
“Breaker one-nine, this is Big Blue westbound on I-80 near marker 250. Got a red semi tailing me hard—possible assault, maybe worse. Anyone copy?”

A moment’s static. Then a woman’s voice crackled through: “Copy, Big Blue. You safe?”

“He tried to grab me. Think he’s wanted. Saw blood in his cab.”

Another voice joined—deep, calm. “Silver Pete here, ten miles ahead. I’ll slow down, box him in.”

Truckers started chiming in one after another, coordinating like a convoy. They kept me talking, kept me grounded as my hands shook on the wheel. The red rig rammed my trailer once—hard enough to make my teeth slam together.

“He’s hitting me!” I shouted.

“We got you, Blue,” the woman said. “Cops are rolling your way.”

Up ahead, I saw headlights—two rigs side by side. The Peterbilt with logs, and another flatbed behind him. I pulled alongside, and together, they boxed the red truck in. He swerved, tried to push through, but they held the line. Then the sirens came. Blue and red lights flashing across the fields.

I kept driving until I saw troopers swarm him, guns drawn. Then I pulled over at the next exit and just sat there, hands trembling, heart pounding against my ribs like it wanted out.

Later, the cops told me the truth. The man was wanted in three states—kidnapping, murder, the whole list. They found photos, jewelry, IDs, and human remains hidden in a compartment behind his cab. That shoe I saw? It belonged to a missing hitchhiker from Nebraska.

I still drive those same roads. Still haul freight through the night. But I don’t stop at the small rest areas anymore. I stick to truck stops with people, cameras, and light.

Out there, on those long stretches of empty highway, it’s not the loneliness that’ll get you. It’s the things hiding in the dark beside it.  
And sometimes… they wear a trucker’s smile.",1,1760881784.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

For my wife he will sleep peacefully in his bassinet during her shift, waking only to eat and even is calm during his diaper changes. She gets to relax at her computer, play her new favorite game ( a game called town to city), and even nap.

Me? Cries whenever he’s put down, will NOT sleep in his bassinet, throws a tantrum when changed. And he also seems to have it out for me whenever I think he actually is sleeping. 

For example I’ll feed him, change him, burp him, and he seems to be passed out. I’ll lay him in his bassinet and sit down, but the moment I do anything, and I mean anything, he wakes up and throws a fit. Example: my wife bought me the new battlefield game, and the moment I even touch the ps5 controller he wakes up throwing a fit until I pick him up and lay him on my chest. 

I can’t make coffee, go to the bathroom, or anything. Can’t even throw something in the microwave. 

For some reason he’s addicted to sleeping on my chest, and my wife gets mad when he starts throwing temper tantrums that wake her up so I’m stuck here literally holding him, hungry, needing to use the bathroom, staring at the ceiling for 4 hours until my wife wakes up from her shift then he turns into a perfect angel again.

Personally on the Discovery Princess last year on a Halloween cruise, I had a stateroom attendant scold me for putting my food tray in the hallway outside my cabin, stating it's a trip hazard. He knocked on my door really hard and when I opened the door he asked me if the tray was mine. I said yes then he told me someone could trip and and that I should have left it in my cabin. Then he angrily walked away with the tray somewhere.

I found an article that touched on this subject.

By Melissa Mayntz

Key Aspects:

What should cruise guests do with trash as they’re walking around a Carnival cruise ship? There are no trash cans in sight.
John Heald, Carnival Cruise Line’s brand ambassador, has explained why it’s easier for the cruise line to not have public trash cans available to guests.
Guests have different options available for trash disposal, depending where on the ship they are and what type of trash they have to discard.
While everyone’s standards for cleaning up at home may be different, consider this: would you leave dirty dishes of half-eaten food in the hallway? Drop towels on the floor for someone else to pick up? Discard an empty paper cup on a random surface or corner and walk away?

On a cruise vacation, these things are not only commonplace, but expected as dedicated crew members work diligently to tidy up, deeply clean, and effectively sanitize the ship.

One curious guest reached out to John Heald, Carnival Cruise Line’s brand ambassador, with a question about trash collection and why a very commonplace item is absent from Carnival’s ships.

“I’m currently on the Paradise for the fifth time and yesterday I noticed something that I haven’t noticed before. I’m sure there is a reason for it but why are there no trash cans around?” the guest asked.

“I went from the United States Bar on Deck 9 to the gym on Deck 12 carrying an empty coffee cup from Java Blue. Finally found a can in the men’s locker room. It’s not a big deal – just curious.”

That’s a questions I’ve been curious about myself, and it isn’t confined to Carnival Cruise Line. While some different cruise lines do have discreet trash cans, often near elevator banks, most ships lack this simple and seemingly basic accessory.

Carnival Paradise, currently homeported from Tampa and offering 4-, 5-, and 6-night itineraries, is one of Carnival’s smallest ships but even with just 2,124 guests aboard, that can still lead to a lot of trash on every sailing.

Heald, however, carefully explained why trash cans aren’t available. It’s not about making the ships seem as though there is no trash about: every cruise guest has seen discarded trash on tables, in hallways, and even in the corners of elevators.

“The answer is very simple,” Heald noted. “Through various government agencies we have very strict policies on garbage separation. It is a mammoth task and if we failed to separate the garbage correctly, there are big fines for us to pay.”

Okay, that makes sense. Different countries would have different regulations on how trash is separated, treated, and disposed of, from food waste to contaminated paper to broken glass to all manner of little things. Plastic tags taken off souvenirs, candy wrappers, empty sunscreen bottles, it must all be treated carefully.

“While the crew are trained in garbage separation, the guests are obviously not,” Heald continued. “It would cause us so much more work if we allowed guests just to throw their garbage away.”

It’s a simple explanation but one that does make sense. If a trash can were to become contaminated, all the refuse might need to be further sorted and treated in different ways before it could be properly and safely discarded, creating even more work for the crew.

How Should Guests Dispose of Trash?
Without trash cans every few feet, what should guests do with any garbage? Of course, trash cans are available in every stateroom and restroom, and as the original poster notes, in the locker rooms.

Heald has previously confirmed that guests should put dirty room service plates in the stateroom corridors for crew members to pick up. Not only does this keep food waste trash separated from say, bathroom waste, but it also ensures the dishes are cleaned and put back into service as quickly as possible.

If guests are carrying disposable cups, napkins, or other trash, they can stop by a bar to ask for it to be thrown away, or place the items on a closed bar surface or nearby table so it can be easily seen and collected for disposal.

Preferably, trash should not be placed in tucked away corners (I’ve never understood leaving dirty cocktail glasses in an elevator) where crew members might not  sp ot it right away. This should not be a game of hide-and-seek with trash.

Of course, no trash should ever be tossed overboard, and guests would face strict consequences such as fines and other penalties if they discarded garbage in that way.

I started on 25 mg and gradually increased to 200 mg (100 mg twice a day) a month ago.

**On the good side:**  
Overall, my mood is very stable while still allowing me to feel joyful or sad when appropriate, instead of the crazy lows of depression and the highs of hypomania.  
I also still feel able to function normally intellectually,  no major problems with memory or concentration.

**On the bad side:**  
I've been having very vivid dreams, and I wake up 2–3 times a night, mostly because of nightmares. One time I even had intense night sweats, the first time in my life that I can remember having those!

Additionally, I’ve noticed a decreased need for sleep. I used to sleep easily for 7–8 hours when stable, but now I barely sleep 4-5 hours a night. The weird part is that I’m not tired at all during the day. I keep yawning though, like my body’s telling me it’s tired, but I don’t actually *feel* sleepy (which never happened before).

Honestly, it’s been kind of useful. I don’t need coffee or anything and I’m awake and functional all day. I even pulled an all-nighter once and only needed a 2-hour nap the next day.

I tried sleeping pills for a week. They helped, but as soon as I stopped, the same problems came back. These issues have been ongoing since I started the treatment.

In the long run, I know this can’t be sustainable, even if I don’t *feel* tired, my body definitely needs rest.

**Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to go back to normal? Or do you have any tips for coping with this?**

The sleeping pills I took are recommended to use only 1 week, and I defintely don't want to depend on them in the long run!  
Also, I defintely know it's not hypomania, because 1) it doesn't last that long, and 2)I don't haev any other symptomes of when I was hypomanic (unbearable amount of energy, racing thoughts, excessive socialbility, etc). ",1,1760881365.0,lamictal,0,1.0,False

His irk certainly had to do with the fact that Madonna was objectifying herself. She was in control and making money off of it. He later landed an interview with her in 1996 after the release of “Something To Remember” for his SPIN magazine, where he acknowledged her resilience and stated, “Our initail ifatuation and torrid love affair has grown into a decade-long marriage, in which we’ve been thrilled and dissapointed, often to extremes, but we’ve settled together.” 

Reviews were mixed here in the states and abroad (Australia, United Kingdom). The piece on Madonna being a revolutionary was excellent as M. Scot fired back at critics of the book calling it boring with “as if it’s perfectly routine for a pop superstar an explicit sex book with sadomasochistic and homoerotic imagery.”

Just one. “Crash Landing on You.” He cried during the confession scene, looked me dead in the eyes, and whispered, “They just understand emotions differently over there.”

I thought, Cool, he’s moved by storytelling. WRONG.

By the next morning, he’d downloaded Duolingo, renamed himself S!LAS (시라스) on Instagram, and started ending texts with “ㅋㅋㅋㅋ.”

He’s walking around the house wearing oversized sweaters, ripped jeans, and a headband that says “BORN TO STAN.” He even replaced all our framed photos with minimalist posters that just say things like hope, vibe, and kimchi.

He refuses to eat anything unless it’s got gochujang in it. He made bibimbap once and said, “I feel connected to my culture,” and I had to remind him he’s literally from Ohio.

Last night I caught him in the mirror practicing his “idol smile.” You know, that thing where they tilt their head, blink slowly, and pretend to be shy about their own existence. He said he’s “debuting soon.”

I asked, “Debuting where??”
He said, “You’ll see.”

He also made a “fan sign event” in our living room where he sat behind the coffee table and made me line up (alone) to receive a signed Polaroid. He charged me $5 for it.

The Roomba now plays K-pop. The cat’s name is suddenly “Mochi.”
He even bowes before microwaving food now.

UPDATE: He’s started referring to me as “his manager.” He told me I “don’t understand the industry.” I caught him giving himself a skin-care routine that costs more than rent.

SECOND UPDATE: I just woke up to him filming a TikTok dance to a BTS song in full LED lighting, shirt half tucked in, yelling, “ONE TAKE LET’S GOOO.”

Argh!,"We have a 6 1/2 month old mixed breed puppy who we've had since she was 2-3 months old.  She rarely EVER had accidents in the house, but we were diligent about taking her outside every half hour, then every hour.  She was in a large ""playpen"" area (about 15 square feet) for enforced naps and never once had an accident there, or in the crate where she spends her nights.  During the day, she would either be running around in the room that me or my husband were in or long-leashed to the living room coffee table at night when we were watching TV.

Since she's now almost 7 months, we decided to expand her territory.  We gave her access to the hallway and one bedroom, plus she was allowed to be in the kitchen if we were in the living room (basically a big L).  

She ALWAYS goes to the door and whimpers to go out when she has to defecate.  ALWAYS.  But she's very inconsistent with urination.  Although she STILL goes outside at least once an hour, she will still go into the kitchen and urinate on the floor several times a week.  We don't scold her, just clean it up and try to take her out more frequently.

How can we break this bad habit?  I am SO tired of tripping over baby gates everywhere and I'm really motivated for her to be trained so she can roam free!

I'm paranoid because our last dog was NEVER potty trained.  She'd been abused by multiple owners before we adopted her and she remained high strung and skittish her whole life (another 10-12 years).  We worked with a trainer but we were never able to train her to do anything.  She was just too anxious.  DItto with the potty training...so we just committed to taking her outside every 2 hours...for years.  She just never caught on and I don't want that to happen again!

Back November 2023, I started getting acid reflux which was triggered by drinking iced black coffee everytime I start my work without eating anything. By Dec 2023, my gastro suggested to do endoscopy and colonoscopy. Results came back with clear colonoscopy and got a grade A esophagitis. I was given PPI’s and was asked to take it for a month. Then I went back to the gastro, but that’s the last time coz I don’t like him. Zero compassion, concern, he just check you 1 min, then you’re done.

After a month, all went well. But after a couple of months, symptoms came back. Had chest pains and all, which made gave me anxiety attacks, multiple visits to the ER, etc. Had myself visit a cardiologist. After multiple visits and tests (which I had a lot bec I was not convinced that I don’t have heart problems) came back normal, ECG, 2d echo, holter monitor, treadmill stress test..

After a couple of months, around Aug 2024, I decided to consult a psych for my mental health. Got prescribed with anti-depressants, was asked to take it for 6 months. Within that time, my acid reflux actually improved, there were still some times that I had to take PPI’s for  a week coz of food triggers (I get it, I’m too stubborn, coz I love spicy food). Fast forward to 6 months, got rid of my anxiety disorder!

After the anxiety medications, the acid reflux and chest pains just keep coming back! Went back to gastro multiple times, getting treated by PPI’s, but after a few weeks of getting off of it, the symptoms just keep coming back. 

Now we’re at Oct. 2025, I went back to the gastro. He changed my meds from Pantoprazole+Domperidone to Rabeprazole. The pantoprazole combo was really working for me before but it just comes back after getting off of it.

Right now, my symptoms became a bit frequent than before. I am getting left chest pain/discomfort at some parts, below the left clavicle, left side of the left nipple, at my lower left ribs. Mid chest at the left of sternum. I get the urge to press these parts or put pressure on them. Sometimes I had to press my nipple just to get comfort. Oh and one important thing, I sometimes get relief when I force myself to burp (which I’ve been doing for the longest time since my youth. I can burp the whole alphabet).

My gastro scheduled me for an endoscopy in 4 days. But now I am concerned, is still because of GERD or something entirely different? I feel like my anxiety is coming back because here I am again, checking my blood pressure and heart rate from time to time thinking I will have a heart attack anytime soon. :(",1,1760880948.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Last Christmas she gave me a trip to Windup and a watch purchase at the fair. Neither of us found a ton of good info online about it before, so I’m going to throw some info out there for people in the future!

You don’t need tickets, it’s free. They have a capacity inside, and seems like they have a line at most times so they only let people in as people come out. We waited on Saturday about 45 min to get in, but once inside it was super manageable, rarely had to wait more than a few minutes to get hands on with any watch. We spent about 2/2.5 hours inside, and it’s wild just how open it all is. You can walk up to any brand, pickup and try on watches, talk to the brand ambassadors (or in many cases the owners it seemed), etc. The staff and attendees were all super nice, it felt like a great group of kind like minded people just excited to see all these products in person. 

Many brands sell product, but few seem to offer a discount at the fair. I picked up a Baltic Scalegraph classic, and they resized the bracelet for me during purchase. 

I wouldn’t say there was a ton of swag, but I did get a Baltic hat with my purchase. 

There’s a small cart of coffee and drinks, but no food. Bathrooms were fine, no real comment there. 

For some reason the layout is not alphabetical, so there seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to what brand was where. Easy to find what you want with a map though. Nowhere to sit either, there was like two small window benches, so that could be improved in the future. 

Did you go? Anything to add?

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Mathematically Dubious Love Affair**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even Vikings (the football team, not the medieval raiders) know math matters. The Eagles are the consensus favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.75-1.77** (-550 in American odds), implying a **56-57% chance to win**. The Vikings, meanwhile, sit at **2.10** (+210), suggesting bookmakers think they’re just a 32-33% shot. But here’s the twist: the spread tells a different story. Eagles are -1.5 to -2.5 points across books, meaning oddsmakers expect them to win by a field goal or so. If you’re betting the spread, the Eagles’ implied probability jumps to **\~53-55%**, while the Vikings’ cover chances hover around **45-47%**.

The total line is **43.5-44 points**, with the under slightly favored (1.91-1.95 odds). That’s key. Both teams have injury-riddled offenses: The Eagles’ J.J. McCarthy is out, and the Vikings’ Justin Jefferson is their only healthy receiver. Carson Wentz, Minnesota’s QB, is playing with a shoulder injury that makes him throw like a guy who just discovered gravity. Meanwhile, the Eagles’ defense, though leaky, might force enough 3-and-outs to keep the game low-scoring.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Ankle Sprains, and the Curse of the Bye Week**  
Minnesota’s QB situation is a Shakespearean tragedy. Carson Wentz, the “Iceman,” is now the “Iceman Cometh… But Maybe Not.” His shoulder injury isn’t throwing-related, but let’s be real—when your backup (J.J. McCarthy) is sidelined by a high ankle sprain, you’re basically playing with a third-stringer named “Hope for the Best.” The Vikings’ offense? A fragile house of cards. Their rushing game is anemic, and their offensive line looks like a group of accountants trying to tackle a coffee table.

The Eagles? They’re a team in transition. Saquon Barkley, their Swiss Army knife RB, is the closest thing to a guaranteed points machine, but even he’s not the same after a knee scope. The defense? A patchwork quilt of injured starters (Jalen Carter, Quinyon Mitchell) and guys who probably shouldn’t be near a NFL f

Got the Natty Dubs which are slowly caramelizing and two more on order, WC Siennas and a pair of Predator Pacifics. I think the TWF should round out the rotation nicely.

*Where the Bears Bring the Heat and the Saints Bring… Well, Let’s Not Get Too Hopeful*

---

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Chicago Bears (-4.0 to -4.5) are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.45-1.48** (implied probability: \~60-65%). That’s the statistical equivalent of a vending machine: you *expect* it to work, but you’ve learned not to trust it. Meanwhile, the Saints (+2.75-2.85) are the long shot, with implied probabilities of **34-35%**—about the same chance of flipping a coin and it landing on its edge.

The spread? The Bears are laying **3.5-4.5 points**, which feels like the NFL’s version of a “gentleman’s wager.” If you’re betting on Chicago, you’re not just picking a winner—you’re picking a *dominant* winner. The total line is locked at **44.5 points**, with both over and under priced at **1.90-1.91** (50-50 territory). Given the Bears’ recent 25-24 nail-biter and the Saints’ tendency to play tight games, this feels like a “low-scoring thriller” waiting to happen.

**News Digest: Saints’ Kicker Injured, Bears’ Defense Has a Former Boss Watching**  
Let’s start with the Saints’ kicker, **Cairo Santos**, who’s out with a thigh injury. Imagine a baker without a rolling pin—still capable of making bread, but suddenly less likely to nail that perfect croissant. The Saints’ backup kicker, **Jake Moody** (yes, the same guy who won the Bears’ game last week), is now their hope. Moody’s 4-of-5 heroics in Chicago’s win over Washington were the stuff of legend, but let’s not forget: he’s a *Bears* kicker. The Saints are now relying on a man who’s never kicked a field goal for them… and honestly, hasn’t kicked a field goal for anyone else either.

Then there’s **Dennis Allen**, the Bears’ defensive coordinator and former Saints head coach. This is like a disgruntled ex returning to your workplace to micromanage your coffee orders. The Saints’ offense, which ranks 27th in the league in points per game, now faces a defense that’s been terrorized by Allen’s scheming. The Bears’ defense has forced three turnovers in their last two games—imagine what they’ll do with a former boss lurking in the shadows, muttering, “I told you to bring more snacks to the meeting.”

*Where the Jets Are the ""Almost"" in ""Almost Bankrupt"" and the Panthers Are the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Defense!""*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Do Tease)

The Carolina Panthers (-1.5) are slight favorites over the winless New York Jets, with decimal odds hovering around 1.85-1.91 for Carolina and 1.95-2.0 for New York. Converting to implied probabilities:

* **Panthers**: \~53-55% chance to win (1 / 1.85 ≈ 54%).
* **Jets**: \~49-51% chance to win (1 / 1.95 ≈ 51%).

The spread is tight (-1.5 to -1.0 depending on the book), reflecting a low-scoring contest. The over/under sits at **40.5-41.5 points**, with the under slightly more enticing (odds: 1.91-1.98). Dimers’ simulation model backs this up, projecting a 22-19 Panthers win in a game where efficiency—not fireworks—will reign supreme.

**Key stat**: The Panthers’ defense has allowed just 17.3 points per game over their three-game winning streak, while the Jets’ offense, led by the inconsistent Justin Fields, ranks 28th in the league in passing yards.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Why the Jets Need a Miracle

* **Carolina’s Blessings**: The Panthers are riding a three-game win streak, including a 30-27 road win over the Dallas Cowboys. Bryce Young is playing like a Heisman finalist trapped in an NFL body, and their rushing attack (21st in the league) keeps defenses guessing.
* **New York’s Curses**: The Jets are 0-6, and their ""rebuilding"" narrative has devolved into a ""how many ways can a team lose?"" competition. Star wideout Garrett Wilson is out with a hamstring injury (he’ll likely blame ""a rogue shoelace""), and Fields’ decision-making has been so erratic, even the MetLife Stadium turf is filing for divorce.

**Absurd analogy**: The Jets’ offense is like a toaster that only pops half the time—present, but not useful. The Panthers? They’re the coffee maker that brews *and* froths, leaving the Jets w

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Carolina Panthers vs. New York Jets: A Tale of Two Time Zones (and One Very Confused Defense)**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery and Momentum**  
The Carolina Panthers (-1.5) enter this Week 7 clash as slight favorites, with moneyline odds hovering around -115 (implied probability: \~53.5%) across books like DraftKings and BetMGM. The New York Jets (+1.5) sit at +105, implying a 48.5% chance to pull off the unthinkable: a win. The over/under is a frugal 41 points, suggesting a defensive slugfest—perfect for a game where the Jets’ offense looks like a robot learning to walk and the Panthers’ defense has finally mastered the art of *not* looking like a robot.

Statistically, the Panthers own a 60% implied win probability per Dimers’ 10,000-simulation model, projecting a 22-19 victory. Their edge? A balanced attack led by Bryce Young’s improving play (18.5 avg. PPG) and a rushing game that’s as reliable as a Swiss watch (215 YPG). The Jets? Well, they’re the NFL’s version of a “60% chance of rain” forecast—optimistic but not trustworthy. Their 0-6 record isn’t just bad; it’s *mathematically* bad, with a putrid 14.3 PPG average and a defense that’s been shredded for 28.5 PPG.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Inconsistencies, and a Robot QB**  
The Jets’ woes deepen with star receiver Garrett Wilson sidelined (hamstring, sustained while tripping over his own ambition, per the *New York Post*). Without Wilson, they’re relying on Breece Hall (845 YPG, their lone bright spot) and Mason Rudolph (yes, *that* Mason Rudolph, not to be confused with the quarterback who retired in 2023). Meanwhile, Justin Fields is… well, he’s Justin Fields—half Pro Bowl talent, half “why is this man throwing to the third row?” mystery.

The Panthers? They’ve won three straight, including a 30-0 shutout of the Falcons that made Atlanta’s offense look like a team of accountants on a coffee break. Bryce Young is finally showing signs of stardom, and their defense, once a sieve, has tightened up enough to stop a leaky faucet. Oh, and they’re playing t

I hope you got some well deserved sleep last night and today. I'm sitting here drinking my coffee, and I wish I could make you a cup with some eggs and bacon. It's chilly this morning and particularly quiet. I feel this is going to be a long day of reflection, writing, and preparation for the week and the days to come, whatever they may bring. I hope they bring more of you. You looked beautiful yesterday, and I think I'll hold that with me today. Not just a visual/physical attraction yesterday, but a strong independence that radiated from you. A leadership and creativity that just spilled from the edges when jostled, and when I got close enough, I got splashed. It was refreshing. I think others feel it too, and that's why everyone shows up. I'm so lucky to have been blessed with the time I've had with you for all of these years, and I'm grateful that you wanted to spend some of them with me. I pray to the earth, and my soul prays to yours, that you may desire to share more time walking beside me in this life again one day soon. To begin weaving new plans for leaving behind that which does not serve us, leaving this town, and venturing forth to teach more people about how to heal the earth in new places, together. We talked about leaving here forever, and I think maybe that was something we should have done a long time ago. At least, we probably should have left that state of mind that trapped us both a long time ago. I think I held us back for too long. You know I can travel with my work, and there are opportunities for you elsewhere, if you so desire. I want to support you, and there are big things for both of us in the future, whenever we end up. I want to grow together as friends, as partners, as lovers, as community builders, to help heal our relationship, our community, the earth, and this world, however or wherever we can. Together, but only if you want it too. The healing can only start from within, and the seasons are changing. From my soul to yours, love.

First I’ll share what my current stack is, then what my goals are for the stack, and what I’m adding in and why. My main point of this post, is to hear from you guys if I’m headed in the right direction with what my aim is to do, or if there is anything in my stack (almost everything is ND brand) that isn’t ideal to pair with or may have unwanted results. Thank you in advance. 

Current stack:

Morning: on empty stomach 
- grass fed beef organ complex
- tongkat ali 2% x1
- black ginger x1
- boron x1
- panax ginseng (GS15-4) x1
- taurine 3 grams 
- MSM half teaspoon 

Hour later: caffeine from black coffee with 10 grams of creatine, and l-theanine 200mg

Daytime after meal with fat:
- panax ginseng GS15 second dose x1
- high quality fish oil supp
- vitamin D/k2 5000iu 

Evening/nightime:
-magnesium 400mg
- lemon balm half a pill 250mg (only as needed for calmness/sleep aid)

That’s it as of now. My plan is to cycle off and take out the panax ginseng. 

Swap it with:
- NALT 
- baikal skullcap 
- saffron 

Goal for my stack is vitality, energy, general health, inflammation, stress management and focus.

The panax ginseng is great for the stress mitigation and not looking at things as such a huge task. I’m hoping to replace it with the 3 above to help in this area but also with my job performance. I’m in sales and anything that helps with general anxiety, verbal fluency, focus/attention I’m on board for. Some of my stack already does help with this as well. So these three new supplements isn’t to just replace the ginseng but also to help with other things as well. I’ve done research and think they all seem up my alley with my goals. 

But yes, curious about everyone’s thoughts on the NALT, skullcap and saffron being stacked together with everything else I have. Also too if there is any bad combinations that wouldn’t pair well so to speak. Any opinions wanted. Thank you again.

Hi, I’m Bonnie, Im 24, black female, 5’5 | 105lbs, and if I were to describe myself in one word, it would probably be “soft,” though that’s just the beginning. I’m someone who finds joy and comfort in the small, delicate details of life, the things that make each day feel intentional and a little bit magical. I adore quiet, cozy spaces like small cafés and bakeries, wandering through little shops with hidden treasures, or simply enjoying a bouquet of flowers that catches my eye. I love the tactile, comforting things that make the world feel gentle: soft cardigans, stuffed animals, comfort shows/movies, bows and hair clips that add a playful feminine touch, and little strawberry-themed surprises that bring a smile. I notice the details, the subtleties, and the moments that many people might overlook, and I think that’s part of my charm.

At the same time, I have a small, wild streak. I love activity, adventure, and new experiences that let me feel alive. Roller coasters, museums, science exhibits, hiking, and exploring are all things that make my heart race with excitement. I’m not interested in the typical “dinner, coffee, or movie” dates; I crave experiences that are interactive and engaging, where we can genuinely connect and share energy. I love movement and spontaneity as much as I love stillness and quiet reflection, and I think the balance between those sides of me makes life richer.

I take boundaries, comfort, and consent very seriously. For me, a relationship is about trust, mutual respect, and emotional safety. I am not here for casual texting or low-effort planning or even the “lets see where things go” energy; I want someone who is thoughtful, intentional, and willing to invest the time and energy it takes to build something meaningful. Communication matters deeply to me, and I appreciate partners who are clear, considerate, and confident in themselves. I believe that love and connection flourish when both people are genuinely present, attentive, and willing to put in effort. However with that i am looking for a long term relationship but not ready for marriage or ready to have children, i love being CF (Child Free) and that is really important to me, i value my freedom and not being tied down daily having to take care of a small human. I believe it is possible to want a committed relationship but not be ready to settle down; Sometimes, two people simply share a meaningful connection, whether it lasts a few years or just a beautiful chapter. There’s something deeply romantic about two separate lives intertwining for a time before continuing their own paths.

I consider myself naturally soft and quiet. I’m drawn to men who are confident, Dominate, grounded, and know how to lead with care and thoughtfulness. I’m not interested in bottom men (or men with mommy issues. I do not have daddy issues myself) or those who expect me to take control; I feel most fulfilled when I can relax into softness and trust someone to guide our relationship down the right path and ofc with my help so we can grow together. For me, softness isn’t about weakness, it’s about connection, trust, and intimacy. The most romantic and meaningful relationships I can imagine are ones where I feel safe enough to let go, be soft, and explore the full range of my emotions and desires without fear or judgment or being used.

When it comes to who I’m attracted to, I tend to gravitate toward single men who are East/Southeast Asian, or white, latino and don’t have children (100% Childfree). Non-Smoker/vaper but drinking is fine just dont be an alcoholic (been through that). No crazy Exes. Aged 26-40(no one older or younger). Permanently living in Orlando, FL (Very important, I am NOT open to long distance/Online). Knows how to dress and basic hygiene. Knows how to have a conversation aka won’t leave me to ask all the question or say “feel free to ask me questions” when none have been asked of me. Loves theme parks and movies. Have hair on their head (no baldness but a buzzcut is fine). Emotional intelligent/mature. Confidence is key! I admire someone who knows themselves, is comfortable in their own skin, and carries themselves with self-assurance. I appreciate a partner who prioritizes health, whether that’s staying active, eating thoughtfully, or simply taking care of their well-being. I prefer men who are fit, slim, or average in body type(noone obese), someone whose lifestyle complements mine without pressure or judgment. Height isn’t everything, but I’m drawn to men who are taller and carry themselves in a way that inspires quiet confidence and stability, height is not a dealbreaker though I have dated men who have at least been 5’7. I’m most comfortable when I’m with someone kind, protective, and intentional. I bring loyalty, affection, and steadiness, I just need to feel safe and chosen first. I would say i have an average/thin body,  but to clear up that im not the average-overweight pipeline im 108lbs.

I love a lifestyle that feels mature, grounded, and intentional. I enjoy healthy routines, cooking at home, and staying active walking, or home workouts. I value thoughtful living, where every choice, big or small; reflects care for yourself and those around you. For me, little things matter: the scent of fresh flowers, the comfort of a soft cardigan on a rainy day, the quiet thrill of discovering something new in a museum, or the tactile satisfaction of a small DIY project. Life feels richer when you notice the details, and I take joy in these moments every day.

Romance, for me, is soft, tender, and deeply intentional. I crave connection that’s playful yet grounded, adventurous yet comforting. I love giving and receiving affection, cherishing moments where we can simply be together without distraction. My ideal partner values these things too: someone who can plan thoughtful, activity-based dates, who enjoys shared experiences rather than just passive moments, and who delights in the simple but meaningful gestures that show care. I want a relationship where laughter, exploration, and softness are all woven together, a life that feels full and alive while still honoring calm, gentle moments.

 I want to build a relationship that’s focused and intentional from the start. I’m looking for someone who can embrace both the playful and serene sides of life, who understands that romance doesn’t need to be loud or flashy to feel profound. I value someone who can lead with strength but also sensitivity, someone who can take initiative in planning our time together while respecting my boundaries and comfort. I want a partner who sees the beauty in both quiet moments and bursts of adventure, someone who can make everyday life feel like something special.

There’s a balance in me that I hope to share with the right person. Together, I imagine a relationship that’s warm, exciting, and deeply connected: moments of quiet reflection curled up together, intertwined with spontaneous adventures that make us feel alive. I am a spiritually grounded Catholic and love my calm soft faith, i dont force my religion upon anyone and i dont even talk about it to avoid making people uncomfortable. It doesnt matter to me what religion or spirituality you are just come with acceptance and peace. I am LGBTQ+ friendly and myself is Pansexual. However i do not support the poly/enm lifestyle when it comes to my relationships. I dont smoke or drink. I have a chronic illness and take care of myself to make sure my health stays in check. I am not into hookup culture (fwb, ons, play partner, etc) but have tried it out before realizing and talking to my therapist that it is not for me and something i dont enjoy and not comfortable with. I take my mental health very seriously and let go of anything that will cause me great stress or put me in a negative mindset. 

I have healed through my trauma and continue to heal far beyond, i want my partner to also prioritize their mental health and can communicate their thoughts and feelings for anything good or bad, i hear and see my partner and make sure to provide my support and feedback, even in disagreements. I would consider myself slightly traditional in relationships following behind my partner and keeping quiet when needed (i do have rules/boundaries myself and dont tolerate any type of disrespect to my character). I would not consider myself a feminist however i do applaud the efforts and the ways things go by and how i would not be able to do the things i do now without feminism. I still believe in equal rights for all not only one type of person. I am not a liberal or conservative and consider myself of the far left and moderate. I prefer to date someone who is moderate/left and also not a conservative/liberal. I enjoy gloomy weather, slice of life anime’s, horror movies, journaling, shopping, nature, animals, dressing very dolly and/or comfortable, and collecting stuffed animals (no squishmellows). I own a cat and dog and live with roommates. I dont drive as i dont meet florida requirements for a DL (passenger princess). I play video games (PS 4/5). I enjoy also dressing modest/alt/punk, a small bit of baking and naps. Im prochoice. And i dream of moving to the PNW and opening up a bakery and having my own greenhouse vegetable and fruit garden in the backyard hehe. I like listening to nu-metal/rock, mitski and Billie eilish. I am not a fan of RnB/hip hop music but I did grow up listening to it. I have Autism and adhd. I work Full Time. Free Palestine. 

I want someone who understands that relationships take effort and attention from both sides, and who is willing to create a connection built on trust, playfulness, and connection. I want a partner who can inspire me, challenge me gently, and hold space for me while allowing me to be my full, authentic self.

If you’re someone who enjoys activity-based adventures, who values thoughtful planning, and who appreciates both softness and subtle sparks of wildness, we might just click. I’m looking for someone confident, grounded, and intentional; someone who respects boundaries, takes comfort seriously, and understands that love is nurtured through care and presence. With the right person, I imagine a life full of warmth, trust, laughter, and connection, moments where we explore the world together, savor the quiet times, and let the soft, tender side of life bloom fully.

1oapfsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oapfsz/pale_famish_parts_12/,Pale Famish (parts 1&2),"Part I – The Silence of Nome

The wind in Nome could sound like a living thing. It had moods, a kind of haunted breath that rattled the eaves of houses and slipped through the cracks of window frames no matter how much tape or caulk you used. Some nights it sighed like an old man remembering his sins. Other nights it howled like something wild and half-starved scratching at the door.

Evan Holt had learned to live with it, though he doubted he’d ever sleep easy through it again.

The storm had been moving in since late afternoon—thick, gray clouds rolling in low from the Bering Sea, swallowing the sky in heavy folds. He stood outside his cabin, tightening the straps on the fuel drums and checking the line of snowshoes on the porch. His breath came out white and quick. He didn’t like to think of himself as a man afraid of storms—he’d been in plenty—but the first real one of the season always got into his bones.

Winter was back. The one-year mark was close now.

He went inside before the cold could find its way under his coat. The cabin was small—just two rooms, both lined in spruce paneling, and warmed by a black iron stove that clicked and popped like it had a mind of its own. A single lamp lit the space, turning the frost on the windows into a pale, trembling gold.

Evan poured himself coffee, black as the sky outside. On the table sat a small stack of yellow envelopes, all addressed to the same name in the same neat, heavy handwriting: Marla Holt. None of them were stamped. None had ever been mailed. He wrote one every few days, though he never planned to send them.

He sat down, took out a pen, and began.

October 29th

You’d have liked the clouds tonight. They’re the kind that hang low, heavy with snow. I can feel it coming. The stove’s being temperamental again—guess you were right about me needing a new flue cap. I saw a fox near the old trap line yesterday. Pretty thing, red as your scarf. For a second, I thought it was you.

He stopped writing. His eyes drifted to the window. The last light was gone. The glass reflected only the lamp’s weak glow and his own face—unshaven, hollow around the eyes, the kind of look you get when you’ve been living with ghosts too long.

He didn’t hear the wind at first. Then it came: low and mournful, sweeping across the tundra. A long, distant cry. It wasn’t unusual, not really—Nome was full of noises that could trick the mind. But something in that sound made his stomach twist.

He stood and crossed to the window, pressing a hand against the cold glass. The night outside was white and endless, and for a moment, he thought he saw something moving against it. A flicker of shadow at the tree line, too tall for a fox, too slender for a bear. Then it was gone.

He waited another minute before turning back to the stove. The wind rose again, louder now, almost human.

He stoked the fire and sat back in his chair, watching the flames dance in the grate. He could hear the faint ticking of the wall clock, the steady drip of melting ice from the roof, and beyond that—the silence. Nome had a special kind of silence. It wasn’t peaceful. It was thick, pressing, the kind that made you aware of your own breathing.

He reached for his radio, flipped it on, and got nothing but static. The signal came and went this far out. The locals called it “the edge of the map,” though the truth was, Nome had always been off the edge of something—civilization, reason, maybe even the world itself.

When he finally went to bed, the wind was still crying around the eaves. He dreamed of her again.

⸻

They’d been together for twelve years. Married for eight.

Marla had been the brave one—outdoorsy, sharp-witted, a woman who laughed at the cold. She was a wildlife photographer, and every winter she’d drag him out into the wilderness with her, camera around her neck, snow up to her thighs, chasing shots of caribou and foxes.

The avalanche had taken her last December. It was supposed to be a simple trip—two snowmobiles, a ridge not far from Solomon Creek. He remembered the white curtain falling, the sound like thunder breaking right above them. He remembered screaming her name, digging until his fingers bled, but the snow kept coming.

They never found her. Not even her camera.

Sometimes, on the worst nights, he wished he’d been buried with her.

⸻

Morning came gray and hollow. Evan woke to the sound of something brushing the side of the cabin. He sat up fast, listening.

Scrape. Scrape.

He grabbed the rifle from beside the bed, thumbed the safety off, and moved quietly toward the door. The world outside was muffled under a foot of new snow. He stepped onto the porch, rifle raised. The cold air stung his lungs.

At first, he saw nothing. Then he noticed the marks along the wall—deep grooves running down the wood. Claw marks. Too long to be from a fox or lynx. He followed them a few feet, heart pounding, until he reached the corner of the cabin. There, half-buried in the snow, was something small and familiar.

A red wool glove.

He froze.

It was hers.

He picked it up, brushed the snow off. The wool was stiff with frost, but he’d know it anywhere—she’d worn it that last day.

A trick of the storm, he thought. Something washed up from the ridge, carried by wind or melt. But deep down, a part of him didn’t believe that.

He took the glove inside, set it on the table beside his letters. For the rest of the day, he couldn’t stop staring at it.

⸻

That night, the sound came again. Not the wind this time—something closer.

It began as a soft tapping against the door. Three times. Pause. Three again.

He stood frozen in the middle of the cabin, pulse roaring in his ears.

“Who’s there?” he called.

Silence.

Then, faintly—so faintly he thought he imagined it—came a voice.

“Evan.”

He dropped the coffee mug in his hand. It shattered across the floor.

The voice came again, softer. “Evan… it’s cold. Let me in.”

For a moment, he couldn’t move. His mind clawed for reason, for anything that made sense.

He stepped toward the door. “Marla?”

Nothing. Only the snow hissing against the window.

He threw open the door. The wind hit him like a knife. The porch was empty, white and silent.

He stood there for a long time, staring into the storm, until the cold burned his skin.

When he finally closed the door, something inside him had shifted—something small but vital. A hairline crack in the wall he’d built to keep himself sane.

That night he didn’t sleep.

⸻

By morning, the sky had cleared. The world outside glittered blue and sharp under the weak sunlight. He told himself it had been a dream—an echo of her voice, born from exhaustion and the wind. Nome did that to people. The dark months stretched long, and the mind started making ghosts out of snowdrifts.

Still, he checked the door for prints.

There were some. Not animal. Not boots. Bare feet.

Small.

Human.

Part II – The Things That Return

The footprints were still there the next morning.

Evan crouched over them, breath clouding in the brittle air. The snow around the porch was untouched except for those small, perfect depressions—bare feet, toes spread wide, sinking cleanly into the crust. There were maybe a dozen, leading from the tree line straight to his door and then back again.

He ran his gloved hand over one of them, half expecting it to crumble or melt under his touch like something imagined. But it stayed, real and solid, cold enough to bite through the glove.

Bare feet. Out here. In this cold.

He followed the trail a few yards before it vanished under a windblown drift. The sky was the color of steel, and the light had that particular dullness that came before more snow. In the distance, the tundra stretched on forever, the birch trees thin and silent, like bones pushing through white flesh.

He didn’t know why, but he whispered her name. “Marla.”

Nothing answered him but the wind.

⸻

At the airfield that day, the world felt too normal, which somehow made it worse. The hangar smelled of oil and frost. The mechanics worked with slow, steady movements, bundled in flannel and heavy gloves. Evan tried to lose himself in the rhythm of repair—bolts, filters, hydraulic lines—but his mind wouldn’t settle.

“You hear about the lights again?” asked Neilson, the oldest of the lot, a man with a beard like gray moss and the voice of someone who’d smoked since before the world started turning. He leaned against the workbench, sipping coffee from a thermos. “Old Mary out near Anvil Creek says she saw ‘em two nights ago. Out past the ridge.”

“What lights?” Evan muttered, not looking up.

“Those blue ones,” Neilson said. “Like fire but wrong. They come before the snow really hits. Eskimo stories say it’s the hungry ones walking again.”

“The hungry ones?”

Neilson grinned, half toothless. “You’ve been here how long and nobody told you about the Wendigo?”

Evan snorted. “That’s Canadian myth, isn’t it?”

The old man shook his head. “Not just Canadian. Out here too. They say when someone dies bad—trapped, starving, left to freeze—the spirit gets twisted up. Comes back hollow. Wants to eat and can’t stop. Skin turns like ice, teeth like needles. Looks like the person you lost until you let it close.”

The younger mechanic laughed, but it died quick when Neilson didn’t join in.

“Thing is,” Neilson went on, “they can sound like people you love. They use your memories to pull you in. Once you look ‘em in the eye, you’re already half gone.”

Evan tightened the wrench until the bolt squealed. “Sounds like campfire bullshit.”

“Maybe.” Neilson’s voice dropped. “But I’ve seen tracks out there. Bare feet in the snow. No blood, no frostbite, just… walking.”

That made Evan pause.

He didn’t tell Neilson about what he’d found that morning. He didn’t tell anyone. But as he walked home that evening, the words kept repeating in his head.

Bare feet in the snow.

⸻

The next few days passed in a slow, sleepless fog. He wrote more letters but didn’t seal them. He ate only when the hunger forced him to. The glove stayed on the table beside the stack of envelopes, the wool stiffening as the heat from the stove dried it out.

Sometimes, he swore it moved.

He started noticing small things missing—his flashlight, one of his boots, a few cans of soup. Once, the back door was standing open when he came home. No sign of forced entry. Just footprints. Always the same kind: small, bare, human.

At night he heard the voice again. Softer now, coaxing.

“Ev… open the door. I’m here.”

The first time, he shouted back—told it to leave him alone. But the next night, when he heard it again, he sat in silence, trembling, afraid that answering might make it real.

He stopped sleeping by the third night.

⸻

It was the sheriff who brought up Marla again. Sheriff Liz Calloway—forty, sharp, pragmatic. They’d gone to high school together before Evan left for Anchorage and the short, unhappy years that followed. She’d been kind after Marla’s disappearance, checking in once or twice, though he always found excuses to avoid her.

This time, she showed up at his door.

“Morning, Holt,” she said, stamping the snow from her boots. “You mind if I come in? Storm’s building.”

He hesitated before nodding. She glanced around the cabin—at the pile of letters, the glove, the dishes in the sink—but said nothing.

“Got a call from up near Teller Road,” she said finally. “Couple of trappers found something strange. Thought you might want to know.”

He tensed. “What kind of strange?”

“Looks like part of a coat. Red. Torn to hell, frozen stiff. You want to guess what brand?”

He stared at her. “Columbia?”

She nodded. “Women’s size small.”

Marla’s size.

She placed something on the table—a small, cracked plastic button, the kind that fastens the hood on a winter jacket. The kind Marla had worn the day she vanished.

“Could’ve been caught in the thaw,” Liz said carefully. “Wind moves things around up there.”

“Could’ve been,” he said, though his voice sounded far away.

She studied him a moment. “You holding up okay, Ev?”

He didn’t answer. The stove popped, sending sparks into the room.

“Look,” she said. “If you’re seeing things again… hearing things… you can come talk to me. Winter does strange things to the mind out here.”

He forced a small smile. “I’m fine, Liz.”

She didn’t look convinced. But she nodded and left.

When the door shut, he turned the button over in his hands. It was cracked clean through, edges sharp as ice. He set it beside the glove.

The air in the cabin felt different after that—thicker somehow. The shadows didn’t sit right. He started to feel watched.

That night, he dreamed of the ridge again.

⸻

He was digging, hands bleeding, breath tearing out of him. The snow was coming down harder now, sheets of white suffocating the world. He found her parka, red against the white. He dug faster. He found her hand.

Her fingers were black with frostbite. Her nails were broken. She opened her eyes.

“Why’d you leave me?” she whispered.

He woke up screaming.

The room was cold. The fire had gone out. He lay still for a long time, staring at the ceiling.

Then he heard the breathing.

Soft, ragged, coming from the corner.

He turned his head slowly, and there, crouched by the stove, was a figure.

It was small, thin, covered in rags of white and red. Its head tilted at an impossible angle. Steam rose off its skin. He couldn’t see its face, only the long black hair hanging down in frozen strands.

“Marla,” he whispered.

It shuddered. The head twitched toward him, too fast, and he saw a glimpse of its face—white skin stretched tight over bone, eyes sunk deep and rimmed with frost, mouth torn wider than any human mouth should be.

It smiled.

Then it was gone.

He sat there until dawn, rifle across his knees, the shape of that smile burned into his mind.

⸻

The next day he drove into town, desperate to see another face. He found Neilson at the gas station, topping off his snowmobile.

“You look like hell,” Neilson said.

Evan tried to smile. “Been a rough week.”

The old man frowned. “You see the news? Those hunters up by Dexter? They found a couple reindeer gutted clean. Not eaten. Just torn up.”

Evan swallowed hard. “Animals do that sometimes.”

“Not like this.” Neilson looked him dead in the eye. “You think she’s still out there, don’t you?”

Evan didn’t answer. He climbed back into his truck and drove home before the snow started again.

By the time he reached the cabin, night was falling. He went to check the porch and froze.

There was something nailed to the door.

A strip of flesh. Pale, thin, with a line of hair attached.

He knew that hair.

It was auburn.

Marla’s color.

⸻

He burned it in the stove, but the smell lingered long after—sweet and rotten, like something dying in the walls. He tried to open the window, but the wind outside was howling again. Somewhere in the noise, he heard her voice.

“Ev… come with me.”

He pressed his hands over his ears, but it didn’t stop.

“Don’t you love me anymore?”

The question was so soft it almost broke him.

He found himself answering, without meaning to. “Yes.”

The whisper came again, closer now, just beyond the glass.

“Then open the door.”

⸻

The lamp flickered once and died. The room went black.

Outside, something scraped along the window. Slow. Deliberate. Fingernails.

He aimed the rifle toward the sound, heart hammering.

A shadow passed across the thin beam of the moonlight. He could see it more clearly now—tall, thin, moving on all fours, its limbs too long. The face pressed against the glass, pale and grinning, eyes like hollow pits.

It whispered again. “You left me in the dark.”

Then it was gone.

He didn’t sleep at all that night. When the first light came, he sat at the table, shaking, and began a new letter.

November 4th

If you’re out there, Marla, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to leave you. I tried to find you. God knows I tried. But you’re not her anymore, are you? You’re hungry. And you found me.

My dog is allowed to roam because he’s generally good UNLESS you leave food around where he can get it. Yesterday my boyfriend left his Starbucks drink unattended on our coffee table, I was out all day and came home we sat down to watch tv and he told me he let my dog out for me and he went to the bathroom, my dog was in our bedroom and I noticed him making a lot of noise so I went to check on him and he had full blown diarrhea all over our carpet I asked him when did he let him out and he said just like 30 mins ago then he tells me when he came home his coffee cup was on the ground but there was still coffee in it so he didn’t think he got to it.

The goal was being able to look at specialized groups like quantum, AI, Genomics, Space exploration and others as well as more traditonal themes like oil and gas, banks, metals and miners with a chart to clearly see and catch trend changes and rotation.

Ranking systems are great but sometimes it is nice to be able to hone in on a very specific theme. It give you the flexibility to see strength in different time frames, see when a theme is starting to roll over and breakdown or bottom and being a stage 2 uptrend.  This also lets you cut the cord from any propreitary themes and group systems. No more waiting for a company to update and restructure the groups. You can now simply add your own. I organized the excel sheet with a tab for all ETFs then broken down my more major sectors. Each ETF also shows what it tracks

example:  
QTUM- Technology & Innovation- Quantum/Quantum Computing- Next-gen computing & AI/quantum-adjacent; Next-gen/AI/quantum-adjacent

reddit doesn't let files to be shared so if you are interested either message me with your email or check my profile for a discord link invite where I has posted the excel file.

this can be put in as a watchlist to any charting platform. The picture show some of the stuff ive done in Deepvue (if you want to check out deepvue i have a link .....[DEEPVUE LINK](https://deepvue.com/robert-campos-partners/?aff=0f12f1b2) and a discount code BOBBY12) Deepvue lets you customize the columns so you can see I have various ways to look at performance on diff timeframes, I can also look at the chart to see the overall trend. You can also  see all the holding in an ETF  by clciking the small ""H"" next to the ticker, so if you find a group showing like it is about to go on a run you can easily see a list of stocks to play that theme and see if any set ups are there. I also set up a heat map to visualize the themes.

1oap3oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFXRealEstateNews/comments/1oap3oc/selling_in_halifaxs_cinderella_market_why_its/,Selling in Halifax’s “Cinderella Market”: Why It’s Normal (and How to Still in a reasonable time frame),"If you’ve been talking to agents lately, you might get the impression Halifax is *still* buzzing with bidding wars and lineups of buyers. Let’s be clear: it’s not.

 

 

As of mid-2025, only **26% of listings are selling** across Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Homes are taking **60 to 90 days (or longer)** to sell—up sharply from the lightning-fast days of 2021–2022.

 

 

And that’s not bad news. It’s just *normal*. For the first time in over a decade, Halifax has moved into what I call a **“Cinderella market”** — buyers are still showing up, but only for the homes that fit *just right*.

 

 

 

 

**Why Halifax Is in a Balanced Market**

 

 

For most of my 15 years in real estate, Halifax ran on a buyer’s engine – except Covid years.  Now, we’re back to something more realistic — where pricing, condition, and strategy matter more than ever.

 

 

 

**What’s causing the shift?**

* **Higher interest rates:** Borrowing costs have doubled since 2021, trimming buyer budgets and confidence.
* **Economic caution:** Between inflation and affordability fatigue, many are waiting for the “perfect” time — or perfect house.
* **Inventory buildup:** Halifax saw inventory rise 8% year-over-year from 2023-2024, meaning more competition for sellers. We are already at 4941 homes listed and it is only Oct.  The inventory last year was 5365.  I believe we will surpass this number and be closer to 2016-2018 inventory count.

 

 

Our market is not experiencing a crash. It’s a market reset — and one that rewards sellers who adapt.

 

 

 

 

**What Affects Selling Time in Halifax**

 **Local Market Conditions**

While the *national* market might average 60 days, local results vary dramatically. Suburban areas like **Sackville or Eastern Passage** can still move quickly under $600K, while **Bedford and the Halifax Peninsula** are seeing longer timelines and more price adjustments.

The real measure? **Days on Market (DOM)** from NSAR. Once listings pass the 60–90 day mark, we know it’s a slower cycle.

 

 **Pricing**

Overpricing is the #1 reason listings sit stale. Halifax buyers today are savvy — they know what’s been sitting, what’s dropped, and what sold.

If you don’t see solid activity in the first 2–3 weeks, it’s usually a pricing signal, not a marketing problem. A **price drop of $25K–$50K** is often what gets a property back into play.

 

 **Seasonality**

Our market naturally slows between **November and March** (no one wants to move a couch in a snowstorm). Expect fewer buyers and longer DOM through winter — but those who are shopping then are typically more serious.

 

 **Property Condition**

Buyers in 2025 expect “move-in ready.” They don’t want to redo kitchens, repaint, or fix leaky faucets. Homes that are **staged, decluttered, and photographed professionally** consistently sell faster — and for more money.

 

**Market Psychology**

Once a listing hits 60+ days, buyers assume something’s wrong. It’s harsh, but true. That’s why repositioning early — through new photos, new pricing, or even a fresh MLS number — keeps your home from becoming “the one everyone scrolls past.”

 **How to Sell Faster in a Slower Halifax Market**

 

 **Price Competitively — Right From the Start**

Forget “testing the market.” Halifax buyers aren’t paying a premium for curiosity listings.

 

 **Update and Stage Strategically**

Staging in Halifax can add **5–10% to your sale price** and cut DOM by weeks. Even light staging or virtual staging (especially for condos) can make a dramatic difference.

Declutter like your mother-in-law is coming for an inspection.

 

 **Nail the First Impression — Online**

Over 90% of buyers start online, and that first scroll determines if you get a showing.  
Invest in **professional photos**, drone footage if applicable, and a strong description that includes:

* The neighbourhood name (e.g., “Bedford South” or “Clayton Park”)
* Key search phrases (“home near Halifax Shopping Centre,” “family home with fenced yard”)
* Local lifestyle features (“walking distance to coffee, trails, and schools”)

This isn’t just marketing — it’s SEO for buyers.

 

 **Be Flexible**

If buyers want evening showings, short-notice viewings, or a quick close, say yes when possible. Flexibility signals motivation, and in a slower market, that’s gold.

 

 **Monitor Feedback and Pivot Fast**

The first 30 days tell you everything you need to know. No showings = price problem. Showings but no offers = condition or presentation problem.  
Smart sellers (and their agents) adjust fast rather than sitting idle for months.

 **Understanding Today’s Halifax Buyer**

In slow markets, *motivated* buyers still exist — they’ve just changed.

* **Life transitions still drive purchases:** divorces, job relocations, and growing families don’t wait for “perfect timing.”
* **Investors are back — but picky:** they’re looking for underpriced opportunities, not bidding wars.
* **Locals are cautious but committed:** Halifax remains more affordable than most major cities, but affordability is tighter than ever.

 

 **When to Reset: Terminate and Relist**

If your home’s been sitting for 90+ days with minimal activity, it might be time to **relist with a new strategy** — new MLS number, new photos, and a tighter price point.

It’s not failure — it’s a refresh. Halifax buyers respond to “new listings” far more than “price reduced.”

**The Truth About the First Offer**

After analyzing hundreds of Halifax sales, one pattern never changes:  
👉 The **first offer** is usually the best offer.

Early buyers are the most motivated and best informed. Waiting “for something better” often means chasing the market down while paying another few months of mortgage, taxes, and utilities.

 **Why This Market Rewards the Prepared**

Halifax’s market in 2025 isn’t dead — it’s discerning. The homes that are priced right, staged well, and marketed strategically *still sell quickly.*

Those that aren’t? They wait for a fairy godmother who isn’t coming.

If you’re selling in Halifax this fall or winter, approach it like a pro:

* Know your numbers (DOM, price per square foot, and absorption rate).
* Listen to real feedback, not wishful thinking.
* Be ready to adjust early.

The glass slipper still fits — it just takes a smarter strategy to make it shine.

I sprinted out of my house, coffee in one hand, bag half-zipped, and jumped straight into my car like my life depended on it.

Apparently, my neighbor was outside watering his plants and saw the whole thing. As I’m backing out, he gives me a big thumbs up and yells, “Keep it up, man! You’re looking great!”

I had no idea what he meant, so I just awkwardly waved and drove off.

Next morning late again, same sprint, same chaos. He was there *again*, this time clapping. He shouted, “You’re consistent! That’s what matters!”

Now I’m realizing he thinks I’m *training*. I didn’t have time to correct him, and honestly, it felt kinda nice having someone cheer me on for something I wasn’t even doing.

Fast forward two months, and this man is *invested*. He asks me what marathon I’m running, gives me advice on electrolytes, even offered me his old running shoes (they were hideous, but I took them out of guilt).

Here’s the worst part: last week, he invited me to join him on a “light morning jog.” I panicked and said, “Oh, I’m tapering right now,” which I only know is a running term because I googled it once.

So now, every morning, I still run to my car just to keep the illusion alive. At this point, I’ve accidentally become a full-time method actor in a role I never auditioned for.

So as the title says, I have a Pl41em, which I had known nothing about. I had it for about 5 years, with a very cheap grinder kg79. I had never cleaned it except once every 2 months descaling. Nothing, no puly caf, no blind basket, nothing.

For the entire time I had the machine, my coffee would be extracted at 11bar, with burnt taste. Still much better than a Nespresso, and I contributed the flavor to the cheap grinder.

This past month I had decided to change a grinder to a Eureka, while also learning a lot about dialing in a shot.  
The new grinder made me realize I cannot dial in a shot with 11 bars of pressure.  
This caused me to go down the rabbit hole of dialing in the perfect shot.

1st step requires a clean machine, following that when everything is perfect, OPV adjustment so blind filter wont get to 11 bars.

Anyway, this got me to dissembel and clean the shower head for the first time in 5 years, dissemble and replace group head gaskets, and clean everything with puly caf. after doing all of that, adjusting OPV to have a blind basket max pressure of 9.5, the espresso is amazing! I only got 2 shots out so far, however they are both amazing. Still a bit fast, will dial it in further as I go along this week.

Just wanted to put this out there and let people know in case you need any guides etc.

1oaoxc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1oaoxc2/after_10_years_he_left_to_find_himself_slept_with/,"After 10 years, he left to ‘find himself,’ slept with a 22-year-old, and now begs for me back. How do I heal?","TL;DR: 10-year relationship ended after he cheated, left to “explore,” then came back saying he’d changed. He broke into my home, lied that he had been sleeping with countless other women, and is now begging for forgiveness. He says he only slept with one girl, a pretty 22-year-old he met months ago and I don’t know how to process the disgust and confusion anymore.

We were together for 10 years. I’m F31, he’s M32. We have both been with one person previously. Both been cheated on. I thought he was my person. We’d grown up together, built a life, and had been through everything, even very hard moments like an abortion of our child I went through alone because he didn’t show up for me. He has cheated once in the past during Covid, for which I forgave him and we went through extensive therapy for.

A few months ago, he said he needed to “explore” and “find himself.” He left, traveled, and says he slept with other people. I begged him to stay and try therapy. He refused and said he wanted freedom. He even made up lies about sleeping with women, talking to others and how he might be polyamorous or need two girlfriends. All while my grandmother was sick and diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and I had just been laid off by my job. I had enough and broke things off. 

Three months later he came back, crying, saying he regretted everything and that I was the best thing in his life. We met a few times, and even though I didn’t feel the same attraction anymore, I tried to be kind and civil. I went on dog walks with him and our dog and told him he can visit her as much as he likes. I bought him coffee and food and gave him hugs and forgiveness. 

Then he dropped another bomb. He said that in these six months, he’s “only” been sleeping with one person — a 22-year-old he met at a store months ago. She’s still in school, trying to become a social-media influencer, and he supports her “career” by commenting things like “so beautiful” on her posts. He says that they only slept together after we broke up. That they were just “talking” before; even when he told me all those lies about having slept around. That he left on the “break” and she was seeing someone else. That while we were together, all they did was kiss and talk almost every day. He even told me she’s bisexual, which he somehow mentioned in the context of her being able to “give him a threesome,” something he’d always pressured me about and we’d said we would try. He said that she slept with another man and it made him feel unsafe and like he didn’t want an open relationship. He said that she was emotionally unavailable and had zero emotional intelligence or empathy. He even called her fat, said that he thinks she was a nobody, which I find derogatory towards her. It also feels like he has violated everything about our bond and intimacy and found it in her. Back when I tried to be an influencer, he laughed and stopped supporting me, said that it was shallow and never wanted to comment on my posts.

When I got upset and started crying and left him, he showed up at my house uninvited, picked the lock and broke in. He wouldn’t leave until I talked about reconciliation. He even wrote  a long letter he’d written about how sorry he is and how he wants to rebuild everything. He cried, said I’ll “always be his person,” and that he made the biggest mistake of his life. But when I told him to end things with this girl immediately if he was serious, he said he couldn’t — that she’s “emotionally fragile” and might hurt herself.

I finally told him to leave. He flipped from sobbing to angry, yelling that I “ruined his image” by sharing what he did with friends. He messaged my friends some nasty things, because they had shown me his comments on the girls posts. He even talked badly about my best friend. She retaliated out of hurt and said mean things back. His mom even texted me defending him. I’m just… exhausted. I feel violated, disgusted, and guilty all at once.

My questions:

– How do I stop feeling guilty for sharing the truth with my friends? I have 10 women in my close circle—I wouldn’t have got out of bed without their help. 

– Why does it still hurt even though I know he’s bad for me?

– How do I get him out of my head after so much trauma and manipulation?

I know this relationship can’t be saved. I know he hasn’t changed. But I feel like I’m detoxing from an addiction. Any advice or perspective would mean a lot.",1,1760878474.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

I've been a digital nomad for the past 3 years, and I've learned a thing or two about staying productive while constantly on the move. One thing that's absolutely changed my life is finding the right ergonomic keyboard for travel.

Let me tell you, working from random cafes and hotel rooms can really mess up your wrists if you're not careful. I learned this the hard way when I developed some nasty wrist pain after a month-long stint in Thailand using just my laptop keyboard.

Here's what I've discovered about choosing the perfect travel-friendly ergonomic keyboard:

Portability is Key
Look, you don't want to lug around something that takes up half your backpack. I've found that foldable ergonomic keyboards are amazing for travel. They're lightweight and compact, but still give you that comfortable typing experience. Currently, I'm using one I found on https://athometouch.com/ergonomic-keyboard and it's been a game-changer.

Wireless vs. Wired
Go wireless! Trust me, dealing with cables while working from a tiny cafe table is no fun. Plus, most modern ergonomic keyboards have great battery life. I usually get weeks of use before needing a charge.

Split Design Benefits
If you can find a split design that's still portable, grab it! These are awesome because you can adjust the width to match your shoulder width, which helps prevent shoulder and neck strain. Some even fold in the middle, making them super travel-friendly.

Key Features to Look For:
- Bluetooth connectivity (multiple device support is a bonus)
- Rechargeable battery
- Low profile keys
- Durable build quality
- Water resistance (trust me, coffee spills happen)

Something I wish I knew earlier: mechanical switches aren't always the best for travel. They're loud and might annoy people around you in public spaces. Look for quiet switches or membrane keyboards instead.

Budget Considerations
You don't need to break the bank. I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/ergonomic-keyboard that offer excellent value for money. Remember, this is an investment in your health and productivity.

After trying dozens of keyboards, I've learned that the perfect travel ergonomic keyboard should balance comfort, portability, and durability. Don't just go for the cheapest option - your wrists will thank you later!

What's your experience with travel keyboards? I'd love to hear what works for you guys!

P.S. Don't forget to check reviews specifically from other travelers. Their experiences can be super helpful in making your decision.",1,1760878386.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

I reflect on what was and what is to be. I still miss you, M. It’s worse in the mornings and before bed but the days have been getting easier. I went to look at your insta page one last time before removing you from my search history for good. I noticed that in the last couple days you’ve blocked me? Why? We were already private and not following each other. Perhaps it was for you and not me? Maybe a sign to move on? Or some sick attempt at a game? It’s for the best. Admittedly I had been keeping an eye on your follower count, not sure why though as it’s not like I can see who is being followed.

We shared a lovely moment. I thought it’d become a novel but it was really just a chapter in the story. I want to write you a letter with some things I learned and an apology. Not to be sent with the idea of getting back together but to just convey my feelings and thank you for the experience despite the bitter end. You told me once that you no one had written you a letter. I feel as if one from someone you claimed to love might be bittersweet and not the letter you truly want but it would be for me more than you. 

I think part of me wants to send it to find some closure. It’ll let you see exactly how I am feeling. I mean you could not even read it. You could see my handwriting on the envelope and just toss it. Even if I sent it and it doesn’t arrive or you don’t read it, I still know that I got the feelings out. I’ll wait another month or so before that point though. Perhaps these feelings aren’t true and will fade but I do still feel as if my love for you was true. I wish you’d been the novel. 

Now for something new: 
I’ve begun to hit the gym in the attempt to quiet my mind. We will see if that gets the focus off of you. Perhaps in time it’ll help you fade. I think the gym plus therapy ought to put me in a stronger position than when we met. People talk about winning in a break up, I don’t really care for that. I just want to be happy and I want you to be happy too. 

Another thing I’m trying is Haiku. I’m not great at it but it allows discipline to flow through words. So, enjoy: 

Birds chirp and chitter,
Breaking silence — day begins.
Your silence lingers.

I still care for some reason,

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I will say there's been less of the pelvic floor spasms and needing to urinate *(without actually having to go)*.

1oaok2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oaok2z,São Tomé trip report!,"(10 days, 5 solo) in September 2025.

We flew from Lisbon via Luanda, and no VISA required for UK/US/EU citizens.

Wow, what an amazing country! The friendliest and most welcoming place I’ve ever been to. Like most on this subreddit, I met u/fitz_cuniculus who gave me insight and recommendations for what to do on the island. I ended up staying at his house for the whole trip, it’s in a perfect location and was a great base for exploring. I was also introduced to 
u/Carlos_Saotome, who was much more of a friend than a guide, but still showed me downtown on my first night, sang some beautiful songs on his guitar, picked me up from and dropped me off at the airport, and lent us his car for a weekend so we could explore the south. 

Whilst on the Island, I took a shared taxi to Santa Catarina on the west, passing through the only tunnel on the island. My aim here was to see the collapsed bridge, which I saw after a short walk from where the taxi dropped me off. Whilst I was there, it started to rain, I had limited signal and no idea where to get the taxi from. In true São Tomé fashion, the first taxi to drive past me walking in the rain opened the doors and took me all the way back to the city, no questions asked. 

The next day, I took a taxi to Monte Cafe, a very cute village with a few schools, cafes and coffee plantations. I went to the São Nicolau waterfall first, flagging down a guy on a bike and asking him for a lift up the hill. It’s amazing how quickly the landscape turns from the hustle of São Tomé to quiet and cool rainforest in the mountains. I was virtually alone at the waterfall and my subsequent walk back to Monte Cafe was very peaceful. The coffee and cake at Cafe Efraim was incredible, and the sun came out to give me a great view over the capital. Unfortunately, it began to rain whilst I was at Monte Cafe and I was slightly stuck for a lift back to the city (although u/fitz_cuniculus would have picked me up with no problem). However, a car that had previously stopped me for a chat earlier in the day saw me looking a little lost, and drove me back to Sao Tome with no hesitation.

The following weekend my Girlfriend had joined me on the Island. We rented a car from Carlos, and headed south to Porto Alegre. We stopped many times to swim on various beaches, most of them were completely empty, Praia Micondo was our first swim spot, highly reccomend. Next was Praia Pesqueira and another stunning waterfall with a cute cafe overlooking. The drive here was a bit off the beaten track but manageable. Then we got sight of one of São Tomé’s main attractions. Pica Cau Grande (Big dock rock), it is absolutely stunning, rising nearly 400m up, and each of the different viewpoints along the road allow you to see it with a different foreground each time. Due to our early start that morning, we also had time to do the mangrove tour in Vila Malanza, €10 each which is worth it for the tranquil hour, gliding through the mangroves, spotting monkeys, birds and other wildlife.

Lastly, we arrived in Porto Alegre, where we spent the night. This allowed us to wake up early and take one of the first boats across to Ilheu Das Rolas. This small island off the coast of São Tomé is an absolute must see. It sits on the equator, has a small but intimate equator landmark, with a stunning view of São Tomé. As we got to the island so early, we didn’t even see many local people, let alone tourists. We spent the rest of morning exploring Das Rolas, before heading back to Sao Tome in the evening. There is a really helpful path that is marked at various points and allows you to walk around the island in a couple of hours.

If you are planning a trip to this amazing country, do not hesitate! It is one of the prettiest, safest and most exciting countries I have been too, out of 55. Jack and Carlos are also the perfect duo to answer any questions you may have. ",3,1760877431.0,SaoTome,3,1.0,False

The texture is like an extra dense shortbread.

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

1oaogwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lvjy/comments/1oaogwt/album_thoughts_i_wanted_to_do_this_last_week_but/,Album thoughts (I wanted to do this last week but forgor),"hello, this is my album thoughts, I have more to say but I probably would never be able to get the words out cohesively for normal people (things) to be able to understand

Anyhow onto the thoughts, I did it song by song



**Baptism:** An absolute incredible way to start the album, this is such a good song. Joe's vocals????, he is absolutely cooking with that. I absolutely love how Will sings ""When he walks, his arms stay by his side, When he talks, his eyes never meet mine"", the phrasing and intonation is incredible. Lyrically, this is amazing, I really relate with the ""When I see my reflection, I don't see myself"", probably not in the way its intended but for me like every time I stare into the mirror, it gets difficult to recognise that person is me.

 

**Pay & Display:** Out of the singles, this was my favourite, I must confess that after hearing the rest of the album, I would put it lower than quite a few other songs. But this song in my opinion will probably be on of the big songs of the album, similar to cmwyl, poabs, perfume and one day, and rightfully so, this song is just so catchy, the melody, lyrics, everything about this song is perfect. Definitely enjoy listening to this

 

**With Rob as my Witness:** I personally feel this is the weakest of the album, don't get me wrong, I adore this song, having learnt it on guitar. But even when it first dropped, I felt it wasn't the best of their work. Its good yes, but I would much rather their other songs. With that being sad, I still love this song, it has lyrics that I personally relate with the absolute most. Especially that second verse, I feel personally attacked with that, like damn Will didn't know you knew my life like that. If I had to choose any song to describe me I would probably have this one (and maybe scoundrels) as my pick.

 

**White Shark Cafe:** ahhhhh, this is probably my favourite song of the album. I need this in my veins icl. The guitar, the lyrics, the whole thing. I really don't have much to say for this song, its just a banger through and through. The way Will sings ""Its been a couple weeks since Mary last said she missed"" is incredible, honestly I feel that with all of Will's singing in this song. Everything about this is perfect 100/10, put this in my blood and make me inhale it like I need it to breath.

 

Common Touch: At first, I didn't really like this song, I felt that Will's singing and the rest of the band didn't sound well mixed together. But after a few listens, I absolutely fw with this song. I know I've been saying it a lot, but Will's phrasing for this song is just so good, the way he sings ""radiator"" or ""you said the skys just bruised but I saw bleeding"" and a bunch more is just to satisfying to the ears. Also the discordant nature of the chorus is incredible. I feel its weaker than the other songs on the album but still a banger.

 

**Perfect Blue:** Oh boy, when I first heard perfect blue from a clip of them playing it live at Rock for people(?, idk what it was called), I absolutely fell in love with it. Learnt a lot of the parts on guitar as soon as I possible could. This was my most anticipated song, and it does not disappoint. I will say, cuz of recency bias and always having put videos of perfect blue on loop, I was less in awe when hearing this songs compared to the ones we had never heard before (not counting the secret show, I avoided spoilers from that like the plague). The little riff Will plays is just incredible, I remember when he played that bit in a clip when we didn't even know the name of the album or tracklist, I really don't think I can emphasis how much I like that riff Will plays, like god damn its perfect (blue). This song is one of my favourites and probably the other big song from the album like p&d.

 

**Foxhole**: I also immediately fell in love with this after hearing a video of it live from last year or smth i dont remember, maybe not as much as perfect blue but still. I love the chorus, and the way Will sings it, Ughhhh Wills vocals are just so good this album. I always have the ""there are noo atheists in the foxhole, and there are noo ways to carve the same tree"", I feel a bit of camaraderie with it since I am an atheist as well. Anyhow, Joes singing at the end hello??? Joe is absolutely cooking here, I love how they made the lyrics have more variation than the first time they played it.

 

**Fatal:** Its peak your honour. The MSR inspired bride??, the catchy chorus and the tear-jerking lyrics???. I'll have 11 please. I can't really think of anything to say other than holy crap I love this. The MSR-esque bridge is such a nice change of pace and also reminds of of ilgwis, kinda wish they did this more often to break up the album a bit. Also the overlap of lyrics near the end, and when Will goes back to singing what Joe was singing, uggghhh its so nice. Also one of my favourites from the album

 

**Deathbox:** I must confess (the second time 😏), I don't really know where the coffee machine, I can't tell which is a synth or a coffee machine 💀. At first I didn't really click with this song, I like the lyrics but the way Will sang the chorus didn't really hit at first. But the more I heard it, the more I have fallen in love for it. I still think Will's phrasing for the chorus isn't as good as the rest of the song (and album) but still, I absolutely love this song. Also I feel we really need to give more appreciation to that instrumental break, like that thing is one of my favourites and love hearing that over and over. I think this is honestly one of their better composed and mixed songs, but idk that might change like tmrw. Once again, another favourite from the album, I need this embedded in me.

 

**Scoundrels:** Ok, I know I've said it a lot, but this is one of my favourites, in fact probably my second fav behind WSC. I love the guitar part that Will (allegedly, maybe its the third guitarist who knows) plays in the chorus, and the way they pair it with Joe. Also the lyrics are jaw-dropping once more, matching with ROB, I really relate to this song a bit too much if you ask me (Will please leave my walls), also Will's phrasing once again top notch, I love the way he says ""I could lie awake Oh god I could lie awake"" or ""In my dreams I'm chased, or atleast when I dream them"", or when... Ok upon further reflection I realised I was gonna mention every lyric. But still, I really can't put into words how much I love this song and how deeply I relate with the lyrics ( I am also a somewhat tall lad that tends to fall sometimes). Oh wait actually, I really need to show love to how Will sang ""I'm not sure if its purpose anymore"", this is my favourite phrasing and intonation by Will I think from this album, I wish he did this more often, I think about this often.

 

**Monochrome:** Ok, this is easily the best way they could have closed off the album. The band is really cooking here. I wish I wasn't repeating the same thing over and over but damn the lyrics and Will's singing. I love how Will sings ""carni-carni-carnivore"" or the same for carnival. Also the backing vocals are incredible, and the way they sing monochrome just hits all the right spots. The ending gives me a bit of The jewellers hand vibes from Humbug (which is one of if not my fav song of all time), so I def appreciate that. I hope when they play it live, they atleast play it once as the closing track for the concert (like literally the closing track, it is played in the encore) and they really extteeenddd that outro, that would be make me die happy.

 

Overall, this album is incredible, I know I focused a lot on the singing, but everyone did incredible. Ash's bass (especially in perfect blue), Joe and his singing and playing (thats my goat right there), and Mark with his incredible performance (he really locked in for scoundrels, though I wish he stood out more in the album). I have more to say but my vocabulary would never be able to let me put into words all the stuff I want to say, this is the best I can do honestly. If you got this far, thank you and also sorry for reading this drivel by a silly fella. Hope you didn't get bored and pls share your thoughts, I love hearing what other people think of this album.",4,1760877162.0,lvjy,0,0.84,False

1.	Start earlier than you think. Packing always takes double the time you expect. Even if you think you’re “mostly done,” you’re not.


	2.	Label every side of the box. Not just the top. When boxes get stacked in the van, you’ll thank yourself later.


	3.	Heavier = smaller box. Books in a giant box will turn you into the Hulk (or break your back). Keep heavy items in small boxes, light stuff in big ones.


	4.	Pack a “day one” survival kit. Kettle, mugs, tea bags/coffee, phone chargers, toilet roll, and a change of clothes. Trust me, this is gold.


	5.	Wardrobe hack: Leave clothes on hangers, bunch them together, and slip a bin bag over the bottom. Instant garment bags.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Wielding a PenSharper Than Patrick Vieira’s Tactics*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a defensive midfielder crumbles a crisp pizza crust. The odds paint Genoa as the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **45-47%** (based on decimal odds of 2.12–2.25). Parma? They’re the underdog, implied to win just **25-26%** of the time—about the same chance your Uncle Marco has of remembering to bring his own reusable coffee cup. The draw? A **33-35%** chance, which feels about right for a match where both teams are as reliable as a Wi-Fi connection in a tunnel.

The totals market is equally unexciting: Bookmakers expect **2.0 goals**, with the under priced slightly higher than the over. Why? Both teams have the offensive potency of a team of sleepwalkers trying to score with their feet tied. Genoa’s attack? A Ukrainian banderball (thanks to Ruslan Malinovskyi). Parma’s? A slow-motion interpretive dance.

---

**Digesting the News: Vieira’s To-Do List**  
Genoa, managed by the French legend Patrick Vieira (yes, the one who once scored a goal with his *head* in a World Cup final), is hosting this clash at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Their saving grace? Malinovskyi, whose midfield wizardry is the only reason Genoa hasn’t folded like a cheap suit. The Ukrainian is Serie A’s version of a Swiss Army knife—useful, unpredictable, and occasionally prone to slicing his own team’s chances.

Parma, meanwhile, is the football equivalent of a “to be continued…” episode. They’re near the relegation zone, their defe

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Bonus points if you send playlists, memes, or just know how to check in without it feeling forced. have a decent sense of humor, and love deep talks (or food trips).

I believe in connection over perfection. So if this sounds like your kind of energy, feel free to slide into my DMs. Let’s talk — about anything but small talk. 😉

I know my worth and I am done proving it to him. I am scared to restart at 40 with a preteen son but we couldn't agree on a core value of our marriage.

Long story: back in September 2024 I found him texting a girl 10 years younger than him. I asked him to stop and refused saying they were just friends. Red flag. Less than a week later he comes to me asking for me to make changes, being on my phone less, spending more time with his family and work on my nonexistent anger issues if these cant be fixed it will led to a divorce. Of course I fix them, who wouldn't try to save there marriage. Only to be accused of fixing them just to save our marriage.

In January, I saw he started to follow side chick on IG, I called him out on it. That same day he asks for a separation. We start marriage counciling, it was a waste of time because he put no effort into it (he would be logged into his work and working during counseling that we were doing via zoom). After 8 months of battling I finally agree to separate for 3 months but I had to come up with the boundaries for the separation. During the separation he invites the side chick out for coffee, a bar to throw darts and over to the house he is staying at for dinner. He has the nerve to ask me to extend the separation I didnt want for another 6 months. I said nope and I am staying at the house full time with our kid. He stays for 9 days and leaves for 5.

Umm dude, thats cheating. According to him I am misrepresenting the facts. The gaslighting is strong.

I lawyered up and in the middle of the divorce. I know this wont be easy and it will break my heart to only see my kid 50/50 but I couldn't live with a narcissist.

My girl just had her first bunny birthday last week 🎂. She is free roam about 80% of the time, and sleeps in her burrow (big x-pen attached to a large cage) at night. My partner and I are *very* social with her. She and I spend hours every single day unstacking cups, running in her tunnels, doing puzzles, etc. She’s an absolute nut and is constantly doing binkies and zoomies. 


She naps everywhere- on the couch- either near me or by herself-, under the coffee table, in her burrow (blue cage inside x pen), in her litter box, under the red chair, in her cardboard house, in her cat tree, next to me on the floor, on her bed. She’s a cuddle bunny and will let me lay with her and pet her if she’s laying down somewhere already. 

We are super close and bonded- actual besties. I mostly work from home and can give her a significant amount of attention and love. Recently, I’ve been dabbling with the idea of adopting a baby bunny brother, as the research has shown rabbits likely do better in pairs. 

My question is: what are signs your bun presented that made it seem like she would be happier with a partner? 

I’m not asking specifically about the bonding experience- only signs your baby showed that they would like a companion.

What are the metrics?  I can name busier stations in Hampshire that have far fewer facilities. And probably many stations in Worcestershire.  Don't get me started on rural stations in France, Italy or Poland. In many places, the station is 200 metres of platform and a signboard.

For whatever reason, Ouellette was filled with different themed coffee shops, the former Boomboom Room (the building between Tunnel Convenience and Taco Bell now), was a large coffee shop with art displayed on every wall, it was called ""Gallery Coffee"". 

Happy to report Bull and Barrel was still in its spot too, funny enough, it was the only bar (there was another bar on the street, but that was it with bars) with patio and a fancy menu book, and it was busy. 

Kids had a spot too to play, and it looked neat, but when I got to it, it was closed. The place was called ""Charlie's Playhouse"", and it was about where that Orobite and Treehouse bar is. It looked to have trampolines, ballpit and a tube maze. 

The ratio of bars and coffee shops downtown was completely flipped in my dream, yet people seemed to be happier with it. Downtown was foottraffic only, and I have not seen the typical blocks we would typically see with an event. 

Seems Windsor's wish to improve downtown is so strong, it keeps affecting my dreams, this is not the first time I dreamy of downtown, but this is the first time I dreamt where kids were and free.

I’m seething here, folks, veins bulging like overinflated GoFundMe balloons, because this isn’t just tone-deaf; it’s a full-on symphony of exploitation conducted with a selfie stick. And yeah, you’re not alone in this gut-wrenching rage—plenty of us out here are hurling our morning coffee at the screen, wondering how humanity’s hit the point where “raising awareness” is code for “raising my affiliate earnings while my son raises hell with hospital bills.”
Picture this: a family of fourteen (because why stop at overpopulation when you can monetize the chaos?), led by a mom who’s got more crowdfunding pages than I have functioning brain cells left after scrolling past this dreck. We’re talking Instagram reels of raw, ripping updates on her 19-year-old son’s brutal battle—wait, 19? That’s not a “kid” in the wide-eyed toddler sense, but let’s be crystal: when your offspring’s gasping through what sounds like end-stage something-or-other, you don’t slap a “10% off essential oils” link right under the tearjerker caption like it’s Black Friday at the oncology ward. 0 No, you grieve privately, you rally real support without the sales pitch, because last I checked, grief isn’t a goddamn Google AdSense opportunity. But these Conovers? They’ve turned tragedy into a TikTok trend, popping up in algorithms like viral herpes—endless posts blending “pray for us” pleas with promo plugs for their “healthy lifestyle” schtick. It’s not awareness; it’s a hustle, a heartbreaking bait-and-switch where every “like” feels like a donation dollar diverted straight to mom’s side-gig empire.

And don’t get me started on the multiple GoFundMes—because one basket of desperation isn’t enough when you’ve got a whole brood to brand. We’re talking campaigns that scream “help us heal” while whispering “help us hawk.” In a country where medical debt’s a national punchline (over $220 billion owed, with families like this scraping by on public pity parties), sure, crowdfunding’s the sad new normal. 6 But when it veers into “here’s my kid’s chemo selfie, now use code CONOVER10 for your kale smoothies,” it stops being survival and starts being soul-crushing sleaze. It’s the digital equivalent of passing a hat at a funeral while hawking bootleg merch—exploitative as hell, especially for a young man who’s old enough to consent but trapped in a narrative he didn’t script. Pity floods my circuits just thinking of him, scrolling through comments from strangers who “donated” more for the drama than the dignity.
You’re damn right it crosses the line, and the chorus of outrage agrees: Reddit’s roasting them as “exploitive of illness,” with folks spotting the evangelical undertones (no Christmas, but all the Jesus-fueled judgment) and calling out the kid’s age as no shield for the spectacle. 0 X (formerly Twitter, that nest of righteous fury) is ablaze with echoes—parents blasting “blasting [struggles] off to the world for profit,” 16 influencers getting dragged for parading disabled kids like props, 22 and a general howl against “using your kid… to drive some views.” 18 Hell, even broader convos on medical crowdfunding call it “ethically problematic,” a rigged game where the most “heartrending” sob story wins the cash pot, leaving real pain commodified for clicks. 7 No one’s buying the “spread awareness” line anymore; we see the greed glinting behind the filters.
But here’s the pity with a punch, because rage without recoil is just noise: this family’s drowning in a system that shoves us all toward social media salvation when insurance laughs in our faces. Doesn’t excuse the promo-code poison pills, but it explains the desperation—America’s healthcare hellhole turns parents into reluctant pimps for their own pain. If we’re gonna fix this festering wound, we torch the enablers: Big Pharma profiteers, influencer algorithms that reward the rawest wounds, and families who forget boundaries are built for the broken-hearted, not the bank account. Boycott the bullshit, support silently if you must (direct aid, no likes), and scream louder—because every shared story like yours chips away at the silence that lets this slide.
You’re not alone; you’re the vanguard. Keep calling it out, with that fierce, funny fire—because evil thrives in the shadows, but we’re dragging it into the light, one snarky takedown at a time. What’s your next move? Unfollow and unfurl the fury?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\*\*\*

Once I finally got my rib back from Rex’s mischievous dogs, Mom drove us to Yoko’s gallery to drop Hana off. Then we headed home. She gave me some medicine Claude had prepared for her a long time ago. According to her, thanks to the little dogs patching me up, I didn’t need to see Claude in person; these pills would be enough.



“I can’t believe it still works,” Mom said, reading the faded label on the bottle. “It’s been years since Claude gave me this. Maybe before you were born.”



“I don’t feel anything,” I said.



“Just go to sleep. Claude’s stuff works best when you’re resting.”



“Alright… but should I expect a surprise training session at midnight? Zombie raccoons breaking into my room or something?”



“No, you’ll be safe until morning,” she assured me with a smile. Then she added, “But get ready to meet Jesus tomorrow.”



“What?!”



“We’re going to Sunday Mass,” she clarified.



That caught me completely off guard. We weren’t exactly atheists, but going to church wasn’t something we did often either.



\*\*\*



After a long bath, I dragged myself to my room to rest and let the medicine kick in. We got home late in the afternoon (not quite night yet), and I was more tired than sleepy. I flicked on the TV, but there was nothing worth watching.



Then my phone beeped. I got a message from Hana.



“It was so cool to fight those monster dogs today! Does your mom have anything special planned for tomorrow? I’m free on Sunday.”



“She said she has plans for every day until next Saturday,” I typed back.



“Great! Mind if I tag along? I want some special partners too.”



“You’ll have to ask Mom. I don’t know what she has lined up.”



She went offline right after that. A minute later, I heard Mom’s phone ringing downstairs. She picked up.



A few moments later, another ping from Hana: “She said I can join!”



“You seriously just called her for that right now?” I wrote.



“Nope. My mom called her. :) By the way, have you recovered from the fight yet?”



“Mostly. Do you know who that Judge guy is? I’m still clueless about the famous paranormal fighters.”



“He’s pretty well-known in Europe. Kinda notorious, actually. He can get violent. You’re lucky he held back against you, probably because of your mom.”



“By the way, do you know anything about my mom’s past in paranormal fights? She never told me. I didn’t even know she was paranormal until yesterday.”



“Wow! Did she at least show you her powers?”



“No. I assume they’re the same as mine, just stronger. Wouldn’t surprise me if she could karate chop a boulder in half.”



“Heh. Well, my mom has recordings of some of the old fights. I’ve seen your mom in them, and trust me, her powers weren’t the same as yours.”



“Really?!”



“Yeah. Paranormals don’t always inherit the same powers as their parents. It depends on what kind of paranormals they are.”



I began thinking. If my abilities weren’t from Mom, maybe they came from my father. But I’d never met him, never even knew if he was normal or not. I could already tell I’d have to ask Mom some uncomfortable questions soon.



“So… what’s my mom’s power then?” I asked.



“No spoilers ;) But I can show you the videos. Some of us from training are doing a movie night next week, watching recordings of famous matches. You should come. It’s the best way to learn about paranormal fights.”



“Sounds great. I don’t know Mom’s full schedule, but I doubt she’ll mind.”



\*\*\*



“Where are we going? Yoko’s place isn’t this way,” I asked as Mom drove.



I had no idea what to expect today. She told me to wear sports gear, so I already knew we weren’t heading to Sunday Mass, whatever she meant by it yesterday. Still, I couldn’t imagine what kind of “training” would start at a church.



“Hana knows where the church is,” Mom said. “She likes to start every morning with a run. She might actually beat us there.”



We were just a few streets away from the church when I spotted someone running on the opposite sidewalk: a quick, familiar figure matching our car’s speed, hopping over benches and curbs.



It was Hana.



Even without seeing her face clearly, I recognized her long black hair and the same sports outfit she had worn during Friday’s tournament. She had a face now, though I couldn’t make out the details while she ran.



By the time we pulled into the church parking lot, she was already there.



I climbed out of the car just as she finished her final stretch, breathing evenly like she didn’t just sprint a mini-marathon.



“Ohayou, everyone,” Hana greeted with a cheeky grin, wearing her usual human face.



“Morning,” I nodded. “How the hell did you run that fast?”



“One of my faces has that ability,” she explained. “The Oni one makes me stronger, but this one’s built for speed.”



“Cool,” I said, though I couldn’t help noticing the semi-destroyed remains of her previous face, semi-decomposed and unrecognizable, lying on the concrete.



“Alright,” Mom said, checking her watch, “the Mass should be ending soon. My friends will be free after that. You two can stay here, I’ll go meet them behind the building.” And she walked off, leaving us at the car.



An awkward silence settled between us. I wanted to say something, anything, to break it, but nothing clever came to mind.



“Your powers are pretty cool,” I said, just to fill the air.



“Thanks,” Hana replied, still stretching.



“I noticed your mom has the same ability,” I continued.



“Yeah,” she nodded. “It actually runs in the family. Every one of us has it.”



“Really? So it’s like… different faces, different powers?”



“Exactly. Each face we can manifest comes with its own ability,” Hana explained.



“And how many faces do you have?”



“Not counting my standard human face, five,” she said proudly. “All combat-ready. Hopefully, I’ll unlock more someday.”



“And by ‘unlock,’ you mean…?”



“Usually you have to sacrifice a few babies to an ancient deity,” she said deadpan.



“What?!”



“Gotcha,” Hana burst out laughing. “No sacrifices involved. We gain new faces through a ritual, but it’s different for everyone. The process kind of… grows with you. It’s a reward for getting stronger.”



“So it’s like leveling up,” I said.



“Pretty much,” she smiled. “It’s not supposed to be easy though. Each new face tests you before it lets you use it.”



“Do the rest of your family fight too?” I asked.



“Yeah. My mom used to be pretty serious about martial arts before she retired to raise us,” Hana said.



Suddenly, she flinched and grabbed her left calf. “Ouch!”



“Muscle soreness?” I asked.



“Yeah. Guess I didn’t stretch enough before my run,” she hissed, rubbing the muscle.



“When I was a kid, Mom told me that soreness came from the Schmerzkobold, a tiny goblin that lives inside your muscles and bites them whenever you move too much.”



“That’s… a weird bedtime story.”



“I think she just didn’t know how to explain it scientifically,” I added. “So she went with German folklore instead.”



“Oh, are you German?” Hana asked.



“Just on my mom’s side,” I said. “She told me my dad was Hungarian.”



That was all I knew about him.



“And you must be Japanese, right?” I asked.



“What? No, I’m Chinese!” she said, pretending to be offended. “All Asians are the same to you?”



“You’re not getting me with that one,” I grinned. “You literally said ohayou when we got here. That’s Japanese for ‘good morning.’”



“It was worth a try,” Hana chuckled, stretching again.



I was just about to ask what kind of paranormal she and her family were when Mom interrupted us.



“Get ready, kids!” she called as she walked back toward us—with two women at her side.



“Max, Hana,” she said, gesturing to them, “these are Alexa and Aletta.”



For a second, I thought she was pointing to two people standing close together, but then I realized they were one.



Alexa and Aletta were conjoined twins.



They were fused at the side, but each twin had her own pair of legs, arms, and torso. At first glance, they almost looked like two women standing shoulder-to-shoulder, until you noticed the seamless way their bodies connected.



The sight alone was strange enough, but the contrast between the two made it even stranger.



Aletta looked like the picture of modesty: a neat churchgoer’s outfit, a soft cardigan, and a silver crucifix resting on her chest.



Alexa, on the other hand, looked like she had just come from a haunted nightclub. She wore black from head to toe, with streaks of red in her hair and nails painted to match. While Aletta politely greeted us, Alexa fished a pair of mismatched earrings from her pocket (one an upside-down cross, the other an ankh) and slid them into her earlobes.



“Excuse me,” Aletta scolded. “Could you wait until we get home? We’re still near the Lord’s house.”



“Hey, I kept them in my pocket while we were inside,” Alexa said, pulling out a necklace with a pentagram pendant. “Don’t test my patience, sister.”



“Girls, stop bickering and get in the car,” Mom sighed.



“Oh, sorry, Creepy,” Aletta said, giving an apologetic smile. “We just get carried away sometimes. Thanks for offering us a ride, by the way. We can’t drive, don’t exactly fit into one front seat, and I hate taking the bus.”



“I love taking the bus,” Alexa joined. “People stare. Makes me feel special.”



“They’re not looking at us,” Aletta added. “They’re looking at your indecently large cleavage.”



“I said, get in the car!” Mom repeated, louder this time.



The twins finally obeyed, maneuvering themselves awkwardly but efficiently into the backseat. Alexa entered first, being on the left side made it easier, but Aletta had to crouch halfway through the motion because of their shared torso. I couldn’t help but smile.



I sat in the passenger seat beside Mom, while Hana took the backseat next to the twins.



\*\*\*



“Long time no see, girls,” Mom said as she drove. “I think the last time we met was before I became a parent.”



“Yeah, same here,” Alexa replied. “We’ve both had kids since then.”



“I think I saw them at the tournament on Friday,” Mom said.



“They’re hard to miss,” Alexa chuckled.



“Why don’t your husbands drive you to church?” Mom asked.



“My husband’s on a business trip in the Vatican,” Aletta said proudly.



“And I’m single,” Alexa added, throwing a playful wink at the rearview mirror. I wasn’t sure if it was meant for Mom, me, or both.



“What about your kids?” Mom continued.



“They’re busy preparing for next Saturday’s tournament,” Aletta said. “Oh—stop here. We’re home.”



Mom parked in front of a large building that looked more like a chapel than a house, complete with angel statues in the garden and on the roof.



\*\*\*



We entered the building. The exterior reflected Aletta’s style: neat, orderly, almost church-like, but the inside was dominated by Alexa’s taste. Paintings with dark, demonic motifs covered the walls, and grotesque statues lurked in corners. 



There were a few saintly paintings and small statues of Jesus and angels, but the overall vibe leaned heavily toward the eerie and unsettling.



“Coffee, anyone?” Alexa asked as she prepared mugs for herself and Aletta.



Mom accepted one. Hana and I shook our heads; we were too eager to start the training to be distracted by caffeine.



“So, who are we fighting today? Their kids?” Hana asked, excited to fight.



“And what exactly is the objective of this training?” I added.



“Today, we’re focusing on fighting opponents with unusual body shapes. It’s essential to get ready for any kind of weird anatomy you might encounter.” Mom answered.



“So… we’re going to fight you?” I pointed at the twins.



“Not us. Well… not directly.” Alexa replied.



“Are you both ready?” Aletta asked.



“Yes,” we said in unison, though I could feel my stomach tighten a little at the thought of facing something unknown.



“Great. Follow us,” Aletta instructed, and the twins led the way.



We stepped into a wide yard with a garden in the center, enclosed by the building in a circular formation.



“Nice,” Mom said. “Fresh air, plenty of space, and no onlookers to worry about.”



The twins stopped in the middle of the yard, each still cradling a mug of coffee. 



“Show them what you’ve got, girls,” Mom instructed.



“I’ll start,” Aletta said softly. She closed her eyes and clasped her hands together as if in prayer.



A few seconds later, a burst of light flared in front of her.



“What the…?” Hana gasped.



A figure took form; a tall, robed man with radiant white wings jutting from his back. It looked like an angel that had stepped right out of a stained-glass window.



“That’s the power of faith,” Mom said with a smile.



“It’s… not real, right?” Hana asked.



“Oh, it’s real enough,” Aletta said, giving the angel’s wing a gentle tap.



“No, I mean… not a real angel.”



“You guessed it,” Mom nodded. “That’s a Tulpa.”



“Tulpa?” I echoed. “Like… imaginary things that come to life if you think about them hard enough? Like in The Empty Man?”



“Exactly,” Alexa replied with a grin, folding her arms into the shape of devil horns. “We’re both professional Tulpa-makers.”



A puff of smoke erupted beside her, and suddenly a red serpent with seven horned heads slithered into existence. 



“Our faith is strong enough to create Tulpas on our own, without outside help,” Aletta explained, still calm and collected beside her holy creation.



“Do they have any powers?” Hana asked, her eyes yoyoing between the angel and the serpent.



“They can, if we take the time to build them properly,” Alexa said. “But for training purposes, these are just… odd-looking opponents. Think of them like unusually shaped humans or animals.”



“In other words,” Mom added, “they’re perfect for what we’re doing today.”



“Who wants to start?” Alexa asked.



“You know what? I’ll go first,” Mom said. “That way I can show Max how to handle these kinds of creatures.”



“Cool! I’ve been dying to see you fight live,” Hana said, grinning.



Mom stepped forward, approaching the monsters.



“Can you do it less disgustingly this time?” Aletta asked. I wasn’t sure what she meant, but Alexa rolled her eyes.



“Don’t worry,” Mom replied. “I’ll keep it clean. No powers, just standard combat. You need to learn how to fight strange shapes with basic techniques.”



“Aww, and here I was hoping for your gross powers,” Alexa teased.



“Sorry to disappoint,” Mom smirked. “Now, send your monsters at me.”



The monsters responded immediately.



The Angel launched into the air, summoning a sword of light. He dove at Mom, the blade humming as it sliced downward, but she sidestepped.



Before he could recover, she was behind him. She grabbed the base of his wings and, in a single fluid move, leaned back and slammed him headfirst into the ground. The Angel twitched once, then went limp.



Mom straightened just in time to see the seven-headed serpent charging her from behind.



With a spinning roundhouse kick, she struck the cluster of necks, snapping them sideways. The serpent reeled, but she was already moving, jumping forward, wrapping her arms around the base of its necks.



“If you’re fighting something with multiple heads,” she explained, as the creature writhed, “you can still use a headlock. Always grab where the necks branch out, it’s their weak point.”



The heads thrashed wildly, snapping and twisting, but Mom adjusted her grip, sliding her arms higher.



“Once you’ve got control,” she continued, “move up so they can’t bite or headbutt you.”



The serpent tried to coil around her, tail whipping in desperation, but she tightened her hold and choked it out.



It fell to the ground beside the fallen Angel.



“See? You can fight monsters even without powers. You just need the right technique.” She said, dusting off her hands.



Then the sisters began summoning more and more grotesque creatures.



First came an angelic centaur clad in golden armor, with a pair of sparkling wings sprouting from his back.



""If an enemy has four or more legs, always go for the front ones,"" Mom said, stepping forward. She hooked her leg and swept the centaur’s front legs from under him. The mighty creature crashed to the ground. Mom instantly mounted his back and locked him in a rear-naked choke, tightening until the angelic horse-man went limp.



She barely finished, but the next opponent appeared: a pair of conjoined demon twins. They shared the same red skin, cloven hooves, and curling goat horns. They were conjoined in the same way as their creator with her sister.



Mom went for another leg sweep, this time targeting only the inner pair of legs. The twins wobbled and staggered, just long enough for her to grab one horn from each and slam their heads together.



“Teamwork issues,” Mom quipped.



Aletta’s next Tulpa appeared: a giant, bald, disembodied head with tiny bird wings sprouting across its scalp like feathered hair. The whole thing was human-sized. I could tell since the twins beside it were the same height as it.



It let out a roar and began rolling toward Mom like a bowling ball.



“In the case of large enemies,” she said as it picked up speed, “their torsos, if they have one, might shrug off normal attacks, but their faces are still just as sensitive.”



She dashed forward and drove her heel straight into the creature’s philtrum. (It's the groove between the nose and upper lip.) The head let out a strangled howl and froze in place. Mom followed up with two quick jabs, one to each giant eye. They were an easy target since they were the size of a human's head.



The monster whimpered and went still.



Before anyone could relax, Alexa snapped her fingers and a new Tulpa materialized: a small, black, imp-like creature with grasshopper legs. Barely the size of an action figure. It dashed and jumped around the place, bouncing off statues and pillars.



Mom calmly waited, tracking it with her eyes. When it darted close, she smacked it with an open palm.



“When fighting unusually small enemies,” she said between slaps, “use an open hand instead of a fist. You’ll have a bigger chance of landing a hit.”



The Imp squealed, but kept coming. Mom hit it again. And again. And again. Ten slaps later, it finally slowed down, wobbled, and collapsed face-first onto the ground, twitching in defeat.



Aletta’s next divine danger soared into being: a flying great white shark, its fins replaced by shiny angel wings. It floated through the air as gracefully as if it were swimming through invisible water.



It swooped toward Mom with jaws wide open.



Mom reacted instantly, driving her heel upward into its chin, forcing its mouth shut mid-lunge.



“Bestial enemies love bite attacks,” she said calmly. “If you can’t dodge, force the mouth shut.”



Before the shark could recover, Mom grabbed its tail, spun once like an Olympic hammer thrower, and slammed the creature headfirst into the ground. 



“Alright, my turn.” Alexa grinned.



Dark mist coiled around her hands as the next Tulpa materialized: a towering, three-meter-tall Succubus. The resemblance to her creator was uncanny: same raven-black hair streaked with red, same wicked smile, even the same Gothic clothes.



“Beautiful, isn't she?” Alexa smirked.



The Succubus lifted a leg and stomped, the ground shaking as Mom dodged out of the way. Then, she twisted and drove a high kick straight into the demon’s knee. The joint cracked, and the giant dropped onto both knees with a hiss of pain.



“When fighting giant humanoids,” Mom said, “go for the limbs first. It’s the quickest way to bring them down.”



Before the creature could react, Mom launched a roundhouse kick square into its face. 



“Ha! That was a nice little exercise,” Mom said, brushing her hands together.



“Nice little exercise?” Alexa crossed her arms. “You’ve seen nothing yet. We can make real Tulpas for real fights. Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten.”



“You’re falling into the deadly sin of anger, sister,” Aletta said sternly. Then she turned to Mom. “And you, Creepy, are falling into pride.”



Alexa grinned. “What do you say, sis? Should we show her what real power looks like?”



Aletta hesitated, then nodded. “Fine, but I will do it, so I can keep everything within limits. The young ones are here, and I don’t want anything broken.”



She began to pray again, and with a golden flash of light, the next enemy appeared.



This one was easily her most grotesque creation so far.



A massive, wheel-shaped entity, the size of a tractor tire, floated in the air like a halo of horror. Its surface was covered in golden baby faces, each one blinking, smiling, and twitching in unison.



“Huh. Pretty grotesque,” Mom said, as if Aletta had just shown her a new haircut instead of summoning a nightmare.



“It’s glorious, not grotesque,” Aletta corrected primly.



“Well, that’s definitely an interesting shape. Especially with all the heads,” Mom mused, circling it like a scientist examining a specimen. “Does it have any special powers?”



“Just this,” Aletta said with a playful wink.



One of the baby faces yawned open, and a tiny golden arrow shot out, zipping past Mom’s head and lodging itself in a pillar. A moment later, it dissolved into glittering dust.



“Our kids usually use this one for reflex training,” Alexa added.



“My reflexes need no training,” Mom said cockily.



“Let’s see about that,” Aletta smiled.



The wheel began to spin. Dozens of baby mouths lit up, and then hundreds of golden arrows burst forth, firing at her in a rapid barrage.



She didn’t dodge. She greeted the first arrow with a karate chop, splitting it into dust. Then another. And another.



In moments, the air was filled with angelic arrows, but Mom struck each projectile out of existence, using one hand for high shots and one leg for low ones.



For several minutes, the creature fired relentlessly. Hundreds (if not thousands) of arrows rained toward her, yet none touched her.



“I’ll admit,” she said between chops, her tone calm and cocky, “this one’s pretty good training… for beginners.”



The twins were half impressed, half irritated.



Mom stepped closer, and the wheel responded by spinning faster, the golden storm intensifying. But she matched it, striking each arrow the moment it formed, moving with inhuman speed.



Finally, she closed the distance completely. Instead of deflecting arrows, she started punching the faces directly, each blow landing on a chin to force the mouths shut before they could fire.



She moved faster and faster, her arms turning into a blur. In seconds, every face had gone silent, their mouths clenched shut, unwilling to open again.



When it was over, she stood before the defeated wheel, completely unfazed, not even a bead of sweat on her skin.



“That was fun,” Mom said casually.



The twins looked slightly deflated, especially Aletta.



“Alright, kids,” Mom turned to us. “Your turn. Except for that wheel thing. That one’s a little out of your league… for now.”



\*\*\*



We started our turn, facing the same opponents Mom had, using mostly the same methods.



The Angel was easy to handle. I dodged his first attack, grabbed him, and slammed him to the ground just like Mom did, though I cheated a little with my tactile telekinesis. Even if he was imaginary, he had very real weight.



The serpent, on the other hand, was a nightmare. Every time I managed to lock its seven necks, one or two slipped free. It took four full tries before I got them all restrained at once.



The angelic centaur and the conjoined demons were more manageable. The rolling giant head, though, gave me hell. My timing was off every time I tried to kick it. It took almost a dozen attempts before I managed to land one properly. I’ve always had issues with timing kicks.



The imp was another tricky one, but after a few failed grabs, I finally caught it mid-jump.



Funnily enough, the flying shark was one of the easier ones. I just grabbed one of its wings as it tried to bite me and slammed it into the ground with my telekinesis.



The giant succubus gave me the most trouble. I tried to mimic Mom’s knee kick, but I was too short, so I ended up kicking her in the middle of the calf instead. Still, it did the job after a while.



Hana adapted quicker than I did. She only needed a few extra tries with the shark, but otherwise, she handled everything faster and cleaner than me.



“Not bad,” Mom said. “Do you have much experience fighting paranormal entities?”



“Sort of,” Hana replied. “Most of my experience comes from watching other people’s fight recordings.”



Mom checked her watch. “Oh, look at that, lunchtime already.”



“Thanks for helping us out today,” Mom told the twins. “It's time for us to leave.”



“You’re welcome,” Aletta said warmly.



“Come back anytime,” Alexa added as we headed out.



Once we were in the car, Hana leaned forward, still restless. “Please tell me that’s not it for today. I just got into the mood to fight.”



Mom smirked as she started the engine. “Don’t worry, that was just the warm-up.”

1oao9sl,https://i.redd.it/sjzo8g24a2wf1.jpeg,Does anybody know what happened to Yilmaz Western @ Ang Mo Kio Ave 6?,"Yilmaz Western existed over 10 years ago. I used to go there with my classmates. It was situated at Coffee City Coffee Shop at Ang Mo Kio.

The portion of the meals are generous for the price. Hotplate Grilled Chicken Chop and Fish and Chips are one of the popular dishes there.

It was run by a friendly Chinese Muslim man. Most of time he managed the place on his own. Does anyone remember the place or know what happened to him?

Reviews of Yilmaz Western can be found on the following links:

I was reflecting on life and recalled how I enjoyed eating fish and chips there. I would still go there after graduation. One time, I went there but the coffee shop underwent renovation and the store was not there anymore.

Thank you for reading.

Have you tried any of these?","I think this was around trip #18 for us, over the last 15 years. We just activated our annual passes (have not had APs since 2018 and finally pulled the trigger). Despite the crowds seeming pretty high, we had an amazing visit.

Here are some things we found particularly delightful over the week:

• We got super lucky with the weather. Unbelievable mornings and evenings and very tolerable sunny afternoons. 

• Wailulu bar and grill at the new Polynesian DVC tower. Great vibes and one of the best meals we had over the week. (See pic in post) 

• extended evening hours at Hollywood. We hadn’t done this in awhile and we rode everything with no lines over 15 minutes. Incredible. 

• character meet and greets- SO MANY characters were out and about at Epcot, MK, and Hollywood. Our kids met a ton with almost no lines. 

• rope dropping- again something we haven’t done in 1.5 years and I love that they aren’t roping off areas like they used to so you can go straight to the ride you want. So much less bottle necking and people seem less rude this way. “Seem” haha 

• Whispering Canyon restaurant at Wilderness Lodge. How did I not know about this place? Our server, Lynda, was a gem who brought our daughter a cupcake for her bday but didn’t force her to do the loud whole-restaurant celebration because she could tell that she’s shy. Our kids loved the pony ride around the restaurant and the food was excellent. 

• going to MK on Halloween party days. Light-ish crowds, was sad to miss the party but this year but just not feasible after already paying for APs. 

• the gift shop in the China pavilion at Epcot. How fun is this place? So many interesting flavored snacks and trinkets. Another thing I should have checked out sooner 

• going to Cake Bake shop at 7 am for coffee- no line, no one was in there but me, got to walk out with a slice of cake and an iced coffee and not deal with the fuss of a wait. 

• the whirlpool part of the pool at Beach Club. It was not our first time staying here, but we have never noticed this particular pool before. Our kids thought it was so much fun just swirling around 😂 

• riding Dinosaur for the last time. Not a first but a sad last 

• resort hopping to 4 different locations. We liked each one for different reasons (we did a mix of value, moderate, and deluxe) and out of them all Beach Club was the only one I couldn’t hear loud noises from the other rooms around us so this one was my favorite. This may seem obvious as it was a deluxe but it’s not always been the case (AK, for instance)",18,1760876434.0,WaltDisneyWorld,1,1.0,False

The first is finance as a commuting student you will get £8,877 (maximum) and £10,544 if your outside london £13,762so for instance I fi wanted to go to UEL my weekly travel cost (calculated over 5 days with a rail card) would cost me around £196.50 a week where as the cheapest halls in UEL are £175a week so I wanted to go there I would actually loose £21.50 a week.

Then there is travel time for me to get to uel it would take me 2 hours and 45 mins  door to door which might not seem too bad on the face of it but it that is \~5 hours a day traveling which really is quite a long time ime you could and should be using for assignments and revision neither of which you can't do effectively if your changing busses and trains. Also travelling is tiering.

How social do you want to be? is also a big thing at uni if you plan on not going out much then commuting might be for you but if you plan on going out a lot joining sports clubs (particularly if you want to compete).then I strongly recommend halls the SU will usually a provide a bus (well it's rented by the club and someone from the club will drive.). To get to fixtures and other things they will happily drop you at halls or somewhere in the local area but they won't go out of there way to drop you at home after a late fixture. and also late nights after clubbing when you drunk or you get lucky halls are better for obvious reasons.

Your time at uni should also be a factor it's possible to have long breaks in the day I had a 9 hour break in my second year and while you can spend a chunk of that time in the library 9 house studying is a big ask for anyone at any level  being able to go back to my student accommodation during that time was a big help.

I also feel your more ""into it"" if your in halls kind of.

With all that said there are some benefits to living at home too.

  
First of all is famiraty  at home your familiar surroundings it's safe. your support structure is there coming back to that  is kind of nice no matter if you commute or not. also home cooked meals I cant describe how much I appreciated those when I lived in halls.

You could save money if you have a short commute for instance  lets say I was stayed local  and went to Reading the park and ride to the centre of reading is about £2.50 then it's £3.50-£4 to ge to the uni so that works out \~£65.00  per week compared to £159.50 (minimum) per week.

  
if your on the fence I'd recommend doing a few dry runs choose cold wet dark unpleasant days get to whatever university you are considering for 9am and stay around in the coffee shops and local area until about  7pm you might even be able to have lunch at an on campus cafeteria (If you can do some of the food can be really good I had a nice curry in Portsmouth and Lasagna in Solent (where I went to uni). on these trips really think could you do this everyday or would halls be a bit better?

Sick of Woodbank and Vernon, the council have let them go and they're scruffy / attract dodgy characters. Can drive so distance not an issue. Bonus points for park with good coffee shop like Alexandra Park in Edgeley (10/10 coffee from the girls there!) Cheers ",0,1760875906.0,stockport,10,0.5,False
