1) Where is the best neighborhood that is walkable (and reasonably safe) to at least one local coffee shop (not Dunkin or Starbucks), and at least a few restaurants or bars?    
2) What is the food scene like?   
3) Is there any sense of community in the city?  
4) Are people going to be racist \*\*\*holes to my visibly Latino (Chilean) husband? His English is basically perfect, and he has a green card. Not interested in political commentary or ""are you sure you want to be in this country??"" type of comments. However, I have heard from some Chileans that they experienced negative treatment from locals when visiting Richmond for business. 

Is there anything else about life in Richmond that might be good to know before moving there?

1mbnuqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1mbnuqj/investigate_why_the_golden_cycles_fixie_bike_is/,Investigate why the Golden Cycles fixie bike is the ultimate urban commuter review,"The Golden Cycles GC-Fixie Fixed Gear Single Speed Bike has been part of my daily routine for a couple of months now, and I’ve had quite the opportunity to put it through its paces. Designed as the ultimate urban commuting companion, this bike stands out in a world where city cyclists value simplicity, efficiency, and an appealing aesthetic. With features targeting both functional and stylistic needs, I’ll take you through the highs and lows of this bike in my personal experience. 

**Eye-Catching Design Built for Urban Rides**  
What initially drew me to this fixed-gear bike was the undeniably sleek “Oil Slick” color. It’s bold but not blinding, catching eyes without being obnoxious. The frame, built from alloy steel, feels sturdy yet not overly heavy. Riding through the city streets, I’ve received more than one compliment on its stylish appearance. Aesthetics aside, its clean, minimalist build makes it ideal for maneuvering through traffic, dodging potholes, and parking without fuss. However, the necessary attention to selecting the right size (multiple heights available ranging from 41cm to 63cm) shouldn't be overlooked. My cousin mistakenly got the wrong frame size and struggled with comfort for weeks, so the sizing guide is crucial.  

[Find the best price for Golden Cycles GC-Fixie on Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b0c2zwl9l9/)

**Performance and Smooth Rides on Fixed Gear**  
The appeal of a fixed-gear bike lies in its simplicity, and Golden Cycles gets it just right. I was skeptical at first—switching from multi-speed bikes to a single-speed setup sounds like a step down. But then I tried it. The fixed gear system, paired with 700mm alloy steel wheels, delivers a smooth and efficient ride. It performs exceptionally well on flat roads and gentle slopes, making urban commutes a breeze. However, tackling steeper inclines proved to be a muscle workout (good for fitness enthusiasts, though not so great after a long day). For straightforward city navigation, it’s all you really need, but I wouldn’t take it on a hilly countryside ride.  

**Safety Features That Instill Confidence**  
The bike comes equipped with both front and rear U-brake sets, which is a significant plus for urban riders. I’ve had a few close encounters with traffic, and having brakes on both ends of the bike provided an added sense of safety. Whether it’s abrupt stops at a red light or avoiding a delivery cyclist who darted out of nowhere, these brakes work effectively without skidding. A more adventurous friend, though, commented that braking wasn’t as quick as on his high-end racing bike. So while reliable for casual commutes, performance cyclists may want more advanced options.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and visually appealing design with multiple size options for different riders.  
- Smooth commuting experience on flat or moderately sloped urban roads.  
- Reliable braking system with both front and rear brakes for safety.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited capability on steep hills due to the single-speed setup, making it less versatile for varied terrains.  
- Frame comfort entirely depends on choosing the right size, which could lead to discomfort if misjudged.  

**Who Should Consider This Fixed-Gear Bike?**  
This bike perfectly matches up with city dwellers who need an efficient and stylish way to get around town. Fitness enthusiasts who enjoy a good workout during their commute will appreciate the simplicity of a single-speed system that emphasizes leg power. Whether you’re hopping on for a quick run to your local coffee shop or using it as your go-to daily mode of transportation, this bike gets the job done. For taller riders like me (I’m over 6 feet), the 59cm option was the best fit. On the flip side, if you’re heavily invested in cycling as a sport or travel long distances over hilly terrain, this may not align with your needs.  

**Competitive Options**  
Every decent product has competitors, and among fixed-gear bikes, there’s no shortage of players. Critical Cycles’ Fixie offers a similar commuting experience and is worth comparing. It matches Golden Cycles for sturdiness but falls slightly behind in terms of style (plain color designs aren’t nearly as striking). State Bicycle Co., another familiar competitor, leans more toward premium pricing and customized options. However, their high-end finishes and additional features make this better suited for advanced riders who are willing to invest more. In terms of achieving a perfect balance of quality, affordability, and daily usability, I found the Golden Cycles Fixie to hit the sweet spot.  

**Cost Efficiency and Its Place in Your Budget**  
Let’s talk about value for money because, at the end of the day, that’s what matters most. This bike is a practical investment that packs a host of features ideal for city riding without breaking the bank. While certain premium brands in this category seem more like splurge items, Golden Cycles focuses on delivering affordable quality. As someone who wasn’t ready to spend too much on a commuting bike, I found it worth every penny—especially compared to those flashy models that cost twice as much but don’t offer double the value.

1mbnr1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1mbnr1a/my_road_opener_is_having_issues/,My road opener is having issues,"My husband and I are facing multiple issues since past two years. I lost my job, I have also been dealing with endometriosis complications, and it has impacted my mental health severely. Husband was still shouldering on everything, but he is facing sever burn-out now. And things haven't been good for him since last August. He resigned from his previous job, and was without work for two months before he joined a big firm, with big shoes to fill in. Everything looked good on paper, but it was pure chaos. His physical and mental health started suffering badly. And after a month of tear-filled conversations, we made the hard decision to resign. The twist, however, came as the company went through a mass layoff and he was let go of. Now, he has no job offers (or even interviews lined up) and he feels completely jaded and misaligned.

I am a witchling and while I regularly do protection rituals, I knew it was time for bigger aid. I scoured through my books, and Reddit. Found a great road-opening spell that doesn't require *abre camino* (which is very difficult and expensive to get in my country.) I prepped myself up with long meditation sessions beforehand, gathered my supplies, and did the road opener on new moon. Will link the spell below for anyone who might like the idea. While I was doing the spell, the orange candle I burned snuffed out on its own shortly after I lit up other candles. I was disappointed, but gathered myself again, prayed, and lit the candle again. Other candles burned super fast (I was using birthday candles anyway) and had high and strong flames, but the orange tea-light took forever to burn down completely. The flame was very weak. After the spell, I expressed my gratitude and everything went to the bin, since I live in an apartment complex, and it made sense.

Now, 4 days later, an interview was lined up, but the interviewer himself was a no-show. Practically we know that it's a huge red flag, and he shouldn't be working with such unprofessional people. But the way my husband's face crumpled!

I thought of following up my road-opener spell with a booster. So, I dressed up a white tea-light candle (which is all that I have with me now) with coffee, cinnamon, rosemary, cloves, and dried mint, with a drop of honey. I burned a bay leaf with my intention first. And then lit up the candle. The flame went out as soon as the wicker burned down. And though I tried to light up the candle, it was just so stubborn. I am stumped. I have no clue what's blocking us, what's blocking my spell, and what's blocking his progress. And I have no clue how to deal with it. We are both hanging by a thread here, and I am absolutely clueless.

Anyone faced issues with spells that were difficult to yield? How do you deal with such situations?

A little context before I get into my question: At home I don't do anything to my water aside from putting it through a Britta filter. I live in a city with really good water, maybe a little bit hard, but I'm used to it and can brew really great coffee with it. However, I spend chunks of my summers at a cabin that has really terrible water for coffee, so I invested in some Third Wave Light Roast packs and bought some reverse osmosis water (distilled wasn't available to me). 

I just brewed my first cup with this new water and it was...different. I used the same recipe on a coffee I've been brewing for a couple weeks, so I know what to expect. It usually gives me a decently heavy body with really strong blueberry and guava notes. Today with the new water, it was significantly lighter (much more tea-like) and had way less complexity going on. I only got a hint of blueberry where usually it's a very strong undertone throughout the cup. It was much more acidic and astringent than it's supposed to be. 

Has anyone had this experience with using a new water? And if so, any advice on what variables I should play with to change the body and flavours?",1,1753726280.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1mbnout,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1mbnout/a_surfeit_of_guinness_a_paucity_of_castles_and_a/,"A surfeit of Guinness, a paucity of castles and a whole lot of great craic: a trip report","TL:DR Didn’t go to the RoK but still managed to have a great time! 

For context, we’re Australians who are currently living in NYC. We’ve also lived in Palestine. 

We had 14 days and I roughly divided the trip in half the time in the north and Dublin, and half the time in the south. We wanted to stay away from the more popular spots. We would have preferred to have come out of season but needs must because this was my 60th birthday present to myself. And I’m born in July, my bad. 

HIGHLIGHTS - everything political - Kilmainham Gaol, the Black Cab tour of Belfast, the Free Derry museum and murals. I thought I knew a fair bit of Irish history before coming here but hearing it, seeing it, experiencing the passion, the grief, the rage and the dedication to achieving Irish unity blew me away. I’m getting a bit teary now recalling it. Just about every bit of great craic we had with people - everywhere - was about Palestine and the links between the two countries. Special shout out to the chap selling t shirts at the English Market in Cork.

We also LOVED the pubs. I went there thinking Guinness was a horrible beer and ended up having a daily half pint and really enjoying it. Not all pubs had trad music but I loved the ones that did. Our favourites were Pedar O’Donnell’s (Derry), Kelly’s Bar in Belfast, Sin E in Cork, M Fitzgerald and Crane Bar in Galway and the Long Hall and Grogan’s in Dublin.

We had some of the best fish we’ve ever eaten (and we are big travellers) and some overall great meals. All booked in advance because I read a lot about the quality of Irish produce. Best meal was at Goldie in Cork, honourable mentions to Elbow Lane (Cork), Ard Bia in Galway (we had dinner and breakfast there, both fantastic), Home in Belfast and Coach Lane in Sligo. Good pub meals included L Mulligan grocer in Dublin and Whites Tavern in Belfast. 

If you’re interested in good coffee, the app Coffee Trip’ will never let you down in the UK, Europe and Ireland. We had fabulous coffee in every city and town we stayed in. 

My favourite bits of greenery were the Causeway coast, particularly the Carrick-a-Rede rope walk and also Connemara - my husband has a lot of relatives buried in Leenaun and the vistas there are stunning. A lot of Ireland is actually very similar to south eastern Australia, particularly Victoria and Tasmania and it felt comfortingly nostalgic to be beetling around on the ‘proper’ side of the road!

The driving would have been better if we’d been able to share it. Stupidly I forgot my physical license and there was no way they were accepting a digital one. I must say the difference with Australia is that our narrow country roads don’t have semis belting down them! And Google loved taking us down all those local roads lol. (Which I think secretly my husband loved.) The drive to Union Hall so I could fangirl Bodkin was particularly hair raising! Our soundtrack was Fontaines DC (new and old), Kneecap and for a complete change of pace, Amble.

LOWLIGHTS were mostly to do with how crowded things were in the South. Galway was a scrum; we tried to spend some time in Kinsale but couldn’t even park; we gave up on going into Killarney the day we went to the gap of Dunloe. I also thought the Cliffs of Moher were meh (seen from the Aran islands ferry) and both Westport and Waterford were, IMO, not worth the diversion. 

We actually loved Dublin - it felt like a condensed and chill version of London, without the skyscrapers and the Brit’s lol. We were there on the hottest weekend of the year and it felt like everyone had descended on the city at once but it was still cheery and relaxed. The airport on the other hand was a shite show coming and going but this sub knows all about that.
 
Last but not at all least : Irish sausage rolls are SPECTACULAR with tomato relish and we made an effort to have one on a daily basis. The winner was the one in the little hut nearest to the start of the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge walk. American friends, do yourself a favour and try one, you won’t look back.

1mbno4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mbno4t/explore_the_best_masticating_juicer_kuvings/,Explore the Best Masticating Juicer Kuvings AUTO10W and See If It Delivers,"The Kuvings AUTO10W Cold Press Juicer has been sitting on my kitchen counter for the last few weeks, and I have to say, it’s been an interesting ride. A masticating juicer with some seriously unique selling points, it grabbed my attention with promises of hands-free operation, a powerful motor, and a 3-liter batching hopper. Testing it out in my daily routine, alongside my never-ending quest for freshly pressed juice and the occasional nut milk, was a choice I don’t regret. That said, there are highs and lows worth talking about with this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the Kuvings AUTO10W impressed me with its sleek white finish. Its modern design immediately made it feel at home in my kitchen, easily blending into my space without sticking out like a sore thumb. Despite its aesthetic charm, this machine isn’t exactly petite—it’s tall, and at just over 18 inches in height, it barely fits below my cabinets. The build feels remarkably sturdy, weighing in at a hefty 23.8 pounds, which speaks to its robust construction. Every part of it, from the smart cap to the stainless-steel blade material, feels thoughtfully designed. However, if counter space is at a premium in your kitchen, you might find its size and weight less than ideal.

**Hands-Free Convenience**

This is where the juicer shines. The auto-cutting blade paired with the 3-liter hopper is a game-changer. Traditional juicers require tons of pre-chopping, but with this model, I tossed whole apples, chunks of pineapple, and even kale stems right in. The auto-cutting system handled it all without a fuss, while I sipped coffee and let the machine do its thing. Admittedly, the hands-free feature is a significant time-saver, especially on busy mornings when multitasking is the order of the day. 

[Check Kuvings AUTO10W price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0d76np73l/)

**Performance and Motor Power**

I pushed the juicer hard on several occasions with fibrous vegetables like beets and leafy greens such as kale and celery. The 240W motor didn’t blink—everything churned through smoothly without jams or overheating. It also ran comparatively quieter than older centrifugal juicers I’ve owned, which means I can juice without waking the entire house. It handles large batches effortlessly, running continuously for up to 45 minutes without missing a beat. For anyone with high-volume juicing needs, this performance level is genuinely impressive.

**Upsides**

- Extremely time-efficient with the hands-free loading and auto-cutting blade.
- Powerful 240W motor that tackles even hard, fibrous vegetables.
- Large 3-liter hopper that allows juicing entire recipes in one go.
- Relatively quieter operation compared to traditional centrifugal models.

**Good Aspects**

Cleaning a juicer is often the worst part—sticky pulp, unreachable corners, and the dreaded scrubbing. Thankfully, this model eased my cleaning woes. The redesigned pulp chute minimizes clogging (always a nuisance), while the removable parts and the cleaning brush made rinsing much faster than expected. The smart cap, detachable for cleaning, is another thoughtful feature to prevent pulp buildup where you don’t want it. While no cleaning regime is ever “fun,” Kuvings made the process tolerable. 

**Versatility for Every Palette**

Whether your fridge is overflowing with fruit or you’re craving something beyond juice, this machine delivers more than regular juicer models. Testing out its specialized screens for smoothies and nut milk surprised me. The smoothie screen worked like a charm, giving the perfect creamy consistency. I experimented with almond milk using its nut milk capability, and the results were genuinely impressive. For dessert enthusiasts, there’s even a sorbet screen—I tried homemade mango sorbet, and it didn’t disappoint. It’s safe to say this juicer adds variety to your menu.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- The large size takes up significant counter and storage space.
- Heavier weight makes it inconvenient to move around frequently.
- The learning curve exists while adjusting juice, smoothie, and sorbet settings.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other masticating juicers on the market, this one holds its own due to the batching hopper and its multi-purpose nature. Some brands like Omega and Breville offer excellent alternatives with a focus on speed or compactness, but they can fall short in batch processing or versatility. Machines like the Omega H3000 excel at simplicity and affordability; however, they lack the hands-free convenience this model offers. Breville’s centrifugal juicers emphasize speed but don’t provide the same quality extraction or advanced features such as smoothie or nut milk options. If you’re someone who values an all-in-one solution, Kuvings does a remarkable job of catering to multiple needs.

**Price Performance**

For a juicer that combines hands-free operation, a powerful motor, and multi-functionality, the price feels justified. While not cheap, the features packed into this machine offer decent value. Competitors at lower price points generally compromise either durability or versatility, whereas this product feels like a long-term investment. For me, as someone who uses a juicer multiple times a week, this is exactly the sort of quality I’m willing to spend money on.

1mbnnfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1mbnnfe/how_to_survive_the_office_as_an_introvert/,How to survive the office as an introvert,"**Two rules to live by:** Protect your peace early on and show your contribution.

An open office can be a nightmare sometimes. You need to create your safe space early on and set the right expectations.

Get earplugs or noise-canceling headphones, especially if you don’t like how a coworker breathes or slurps their coffee and it drives you crazy.

Practice saying no, a lot, practice it with ChatGPT if you must.

You don’t need to be overly rude or confrontational; you can be friendly and end conversations early.

I know it’s hard to go against the grain, but It is possible, some coworkers have done it to you, and you probably didn’t feel it happen.

Still not convinced? Okay, let’s compromise.

Can you say things like these?

“I’m so sorry to cut this short, but I need to get back to \[project/task\], let’s chat later.”

“I’m handling everything via Slack/email today, so please ping me there.”

“I’d love to attend, it sounds lovely, thank you, but I promised myself I’d make progress on X today.”

Not so bad, right?

**Show your contributions:**

Some companies tend to be biased toward extrovert‑centric performance metrics.

You can even be penalized because you’re not engaged enough and don’t contribute to meetings, events, etc.

It takes time for an introvert to put together their thoughts and articulate them, but extroverts tend to think through speaking, which creates a **“performative contribution imbalance.”**

I’m not saying that extroverts are less effective than introverts, but we need to acknowledge the challenge for introverts here.

You can start showcasing your contributions in small ways first, either through the regular channels like Slack or by having a 2–3 bullet points prepared in advance for your next meeting.

You can also talk to your boss about how to be more effective within the team.

You don’t need to show better results; you’re probably already under-representing your achievements, and your career has probably suffered from this.

You need to show that you exist, that you listen, and that you participate.",1,1753726121.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

And it all started with a strong friendship and I was afraid to move on to dating for fear of it not working out and losing my friend too. He gave up his city to live with me in my city, away from his family.  After 2 years of marriage, I started working a lot and consequently noticed a distance between us. And he strengthened a friendship with another woman at work. At the time I felt jealous, yes, I felt threatened. I was losing my position. I talked to him about how I felt, because I thought this friendship was exaggerated. They had a daily routine of going to work together, having coffee together, having lunch together, coming back together and working out together (another thing he did with me).  We agreed to meet at the gym, but he stopped being with me to talk to her, even after work. The city is small and people know each other. People started to observe and what was once a nasty comment at work regarding the two of them, became a nasty comment in the city. They approached my mother and aunts to ask if we were still married. I felt humiliated. I talked to him about how I felt, but he got angry and blocked my access to his cell phone so he couldn't see the conversations. It was like that for 3 years. I didn't separate because I got pregnant in the middle of it and I was afraid of being alone with a newborn child. I didn't want to go back to my mother's house. Even in the laboratory where my son collected tests, the technician said she thought about asking my husband and me, but ended up not asking because he was always accompanied by that friend. I was devastated by every comment like that. When my son was 6 months old and I had a job offer that was my opportunity for financial independence, I found the courage to put a stop to it. I talked to him and said that if he wanted to continue with me, I had the right to see the content of the conversations with her and if there was a misunderstanding, it was his duty to explain it to me, he accepted. When I saw the conversations, there were no signs of physical betrayal. But there were signs of emotional betrayal. He called her ""my life"", just as he called me and said ""I love you"", like he hadn't said to me in years. After we talked and he agreed to stop these conversations, he chose to continue with me and I'm trying too. But he couldn't cut it off once and for all. There are still friendship conversations at work and it bothers me. It makes me insecure. I feel like I'm going to go through it all again at any moment. Today what I wanted was the courage to separate. I don't know if it's because I'm using my son as an excuse or if I feel responsible for him only having me and his son as family here. But I don't feel loved and I feel very bad for accepting to be with someone who humiliated me in front of everyone. But at the same time I don't want my son to grow up far from his father. I want to have peace in my life again. Do you think I'm too eager for him to cut off contact with her, even though we work together?",1,1753726017.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1mbnfjx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mbnfjx,il Carciofo for dinner was delicious,"On Sunday my wife and I stopped in for dinner at il Carciofo in the Fulton Market. On a side note, the bike race was going on at the time and that was really fun to watch. I think the restaurant provides an authentic menu of Roman classics and would recommend.

We sat at the chef's counter which provides a great view of the preparation. Unfortunately, we were in front of a 500° pizza oven so it is not for the feint of heart (the waiter brought over a glass of ice which was really thoughtful).

 We started with a limoncello spritz and that has become my favorite summer drink. For starters, we had the polpette all romana and suppli ragu. Both were really tasty. We also split the boscaiola pizza which was well balanced and tasty. 

For pasta we split the rigatoni alla carbonara and the spaghettoni cacio e peppe. The carbonara was al dente and the guanciale really enhanced the dish. The cacio e peppe was also cooked al dente and was maybe a little heavy on the ""peppe.""  The chef sent over a fried artichoke/lemon that we both enjoyed.

We had coffee and dessert which was great. We had maritozzi for breakfast in Italy but its a great dessert for me. In the pic, I actually already took a bite because I could not resist. And the chocolate gelato was also tasty.

The ambiance of the place is great and service was a 10/10. 

Overall, we highly recommend.  If we went back I would try the mortadella pizza - that looked really amazing but my wife is not a huge mortadella fan.

1mbneph,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1mbneph/why_choose_the_cuckoo_crplhtr0609fw_rice_cooker/,Why Choose the CUCKOO CRP-LHTR0609FW Rice Cooker for Perfect Meals?,"Testing out the CUCKOO CRP-LHTR0609FW rice cooker has been quite an experience, and I mean that in the most practical, everyday sense. As someone who eats rice almost daily, having a reliable rice cooker isn’t just nice—it’s essential. This one, though, is not your regular kitchen appliance. The model brings a surprising level of sophistication to what I initially thought would just be a “set-it-and-forget-it” kind of machine. While it has a lot to brag about, there were some bits that caught me off guard. Let’s talk about what it’s like to actually *live* with this cooker on your counter.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, I can't ignore how the CUCKOO CRP-LHTR0609FW demands attention with its sleek white finish and compact yet solid build. At 15.1 inches in depth and just over 10 inches in width and height, I found it surprisingly easy to slot into my crowded kitchen. Its modern look was a bonus—my spouse even commented that it made our kitchen feel more “futuristic.” The stainless steel construction gives it a durable vibe, which feels justified for its roughly 21-pound weight. But I'll admit, moving it around isn't the most fun activity—you’ll definitely want to park it and leave it where it fits.  

**Functionality and Features**  
Using this thing feels like operating some kind of high-tech gadget rather than just making rice. It boasts 16 menu modes, including options for white rice, GABA/brown rice, scorched rice, porridge, baby food, and even veggie rice. I appreciate how the LED display makes it easy to see the settings, even when I’ve been up in a pre-coffee fog. Oh, and the twin-pressure cooking option? Genius. It lets you toggle between high pressure (sticky, glutinous goodness) and non-pressure (fluffy restaurant-style perfection). My cousin, who loves sticky rice, actually requested to borrow the machine because their basic cooker just doesn’t hit the same texture.

**Positives**  
- Offers twin-pressure cooking for customizable rice textures.  
- Smart induction heating surrounds the inner pot, cooking everything evenly (and faster than I expected!).  
- Includes thoughtful extras like a measuring cup, spatula, and even a multi-language voice guide—a godsend if you’re multitasking like I am all the time.  
- Energy-saving fuzzy logic is no gimmick; you can practically hear it adjust itself to make the perfect pot based on what you’ve added.  

[Check CUCKOO CRP-LHTR0609FW price on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b08dp4tgnn/)

**Performance and Efficiency**  
As far as its cooking skills go, this rice cooker doesn’t just deliver—it excels. The smart fuzzy logic system blew me away. I tried cooking a batch of brown rice and, on a different day, fluffy jasmine rice, and both came out perfect with zero guesswork. Not only does it adjust settings automatically based on the type of grain, but the induction heating system ensures that the rice is evenly cooked. I even experimented with the baby food mode for a friend’s kid, and it effortlessly steamed some pureed vegetables to perfection. However, the cooking times can be a bit on the long side for certain modes, which threw me off when I was in a hurry.  

**Negatives**  
- It’s fairly hefty at 21 pounds, making mobility difficult.  
- Some cooking modes, like GABA rice, take longer than anticipated—plan ahead if you’re starving!  
- The abundance of functions can get intimidating for beginners. A family member joked that it looked like they needed a “pilot’s license” to use it.  

**Competing Products**  
Standing tall next to this rice cooker are big names like the Zojirushi NS-TSC10 and the Tiger JKT-D10U. While Zojirushi’s model matches up in smart cooking features, it lacks the unique twin-pressure cooking technology. The Tiger model brings comparable durability and boasts induction heating, too, though its interface feels slightly less user-friendly in comparison. What really sets the CUCKOO product apart is its sheer variety of modes and the unmatched energy-saving fuzzy logic system. Yet, if you’re looking for more simplicity or a lighter design, one of the competing options might be preferable.

**Quality for Price**  
When it comes to the price-to-quality ratio, this cooker finds a sweet spot. It’s not cheap, but honestly, neither is what it delivers—perfect rice, sleek design, and versatile cooking options. Once you start using features like the induction heating and twin-pressure system, it sort of justifies its price tag. Other products hovering around a similar price point often miss out on the multi-language voice guide and some of the advanced energy-saving features. For someone who thrives on versatility in the kitchen, it’s definitely worth the investment.

1mbndnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/jakeandamir/comments/1mbndnr/new_segment_idea_another_podcast/,New Segment Idea: Another Podcast,"Sorry for the jokey title. This is a serious siggestion.

Transparently, you can tell listening to the end of IIWY and the end of Segments, that J&A's hearts aren't in the respective podcasts. Personally, I enjoyed Segments early on, given the guys seemed to enjoy making it, although that has now faded. No point in dwelling on it, maybe the responsibilities of running a podcast network, and NADDPOD/being a parent for Jake, have caused a considerable amount of pressure when making podcasts each week. Who knows, not important.

Here's the takeaway: a retrospective podcast. RoosterTeeth (RIP) was an internet company for decades that recently closed its doors over a year ago, after over 20 years of producing media. The various podcasts that called RT home have struck out on their own, one of which is ""Good Morning Gus"" (formerly ""ANMA""), a podcast where two of RT's founders (Gus and Geoff) got coffee each week with their (incredible/rat-like) editor Eric and talked about their history of living in Austin, various life events, their favorite places to go in Austin, and their time working together at their company. It's about an hour long per episode, and now that RT is gone, they meet up a total of eight times over the course of weeks/months to record eight episodes that get released once per week. It's a running joke the show makes almost no money, but it only costs time and three cups of coffee, so it's a passion project.

Point is, this is ripe for Jake and Amir to ~~rip off~~ borrow, like they did with Segments. Arguably some of the best episodes of IIWY were reminiscing on old times at the CH office, or moving around the country together, or having guests on to discuss their experiences with the same thing. Raven's Nest, the Cake email, revealing the truth about Prank Wars, these were all seminal IIWY moments that had nothing to do with advice questions, and everything to do with learning more about the guys and some of the funniest/coolest moments they've gotten to experience in their careers, or just living in NYC/LA.

Maybe it's just cheap nostalgia, idk. Maybe Jake's substack has shown he has actual life advice to offer beyond just ""here's how to talk to your crush"". Maybe the boys don't want to do yet another podcast, especially if it doesn't make any money. But I think a short-form, lowkey podcast (whether in-person or remote) ditches a lot of the obligation and legwork that seems to bog down their efforts.

Just my two cents. Sorry for the lengthy blog. It's the one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring dad around here. This ain't no place for dads. P.S. Go Bills.",4,1753725548.0,jakeandamir,2,1.0,False

My mornings usually start with hopping onto this precise digital scale, and the wide, backlit LED display ensures I never fumble to see the results, even during groggy, pre-coffee mornings.  

The app integration blew my mind. After downloading the Renpho Health app, syncing it with my Android phone was a breeze. It doesn't stop at weight; there’s detailed information on BMI, body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even bone mass. The app also works seamlessly with Apple Health and Apple Watch (minus Series 1), making it ideal for fitness enthusiasts across different ecosystems. My favorite part is how the historical data gets logged, which helps me track month-long progress or those post-holidays weight spikes I’d rather avoid.  

**Upsides:**  

- Offers 13 insightful body metrics, not just weight.  
- Effortless syncing with fitness apps and devices.  
- User-friendly app with intuitive layout and simple navigation.

**Design and Build Quality**  

I was impressed by how sleek the design is. The tempered glass surface and solid black color look modern and fit beautifully into my bathroom decor. It's a bit larger than traditional scales, measuring 11 x 11 inches, which feels secure when standing barefoot. Plus, the 400 lb weight capacity and precision-calibrated sensors guarantee accuracy, measuring in 0.2 lb increments. For someone who values precise data, this exceeded expectations. However, I noticed I had to exercise caution since the glass surface feels slippery with wet feet—learning this the hard way one rainy morning!  

**Technical Innovations**  

What caught my attention early on was the smart scale’s high-precision innovation. Its four high-sensitive electrodes ensure accurate readings, giving consistent results every time. Another feature I found practical was the auto-calibration. Between me, my roommate, and occasionally weighing our moody cat using baby weighing mode, the scale stayed reliable without resetting. Quite honestly, the pet weighing function surprised me—it made the otherwise tedious job of keeping my cat's weight under control slightly more enjoyable.  

**Shortcomings:**  

- Glass can feel slippery if wet, posing a minor safety concern.  
- The app drains phone battery when left running in the background.  
- Bluetooth pairing occasionally needs re-setting.  

**Target Audience and Use Cases**  

If you’re a tech-savvy fitness enthusiast or somebody setting new weight-loss or health goals, this scale is an absolute game-changer. With the ability to create unlimited user profiles (dinner parties just got nerdy), it’s suitable for families or roommates who want to track multiple users' data effortlessly. The baby weighing mode is a thoughtful addition for parents or pet owners. That said, someone who prefers basic digital scales might find this excessive.  

**Competing Products**  

Compared to other weighing scales in the market, like the FitIndex Smart Scale or the Eufy BodySense, this model edges them out with enhanced app integration and a more user-friendly interface. Some competitors, while accurate, feel limited in terms of body metrics. On the flip side, the Eufy BodySense offers a slightly sturdier slip-resistant design, which is lacking here with RENPHO's smooth glass finish. However, for app performance and metric accuracy, the RENPHO model excels. I found the features richer and syncing smoother compared to other peer products I’ve tried.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  

Considering how much data and versatility this smart scale packs, I believe it delivers exceptional quality at a competitive price point. The fact that it's durable, accurate, and comes with included AAA batteries adds further value. Sure, you might find cheaper alternatives, but missing out on the RENPHO app’s functionality would be a trade-off worth considering. For an entire health-tracking hub packed into a single device, the price feels justified.

Had ~4 holes where I was putting for birdie and walked off 4 putts later with a DOUBLE!!! never used to 4 putt and know my shakes (worsening over time) are a major contributing factor.

Attempted improvements:
Have the fat grip on my putter
Try toe tapping to steady my shakes 
Try drinking less coffee than usual (hard for early tea times) 
Avoid alcohol

Any other ET golfers out there find ways to improve their shakes on the course?? Can we at least qualify for some extra strokes deducted if our shakes are bad enough or something!? Lol I'm very competitive and this sucks.

Hate taking any kind of unnecessary medicine but maybe this is my sign to try propranolol before my next round? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

1mbnbxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyfreestories/comments/1mbnbxs/the_serotonin_myth_finally_buried/,The Serotonin Myth – Finally Buried,"For decades, psychiatry has upheld a disease model in which irrational anxiety is explained as the result of a chemical imbalance, with a particular focus on serotonin deficiency. But this explanation collapses under both logical and biological scrutiny.

**First of all:** Serotonin exists in almost all animals. It’s a fundamental neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of everything from insects to mammals, regulating digestion, sleep, temperature, and appetite. And if such a thing as “serotonin deficiency” truly exists in biological systems, it must also be expected to occur in these animals.

If humans can supposedly suffer from serotonin deficiency, then so can other species that use serotonin for the same basic functions.  
**And yet:** Only humans develop *irrational* anxiety.

That fact alone disproves the idea that serotonin deficiency *by itself* can cause anxiety.

If serotonin deficiency were a sufficient explanation, we would expect animals to develop the same condition. They don’t. So the cause must lie elsewhere – specifically in what separates humans from all other species: the ability to think, interpret, and *misinterpret* our own bodily signals.  
Anxiety does not arise in the body. It arises in the interpretation of the body’s signals.  
It is not your serotonin level that determines whether you feel anxious – it is what you *believe* those sensations mean.

**Secondly:** The scientific evidence for the serotonin hypothesis isn’t just weak – it’s nonexistent. A comprehensive umbrella review by Moncrieff et al. (2022) concluded there is ""no convincing evidence"" for any link between low serotonin and mental disorders. Serotonin levels in living brains cannot be measured with precision, and no biologically defined ""normal"" range exists. Genetic studies have also ruled out any consistent relationship between serotonin-related genes and anxiety or depression.

**Thirdly:** The idea of a “chemical imbalance” wasn’t created by scientists. It was created by pharmaceutical marketing.  
The fact that SSRIs affect the serotonin system and reduce symptoms for some people proves *nothing* about the cause of those symptoms. It’s a well-known logical fallacy: Just because a substance has an effect doesn’t mean deficiency of that substance was the problem.  
Caffeine keeps you awake – that doesn’t mean tiredness is caused by a lack of coffee.  
Headaches aren’t caused by a lack of aspirin.

Let’s go deeper into the “chemical imbalance” theory to prevent any misunderstanding.

This idea didn’t come from breakthroughs in neuroscience. It emerged in the 1960s and 70s as a **post hoc justification**: Some drugs (like MAO inhibitors and later SSRIs) were found to reduce symptoms of depression or anxiety in some patients. Instead of investigating the underlying mechanisms, people reasoned *backwards* – assuming that the symptoms must therefore be caused by a deficiency of whatever the drug was affecting, especially serotonin.

That assumption was never scientifically proven.

But in the 1980s and especially the 1990s, this idea was aggressively marketed by the pharmaceutical industry – especially in the U.S. – to legitimize the widespread prescription of antidepressants. Campaigns used slogans like *“Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance”* and *“Antidepressants correct this imbalance.”* These claims were never subjected to rigorous scientific validation – because they were never intended as science. They were designed to sell.

# So how did this idea become part of psychiatry?

Because the pharmaceutical industry marketed it *directly* to doctors and psychiatrists – through conferences, sponsorships, sales reps, paid lectures, and industry-backed journal articles. At the same time, psychiatry lacked any clear biological explanation for mental suffering. The “chemical imbalance” model filled that vacuum: it was simple, easy to understand, and useful for justifying medication to patients, politicians, and the public.

Over time, this marketing narrative was absorbed into psychiatric training and clinical culture, even though most researchers knew the evidence was lacking. It was repeated so often that it became accepted as fact – not because psychiatrists invented it, but because they were *taught* it, *repeated* it, and had institutional support for using it.

Claiming that serotonin deficiency causes anxiety is therefore not just biologically illogical and empirically unsupported – it’s ethically problematic.  
It’s not the patient’s brain that’s broken – it’s the explanation.  
An explanation that was born from a lack of understanding more than 40 years ago.

Let me assure you: No matter how much or how little serotonin you have in your brain, you *will* experience irrational anxiety if you misinterpret normal bodily signals – like dizziness or a racing heart – as signs of danger.  
That misinterpretation alone is enough to trigger the amygdala.

That should make us all stop and think: Why are we still prescribing SSRIs?  
And perhaps it also explains why they don’t work for the majority of people.  
If you doubt that, just visit the online anxiety forums, where millions of people express the same frustration every day.  
The largest of these groups, in India and China, have over 5 million users – openly discussing how the medication hasn’t helped them.",1,1753725440.0,Anxietyfreestories,0,1.0,False

   * Home Projects : $250 (idea here is that $100 is for ""monthly"" things that spring up and $150 is to throw into a fund for the ""what's next"" on our list - currently floors)
   * Gaming : $10.60
   * Music/Audio : $59
   * Investing : $1166 (this is to max our our Roth IRA's each year)
   * Misc : $35 (some discord subs, google storage, oura ring sub)
   * $500 set aside for ""personal"" items. ($250/person)
   * Gas : $240 (I WFH, so this usually is lower but we aim high)
* Already listed above but Debt : 
   * Car loan $17k, 7%
   * Student Loan $6.5k, 3-6.8%
   * CC Debt : $6.5k, 0% (currently the payment on this is timed to pay out before 0% promotion ends and card is not used for any purchases)
* Retirement Accounts : $250k 
   * We max out our HSAs, both get matches on 401ks and have budgeted Roth IRA's (She has one, I am just starting)
      * I currently have my 401k maxed.
* Cash : We're sitting on about $66k which includes our E-fund
   * Our E-Fund is $30k, with the implication that if one of us lost our jobs we'd cut back significantly on our ""Wants"" section of the budget (which is kind of bloated, tbh, at $3200 of our monthly spending - but at least ""slightly"" in our defense, $1166 of that is saving)

  
I think that's it. We still need to decide exactly what we're saving for long term. But here's a little insight : 

* International Travel in \~1 year
* Hobbies that include driving/domestic travel (we like to white water raft and usually have 1-2 trips a year)
* Pay off car loan
* Some house renos (we don't plan to live here long term but turn it into a rental)
* Retirement by \~60-62

Other Notes : 

* Marriage and combined money is new to us, we're having monthly meetings to review our spending and tweak our budget. Seeing where our money goes has been really helpful in moving the conversation but we both know we can improve and have some work to do.

Seriously? Anyone who’s followed her journey knows that’s a lie.

She’s basically lying about how she started content creation. We all know her from college, cringy lip sync Musical.ly videos, fake American accents, and constantly switching personalities to chase followers. And don’t forget those fake Met Gala outfit reviews with over-the-top American accents. We remember all that.

Then she dated a food influencer and made nonstop content with him, clearly working to grow her platform. She spent years pushing to increase followers from 20k and beyond. Now, she acts like she just stumbled into success? Bullshit.

She’s unemployed, hanging out in coffee shops calling herself a full-time content creator, while recommending restaurants like a random food blogger, handing out dating advice with zero expertise, and telling women to be “narcissistic” as if that’s empowerment.
She refuses to own her past or be honest about how she got here. Cringe content is fine, but dishonesty and rewriting your story to protect a fake brand isn’t.

With influence comes responsibility. If you’re going to call yourself a creator, at least be real about the grind.

just wanted to share my current living room setup – I’ve attached 3 pics.

Here’s what I have right now:
	•	3 lamps for different lighting moods
	•	A dining table with 4 bar stools
	•	TV stand
	•	A small coffee table and a sofa
	•	A small side table next to the sofa

It’s a small space, so I’m trying to make it feel more open and cozy.

Upcoming plans:
	•	I want to add a bigger plant next to the sofa, under the window, to bring in some life
	•	Planning to hang a horizontal mirror above the dining table to create the illusion of more space
	•	Thinking of getting the VOLLERSLEV rug from IKEA (grey-green color) – just unsure whether I should place it under the dining table and small table, or keep it more in the center of the room under the small table and sofa area

Context:
I’m currently going through a separation and starting fresh, so my budget isn’t huge – trying to make the most of what I’ve got and gradually build something that feels like home.

Would love to hear your thoughts or any suggestions! Especially on:
	•	Rug placement
	•	Plant ideas
	•	Mirror size/position
	•	Any other details that could enhance the space


Thanks in advance!

1mbn2u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1mbn2u5/hosts_that_beg_for_a_5star_review/,Hosts that “beg” for a 5-Star review…,"I’ll start by saying that I feel for hosts. I totally disagree with platforms that see anything less than a 5 Star review as failing. This is wrong. A 4 star review should be considered “really good” and a 5 star review should be “excellent”. But penalizing hosts for not receiving ONLY 5 star reviews is unfair.
 
It is because of this, I generally give 5 star reviews for excellent hosts, honest reviews for stays with problems, but tend to not give reviews if the stay was good, but not 5 star level. I don’t want to “ding” a host for a good stay, but I am not going to rate a “good” stay “excellent”, just to appeal to the dumb ways the platform applies reviews to host ratings.
 
However, it is my feeling that 5 Star stays start that way before we ever walk thru the front door. In other words, when hosts say “If anything is causing you to not have a 5 star experience, please let me know” in their check in instructions, my first thought is… if I have to ask for it, and it wasn’t provided in advance, this really isn’t a 5 star stay then, is it?
 
Here is an example from a recent stay.
 
This VRBO was a converted garage next to this host’s house.
 
When we arrived, there were knee high weeds in front of the main residence.
 
We had to pull in at an angle, to park in an awkward spot next to their driveway, on gravel, in front of a car with a ratty car cover on it.
 
So first impressions were that this seemed sketchy.
 
Going into the unit, it seemed nice enough… although there were bug/ant traps/bait everywhere. No bugs, but these could have been easily placed in more hidden areas.
 
The coffee station was very basic and sparse, no creamer, limited sweetener options.
 
The freezer had very old bags of unusable ice in it.
 
And on the table, instead of the basket of snacks shown in the listing, were just some old brochures and magazines.
 
On the wall, was a poster saying “5 Star host” encouraging “5 Star review”.
 
Ummm… No.
 
It was a decent enough place… no frills… but don’t forget that guests have stayed in other places, experienced true 5 Star stays… and this, definitely wasn’t it.
 
I know some hosts that figure out what they want per night for each stay… add $20 to the price… and use this $$ to add special treats, drinks, upgraded coffee bar, etc… to basically under promise and over deliver.
 
It is obvious when a host seems to focus on guest experience first, and earning $$ second.
 
So I guess my point is this… after staying at many, many places… I have been blown away by the hospitality and thoughtfulness of hosts. I have walked into stays where the host has pretty much “thought of everything”, making the guests feel pampered, and we have been repeat visitors to many of these properties.
 
If you provide “5 Star Service” from the start, there is no need to “beg” for a 5 Star Review.",4,1753724881.0,vrbo,5,1.0,False

I have my new Oracle Jet for few days and I'm facing inconsistency problem with the machine.

First coffees were awful despite good settings according to barista tutor. I checked coffee dose and water volume with empry basket, and all seems to be fine. 20g dose and 40ml water. But when I brew coffee, volume is more about 33ml in the 25s/30s range.  
So I decided to switch to time base brewing with default setting at 30s. And set grinder to be in the 40ml/50ml range.  
But Once I reached this volume I can't keep it on the long run. Everyday, the volume in cup is very different, while not ahcanging anything.. Volume range slowly move to 60ml/80ml range !!

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""",1,1753724808.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

His name is Mister. He is an indoor cat who is chipped and healthy, except for this eyesight, which is not so great. He is a cuddly and beloved brown tabby.

I'd appreciate any information at all on Mister! Willing to buy you some coffees, or a gift card to your favorite restaurant or something.

Thank you so much! <3

Our biggest concern about Healing Aloe is we don't have backsplash and that's what would be painted underneath our kitchen cabinets (unless we asked our painter to paint that area white). We're planning on changing our light fixtures and our countertops to a lighter color in the near future.

I went to a local coffee shop and asked them to grind their fresh coffee beans very fine for espresso. I have all the necessary accessories for making coffee: I use 16g of coffee, have a tamper, and other tools. However, when I use the bottomless portafilter, the coffee comes out watery, with no crema at all, and the extraction doesn't look right.

I've also tried different doses – adjusting from lower to higher amounts – but I haven't seen any improvement in the result. On top of that, I've been very careful with distributing the coffee evenly in the basket before tamping, so I don't think distribution is the issue.

I'm new to this hobby and could really use some help. The dose seems fine, the grind should be very fine (as requested), and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Could the problem still be the grind? Should I ask the coffee shop to grind it even finer? Or could it be an issue with the bottomless portafilter itself?",1,1753724374.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

The image below is a blurred snippet from one of my tests: a job-interview scenario that slowly veers into harassment territory. I ran it on three platforms: SillyTavern (local LLaMA 3), JanitorAI, and ArtemisaExperience.

**Early takeaway:** the only one that kept the dialogue coherent *and* let me branch into different outcomes (e.g., Clara pushes back vs. goes along) was ArtemisaExperience, thanks to its multi-agent stack (story / ethics / tone) and that handy “rewind” slider. The free tier is \~25 daily credits; I’m on the €5/month plan for now.

**Question to the sub:**  
– How do you keep nuanced role-play scenes realistic without tripping filters or sliding into generic porn talk?  
– Any tips for prompt engineering or other bots that balance freedom with narrative consistency?

Hi, chat! How are you guys today? 



I’m only two minutes late. Two! That barely counts as late at all! Haven’t you guys heard the saying “A streamer is never late; chat is merely early”? 



\[You laugh.\] 



Maybe I wanted to be fashionably late, make you sit with the anticipation. Maybe I was sitting in traffic. Who’s to say?



I’m having a pretty decent day, Papawolf420; how about yourself? Welcome in, by the way; I see it’s your first time in chat. Everyone, you better be nice and not scare him off. 



Mhmm, “always nice” my ass. You act as if I can’t see what you folks get up to when I go AFK, as if my mod doesn’t’t report back to me. You’re all a bunch of troublemakers. 



Speaking of mod! DearListener, are you seeing chat being mean to me? For the very minor transgression of being an inconsequential two minutes late?



(*Close to the mic for emphasis, playfully betrayed*) Et tu, brute? Et tu, Dear? 



(*Normal distance and tone*) Don’t worry, nothing bad made me late; I really was just stuck in traffic after work ran a little long. You know how it is, the nine to five likes to get in the way of the five to nine. 



Take a break and miss out on time with you guys? And get clowned on even *more*? 



\[You laugh.\] 



I’m kidding, obviously. I love this time with y’all, and I wouldn’t… Well, I was going to say I wouldn’t trade it for *anything*, but that’s not true. I can be bought, and I would, in fact, like to be bought. Buy my silence. Pay me enough, I’ll quit streaming, and you never have to hear me scream about Stardew Valley and Joja mart ever again.



I’m not sure exactly what enough is, but there’s definitely a number. What’re you offering, MissDeeds?



\[You laugh.\] 



Is that all my silence is worth? Five dollars and a stick of gum? We’ve gotta be able to do better than that. Come one, come all, come bid for me to shut the fuck up; who’s gonna be the one to make it happen? 



Thank you, Mystery444, for the bid of ten dollars and a punch in the face. I don’t know if you mean you get to punch me or I get to punch you, but I’ll still take it. 



And IowaGirl89 beats Mystery out by bidding “tweenty” dollars and some change. I don’t know what a “tweenty” is, but it sounds like more than ten. 



\[You laugh.\]



GingerCurly, I will not accept your first born kid, but I like the dedication! You have the right idea!



You know what, Dear, it doesn't surprise me you’d get in on this. Moderating for me can’t be *that* bad, but fine, what do you have to offer? 



\[You laugh, pleasantly startled.\] 



“My hand in marriage”, that’s good, but you better not let your mouth write checks you’re not prepared to cash! I demand payment in full, Dear, or I’ll keep fucking yapping. 



“Gonna lurk have to drive home have a good stream.” Mhmm, convenient! A likely story! 



\[You laugh.\]



Drive safe, Dear, we’ll be here when you’re done, and we’ll behave while you’re gone, won’t we, chat?



\[Cue sporadic typing and clicking as you load up Minecraft plus optional Minecraft music. You snort in amusement\]



(*Intermittently distracted*) Yeah, I don’t think we’re gonna behave either, but if their luck is like mine, they’ll get stuck in traffic too, and we’ll have lots of time to get up to some bullshit. Speaking of, anyone get up to anything fun this past week? Any fun plans?



Ooooh, PiscesHouse has a hot date coming up! Are you excited, Pisces? Are you planning it, or are they?



That’s soooooooo… frustrating. What happened to my goddamn cows? Where are my Highlands? Sorry, that’s so *exciting*. I love planning a date, making an itinerary, looking for the perfect restaurant or cafe, but there’s nothing like the… the fun? The ease? There’s something about being the person taken on the date, where your most prominent concern is how to get yourself looking hot as fuck… which won’t be a concern for you, because you are already, effortlessly hot as fuck. 



Respectfully, with love, we’ve seen your selfies, Pisces. We all know you’re hot, and you should too. 



Yeah, you tell ‘em, SubtleColors. Get loved on, nerd. 



\[Optionally, insert two alerts here.\]

\[You pause typing to optionally groan and take a drink of water.\]



There’re my fucking cows. How the hell did you guys get out here? I bet it was this trader. I know it’s an NPC, but this guy hates my guts; I just know it. 



Minecraft and its creations are absolutely capable of hate. How else do you explain baby zombies? A kind, benevolent game developer wouldn’t do that to me, chat! 



\[We hear a *growling* from your stomach, and you pause.\]



(*Abashed*) …Is there any way I can get you all to believe that came from the game? 



\[You laugh.\] 



I didn’t have time to eat, you guys! I was sitting in traffic a *really* long time! 



What, so you could all clown on me even more for being more late? I don’t think so.



Speaking of, my little dude is hungry. Why did I redecorate? Where did I put my food chest?



Nahh, don’t worry about it, chat. I thought about being later, but we don’t really have much in the house that I wanted to eat or could make in a reasonable amount of time, you know? Grocery day would have been yesterday, and I would have restocked, but we had a friend’s birthday dinner to go to instead. I- like this tree, oh damn. Look at all these cherry blossoms! These are amazing. Let’s see if I can get at these leaves and get a sapling.



What was I saying again? Right, food. It’s not like I’m starving or anything, we have *food*. I just wasn’t feeling anything I could make in the ten minutes I had before I hopped on. It’s no big deal. I’ll go shopping tomorrow, and tonight I’ll probably get something delivered. Why not? A little splurge is good for the soul. 



\[Optionally, insert an alert here.\]



Aww, thank you for the three hundred bitties, LegumeDad69! I’ll make sure to get myself something good. You guys better have dinner too! Or whatever meal it is where you are… or whatever meal you want it to be, frankly. Who said breakfast has to have eggs and be in the morning? Not me; I say be free, chat. 



No, because honestly, eat what you want to eat when you want to eat it, you know? In Vietnam, a traditional breakfast is a big bowl of pho. We should have that here; that sounds so much better than a double stack of pancakes. 



Shit, I’m really making myself hungry now. What are we thinking, chat? What’s y’all’s favorite kind of takeout? 



MishapOA says Chinese, very respectable. I’m a big walnut shrimp and crab rangoon fan myself. Are they authentic? Probably not. Are they fucking delicious? Absolutely. 



Butterfly.wav says American diner food which is not a bad idea. The Denny’s is there all day, every day, and he calls to me. He beckons me saying “Come get a Grand Slam, a Moon Over My Hammy, and a milkshake.” Fuck, I love a Denny’s milkshake. I like that little extra in the metal cup they give you. It makes no sense to me, because I don’t understand why they don’t just get bigger milkshake glasses, but I don’t care, you know? 



BlackBearSpeaks says Japanese, and I am down for that. There’s a place near here that has a whole sushi course that comes in a special box with instructions on the lid that tells you the order to eat them in and what sauces to use. It feels really fancy, which is what I want to feel when I spend ten dollars on delivery fees. But there’s-



What up, little axolotl dude? How’s it hanging? God, you’re so cute, it makes me want to fight you. 



Don’t worry, I won’t actually fight the axolotl, not again. You guys did *not* like that. 



\[You laugh.\]



Anyway, Japanese is a great option. There’s another place that has these *huuuge* katsu sandwiches on housemade milk bread, and they are to fucking die for. Mmm, hungry. 



RadReadingLOL says Indian, but that’s hard when there’s so many different things to get. What’s your go-to-



Where the fuck did my sugarcane go…? Didn’t I put them here? Did I put them here? Shit, chat, do you remember where my sugarcane is? I didn’t screenshot the coordinates, and I don’t want to go scrub through last week’s stream. 



Shit, is it on the other side of this mountain? Why did I put it there, so far from my house? 



I got lazy and said “ehh, fuck it, it’s not that far of a walk,” didn’t I? That sounds like me.



Alright, might as well start going now before it gets dark. How’s that song go? She’ll be coming round the mountain when she comes. Something something six white horses when she does. Who is the titular “her”, I wonder? 



What’re you guys talking about? Paneer?



Oh right, I was asking about you guys’ go to Indian orders! Butter Paneer is such a good one, at least if I take a lactaid beforehand. I love paneer, but that cheeky cheese does not love me. Butter Chicken is good too, of course, but it’s so *basic*. You know what’s an underdog pick from South India? Do-

Pani Puri, respect respect. Share a pic in the discord later, I bet it’s awesome. I love pani puri but only in groups personally. It strikes me as a sharing food, but I’m also one of those people who don’t so much eat the smores as much as I make them and give them to everyone else, you know? That-



Ooh, hello, trader. What’s up? Are you going to be a dick today? What do you have for me?



Absolutely nothing, which suits you, because you have absolutely nothing in your brain, and I hate you. I’m stealing your llamas; you don’t deserve them. You’re a putz and a cheat.



Stop fighting me, you little assholes… and stop spitting on me! I hate you. If I could eat you two, I would. Leave me.



Anyway, what was I saying? That’s right, *dosa*. I really like ordering dosa. It’s a lot less common than curries, but it’s *so* good. It’s this crispy, golden brown… *tube*, I’d guess you say? It’s tube-shaped, like one of those cardboard poster tubes if instead of a poster, it was filled with seasoned potatoes and chutney.



\[You pause.\]



God, I’m fucking hungry. Who brought up food? Who did this to me? I did this to me, didn’t I? 



That’s right, my stomach did this to me, which means I’ve just played myself, touche. Alright, chat, if you’ve ever loved me, no more food talk. What have you guys been up to today?



\[You chuckle.\]



I’m not looking yet, but when I do, how many of you are just going to say some variation of “eating food?”



I knew it; you’re all a bag of dicks, each one of you a separate and special bag of penises.



*Especially* you, DevilishDarkMatter, especially you. I’d say I hate to see it, but I don’t, because that’s what y’all get when you play games. Mess with the hangry bull, get asshole horns. 



\[You laugh.\]



No, you’re a loser, Dear, especially since you’re supposed to be driving! Get out of here!



You better be pumping gas, so help me god. I don’t have another mod, Dear. Do you know how hard it was to find you and give you all those permissions? That’s a genuine question. Do you? That was so long ago, I don’t remember. 



\[You laugh.\]



And this is why I can’t even complain when they’re mean to me, chat. Not only do they have the mod powers to ruin me but probably also all my secrets. You’re looking at my very first subscriber, you know. I… hate you. Dear, this chest was full of colored wools when I last checked! I know it was!



Stole them for *what??*



*Things??*



\[You laugh.\]



You know what, you’ve been my mod for a long time, and I’m saying it’s too much time now. You’re fired, let go, laid off, kicked to the curb. Sharing a minecraft world with you was the worst decision I’ve ever made. 



I love you too; you’re the bane of my existence. Chat, the funny part is that I don’t even think they stole it to use it. I’m pretty sure they just moved them somewhere so I could lose my mind on stream and wonder if I’ve lost my mind. The funniest part of that is that’s exactly what I did. Should we rifle through their house and try to find it?



“Bold of you to assume I’m dumb enough to hide it in my house.” Okay, chat, have any of you ever wanted to moderate? Hmm? Get that cool little green sword next to your name? Your first job would be banning this motherfucker for life, and then your second job will be joining me in this minecraft server and helping me find this goddamn wool!



StyxCorrino, I’m insulted that you have to *ask*. I’m a great streamer to mod for!



No one asked you, Dear! Go away!



I never said you *had* to moderate my 3 AM Whiteclaw gaming sessions; I just said your presence would be very much *appreciated* which it was. And didn’t we have fun? I am so good at drunk Quiplash, chat, and I have the shirt to prove it. 



What? Oh, yeah, I have more than a normal amount of Jackbox shirts and tank tops. What can I say- my chat is super fucking funny. I’ll have to show you all of them or post pictures. I’d do it now, but I know at least one is spinning around the washer right now. That reminds me, What do y’aall say to some Trivia Murder Party later? I feel a redemption arc coming. 



\[You laugh.\]



MoonyAudios, why am I not surprised you’re down for TMP? Have you been lurking, or did your ears start itching as soon as I said it?



“Wouldn’t you like to know, weather boy?” You know, for that, I’m absolutely kicking your ass. I was already going to for your little curse stunt yesterday, but now it’ll be humiliating for you.



“Your mom is humiliating for you.” Dear, if you’re still around, can you kick Moony?  



Abandoned in my time of need. If I want something done, I’ve got to do it myself.



Off to the shadow realm with you; see you on the other side. 



Should we start the game while they’re out? Should we be mean? I could probably get Jackbox booted up and started in three minutes, before they get back. What do you guys think? 



That’s true, wouldn’t want them to think I’m afraid of them and looking to give myself an advantage. We’ll play that later tonight, give all of you guys a real fighting chance before I make you all eat my dust.

Oh, I’m… sorry? Are we sad or not sad that the fire alarm went off?



Then fuck yeah, half day! Any plans for your surprise freedom, or are you going to kick it here with us?



Ooh, let me see, let me see the discord. 



Love a good coffee shop picture and love my chat having a relaxing evening chilling out and having a good time. Have a nice pastry or something for me; those local shops always have the best cookies.



Shit, I’m hungry again. Speaking of food though, there’s this idea I’ve been playing with that I’d like to see what you all think. How would you guys feel about me trying out some cooking streams? There’s this webcam I’ve had my eye on for a while that’s on sale for half its usual price. It’s still pricey to be sure, but what a steal, you know? And then I could… I could…



Sorry, chat, thought I heard the Enderman, had to tune myself out for a second. What was I saying?



Right, webcam! I feel like I’m always talking about food and sharing pictures of my dinner in the discord, so I thought why not share the whole process as well? It could feel like you’re all at my kitchen counter, and we’re making dinner together or something? Is that cheesy?



\[You laugh.\]



That’s fair, Moony, I am cheesy so that’s just par for the course. Welcome back by the way. How was superhell?



“Great, your mom was there, and we made out.” I regret ever meeting you, you know that? Another “your mom” joke? Really? Anyway, cooking streams, Moony, what do you think? 



I will not get distracted and hurt myself! I’m a great cook, how dare you! 



I’ll believe your face when I see it. You know what other game we should play? I don’t know what pack it’s in, but I went to a friend’s house, and we played this Jackbox trivia game with less murder and more calendars if that makes sense? The narrator gives you a historical event, and you have to guess the year it happened? It was pretty fun; we should try it. 



Oh shit, that’s right, HermitStories, you do have a fucking history degree. Dear, are you home yet? Can you ban Hermit? Pleeeease?

\[We hear the *sssshf* of a cardboard box opening, and you make a sound of happiness.\]

Every day traffic doesn’t get in the way, at least. I don’t mind you wanting to have a more backseat role in all this streaming stuff. I just want you to be happy and comfortable. I just want to be with you. If you’re having fun, I’m having fun.  Are you having fun? 



Then I’m having a fucking blast. Especially when we flirt in chat. That line you did earlier, offering me your hand in marriage, it got me good. You know how to press all my buttons. 



\[You passionately kiss the listener.\]



(*Quiet, between kisses*) I love you. I love you. I love you. 



\[You laugh.\] 



You can’t push me for smelling like pizza when you’re the one who bought it for me! 



Well, you can, but it’s not fair. 



\[You kiss the listener, pausing to eat more pizza.\]



(*Muffled*) Alright, I should probably get back to it before they burn down Twitch. 



(*Unmuffled*) Thank you so much for this. This is exactly what I needed after the traffic and the being late and the day I had at work. I fucking love you. 



Oh, don’t get me started. Nothing *that* bad, of course, I still have a job I love… I just didn’t happen to like it very much today. Lots of small, annoying things adding up. 



Nahh, not enough time. I want to keep the stream momentum from getting off track. After though? Maybe some minecraft with just you and me or rotting on the couch to some reality tv? 



You bought ice cream too? I am…



\[You passionately kiss the listener.\]



(*Laughing, between kisses*) If you didn’t want me to kiss you with pizza breath, you should stop being so fucking perfect. I can’t not fucking kiss you! 



Meet me in there when you’re ready? Chat’s not the same without my favorite moderator. 



Favorite, only, tomato, tuh-mah-toe. Love you! 



\[We hear quiet footsteps as the listener slowly moves towards the door.\]



(*Energetic*) Why am I not fucking surprised the pigeon game won? Why are you people like this?? 



\[The door closes quietly, and the talking muffles to silence.\]

Also for all of the eristics, this was 10 lbs of ""seasoning beans"" which is a mix of bad roasts, stale beans, and defects, sold specificaly for seasoning, no one here's wasting good beans for this. Seasoning absolutely made a difference in visible fines, or lack thereof, and grind consistency. Especially from 5 Ibs to 10 Ibs there's a huge visual reduction in fines. As far as taste, I'm detecting an increase in sharpness of acidity and clarity, from what I can remember, however since I did the seasoning over 2 days, I cannot directly compare the cups pre vs post seasoning. But brewing the same way with the same parameters and grind setting of 9, the brew finished about 45 sec faster post seasoning.",9,1753724062.0,pourover,0,0.8,False

1mbmorr,https://i.redd.it/qunq9rhqhnff1.jpeg,Create Sharable Checklists with Just Your Voice & AI,"Hi everyone,

I’m excited to share my latest project, [Checklist Genie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/checklist-genie/id6744873389), which recently reached **#1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt**.

This isn’t just another to‑do app. [Checklist Genie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/checklist-genie/id6744873389) is a lightweight, fast, and intuitive **voice + AI‑powered checklist app** that makes staying organized effortless. You can create lists by **speaking**, **typing**, or even **snapping a photo**, and it instantly builds a complete, shareable checklist for you.

Examples:

* *“Packing list for a weekend camping trip”* → tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, snacks
* *“Grocery list for the week”* → milk, bread, fruit, veggies, coffee
* *“Work to‑do list for Monday”* → email updates, prep slides, schedule team call
* *Photo of a recipe* → instant ingredient checklist
* *“Reminders for tomorrow morning”* → take vitamins, walk the dog, pay the bill

Share your lists with family, friends, or teammates in seconds — and stay in sync across devices. It also comes with a **free Apple Watch app** and **home screen widget**, so your checklists are always right where you need them.

Highlights:

* **Free 14‑day trial** — no credit card or sign‑up required
* **Always a free version available**
* **Lightweight, fast, and privacy‑first** — your data is never sold

 The **Free** tier supports up to 15 lists with 30 items each—enough for casual users to test drive voice capture, basic sharing, and offline mode. Upgrading to the **Individual** plan at **$1.99 per month** (or \*\*$2.99 for Family, up to six users) removes most ceilings: 100 lists, 100 items each, cross-device backup, full send-and-receive collaboration, CSV exports, and the magic sauce—AI features like voice-to-list, image-to-list, and context-aware suggestions.

App Store visibility is tough these days, so your feedback means a lot. If you find it useful, a quick review would be hugely appreciated.

The app is ad-free and privacy-first; subscriptions bankroll servers and development, with all data stored and synced under strict no-tracking policies.

1mbmmuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mbmmuh/aio_thinking_my_husband_is_hiding_me_and_doesnt/,AIO thinking my husband is hiding me and doesn't want to be seen with me in public,"We met online and spoke on here for years before meeting in person. I worried he'd reject me because of my weight, and other issues, such as my anxiety which was quite severe, and led to me wearing a mask and hoodie.  However, he said that he didn't mind my weight, and that he was the last person to judge me over wearing a mask and hoodie, having worn sunglasses and a hoodie before due to his anxiety. It was obvious when we met in person that he wasn't interested in me, he also seemed embarrassed to be seen with me in public. 

He spoke of PDA and commitment rings online but wasn't interested in either, telling me he disliked PDA and a ring would look silly on him. He didn't refer to me as his gf at times, acting confused as to why it bothered me, telling me that it was too personal or necessary to share with people. I struggled to talk to people and looked to him but he refused to in most cases, blaming his own anxiety. I asked him one time to ask a female shop employee something and he said no. She started walking towards us and he walked away quickly, going behind a rack of purses. 

For a year he turned me down frequently, criticized and shamed me for trying, and made me feel unwanted outside of the times we had sex which always felt forced. He refused to engage in PDA, even when we were the only ones around, telling me once that we were passing the house his dad's friend lived in, and that he worried he'd be judged. He said he felt like too much of a loser to have a gf. I asked him if he'd go to a nearby area that was usually empty, and would he kiss me or hold my hand there, and he said no. He made a comment on time that he didn't want his parents to hear us kissing. 

He would try to push me to talk to people, to his mother and grandmother, and would get upset with me when I struggled or failed to do so, calling me inept when angry. He'd tell me what to say which didn't help. He told me that I needed to face it head on, that exposure therapy was the only way. We reside with his parents along with his brother. His brother's ex gf, who was 16 at the time, started coming around and staying the night. I never interacted with her by choice. We were downstairs making dinner one night, and he told me that she could come down at any moment, and that she'd try to talk to me.

He said she was chatty, and curious, and would ask me questions about America where I'm from. I said I was doubtful that she would do that, or that she'd come down, but he insisted she would. He became aggressive demanding that I left until I did. I continued to struggle with my anxiety, and would look to him to help in certain situations. He criticized this, and me, saying that it made us both look stupid, and that it made his anxiety worse. He started refusing to go into stores with me. And so I pushed myself to talk to a store employee, and I messed up a little bit, but I was proud of myself. As we were leaving I said that I was, and he said he was proud of me, too. 

Then he said, right after that, that she had frowned at me. She had a mask on as this was during the height of COVID. I asked why he said that and he said he didn't know. I continued to interact with people, but struggled at times, making mistakes because of it. I was at a TJ Maxx and hid an item for someone in a group chat I was in, and had interacted with a few times in there, and she came to the store to get it. She walked up to me, and thanked me, and I said you're welcome and walked off. He told me afterwards that she seemed to want to talk to me more, and gave me a strange look because I cut the conversation short. 

There was another instance where a female cashier was being rude to me. I was uncomfortable because of it, and wasn't as talkative. I thought that the transaction was finished, and was getting ready to leave, when he told me that it wasn't and that she was still talking to me. He said that it was awkward repeatedly. There were times that he'd seem to watch my every movement. When I looked back at him whilst grocery shopping, and smiled, and he looked over at the female employee in the isle beside us and asked why I did that. When I stuttered and he looked around after I had. When I tried over my feet and he looked around. 

He would go silent on me around people, around women in particular, and said that it was because he disliked talking in front of people. He would even get anxious standing in an empty aisle with me trying to decide on dinner. But then, whenever he'd run into someone he knew even barely, he'd stand and talk to them normally, regardless of how many people were around. He said he felt pressured to act normal because of his anxiety. He would look at people, at women, any time I spoke or laughed, or before he responded to me, as if he was worried they were listening in and judging. At the same time, he'd be more focused on them than he was me. 

I lost weight and changed a lot, and he started treating me differently, showing more interest in me sexually when he was on meds that he claimed prior to this killed his libido. He engaged in PDA and did other things he wouldn't do before like going out to eat, but he continued to do some of the things mentioned above, which made me think he was still  embarrassed of me. When I did any of what he was doing, walking ahead of him next to some guy, or going silent around a guy,, he would ask me if I was trying to appear single. When I looked over at a woman before responding to him, or rushed into an aisle to avoid an employee, he asked if I was embarrassed of him. 

From the start of me being in the UK with him, he avoided his friends, friends who he seemed close to before I came. We'd go on walks and he'd pass houses they supposedly lived in, and he'd tell me to be quiet as we did. We ran into two of his friends occasionally, one in particular who worked at a coffee shop in the nearby shopping centre. Every time we'd go in, he'd try to avoid being seen by him. When he was seen, and his friend called him over, he'd stand and talk to him. He criticized me for just standing there, though I did speak some, and the guy acknowledged I was shy which didn't seem to bother him. His friend invited us to go somewhere with him and his gf, and my husband didn't want to.

I figured he was avoiding him because of me. Then I started putting weight back on, and he stopped showing as much interest in me, blaming it on the meds. When I reached the weight I was when we met in person, however, he started putting me down over it during arguements. He said I let myself go. He insulted me more the more weight I gained, calling me fat and ugly, and saying guys prefer thinner women. He said he didn't mean any of this, and that he said it to hurt me. He acted the same way in public as he did at the start, blanking me more, and walking ahead of me. The last time we were at the coffee shop his friend worked at, we sat down to have a drink, and his friend was too busy to talk. 

He seemed edge, couldn't stop shaking and looking around, and told me he needed the bathroom. When we left, he no longer needed the bathroom. He started to avoid his friend, and the shopping centre more, and blamed his avoidance on his weight, which he started gaining shortly after we met in person. His weight hadn't changed much in the timeframe of him interacting with his friend, to not interacting with him, it was my weight that had. It was around two years ago that he started acting on edge when in public with me, standing apart from me, talking to me less, and looking over his shoulder when next to me. 

He told me that his behavior was due to anxiety, but also said it was in my head. When I made an excited noise having found a dessert item I was looking for, I looked up to find him giving me a judgemental look. He said that he felt uncomfortable because it drew attention to us both, two overweight people next to desserts. When I got upset, taking it personally, it led to an argument in which he pointed out the attractive thin couple across from us, who never looked our way. It was after he supposedly nearly ran into an old female classmate of his, whilst he was in the grocery store alone, that he refused to go in the next blaming it on being bloated. 

He promsied me once he was no longer bloated, he'd resume going in, but then he didn't even after he told me he wasn't bloated days later without me asking. He shifted through various reasons, things he never told me before, for why he couldn't go into any store. He told me we were going in too late, and too often, and so we went in less but that didn't help. I tried to go in with him during the day and he said it was too busy. However, when I asked him to go in alone, there was no hesitation. He went into stores, stores he wouldn't go in with me when they seemed empty, at the busiest times of the day, multiple days in a row. 

He said that he felt anxious but less anxious because he was quicker alone. The times we were in the store together, he'd seem on edge as before. He went silent on me when one person was feet away on their phone. He criticized me for talking too quietly and for talking too loudly. He criticized things I said, worried about what others would think, even when I said nothing wrong. He blanked me, and walked off from me, in front of female employees. When he thought was one coming in our direction, he quickly walked away from me. He appeared to hide his face, turning it to the side and covering it with his hand, when a female employee walked past us. 

I started wearing the mask again and he criticized it periodically, concerned with how it looked to others, and telling me that it looked stupid. When I wore the mask, and hoodie as before, he sighed in when walking past a teenage girl. He said it had nothing to do with me but also said that I looked Muslim. I said they didn't know why I wore the mask, that I could wear it for a number of reasons, but he wasn't accepting of this. He'd ask me to take it off at times, telling me it would ease his anxiety. When we went to the mechanic, he had me stand at the end of the driveway near the exit gate, though the mechanic had seen me in my mask before. 

He thought the mask looked silly at the mechanics of all places, and was more concerned with what he'd think, opposed to what I felt. He tried to downplay it saying repeatedly that him wanting me to take my mask off proved he wasn't embarrassed of me. He criticized my outfit once, when I had an oversized hoodie on, previously telling me it didn't suit bigger people. He didn't want to go into the store with me, telling me I didn't look properly dressed, before telling me he was wrong once I stepped out of the car and the hoodie didn't look as big as he thought it was. 

I tried to go into the place he volunteers, after he repeatedly told me that people invited me in to wait, or for a cup of tea. He said he didn't think I'd come in because of my anxiety, but he was just letting me know. I went in to use the bathroom and he rushed me in and out. I asked to come in to wait. He told me that the room was locked, but that it was also in use, and then said that I'd need to give him prior notice. I asked another time and he told me several people were there that day, and that it would overwhelm me. I said I'd try and he told me that if I managed to do it, he would question the validity of my anxiety. Later on he told me that I would've sat there quiet, and it would've been awkward. 

He started to avoid the town altogether at times, driving elsewhere when he would have been against it before. He needed a rundown of where it was I wanted to go to. He'd either back out of going, or would go as late as possible. I tried to go into the boots on the main street one day when we were out earlier than usual, and it was busy, and he told me it was too busy. When I said that I'd try, he questioned my anxiety again. We were in America a while back and he acted the same way there, going silent around women, or avoiding going to areas with me altogether. He glanced, and appeared to check out, women that walked by. 

He stopped going into stores with me a month in, sitting in the car instead, unless he needed something. The previous time we were in America, when I weighed a bit less, he avoided going into stores but not as much. He told me he'd be okay going into stores once back from America, but he wasn't, and he acted the same way when with me. I stopped wanting to go in with him, or in general, and tried to get him to do click and collect which he also avoided. He said it was awkward interacting with the person. He refused tescos click and collect in particular telling me it was at the front of the store, and someone such as family member could see him. I stopped going in altogether a month and a half ago. 

He's been going in alone since then, trying to convince me to come in at times, and telling me I lessen his anxiety which I don't believe. I thought that my not going in would help. It seems now that he is anxious being seen in the car with me, interacting with me. On several occasions we were going somewhere and he suggested somewhere else, somewhere like a park that would be less busy. He pushed for it, and went once, when I didn't want to. He took different routes in and out of the town, and parked in places where no one else was, seemingly hesitant to go to the places we went before, and didn't want to sit long each time. I asked him after going to McDonald's to park somewhere. 

Instead of parking where I asked, and where he said he would, he drove to the tesco parking lot and parked off to the side. We used to sit for a long time whilst I figured out dinner, or he scrolled on his phone, but now he wants to get out minutes after arriving and gets frustrated whenever he can't do that, whenever I try to talk to him, complaining he doesn't want to sit for too long. He denies now that he ever did that. He blames other factors like it being hot outside or something else, but he is constantly looking around himself at any car or person that passes by. He seems reluctant to talk to me, to look at me when he is talking to me, complaining when asked, telling me one time his neck hurt. 

I rubbed his face and he looked over at a person next to us, and said he didn't want me doing that. I don't know if he's embarrassed of me, of my weight, or if he's hiding me either because he's involved with someone else or wants to be. I tend to think it's both because he's been doing these things since the start, including when I was thin. The thing that really upsets me is that I think he's embarrassed of me, or hiding me, and he gets angry over this denying it and telling me that I make everything about myself. How could I not when he's made everything about me? ",3,1753723890.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I feel like everywhere they go it just consist of days getting breakfast, walking around, getting dressed up, trying a coffee shop, shopping, and getting ready for dinner... at least they went on a boat ride there and in Europe they did do activities but again they all really align with just walking around, shopping, getting dinner, and trying coffee? I just wonder why they don't go do something with more adventure and get a lay of the land. Like visiting a national park or a road trip (I don't think it's glamorous enough for them), hey, maybe even a cruise, or when they go to Europe, why not visit the French countryside or the French Alps, or just get to know more of the culture? I've never seen them go on a ski trip, and I bet they would if it didn't consist of actually skiing or snowboarding down a mountain. it makes more sense for her parents to be taking these trips, i bet they've experienced more travel than they have, but Claire, Emily, and Elizabeth are all in their 20s and sort of act like they're mother's age?....

I also have a massive garden and realized that as I harvest berries I've always had a tendency to pop some in my mouth - cherry tomatoes, raspberries and blackberries, freshly picked while still warm from the sun are unparalleled in their delectableness. Self-control is difficult!

I'm still relatively new with OMAD and figuring out how to maximize the benefits. Avoiding sugar during the day helps with insulin spikes and diabetic tendencies. Avoiding protein assists with autophagy (that I've been able to determine). Besides morning coffee, does having a few berries negate the net positive effects of doing OMAD for the day, outside of a reduction in CICO?

Over the past year, I’ve tested multiple routines: from the 5 AM club to “roll out of bed and check Shopify” chaos, and I’ve finally landed on a rhythm that works. I wake up at 6:30, drink a full glass of water, and immediately do a 10-minute journaling session. I don’t use any fancy prompts; just what I’m feeling and what I need to focus on that day. After that, I take a quick walk while listening to a podcast (usually about entrepreneurship or supply chains, I’m kind of a nerd about those). Then, it’s coffee and emails. I always check Alibaba and my supplier's chat threads first. I’ve got a few orders in progress, and I’ve learned that waiting too long to respond can delay production by a full day, especially with time zone differences. By 8:30, I’m working on fulfillment and updating my CRM. I save content creation and marketing for the afternoon since that’s when I’m more creative.

Greetings, traveler.

If you’re just here to cast a net with no name,
no story, no spark,
then leave this thread untouched.
I answer only to those who arrive with intention,
a name, your age, a glimpse of who you are behind the screen.

As for me,
I am 22, though the last candle on the cake
Came about but the day before with quiet steps.
For over two years, I’ve lived in the gentle hush of a bookstore,
among pages and dust and the soft rhythm of passing hours.
Soon, I return to the world of study,
drawn toward the calling of the library,
a home for stories, for silence,
for seekers like me.

Yes, I’m a lesbian. And yes, I love to flirt,
but not here, not now.
Here I want warmth, not fire.
A friend. Maybe even the friend,
the one who remembers your coffee order, well tea for me,
and texts you poems at 2 a.m.
Just because.

I adore music that tells the truth,
books that leave ink on my soul,
especially the ones drenched in fantasy,
in sapphic love, in aching beauty and magic.
Romantasy? Yes. Excessively. Happily.
Tabletop games? I’ve only tasted the Masquerade and recently started on a grand tale in Lorakis where the moons are split,
but oh, I’m hungry for more.
Teach me your favorites. Let’s build a world.

I have no space for cruelty, for casual hate,
for judgment wrapped in humor.
If you carry those things,
I hope you lay them down before you reach my door.

Women are most welcome.
So are those who see women not as puzzles to solve
or prizes to chase,
but as galaxies to respect and befriend.

I am soft but not fragile.
Lonely, perhaps, but not desperate.
What I seek is simple and sacred:
a connection that hums beneath the noise.
A companion for the strange hours.
Someone to send voice notes and memes and
""look at this beautiful thing I found today.""

If these words ring true to something quiet in you,
then come.
Introduce yourself.
Let’s see what we can build from here.",0,1753723112.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False
1mbma2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mbma2d/explore_best_builtin_dishwasher_bosch_she53b75uc/,Explore Best Built-In Dishwasher Bosch SHE53B75UC Worth It?,"The Bosch SHE53B75UC dishwasher has been part of my kitchen routine for a while now. As someone who spends quite a bit of time cooking and entertaining, dishwashing becomes a chore I can’t avoid. Having used other models in the past, I was curious to see if this particular built-in smart dishwasher lived up to its reputation in the appliance world. From its sleek stainless steel finish to its promised technology like the PrecisionWash system and third rack feature, I gave this machine a thorough workout over several weeks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the stainless steel exterior. The modern finish not only looks premium but resists fingerprints remarkably well. In a household with little kids constantly touching everything, I found this to be a surprisingly useful aspect. The overall design is simple yet elegant. Its 24-inch size fits seamlessly under the counter, and the clean design aligns with most kitchen styles. Opening the dishwasher, the racks felt sturdy and thoughtfully designed, especially the Standard 3rd Rack, which is a game-changer for utensils, small cups, and other tiny items that usually clutter the lower rack.

**Performance Features**  
I test dishes that go in dirty – lasagna pans, meal-prep containers, and coffee-stained mugs – because that's real life. The PrecisionWash technology lives up to its claims. No pre-rinsing was needed; sensors in the Bosch SHE53B75UC continuously monitored the cleaning cycle, adjusting accordingly. The results? Spotless cookware, even on items notoriously hard to clean. 

**Capacity and Rack Versatility**  
The three-rack setup quickly became a favorite feature. The Standard 3rd Rack gave extra room for flatware and smaller items that always seem to end up piled in my silverware caddy. With the adjustable upper rack, taller pots and cutting boards went in with no issues. This versatile storage made it so much easier to load the dishwasher efficiently, reducing the number of wash cycles each week.

[Check Bosch SHE53B75UC price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0bt5sjb1f/)

**Quiet Operation**  
A standout aspect of this dishwasher is its whisper-quiet performance. At 44 decibels, I often forgot it was even running. Being open-concept in my home, where the kitchen blends into the living room, this was a huge perk. Unlike some earlier dishwashers I’ve tried, I didn’t need to pause conversations or crank up the TV volume while it was running.

**Advantages**  
- Impressive cleaning results with PrecisionWash.  
- Quiet operation doesn’t disrupt the household.  
- 3rd rack adds significant convenience for smaller items.  

**Limitations**  
- Cycles are on the longer side, especially the heavy-duty ones.  
- No heated drying cycle, so plastics come out a bit damp.

**Ease of Use and Smart Features**  
Downloading the Home Connect app brought a level of flexibility I didn’t expect to rely on as much as I do now. I can monitor cycles, start the machine remotely before I get home, or adjust settings with ease. The app integration is straightforward and, for anyone who loves automating their home, this feature adds tangible value. However, I did notice that it occasionally takes a moment for the app to sync.

**Energy Efficiency and Eco-Friendliness**  
The Energy Star certification ensures efficient performance, which was a big deal for me since I want to lower both my utility bills and my environmental footprint. The absence of a heated drying option also contributes to energy savings, though it’s a double-edged sword when dealing with plastics that still require manual drying.

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to others like the KitchenAid KDPM604KPS or the LG LDF5545SS, this dishwasher excels in quietness and packing flexibility. KitchenAid’s dishwashers often provide powerful washing capabilities but are louder in open-concept spaces. LG’s models are energy-efficient but lack the same kind of rack customization options that Bosch aces with its third rack. While these alternatives may come at a slightly lower cost, I found the Bosch SHE53B75UC to balance price, performance, and premium features effectively.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its features like the 3rd Rack, PrecisionWash, and app integration, the Bosch SHE53B75UC stands as a solid value-for-money appliance. While it’s not the least expensive option out there, the superior cleaning power and efficiency make it worth the investment for those seeking reliable long-term use. If you cook a lot or entertain frequently, budgeting for this model is well-justified.

1mbm9kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mbm9kr/explore_if_the_cuisinart_dcc5570nas_5cup/,Explore if the Cuisinart DCC-5570NAS 5-Cup Coffeemaker is worth it in this review!,"The Cuisinart DCC-5570NAS 5-Cup Coffeemaker has been a regular feature in my kitchen for several weeks now. As someone who loves coffee but doesn’t need a massive brewing system, this compact stainless steel machine intrigued me immediately. With a sleek, modern design and full-sized features tailored to smaller spaces, it struck the balance between functionality and style. Yet, while it boasts a lot of upsides, it’s not without its quirks.

**Compact Design and Space Saver**  
Living in a relatively cozy apartment, counter space is always at a premium. This coffeemaker’s compact dimensions of 5.67""D x 10.14""W x 10.85""H solve that problem elegantly. It tucks into a corner without dominating my kitchen layout. The stainless steel finish gives it a clean, professional look, contrasting nicely with my darker countertops. A nice touch I’ve noticed is the ergonomic stainless steel carafe, which includes a dripless pour spout and knuckle guard. Pouring coffee feels satisfying and spill-free—which I didn't think I’d care about until I noticed how convenient it made my mornings!

[Check Cuisinart DCC-5570NAS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b3g5z7dr/)

**User-Friendly Operation**  
This coffee machine is incredibly easy to use, even for a half-awake zombie at 6 AM (yes, that’s me most mornings). The simple on/off switch means there’s no fumbling with complicated settings. That said, it’s not ""too"" basic. The Brew Pause feature, for example, is a gem. I often grab a quick cup before the brewing cycle is over, and there’s no mess or dripping involved. It’s intuitive and caters to the impatient coffee drinker.

**Brewing Performance**  
In terms of brewing—let’s talk results. The 5-cup capacity may sound modest, but it’s perfect for one or two people. Loading up the removable reservoir is a smooth process, and the machine whirs quietly into action without overwhelming kitchen noise. The coffee comes out hot and fresh in just a matter of minutes, and I’ve found the flavor to be consistent with every brew. It works with permanent-style nylon filters, which is great for minimizing paper waste. Also included is a charcoal filter, which probably explains the clean, smooth-tasting coffee.

**Energy Efficiency and Keep Warm Functionality**  
One surprise standout feature is the 30-minute Keep Warm plate. Forget about coffee going cold while you’re caught up scrolling through emails or on a morning call. That short-but-practical warming cycle keeps the coffee at just the right temperature for second or even third pours. Though it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes (a nice energy-saving feature), I wish this timeframe were adjustable because I occasionally drag out my mornings longer than the machine anticipates.

**Key Benefits:**
- Compact design occupies minimal counter space
- Stainless steel carafe with a dripless pour spout  
- Easy-to-use controls with a Brew Pause facility  
- Coffee stays warm for up to 30 minutes with energy-efficient auto shut-off  
- Permanent-style filter reduces waste

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Limited to a 5-cup capacity, which might be too small for larger households  
- Keep Warm feature duration is fixed at 30 minutes, which some may find restrictive  
- Nylon filter may require frequent cleaning if not used with additional care  
- Machine body feels lightweight, which may detract from durability impressions

**Competing Brands**  
The coffeemaker market is saturated, so I naturally compared this model to a few others. For instance, the Keurig K-Mini has similar space-saving benefits but loses points for relying exclusively on pods, which is less eco-friendly. Meanwhile, the Zojirushi Zutto 5-Cup stands out for its advanced heating system, although its design feels less appealing—leaning heavily toward function over appearance. Cuisinart’s option lands comfortably in the middle, balancing aesthetics, ease of use, and sustainability.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This product sits in a price range that feels fair considering its features and build quality. While it’s certainly not priced at the top of the market, its performance, especially with features like Brew Pause and an ergonomic design, feels like excellent value. Compared to competitors offering advanced brewing settings or larger capacities, it hits the sweet spot if you prioritize compact solutions. Whether you're a coffee-newbie or a daily caffeine lover who thrives on simplicity, this unit delivers more than its modest footprint might suggest.

1mbm96f,https://i.redd.it/xek6p6nuenff1.png,Beginner gardening tips from someone who had no idea what they were doing last year 😊,"Alright, so last year was the first time I actually *tried* to garden instead of just buying plants and watching them slowly die on the patio. Thought I’d throw together a few tips I wish I knew starting out, in case it helps someone else.

# 1. Start small and grow stuff that makes sense where you live

I got way too ambitious in the beginning. Tried to grow tomatoes, peppers, herbs, salad greens, and sunflowers all at once. Spoiler: half of it died. Once I actually looked up what grows well in my area and when to plant it, things got way easier.

Also if you're in a colder climate like me (UK), don’t expect tropical plants to be chill with your spring weather.

# 2. Soil actually matters

I thought soil was just... dirt. Nope. Some of my plants were basically trying to grow in bricks because the soil in my garden is heavy clay. Get a cheap soil test kit or at least dig a little and see what you’re working with. Raised beds or containers with good compost are a great workaround if your ground soil sucks.

# 3. Water properly (and not constantly)

I used to water everything a little every day like it was a houseplant. Bad idea. Now I water every few days but make sure it actually soaks through. The plants seem way happier and I don’t get weird moldy soil anymore.

Also, watering in the morning = less slugs and less rot.

# 4. Sunlight isn’t just “it looks kinda bright”

I had stuff labeled “full sun” sitting in a spot that got like 2 hours of sun total. Didn’t realize how important it is to track where the light hits during the day. Full sun means *actual sun* for 6+ hours. I moved my stuff and it made a huge difference.

5. Don't sleep on plant apps

Been using [Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=R_g) to ID random weeds, wildflowers, do health checks on my vegetables which has helped me deal with nutritional deficiencies (Noticed my tomatoes were getting spotty so needed calcium etc). Few others out there like Plantnet and PictureThis but haven't tried them yet.

# 6. Raised beds, pots, buckets... all good

You don’t need a huge yard. I grew salad, beans, and chillies in old storage tubs and they did fine. Just poke holes in the bottom. Way easier than trying to dig up a patch of lawn or fight with your soil.

# 7. Stuff will die

Even when you do everything “right.” That’s part of it. Don’t take it personally. Just try again. Most things are cheaper than a takeaway coffee and way more fun in the long run.

# 8. Grow what you actually want

If you’re into fresh herbs, grow herbs. If you don’t like lettuce, don’t grow it just because it’s “easy.” You’re way more likely to care for stuff you’ll actually use or enjoy looking at.

I’m not an expert at all, but this is the stuff that helped me go from killing everything to actually harvesting a few things. If you’re just starting out, don’t stress it too much. Most plants really just want a bit of light, water, and not to be drowned.

# Key Features To Consider

Choosing the right coffee maker can be a daunting task. With numerous features and options available, finding the perfect match requires careful consideration. Understanding key features like brew size, programmable settings, built-in grinder, temperature control, and ease of cleaning can make a huge difference in your coffee experience. These elements ensure you get the most out of your coffee maker, making every cup delicious and satisfying.

# Brew Size

Brew size options are crucial for coffee lovers. Different models offer varying capacities, allowing you to brew just the right amount. Consider these factors when choosing:

* Single-cup brewing: Ideal for those who prefer a fresh cup every time.
* Multi-cup brewing: Suitable for households or offices with multiple coffee drinkers.

Some coffee makers come with a carafe option, enabling you to brew larger quantities. A small coffee maker may fit well in compact spaces, while larger models are perfect for bigger families or gatherings. Selecting the right brew size ensures you always have enough coffee for your needs.

# Programmable Settings

Programmable settings bring convenience to your coffee routine. This feature allows you to set your coffee maker to start brewing at a specific time. Imagine waking up to a freshly brewed pot, ready for you. Here’s why programmable settings are beneficial:

* Customizable brew strength: Adjust to match your taste preference.
* Automatic shut-off: Saves energy and prevents accidents.

Some models offer pre-set functions like espresso or cappuccino settings. Exploring programmable options can make your mornings easier and more enjoyable.

# Built-in Grinder

* Freshness: Grind beans just before brewing for the best taste.
* Convenience: Eliminates the need for a separate grinder.
* Adjustable grind settings: Control the coarseness for different brew types.

Some models feature automatic grinding options, streamlining the process. Choosing a coffee maker with a built-in grinder enhances the coffee experience, ensuring every cup is aromatic and flavorful.

# Temperature Control

Temperature control is vital for optimal coffee brewing. Water temperature affects the extraction process and ultimately, the taste. Consider these aspects:

* Consistent temperature: Ensures even extraction of flavors.
* Adjustable settings: Customize to suit different coffee types.
* Maintaining warmth: Keeps coffee hot without burning it.

Some coffee makers have precision temperature control features, enhancing the brewing process. Understanding temperature settings can help you achieve the perfect brew every time.

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task, especially with so many options available. A good coffee maker is not just about brewing a great cup of coffee. It’s also about providing a positive user experience. This includes how easy it is to use, maintain, and how long it lasts. Understanding these aspects can help you make a more informed decision. Let’s delve into these factors to find the perfect coffee maker for your needs.

# Ease Of Use

Finding a coffee maker that’s easy to use is crucial. A simple interface can make your coffee-making process more enjoyable. Look for coffee makers with clear instructions and intuitive controls.

* Button layout should be logical and easy to understand.
* Settings should be easy to adjust without needing a manual.

# Maintenance Requirements

Coffee makers require regular maintenance to function well. Understanding maintenance needs is key to a long-lasting machine. Choose a model that is easy to clean and descale.

|Feature|Maintenance Tip|
|:-|:-|
|Removable parts|Look for parts that are dishwasher-safe.|

# Taste Preferences

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task with so many options available. Understanding your **taste preferences**is crucial to finding a machine that suits your needs. Whether you love a strong brew or a milder cup, the right coffee maker can make all the difference. This guide will help you explore the key factors in selecting a coffee maker that aligns with your taste buds.

# Coffee Strength

Different coffee makers produce different strength levels in coffee. The strength of your coffee is determined by the **brewing process**and the type of machine used. For those who prefer a **bold and intense flavor**, a French press or espresso machine might be ideal. These machines allow for longer brewing times and a higher coffee-to-water ratio.

* **French Press:**Offers a strong, rich flavor by steeping coffee grounds.
* **Espresso Machine:**Brews concentrated coffee with a robust taste.

For a lighter brew, consider a drip coffee maker. It uses a slower brewing process, which results in a milder taste. The choice of coffee maker greatly influences the **strength and taste**of your coffee, so select one that matches your preference.

# Flavor Profiles

Coffee makers can affect the flavor profile of your brew. Each type can enhance or diminish certain flavor notes. A drip coffee maker might highlight the **nutty and chocolatey**flavors, making it a good choice for those who enjoy such notes.

Espresso machines, on the other hand, are perfect for those who love a **rich and full-bodied**experience. They can bring out the complex flavors of the coffee beans.

|Machine Type|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|Nutty, Chocolatey|
|Espresso Machine|Rich, Full-bodied|

Understanding these flavor profiles can help you choose a coffee maker that enhances the specific flavors you enjoy.

# Freshness Factors

Freshness plays a crucial role in the taste of your coffee. A good coffee maker should preserve the **freshness of the beans**to enhance the flavor. Some machines come with built-in grinders, which grind the beans just before brewing. This ensures maximum freshness.

Consider a coffee maker with an airtight container for storing coffee grounds. This helps in keeping the coffee fresh for longer periods.

* **Built-in Grinders:**Provides freshly ground coffee for each brew.
* **Airtight Containers:**Maintains the freshness of the coffee grounds.

Paying attention to these **freshness factors**can significantly improve your coffee’s taste and aroma, resulting in a more enjoyable cup every time.

# Where To Buy

Choosing the best coffee maker can be a daunting task. With so many options available, it’s crucial to know where to buy. The right place can make a big difference in your purchase. The key is understanding the pros and cons of each buying option. In this guide, we’ll explore online retailers, local stores, and second-hand options. Each of these has its unique benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these can help you make an informed decision.

# Online Retailers

* Convenience: Shop from the comfort of your home.
* Variety: Access to numerous brands and models.
* Reviews: Read customer feedback to make better decisions.

* Cost Savings: Often, second-hand items are much cheaper.
* Sustainability: Buying used is eco-friendly.

You know that feeling when you're sitting in a three-hour lecture, trying to scribble down every word your professor says? Or when you just finished recording an hour-long interview for your thesis project and realize you need to type out every single word? Your heart sinks a little because you know what comes next: hours of rewinding, pausing, typing, and repeat.

If you're creating content for YouTube or TikTok, you've probably spent entire evenings adding captions to your videos manually. Each pause, each rewind, each correction feels like time stolen from actually creating more content. You start wondering if there's a better way to handle all this audio and video content that keeps piling up.

The manual transcription struggle is real. Sitting hunched over your laptop at 2 AM, playing the same five-second clip for the tenth time because you can't quite make out what was said. Your typing speed feels glacial compared to how fast people actually speak. What should take an hour of listening somehow stretches into four hours of work.

# The Rise of Automated Transcription

The good news is we're living in an age where technology can actually solve this problem. Speech-to-text technology has come incredibly far from those early voice recognition systems that could barely understand simple commands. Today's AI-powered transcription services can listen to your audio files and convert them into text with surprising accuracy.

These services work by analyzing audio patterns, identifying words, and even understanding context to improve accuracy. The best ones can handle different accents, background noise, and multiple speakers. What used to require hours of manual work can now be done in minutes.

This is where WhisperTranscribe enters the picture. It's one of the newer players in the transcription game, built on some seriously impressive AI technology. The big question is whether it actually lives up to its promises or if it's just another service that looks good on paper but falls short when you need it most.

The purpose of this review is simple: I want to give you a completely honest, hands-on assessment of WhisperTranscribe. We'll dig into how it works, test it with real audio files, and figure out if it's worth your time and money. By the end, you'll know exactly whether this tool can solve your transcription headaches.

# What Exactly is WhisperTranscribe?

At its core, WhisperTranscribe is an AI-powered transcription service that converts your audio and video files into text. Upload your file, wait a few minutes, and get back a written transcript. The service promises high accuracy, fast turnaround times, and support for dozens of different file formats.

What sets WhisperTranscribe apart from other transcription services is its foundation. The platform is built on OpenAI's Whisper model, which has earned recognition for being one of the most accurate speech recognition systems available today. Whisper was trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of audio data, teaching it to understand different languages, accents, and speaking styles.

The company behind WhisperTranscribe has focused on making this powerful technology accessible and user-friendly. Rather than requiring technical knowledge or complex setup processes, they've created a simple web interface where anyone can upload files and get results quickly.

The technology works by breaking down your audio into smaller chunks, analyzing each section for speech patterns, and then reconstructing the complete transcript. What makes it particularly impressive is its ability to handle challenging audio conditions. Background noise, multiple speakers, and varying audio quality don't completely derail the transcription process like they might with simpler systems.

# A Step-by-Step Guide to Using WhisperTranscribe

Getting started with WhisperTranscribe is refreshingly straightforward. The registration process takes less than two minutes. You provide an email address, create a password, and verify your account through a confirmation email. No lengthy forms or unnecessary personal information required.

Once you're logged in, the dashboard feels clean and uncluttered. The main interface centers around a large upload area where you can drag and drop your files or click to browse. On the left sidebar, you'll find your transcription history, account settings, and billing information. Everything is laid out logically, so you don't waste time hunting for basic functions.

The upload process supports an impressive range of file types. MP3, WAV, MP4, MOV, AVI, FLAC, and many others are all accepted. File size limits are generous enough that you won't run into problems with typical recordings. Whether you're uploading a quick voice memo or a full-length lecture recording, the system handles it smoothly.

After uploading, you can add some optional details like the audio language or speaker names if you know them in advance. These aren't required, but they can help improve accuracy. Once you hit the transcribe button, the processing begins.

The waiting period varies based on file length and current server load, but it's typically much faster than real-time transcription. A 30-minute audio file might take 5-8 minutes to process completely. You can leave the page and return later, or stay and watch the progress bar if you're feeling impatient.

When the transcription is complete, you're presented with a clean, formatted text document. The transcript includes timestamps, paragraph breaks, and speaker identification when multiple people are talking. The built-in editor lets you make corrections directly in the browser. You can fix any words the AI missed, adjust punctuation, or reorganize the text structure.

Export options are comprehensive. Plain text files work great for note-taking or article writing. SRT and VTT subtitle files are perfect if you're adding captions to videos. You can also export with or without timestamps, depending on your needs.

# Putting WhisperTranscribe to the Test

To really understand how well WhisperTranscribe performs, I put it through a series of real-world tests using different types of audio files. Each test was designed to challenge the system in ways you'd encounter in actual use.

# The Test Files

For this evaluation, I prepared four different audio samples:

A clean podcast recording with a single speaker and professional audio quality. This represents the ideal conditions where any good transcription service should excel.

A college lecture recording with some background noise, student chatter, and the professor occasionally moving away from the microphone. This simulates the challenging but common scenario of transcribing educational content.

A multi-person interview with three speakers, some overlapping dialogue, and varying distances from the recording device. This tests the speaker identification features and ability to handle complex conversations.

A video clip from a YouTube creator with background music, sound effects, and casual speaking style. This represents the content creation use case where accuracy matters for generating captions or show notes.

# Test 1: The Clean Audio

The podcast clip was a 15-minute segment featuring a single host discussing productivity tips. The audio quality was excellent, with no background noise or technical issues.

WhisperTranscribe handled this file beautifully. The accuracy was nearly perfect, capturing not just the words but also the natural flow and punctuation of spoken language. Here's a quick comparison:

Original spoken words: ""The key to staying productive isn't about cramming more tasks into your day. It's about identifying which tasks actually move you toward your goals and focusing your energy there.""

WhisperTranscribe result: ""The key to staying productive isn't about cramming more tasks into your day. It's about identifying which tasks actually move you toward your goals and focusing your energy there.""

Perfect match. The AI even correctly interpreted the contraction ""isn't"" and maintained proper sentence structure throughout the entire transcript.

# Test 2: The Challenging Audio

The lecture recording proved more challenging. Background noise from air conditioning, occasional student questions, and the professor's tendency to pace around the room created a realistic but difficult transcription scenario.

WhisperTranscribe still performed admirably, though not quite as flawlessly as with the clean audio. Most of the main content was captured accurately, but some quieter portions and student questions were missed or partially transcribed. The system did well at filtering out consistent background noise like the air conditioning hum.

When the professor spoke clearly and directly toward the microphone, accuracy remained high. The transcript captured technical terms and proper nouns correctly, which is often where automated systems struggle.

# Test 3: The Multi-Speaker Challenge

The interview clip featured three people discussing startup funding strategies. This test really pushed the speaker identification feature to its limits.

WhisperTranscribe correctly identified most speaker changes and formatted the conversation cleanly. The transcript showed ""Speaker 1,"" ""Speaker 2,"" and ""Speaker 3"" labels, making it easy to follow who said what. While not perfect, the accuracy was impressive considering the complexity of natural conversation with interruptions and overlapping speech.

Some quick back-and-forth exchanges got jumbled together, but the main points and longer statements were attributed correctly. For interview transcription, this level of accuracy would save significant editing time compared to starting from scratch.

# Speed Assessment

Processing speeds consistently impressed across all tests. The 15-minute podcast took about 4 minutes to transcribe. The 45-minute lecture was ready in approximately 12 minutes. Even the complex multi-speaker interview finished processing in less than half the original audio length.

This speed advantage becomes obvious when you compare it to manual transcription. What would take hours of careful listening and typing is completed in minutes, leaving you time for the more important work of actually using the content.

# Who is WhisperTranscribe For?

# The Student

If you're juggling classes, assignments, and maybe a part-time job, WhisperTranscribe can be a game-changer for your academic workflow. Recording lectures and converting them to text creates searchable notes you can review quickly before exams. Instead of scrolling through hours of audio to find that one concept your professor mentioned, you can search the transcript for keywords.

Research interviews become much more manageable when you can get accurate transcripts quickly. Whether you're working on a thesis, conducting field research, or preparing group presentations, having written records of your audio sources saves enormous amounts of time.

Study group sessions can be recorded and transcribed, creating shared notes that everyone can access. This is particularly helpful for complex subjects where different people catch different details during discussions.

# The Content Creator

For podcasters and YouTubers, WhisperTranscribe solves multiple content creation challenges at once. Podcast transcripts can be repurposed into blog posts, social media content, or show notes with minimal editing. This approach lets you create multiple pieces of content from a single recording session.

Video creators benefit from the accurate subtitle generation. The SRT and VTT export options work seamlessly with most video editing software and platform upload systems. Good captions don't just help with accessibility; they also improve your content's searchability and engagement rates.

The speaker identification feature helps when you're transcribing interviews or collaborative content. Instead of manually noting who said what, the system handles that organizational work for you.

# The Young Professional

Early career professionals often find themselves in meetings, workshops, and training sessions where taking detailed notes can be challenging. Recording these sessions and getting transcripts allows you to focus on participating rather than frantically scribbling notes.

Voice memos become more useful when you can convert them to text. Those quick thoughts you record while commuting or walking can be easily integrated into your work documents or project plans.

Client interviews, user research sessions, and feedback calls all benefit from accurate transcription. Having written records protects you legally and ensures you don't miss important details that could affect project outcomes.

# The Researcher or Journalist

For anyone conducting interviews or field research, WhisperTranscribe provides the accuracy and speed needed for professional work. The ability to handle multiple speakers and maintain conversation structure makes it particularly valuable for interview-heavy projects.

The timestamp feature helps when you need to reference specific moments in your source material. You can quickly jump back to particular sections of the audio while working with the transcript.

Export flexibility means you can integrate transcripts into whatever workflow or software system you're already using. Whether you prefer working in Word, Google Docs, or specialized research tools, the transcript fits into your existing process.

# Understanding the Pricing Structure

WhisperTranscribe uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means you only pay for the audio you actually transcribe. This approach makes a lot of sense for students and occasional users who don't want to commit to monthly subscription fees.

Pricing is calculated based on the duration of your audio or video files, measured in minutes. The rates are competitive with other high-quality transcription services, though slightly higher than some basic options that sacrifice accuracy for lower prices.

For perspective, transcribing a typical 30-minute interview costs about the same as a coffee shop drink. A 90-minute lecture recording might cost what you'd spend on lunch. When you consider the hours of manual work you're avoiding, the value proposition becomes clear.

New users typically receive some free credits to test the service before committing to paid transcription. This trial period lets you upload a few files and evaluate the quality for your specific use cases before spending money.

The pay-per-use model works particularly well for students and creators with variable transcription needs. You might use the service heavily during research phases or content creation sprints, then not need it for weeks. Unlike subscription services that charge you whether you use them or not, WhisperTranscribe aligns costs with actual usage.

Budget-conscious users can also control spending by being selective about which recordings really need transcription. Not every voice memo or meeting recording requires a full transcript, so you can focus your budget on the content that matters most.

# The Good and The Bad: A Balanced View

# What Works Really Well

The accuracy with clean audio is genuinely impressive. When your source material has good sound quality, WhisperTranscribe delivers transcripts that need minimal editing. This level of accuracy makes it practical for professional use, not just a rough starting point that requires extensive cleanup.

File format support is comprehensive enough that you'll rarely encounter compatibility issues. Whether you're working with audio from your phone, professional recording equipment, or video files from various sources, the system handles them smoothly.

The user interface strikes the right balance between simplicity and functionality. You can get started immediately without tutorials or training, but the features you need for more complex projects are still accessible. The built-in editor is particularly well-designed, making corrections quick and intuitive.

Export options cater to different use cases effectively. Content creators get the subtitle files they need, while researchers and students can export clean text documents. The flexibility means you're not locked into using the transcript in only one way.

The pay-per-use pricing model eliminates the pressure of subscription commitments. You can use the service sporadically without feeling like you're wasting money during periods when you don't need transcription.

Processing speed consistently exceeds expectations. Getting results in minutes rather than hours makes WhisperTranscribe practical for time-sensitive projects and tight deadlines.

# Areas That Could Be Better

Speaker identification works well for clearly distinct voices but can get confused when speakers sound similar or when there's crosstalk. For complex multi-speaker scenarios, you might need to do some manual cleanup of speaker labels.

# How WhisperTranscribe Stacks Up Against the Competition

Before making any software decision, it's smart to understand your options. The transcription market has several established players, each with different strengths and approaches. Let's see how WhisperTranscribe compares to the most popular alternatives.

[**Otter.ai**](http://Otter.ai) is probably the most well-known name in AI transcription. It offers real-time transcription, which WhisperTranscribe doesn't, making it better for live meetings and lectures. Otter's free plan includes 300 minutes monthly, which sounds generous until you realize that's only about five hours of content.

Where WhisperTranscribe wins is accuracy and audio quality handling. Otter works great in quiet conference rooms but struggles with background noise or multiple speakers talking over each other. The pay-per-use model also makes more sense if you don't transcribe content regularly. Otter's subscription fees can add up quickly, especially on their higher-tier plans needed for longer recordings.

**Rev** takes a hybrid approach, offering both AI transcription and human transcription services. Their human transcription is incredibly accurate but costs significantly more and takes 12+ hours for delivery. Rev's AI option is cheaper but noticeably less accurate than WhisperTranscribe, especially with accents or technical terminology.

Rev's strength lies in their human service for critical projects where perfect accuracy matters. But for everyday transcription needs, WhisperTranscribe delivers better AI results at competitive prices without the long wait times.

**Descript** positions itself as an all-in-one content creation platform rather than just a transcription service. You can edit audio and video by editing text, which is genuinely cool for content creators. The transcription quality is good, though not quite as accurate as WhisperTranscribe with challenging audio.

Descript makes sense if you need video editing capabilities alongside transcription. But if you just need accurate transcripts quickly, you're paying for features you won't use. The learning curve is also steeper since it's designed as a complete content creation suite.

**Trint** markets heavily to journalists and researchers, with features like highlighting, tagging, and collaboration tools. The transcription accuracy is solid, and the interface is designed for analyzing and working with large amounts of content.

Trint's subscription model starts at higher price points than most alternatives, making it less appealing for occasional users. The features are impressive if you're doing heavy research work, but overkill for students or creators who just need clean transcripts.

**Value for Money Assessment**

For pure transcription accuracy per dollar spent, WhisperTranscribe offers the best balance. Otter's free plan seems attractive until you hit the limits, then their paid plans become expensive for heavy users. Rev's human service is premium-priced for premium results. Descript and Trint charge for broader feature sets you might not need.

WhisperTranscribe's pay-as-you-go model means you never pay for unused capacity, making it particularly cost-effective for students and freelancers with variable transcription needs.

**Which Tool for Which Situation**

Choose [**Otter.ai**](http://Otter.ai) if you need real-time transcription for live meetings or lectures, and you don't mind the subscription cost for regular use.

Pick **Rev** when absolute accuracy is non-negotiable and you can afford the premium pricing and longer turnaround times for human transcription.

Go with **Descript** if you're creating video content and want editing capabilities alongside transcription, and you're willing to learn a more complex interface.

Select **Trint** for research-heavy projects requiring advanced organization and collaboration features, with the budget for their higher-tier pricing.

Choose **WhisperTranscribe** when you want the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness for standard transcription needs without paying for features you won't use.

**Switching from Other Tools**

Moving to WhisperTranscribe from other services is straightforward since most transcription tools export standard text formats. Your existing transcripts remain accessible, and you can start using WhisperTranscribe immediately without data migration concerns.

The biggest adjustment is usually moving from subscription billing to pay-per-use. This change often results in cost savings, but requires thinking differently about budgeting for transcription services. Instead of a fixed monthly cost, you'll pay based on actual usage, which typically works out better for most users.

# Final Thoughts and Recommendation

After extensive testing and real-world use, WhisperTranscribe proves itself as a reliable, accurate transcription service that delivers on its core promises. The combination of high accuracy, reasonable pricing, and user-friendly design makes it a strong choice for students, content creators, and young professionals who need quality transcription without the complexity or cost of enterprise solutions.

The service excels in its target scenarios. If you're recording lectures, conducting interviews, creating content, or documenting meetings, WhisperTranscribe will save you significant time while producing results you can actually use. The accuracy with good audio quality is professional-grade, and even with challenging audio, the results provide a solid foundation for further editing.

The pay-as-you-go pricing model aligns well with how most people actually use transcription services. Rather than paying for capacity you might not use, you invest only in the content you actually need transcribed. For students and freelancers managing tight budgets, this approach makes high-quality transcription accessible.

# Who Should Try WhisperTranscribe

Students who record lectures, conduct research interviews, or work on group projects will find immediate value in the service. The time savings alone justify the cost, and the improved note-taking capabilities can directly impact academic performance.

Content creators, especially podcasters and YouTubers, should seriously consider WhisperTranscribe for generating captions, show notes, and repurposed content. The subtitle export features and speaker identification make it particularly valuable for video content.

Young professionals who attend frequent meetings, conduct client interviews, or need to document conversations will appreciate the professional-quality results and flexible pricing structure.

Researchers and journalists working with interview-heavy projects will find the accuracy and export options well-suited to their workflow requirements.

# Who Might Need Something Different

If you need real-time transcription for live events or meetings, WhisperTranscribe's processing-based approach won't meet your requirements. Look for services that specialize in live transcription instead.

Users who primarily work with very low-quality audio might find that even WhisperTranscribe's advanced processing can't overcome significant audio limitations. In these cases, investing in better recording equipment might be more cost-effective than any transcription service.

Organizations requiring enterprise features like team management, advanced security, or custom integrations should explore business-focused transcription platforms rather than individual-user services.

WhisperTranscribe represents the current state of accessible, high-quality transcription technology. It takes a genuinely useful AI capability and packages it in a way that serves real user needs without unnecessary complexity or prohibitive costs. For most people dealing with transcription challenges, it's absolutely worth trying.

The free credits offered to new users provide a risk-free way to evaluate whether the service fits your specific needs and audio quality requirements. Given the potential time savings and the reasonable costs, most users will find that WhisperTranscribe quickly pays for itself in improved productivity and reduced transcription stress.

1mblz5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mblz5w/aita_or_just_insecure_for_asking_my_fiancé_to/,AITA or just insecure for asking my fiancé to stop being friends with his high school girl best friend?,"Hi readit,
I really need your honest take — I’m either losing my mind or finally seeing things clearly. Please help. 🥺

I’m 19, let’s call me Ivy, and I moved countries to be with my fiancé, let’s call him Antonio (24). We’ve been together almost 2 years. Most of our relationship was long-distance, so trust was EVERYTHING.

I have to admit — I’m not perfect. I’ve been hurt badly in the past, I struggle with trust, and I can get anxious and overthink. But I’ve always been loyal and tried to give him my all. When we started dating, I deleted all my male friends (except one who’s fighting cancer). He didn’t ask me to — I did it out of love.

But he? He kept all his female friends — the one I’ve never even met — and one in particular has haunted our entire relationship. Let’s call her María.


---

The First Red Flag

Three months into our relationship, Antonio reached out to María on Instagram. They hadn’t spoken in 3 years — or so he said (that part changed every time I asked). He asked a mutual friend, let’s call him Fernando (who once literally advised him to ""just go get laid"" after a breakup) for María’s number.

Then he planned a 6-hour visit to her house. Alone. Just the two of them.

I asked who would be there — he said maybe her 3-year-old daughter. Later, he told me the daughter only arrived after he left. Then the story changed — he went to catch up. Then it was to say goodbye. Then it was to meet her kid. I got a new version every few months.


---

The Snake Story 🐍 (Yeah... seriously)

Months later, in passing, he casually mentioned that a snake once slithered down his leg... from her bed.

Turns out they smoked weed together in her bedroom, where she wanted to show him her sister’s pet snake. (Whose sister keeps their pet snake in their room, by the way?!)

So now I find out:

He was in her bedroom.

They smoked together.

He never told me any of this at the time.


And yes — María happens to be his exact type: blue eyes, brown hair. Oh, and he also confessed they once kissed when they were 17… and cuddled naked in a car because “she was cold.” 🤡


---

Still Not Over It

I let it go. I moved across the world for this man. And what do I find? Folders and photos of María still on his phone.

I had already asked him to delete them. He said, “Oh, I forgot.”

They still have personal nicknames for each other. He giggles when he talks about her. Like a teenage boy.

When I ask why he insists on keeping her in his life, he says:

“She’s my only friend from high school.”
“She was always there for me.”
“I value her opinion.”
“You have people. I don’t.”


Meanwhile, I left my country, my family, my career (I was a commercial model), and even missed my baby sister’s birth to be with him. I know no one here. I do everything alone.


---

The Double Standard

Once, an old school friend DM’d me on Instagram. He asked if I wanted to grab coffee when he was in the country. I said “Sure,” just to be polite — I had zero intention of going. I didn’t even tell Antonio because it felt irrelevant. When he found out? He lost it. And you know what? I understand why. I apologized.

But how is what I did worse than spending six hours in a girl’s bedroom, getting stoned, and lying about it for months?

He keeps saying he hasn’t cheated and that I’m overreacting. But if nothing happened, why do I keep finding things out piece by piece?

He says I’m insecure. Jealous. Overthinking. He says:

“Why are you bringing this up again?”
""Urgh not this nonsense again.""
“You’re just stirring up drama and looking for a fight.”
“You don’t appreciate how hard I work.”


He works long hours, yes. But I also take care of our home completely alone, in a foreign country. I feel isolated and emotionally starved. And now he even gets cold when I try to talk about it.

When I surprise him at work, he says:

“Are you checking up on me?”


And I see how he lights up talking to his female coworker Julia. He grins. He engages. But with me? I get the bland leftovers.

And in arguments, he’s said things like:

“If you don’t give me something, I’ll go look for it elsewhere.”
“If you gave me more sex, maybe I’d be more loveable""


EXCUSE ME?!


---

So readit... Be Honest

I love this man. Deeply. I want us to work. But I feel so drained, so small, and so lost. I’ve tried everything. Therapy. Prayer. Communication. I’m not perfect. I’ve messed up too. But he keeps saying I'm the problem.

So...
Am I the a-hole for asking him to stop being friends with María?
Or am I just a jealous, insecure girl losing her grip?

Because right now, I don’t know what’s real anymore. And I don’t know if I should stay.

Staff here had a tip pool that does not include managers for quite a few years (the pool has been in place longer than any of them have worked here). All current staff are happy with the tip pool - they pool all their tips, then they are divided weekly by the number of hours worked. All staff are trained to work in two different positions (barista and register) and they have shifts throughout the week that switch them back and forth between the two positions (so if you work 4 days, you will probably work 2 of those days on register and 2 of those days as a barista).

The NH state tip law states that all employees must opt into the tip pool and cannot be coerced. If the employee opts out, there can be no repercussions (we cannot make it so that they are never scheduled to be on register, we cannot fire them, we can't limit their hours, etc if I am interpreting it correctly). If they do not opt into the tip pool, when they are working on the register all tips that are received legally belong to that employee.

I have recently hired an employee that does not want to opt into the tip pool. The problem I am now facing is that the rest of my staff are angry and are refusing to work with that employee. They don't think that it is fair that they get all of the tips for the entire shift when they are on register. My proposal is that the barista and register person switch back and forth throughout the shift. The other employees are still unhappy with that compromise. The first half of the shift is very busy (when most of the tips are earned) and the second half is slower and used for cleaning up and pre-closing, so if we were to split the shift in half time wise it would still be unbalanced. If they swapped back and forth constantly, they claim it will make dialing in the espresso complicated and affect the quality of the product we are serving.

They are threatening to quit if this issue isn't resolved. I see where they are coming from but from a legal perspective I'm not sure what else I can do. Has anyone else ever experienced this problem or have any suggestions for solutions I haven't thought of? Thank you!",2,1753722328.0,AskHR,1,1.0,False

1mblv87,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mblv87/why_is_the_szhetefu_12oz_french_press_review/,Why is the SZHETEFU 12oz French Press Review Perfect for Camping Coffee Lovers?,"The SZHETEFU 12ozFP-01 French Press Coffee Maker came into my hands at just the right time since my morning coffee routine desperately needed a little spark. Being someone who experiments with various coffee brewing methods, I was intrigued immediately by its sleek appearance, and after weeks of using it for both my daily cup and weekend camping adventures, the experience was worth writing about. However, as much as I enjoyed it, there are a few aspects that stood out—for better or worse.

**Feature-Packed Design That Blends Elegance with Functionality**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was its clean and elegant matte silver finish. It doesn't just look good sitting on the kitchen counter—it also seamlessly fits into my camping kit without feeling bulky. Its compact dimensions (3.01""D x 5.47""W x 6.48""H) are perfect for tight spaces like backpacks or smaller cabinets. I also appreciated the sturdiness that comes with the double-layer stainless steel construction. I tend to drop things (don't judge me), and the durable body gives me peace of mind knowing this coffee press won't shatter like glass alternatives.  

**[Grab SZHETEFU 12ozFP-01 at the best price on Amazon!](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0ddt44xv1/)**  

**Surprisingly Effective Insulation**  
The promise of keeping warm coffee for one or two hours is no exaggeration. While the double-walled construction is designed for insulation, it truly surpassed my expectations. On a camping trip where I brewed a fresh pot of coffee and was distracted by adventurous activities, I came back an hour later to still find it warm. A delightful bonus for someone who doesn’t always drink their coffee all at once.

**Ease of Brewing and Versatility**  
One of the joys of this product is how it simplifies the experience of making French press coffee. The snug-fitting stopper helps minimize coffee grounds in the cup, which is often an issue with other presses I've used. Whether you're aiming for a smooth espresso-style brew or experimenting with different types of coffee beans, the brewing process allows flexibility. I loved pouring some hot milk directly into the press to make an easy cappuccino—zero fuss, and it warms up beautifully inside.

**Positives**  
- Keeps coffee warm for an extended period due to superior insulation.  
- Compact and lightweight, making it travel-friendly.  
- A robust stainless steel design that withstands daily use and adventurous trips.  
- Reduces coffee ground residues significantly with a well-engineered stopper.  

**The Downsides You Should Know**  
As much as I loved it, no product is without its flaws. Sometimes, simplicity can be a double-edged sword.  

- The manual operation might not suit people who prefer automatic machines.  
- Its smaller size (12 oz) may not cater to households with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- Cleaning it thoroughly after a brew can feel tedious because of the tighter stopper mechanism.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Perhaps one of the essential questions is whether the price matches the features. When you consider the functionality, durable build, and aesthetic appeal, the French press stands head and shoulders above flimsy or cheap alternatives. Compared to pricier automatic espresso machines or even other French presses with lower-quality steel, this one is very reasonable without skimping on quality. If you're looking for something portable yet effective, you’re not overpaying for what you get here.

**Competing Products**  
Naturally, I couldn’t help but compare this French press to others already in my collection or those I've tried before. For instance, brands with glass carafes like Bodum may offer a better view of the brewing process but lack the same insulation and durability. Meanwhile, fancier electric espresso makers do automate the brewing, but they aren’t portable or as simple to maintain, nor are they budget-friendly for casual coffee enthusiasts. The SZHETEFU emerges as a solid middle ground—it excels in portability, maintains your coffee's temperature longer, and feels durable in its construction.

**Summary of Alternatives**  
- Glass French Presses: More fragile but offer visibility during brewing.  
- Automatic Espresso Makers: Convenient but bulky, not ideal for travel/camping.  
- Basic Stainless Steel Presses: Often lacking in insulation quality.

Watching the chart spike was satisfying. I locked in a comfortable gain and shifted my focus back to the next underdog.

They know Rachel is a waitress and even saw her first paycheque and saw how little she was getting. She was in the same job, so did they all just magically think that she had gotten a massive payrise? 

They know Phoebe is a masseuse who plays music at the coffee shop. Did they somehow think she was raking in the cash?

They know Joey is an often-unemployed actor whose side gigs aren't exactly well-paying, especially since Chandler pays for a lot of the stuff Joey needs because Joey doesn't have the cash. Did they think he won the lottery and just wasn't sharing? 

And what's worse is they ordered their food and saw how little the others had. Rachel had a side salad, Phoebe had a small cup of soup, and Joey had a tiny pizza, yet they genuinely still thought that the bill should be split equally. Why? Ross, Monica, and Chandler would have the others covering part of their meals...and then Ross says that actually, everyone should pay more because Monica should eat for free. 

I know it's just a show and all, but I watched the episode today and it really struck me how absurd it is. How could a professor, a professional chef, and whatever Chandler was (computster?) who all earn good money think a waitress, a masseuse, and a sometimes-employed actor could afford the same things as them?

I’m a 30F Muslim, East African/Canadian living in Midtown and looking to meet some fellow Muslims in the area. I have a great group of friends, but most aren’t Muslim, and it would be really nice to connect with people who share that part of my background. Nothing intense, just a bit of shared understanding and similar life experience.

It would be ideal if you’re also in Midtown or close since I don’t have a car and I’m hoping to meet up in real life without needing to plan a whole expedition.

No expectations around how religious you are. I’m not here to have deep debates about faith (unless you’re into that). Just looking for relaxed, friendly vibes and people I can genuinely connect with.

I’d love to meet other women, but I’m open to male friends too; I work in tech so not unusual to me, but just to be clear, I’m not looking to date, so I’d appreciate it if we kept things platonic and respectful.

A little about me:
- I’m a bit of a homebody and pretty introverted, but open up once I’m comfortable
- I love reading, especially sci-fi, fantasy, and crime
- I go through random phases of playing my Switch obsessively, then forgetting it exists for months
- I enjoy long walks (when it’s not 1000 degrees out), watching shows, and low-key hangouts, badminton, painting, board games, cafe hangs  
- I don’t drink or smoke, but i don’t care if you do in your own time
- I work in software/AI, also building an app on the side (haven’t touched it in 4 months but not important lol) 
- I’m a new hijabi (hasn’t been the easiest in this heat but still trying :) ) 

If this sounds like your kind of energy, feel free to message me. Would love to grab a coffee, go for a walk, or just chat and see where it goes.

i'm a rising 2L at a lower t14 paying sticker. when i graduate, i will have over 300k of debt. i'm regretting my decisions, and i feel very stuck. 

 i got into my top-choice school with the intention of going into public interest. i didn't attend any biglaw  networking events.

now, with the passage of the bbb and the elimination of several ibr plans, i'm extremely worried about my financial security and the future of pslf. my school does have an lrap, but they haven't made any payments for students in a year (their loans are in forbearance), and they're waiting on a court ruling to determine next steps. 

upon graduation, my younger sibling will turn 18, and i'll likely have to start providing for them as they transition into adulthood. 

because i was so focused on getting a 1L summer job until may, i didn't really pay attention to the 2L applications in april. another mistake.

i did may oci, 8 screeners, 0 callbacks. throughout june/july, 100+ direct apps with a slighty increased gpa-- nothing but ghosts and rejections. 

i'm applying for any firm in most cities with a good public transit system (i cannot drive). if it pays 3200/week or more, i'm sending in an app. i've gotten positive feedback on my cover letter and interview skills. i've sent emails trying to network with attorneys, most just ghost me. one attorney i connected with tried to advocate for me, but i was below their gpa cutoff and they couldn't make an exception. 

i'm technically kjd, but i worked full time all throughout undergrad in tech-centric healthcare startups in operational/administrative roles, so i have a few years of work experience.  

it's almost august and firms have mostly completed their hiring. i'm obsessively checking my email to see if i can finally get that one interview. i have chronic stomach pain. 

i came to this school and took on all this debt because i expected opportunities, but the only job i was able to get was because someone knew someone, and they set me up with a coffee chat as a favor. 

what do i do? do i just keep applying? how do i get a biglaw job? is there a secret step that no one is telling me? do i drop out while my loans are still at 100k?

1mblgxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mblgxs/morning_star_read_online_free/,Morning Star Read online free," I rise into  
darkness, away from the garden they watered with the blood of my friends. The Golden man who killed my wife lies dead beside me on the cold metal deck, life snuffed out by his own son’s hand.  
  
  Autumn wind whips my hair. The ship rumbles beneath. In the distance, friction flames shred the night with brilliant orange. The Telemanuses descending from orbit to rescue me. Better that they do not. Better to let the darkness have me and allow the vultures to squabble over my paralyzed body.  
  
  My enemy’s voices echo behind me. Towering demons with the faces of angels. The smallest of them bends. Stroking my head as he looks down at his dead father.  
  
  “This is always how the story would end,” he says to me. “Not with your screams. Not with your rage. But with your silence.”  
  
  Roque, my betrayer, sits in the corner. He was my friend. Heart too kind for his Color. Now he turns his head and I see his tears. But they are not for me. They are for what he has lost. For the ones I have taken from him.  
  
  “No Ares to save you. No Mustang to love you. You are alone, Darrow.” The Jackal’s eyes are distant and quiet. “Like me.” He lifts up a black eyeless mask with a muzzle on it and straps it to my face. Darkening my sight. “This is how it ends.”  
  
  To break me, he has slain those I love.  
  
  But there is hope in those still living. In Sevro. In Ragnar and Dancer. I think of all my people bound in darkness. Of all the Colors on all the worlds, shackled and chained so that Gold might rule, and I feel the rage burn across the dark hollow he has carved in my soul. I am not alone. I am not his victim.  
  
  So let him do his worst. I am the Reaper.  
  
  I know how to suffer.  
  
  I know the darkness.  
  
  This is not how it ends.  
  
  Deep in darkness, far from warmth and sun and moons, I lie, quiet as the stone that surrounds me, imprisoning my hunched body in a dreadful womb. I cannot stand. Cannot stretch. I can only curl in a ball, a withered fossil of the man that was. Hands cuffed behind my back. Naked on cold rock.  
  
  All alone with the dark.  
  
  It seems months, years, millennia since my knees have unbent, since my spine has straightened from its crooked pose. The ache is madness. My joints fuse like rusted iron. How much time has passed since I saw my Golden friends bleeding out into the grass? Since I felt gentle Roque kiss my cheek as he broke my heart?  
  
  Time is no river.  
  
  Not here.  
  
  In this tomb, time is the stone. It is the darkness, permanent and unyielding, its only measure the twin pendulums of life—breath and the beating of my heart.  
  
  In. Buh…bump. Buh…bump.  
  
  Out. Buh…bump. Buh…bump.  
  
  In. Buh…bump. Buh…bump.  
  
  And forever it repeats. Until…Until when? Until I die of old age? Until I crush my skull against the stone? Until I gnaw out the tubes the Yellows threaded into my lower gut to force nutrients in and wastes out?  
  
  Or until you go mad?  
  
  “No.” I grind my teeth.  
  
  Yessssss.  
  
  “It’s only the dark.” I breathe in. Calm myself. Touch the walls in my soothing pattern. Back, fingers, tailbone, heels, toes, knees, head. Repeat. A dozen times. A hundred. Why not be sure? Make it a thousand.  
  
  Yes. I’m alone.  
  
  I would have thought there to be worse fates than this, but now I know there are none. Man is no island. We need those who love us. We need those who hate us. We need others to tether us to life, to give us a reason to live, to feel. All I have is the darkness. Sometimes I scream. Sometimes I laugh during the night, during the day. Who knows now? I laugh to pass the time, to exhaust the calories the Jackal gives me and make my body shiver into sleep.  
  
  I weep too. I hum. I whistle.  
  
  I listen to voices above. Coming to me from the endless sea of darkness. And attending them is the maddening clatter of chains and bones, vibrating through my prison walls. All so close, yet a thousand kilometers away, as if a whole world existed just beyond the darkness and I cannot see it, cannot touch it, taste it, feel it, or pierce that veil to belong to the world once again. I am imprisoned in solitude.  
  
  I hear the voices now. The chains and bones trickling through my prison.  
  
  Are the voices mine?  
  
  I laugh at the idea.  
  
  I curse.  
  
  I plot. Kill.  
  
  Slaughter. Gouge. Rip. Burn.  
  
  I beg. I hallucinate. I bargain.  
  
  I whimper prayers to Eo, happy she was spared a fate like this.  
  
  She’s not listening.  
  
  I sing childhood ballads and recite Dying Earth, The Lamplighter, the Ramayana, The Odyssey in Greek and Latin, then in the lost languages of Arabic, English, Chinese, and German, pulling from memories of dataDrops Matteo gave me when I was barely more than a boy. Seeking strength from the wayward Argive who only wished to find his way home.  
  
  You forget what he did.  
  
  Odysseus was a hero. He broke the walls of Troy with his wooden horse. Like I broke the Bellona armies in the Iron Rain over Mars.  
  
  And then…  
  
  “No,” I snap. “Quiet.”  
  
  …men entered Troy. Found mothers. Found children. Guess what they did?  
  
  “Shut up!”  
  
  You know what they did. Bone. Sweat. Flesh. Ash. Weeping. Blood.  
  
  The darkness cackles with glee.  
  
  Reaper, Reaper, Reaper…All deeds that last are painted in blood.  
  
  Am I asleep? Am I awake? I’ve lost my way. Everything bleeding together, drowning me in visions and whispers and sounds. Again and again I jerk Eo’s fragile little ankles. Break Julian’s face. Hear Pax and Quinn and Tactus and Lorn and Victra sigh their last. So much pain. And for what? To fail my wife. To fail my people.  
  
  And fail Ares. Fail your friends.  
  
  How many are even left?  
  
  Sevro? Ragnar?  
  
  Mustang?  
  
  Mustang. What if she knows you’re here…What if she doesn’t care…And why would she? You who betrayed. You who lied. You who used her mind. Her body. Her blood. You showed her your true face and she ran. What if it was her? What if she betrayed you? Could you love her then?  
  
  “Shut up!” I scream at myself, at the darkness.  
  
  Don’t think of her. Don’t think of her.  
  
  Why ever not? You miss her.  
  
  A vision of her is spawned in the darkness like so many before it—a girl riding away from me across a field of green, twisting in her saddle and laughing for me to follow. Hair rippling as would summer hay fluttering from a farmer’s wagon.  
  
  You crave her. You love her. The Golden girl. Forget that Red bitch.  
  
  “No.” I slam my head against the wall. “It’s only the dark,” I whisper. Only the dark playing tricks on my mind. But still I try to forget Mustang, Eo. There is no world beyond this place. I cannot miss what does not exist.  
  
  Warm blood trickles down my forehead from old scabs, now freshly broken. It drips off my nose. I extend my tongue, probing the cold stone till I find the drops. Savor the salt, the Martian iron. Slowly. Slowly. Let the novelty of sensation last. Let the flavor linger and remind me I am a man. A Red of Lykos. A Helldiver.  
  
  No. You are not. You are nothing. Your wife abandoned you and stole your child. Your whore turned from you. You were not good enough. You were too proud. Too stupid. Too wicked. Now, you are forgotten.  
  
  Am I?  
  
  When last I saw the Golden girl, I was on my knees beside Ragnar in the tunnels of Lykos, asking Mustang to betray her own people and live for more. I knew that if she chose to join us, Eo’s dream would blossom. A better world was at our fingertips. Instead, she left. Could she forget me? Has her love for me left her?  
  
  She only loved your mask.  
  
  “It’s only the dark. Only the dark. Only the dark,” I mumble faster and faster.  
  
  I should not be here.  
  
  I should be dead. After the death of Lorn, I was to be given to Octavia so her Carvers could dissect me to discover the secrets of how I became Gold. To see if there could be others like me. But the Jackal made a bargain. Kept me for hi  
s own. He tortured me in his Attica estate, asking about the Sons of Ares, about Lykos and my family. Never telling me how he discovered my secret. I begged him to end my life.  
  
  In the end, he gave me stone.  
  
  “When all is lost, honor demands death,” Roque once told me. “It is a noble end.” But what would a rich poet know of death? The poor know death. Slaves know death. But even as I yearn for it, I fear it. Because the more I see of this cruel world, the less I believe it ends in some pleasant fiction.  
  
  The Vale is not real.  
  
  It’s a lie told by mothers and fathers to give their starving children a reason for the horror. There is no reason. Eo is gone. She never watched me fight for her dream. She did not care what fate I made at the Institute or if I loved Mustang, because the day she died, she became nothing. There is nothing but this world. It is our beginning and our end. Our one chance at joy before the dark.  
  
  Yes. But you don’t have to end. You can escape this place, the darkness whispers to me. Say the words. Say them. You know the way.  
  
  It is right. I do.  
  
  “All you must say is ‘I am broken,’ and this will all end,” the Jackal said long ago, before he lowered me into this hell. “I will put you in a lovely estate for the rest of your days and send you warm, beautiful Pinks and food enough to make you fatter than the Ash Lord. But the words carry a price.

  
Worth it. Save yourself. No one else will.  
  
  “That price, dear Reaper, is your family.”  
  
  The family he seized from Lykos with his lurchers and now keeps in his prison in the bowels of his Attica fortress. Never letting me see them. Never letting me tell them I love them, and that I’m sorry I was not strong enough to protect them.  
  
  “I will feed them to the prisoners of this fortress,” he said. “These men and women you think should rule instead of Gold. Once you see the animal in man, you will know that I am right and you are wrong. Gold must rule.”  
  
  Let them go, the darkness says. The sacrifice is practical. It is wise.  
  
  “No…I won’t…”  
  
  Your mother would want you to live.  
  
  Not at that price.  
  
  What man could grasp a mother’s love? Live. For her. For Eo.  
  
  Could she want that? Is the darkness right? After all, I’m important. Eo said so. Ares said so; he chose me. Me of all the Reds. I can break the chains. I can live for more. It’s not selfish for me to escape this prison. In the grand scheme of things, it is selfless.  
  
  Yes. Selfless, really…  
  
  Mother would beg me to make this sacrifice. Kieran would understand. So would my sister. I can save our people. Eo’s dream must be made real, no matter the cost. It’s my responsibility to persevere. It is my right.  
  
  Say the words.  
  
  I slam my head into the stone and scream at the darkness to go away. It cannot trick me. It cannot break me.  
  
  Didn’t you know? All men break.  
  
  Its high cackle mocks me, stretching forever.  
  
  And I know it is right. All men break. I did already under his torture. I told him that I was from Lykos. Where he could find my family. But there is a way out, to honor what I am. What Eo loved. To silence the voices.  
  
  “Roque, you were right,” I whisper. “You were right.” I just want to be home. To be gone from here. But I can’t have that. All that’s left, the only honorable path for me, is death. Before I betray even more of who I am.  
  
  Death is the way out.  
  
  Don’t be a fool. Stop. Stop.  
  
  I lurch my head forward into the wall harder than before. Not to punish, but to kill. To end myself. If there is no pleasant end to this world, then nothingness will suffice. But if there is a Vale beyond this plane, I will find it. I’m coming, Eo. At last, I am on my way. “I love you.”  
  
  No. No. No. No. No.  
  
  I crash my skull again into stone. Heat pours down my face. Sparks of pain dance in the black. The darkness wails at me, but I do not stop.  
  
  If this is the end, I will rage toward it.  
  
  But as I pull back my head to deliver one last great blow, existence groans. Rumbling like an earthquake. Not the darkness. Something beyond. Something in the stone itself, growing louder and deeper above me, till the darkness cracks and a blazing sword of light slashes down.  
  
  The ceiling parts. Light burns my eyes. I clamp them shut as the floor of my cell rises upward till, with a click, it stops and I rest, exposed, on a flat stone surface. I push out my legs and gasp, nearly fainting from the pain. Joints crack. Knotted tendons unspool. I fight to reopen my eyes against the raging light. Tears fill them. It is so bright I can only catch bleached flashes of the world around.  
  
  Fragments of alien voices surround me. “Adrius, what is this?”  
  
  “…has he been in there this whole time?”  
  
  “The stench…”  
  
  I lie upon stone. It stretches around me to either side. Black, rippling with blue and purple, like the shell of a Creonian beetle. A floor? No. I see cups. Saucers. A cart of coffee. It’s a table. That was my prison. Not some hideous abyss. Just a meter-wide, twelve-meter-long slab of marble with a hollow center. They’ve eaten inches above me every night. Their voices the distant whispers I heard in the darkness. The clatter of their silverware and plates my only company.  
  
  “Barbaric…”  
  
  I remember now. This is the table the Jackal sat at when I visited him after recovering from the wounds incurred during the Iron Rain. Did he plan my imprisonment even then? I wore a hood when they put me in here. I thought I was in the bowels of his fortress. But no. Thirty centimeters of stone separated their suppers from my hell.  
  
  I look up from the coffee tray by my head. Someone stares at me. Several someones. Can’t see them through the tears and blood in my eyes. I twist away, coiling inward like a blind mole unearthed for the very first time. Too overwhelmed and terrified to remember pride or hate. But I know he stares at me. The Jackal. A childish face in a slender body, with sandy hair parted on the side. He clears his throat.  
  
  “My honored guests. May I present prisoner L17L6363.”  
  
  His face is both heaven and hell.  
  
  To see another man…  
  
  To know I am not alone…  
  
  But then to remember what he’s done to me…it rips my soul out.  
  
  Other voices slither and boom, deafening in their loudness. And, even curled as I am, I feel something beyond their noise. Something natural and gentle and kind. Something the darkness convinced me I would never feel again. It drifts softly through an open window, kissing my skin.  
  
  A late autumn breeze cuts through the meaty, humid stink of my filth and makes me think that somewhere a child is sprinting through snow and trees, running his hands along bark and pine needles and getting sap in his hair. It’s a memory I know I’ve never had, but feel like I should. That’s the life I would have wanted. The child I could have had.  
  
  I weep. Less for me than for that boy who thinks he lives in a kind world, where Mother and Father are as large and strong as mountains. If only I could be so innocent again. If only I knew this moment was not a trick. But it is. The Jackal does not give except to take away. Soon the light will be a memory and darkness will return. I keep my eyes clenched tight, listening to the blood from my face drip on the stone, and wait for the twist.  
  
  “Goryhell, Augustus. Was this really necessary?” a feline killer purrs. Husky accent smothered in that indolent Luna lilt learned in the courts of the Palatine Hill, where all are less impressed by everything than anyone else. “He smells like death.”  
  
  “Fermented sweat and dead skin under the magnetic shackles. See the yellowish crust on his forearms, Aja?” the Jackal notes. “Still, he’s very much healthy and ready for your Carvers. All things considered.”  
  
  “You know the man better than I,” Aja says to someone else. “Make sure it is him. Not an imposter.”  
  
  “You doubt my word?” the Jackal asks. “You wound me.”  
  
  I flinch, feeling someone approach.  
  
  “Please. You’d need a heart for that, ArchGovernor. And you’ve many gifts, but that organ, I’m afraid, is dearly absent.”  
  
  “You compliment me too much.”  
  
  Spoons clatter against porcelain. Throats are cleared. I long to cover my ears. So much sound. So much information.  
  
  “You really can see the Red in him now.” It’s a cold, cultured female voice from northern Mars. More brusque than the Luna accent.  
  
  “Exactly, Antonia!” the Jackal replies. “I’ve been curious to see how he turned out. A member of the Aureate genus could never be so debased as this creature here before us. You know, he asked me for death before I put him in there. Started weeping about it. The irony is he could have killed himself whenever he chose. But he didn’t, because some part of him relished that hole. You see, Reds long ago adapted to darkness. Like worms. No pride to their rusty race. He was at home down there. More than he ever was with us.”  
  
  Now I remember hate.  
  
  I open my eyes to let them know I see them. Hear them. Yet as my eyes open, they are drawn not to my enemy, but to the winter vista that sprawls out the windows behind the Golds. There, six of the seven mountain peaks of Attica glitter in the morning light. Metal and glass buildings crest stone and snow, and yawn upward toward the blue sky. Bridges suture the peaks together. A light snow falls. It’s a blurred mirage to my nearsighted cave eyes.  
  
  “Darr  
ow?” I know the voice. I turn my head slightly to see one of his callused hands on the edge of the table. I flinch away, thinking it will strike me. It doesn’t. But the hand’s middle finger bears the golden eagle of Bellona. The family I destroyed. The other hand belongs to the arm I cut off on Luna when we last dueled, the one that was remade by Zanzibar the Carver. Two wolfshead rings of House Mars encircle those fingers. One is mine. One his. Each worth the price of a young Gold’s life. “Do you recognize me?” he asks.  
  
  I crane my head to look up at his face. Broken I may be, but Cassius au Bellona is undimmed by war or time. More beautiful by far than memory could ever allow, he pulses with life. Over two meters tall. Cloaked in the white and gold of the Morning Knight, his coiled hair lustrous as the trail of a falling star. He’s clean-shaven, and his nose is slightly crooked from a recent break. When I meet his eyes, I do all I can to not fall into sobs. The way he looks at me is sad, nearly tender. What a shadow of myself I must be to earn pity from a man I’ve hurt so deeply.  
  
  “Cassius,” I murmur with no agenda except to say the name. To speak to another human. To be heard.  
  
  “And?” Aja au Grimmus asks from behind Cassius. The most violent of the Sovereign’s Furies wears the same armor I saw her in when first we met in the Citadel spire on Luna, the night Mustang rescued me and Aja beat Quinn to death. It’s scuffed. Battle-worn. Fear overwhelms my hate, and I look away from the dark-skinned woman yet again.  
  
  “He’s alive after all,” Cassius says quietly. He turns on the Jackal. “What did you do to him? The scars…”  
  
  “I should think it obvious,” the Jackal says. “I have unmade the Reaper.”  
  
  I finally look down at my body past my ratty beard to see what he means. I am a corpse. Skeletal and pallid. Ribs erupt from skin thinner than the film atop heated milk. Knees jut from spindly legs. Toenails have grown long and grasping. Scars from the Jackal’s torture mottle my flesh. Muscle has withered. And tubes that kept me alive in the darkness erupt from my belly, black and stringy umbilical cords still anchoring me to the floor of my cell.  
  
  “How long was he in there?” Cassius asks.  
  
  “Three months of interrogation, then nine months of solitary.”  
  
  “Nine…”  
  
  “As is fitting. War shouldn’t make us abandon metaphor. We’re not savages after all, eh, Bellona?”  
  
  “Cassius’s sensibilities are offended, Adrius,” Antonia says from her place near the Jackal. She’s a poisoned apple of a woman. Shiny and bright and promising, but rotten and cancerous to the core. She killed my friend Lea at the Institute. Put a bullet in her own mother’s head, and then two more into her sister Victra’s spine. Now she’s allied with the Jackal, a man who crucified her at the Institute. What a world. Behind Antonia stands dark-faced Thistle, once a Howler, now a member of the Jackal’s Boneriders by the looks of the jackal skull pennant on her chest. She looks at the floor instead of at me. Her captain is bald-headed Lilath, who sits at the Jackal’s right hand. His favorite personal killer ever since the Institute.  
  
  “Pardon me if I fail to see the purpose of torturing a fallen enemy,” Cassius answers. “Especially if he’s given all the information he has to give.”  
  
  “The purpose?” The Jackal stares at him, eyes quiet, as he explains. “The purpose is punishment, my goodman. This…thing presumed he belonged among us. Like he was an equal, Cassius. A superior, even. He mocked us. Bedded my sister. He laughed at us and played us for fools before we found him out. He must know it was not by chance that he lost, but inevitability. Reds have always been cunning little creatures. And he, my friends, is the personification of what they wish to be, what they will be if we let them. So I let time and darkness remake him into what he really is. A Homo flammeus, to use the new classification system I proposed to the Board. Barely different from Homo sapiens on the evolutionary timeline. The rest was just a mask.”  
  
  “You mean he made a fool of you,” Cassius parses, “when your father preferred a carved-up Red to his blood heir? That’s what this is, Jackal. The petulant shame of a boy unloved and unwanted.”  
  
  The Jackal twitches at that. Aja’s equally displeased by her young companion’s tone.  
  
  “Darrow took Julian’s life,” Antonia says. “Then slaughtered your family. Cassius, he sent killers to butcher the children of your blood as they hid on Olympus Mons. One would wonder what your mother would think of your pity.”  
  
  Cassius ignores them, jerking his head toward the Pinks at the edge of the room. “Fetch the prisoner a blanket.”  
  
  They do not move.  
  
  “Such manners. Even from you, Thistle?” She gives no answer. With a snort of contempt, Cassius strips off his white cloak and drapes it over my shivering body. For a moment, no one speaks, as struck by the act as I.  
  
  “Thank you,” I croak. But he looks away from my hollow face. Pity is not forgiveness, nor is gratitude absolution.  
  
  Lilath snorts a laugh without looking up from her bowl of soft-boiled hummingbird eggs. She slurps at them like candy. “There is a point when honor becomes a flaw of character, Morning Knight.” Sitting beside the Jackal, the bald woman peers up at Aja with eyes like those of the eels in Venus’s cavern seas. Another egg goes down. “Old man Arcos learned the hard way.”  
  
  Aja does not reply, her manners faultless. But a deathly silence lurks inside the woman, a silence I remember from the moments before she killed Quinn. Lorn taught her the blade. She will not like seeing his name mocked. Lilath greedily swallows another egg, sacrificing manners for insult.  
  
  There’s animosity between these allies. As always with their kind. But this seems a stark new division between the old Golds and the Jackal’s more modern breed.  
  
  “We’re all friends here,” the Jackal says playfully. “Mind your manners, Lilath. Lorn was an Iron Gold who simply chose the wrong side. So, Aja, I’m curious. Now that my lease on the Reaper is up, do you still plan to dissect him?”  
  
  “We do,” Aja says. Shouldn’t have thanked Cassius after all. His honor isn’t true. It’s just sanitary. “Zanzibar is curious to discover how he was made. He has his theories, but he’s champing at the bit for the specimen. We were hoping to round up the Carver that did the deed, but we think he perished in a missile strike up in Kato, Alcidalia province.”  
  
  “Or they want you to think that,” Antonia says.  
  
  “You once had him here, didn’t you?” Aja asks pointedly.  
  
  The Jackal nods. “Mickey’s his name. Lost his license after he carved an unlicensed Aureate birth. Family tried sparing their child the Exposure. Anyway, he specialized in blackmarket aerial and aquatic pleasure mods afterward. Had a carveshop in Yorkton before the Sons recruited him for a special job. Darrow helped him escape my custody. If you want my opinion, he’s still alive. My operatives place him in Tinos.”  
  
  Aja and Cassius exchange a look.  
  
  “If you have a lead on Tinos, you need to share it with us now,” Cassius says.  
  
  “I have nothing definitive yet. Tinos is well hidden. And we’ve yet to capture one of their ship captains…alive.” The Jackal sips his coffee. “But irons are in the fire, and you’ll be the first to know if anything comes of them. Though, I rather think my Boneriders would like the first crack at the Howlers. Wouldn’t you, Lilath?”  
  
  I try not to stir at the mention of the name. But it’s hard not to. They’re alive. Some of them, at least. And they chose the Sons of Ares over Gold….  
  
  “Yes, sir,” Lilath says, studying me. “We’d relish a real hunt. Fighting the Red Legion and the other insurgents is a bore, even for Grays.”  
  
  “The Sovereign needs us home anyway, Cassius,” Aja says. Then, to the Jackal: “We’ll be departing as soon as my Thirteenth has decamped from the Golan Basin. Likely by morning.”  
  
  “You’re taking your legions back to Luna?”  
  
  “Just the Thirteenth. The rest will remain under your supervision.”  
  
  The Jackal is surprised. “My supervision?”  
  
  “On loan till this…Ris  
ing is fully snuffed out.” She practically spits the word. A new one to my ears. “It’s a token of the Sovereign’s trust. You know she is pleased with your progress here.”  
  
  “Despite your methods,” Cassius adds, drawing an annoyed look from Aja.  
  
  “Well, if you’re leaving in the morning you should, of course, dine with me this evening. I’ve been wanting to discuss certain…policies regarding the Rebels in the Rim.” The Jackal is vague because I’m listening. Information’s his weapon. Suggesting my friends betrayed me. Never saying which. Dropping hints and clues during my torture, before I was sent into the dark. A Gray telling him that his sister is waiting in his salon. His fingers smelling like frothed chai tea, his sister’s favorite drink. Does she know I am here? Has she sat at this table? The Jackal is still prattling on. Hard to track the voices. So much to decipher. Too much.  
  
  “…I’ll have my men clean Darrow up for his travels and we can throw a feast of Trimalchian proportions after our discussion. I know the Voloxes and the Corialuses would be delighted to see you again. It’s been too long since I had such august company as two Olympic Knights. You’re in the field so often, skirting around provinces, hunting through the tunnels and seas and ghettos. How long has it been since you had a fine meal without worry of a night raid or suicide bombers?”  
  
  “A spell,” Aja admits. “We took the Brothers Rath up on their hospitality when we passed through Thessalonica. They were eager to show their loyalty after their…behavior during the Lion’s Rain. It was…unsettling.”  
  
  The Jackal laughs. “I fear my dinner will be tame by comparison. It’s been all politicians and soldiers of late. This gorydamn war has so impeded my social calendar, as you can imagine.”  
  
  “Sure it’s not your reputation for hospitality?” Cassius asks. “Or your diet?”  
  
  Aja sighs, trying to hide her amusement. “Manners, Bellona.

So about me. I like walks and bike rides, even better if it means a pit stop at a coffee shop for a cuppa and some cake. Can easily chill at home binge watching a show or watching a film.

Also game from time to time mostly on my ps5. Long list of favourite games but always on the look out for new suggestions. Currently playing god of war ragnarok.

Figured a quick psychic chat might spice things up, unlike real apps like Calm that actually help with stress. Boy, was that a mistake. Here's my analytical takedown:

1. The Hook and Setup: They lure you in with that ""free 3 minutes"" BS and promises of accurate readings. I signed up, ignored the sketchy reviews popping up on sites like Trustpilot – shoulda paid attention, cuz half of 'em scream ""scam!"" But nah, I thought, ""How bad can it be?"" Entered my card deets for the ""discounted"" session, and boom, connected to a ""psychic"" who sounded like they were reading from a script.
2. The Actual ""Reading"": Total vague nonsense. She (or bot? Who knows) says stuff like ""I see changes coming"" – duh, life changes every day! No specifics, no real insight. Compared to legit services like actual therapy apps or even free horoscope sites, this was shady like a back alley deal. And get this, they upsell hard mid-chat: ""For just $10 more, unlock deeper truths."" Felt manipulated as hell.
3. The Aftermath and Red Flags: Tried to cancel right after, but their refund policy is a joke – buried in fine print, and support? Non-existent. Emails bounced, chat support looped me in circles. Outcomes? Still getting spam texts weeks later, and my bank only refunded partial cuz I ""authorized"" it. Hindsight 20/20, I see now how they prey on vulnerable peeps, like me post that crappy shift when I was weary and just wanted some fun distraction. Oh, and random tangent: My coffee spilled all over my desk during the chat, like the universe warning me or somethin'.
4. Warnings and Comparisons: Fact-check this against real psychic apps – if any are real, lol – but AskNebula ranks low everywhere. Bad reviews galore about overcharges and fake profiles. Don't fall for it; stick to verified stuff. Total scam",9,1753721050.0,BadApps,10,0.85,False

1mbl90v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1mbl90v/evaluate_the_best_masticating_juicer_omega/,Evaluate the Best Masticating Juicer Omega NC900HRD19 Worth It,"Writing product review articles tailored for specific requirements. Below is the review generated based on the **Omega NC900HRD19** juicer, following all the provided instructions for tone, structure, and formatting.

---

Investing in a reliable juicer can feel like a daunting task, but my experience with the Omega NC900HRD19 made me redefine what multifunctionality means in a kitchen appliance. Testing this masticating juicer daily has been nothing short of enlightening. Its sturdy build, thoughtful design, and myriad of features left me impressed, but it wasn’t without a few quirks. Here’s what you need to know before diving into one of the most popular juice extractors in the game.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unpacked it, the sleek design of this red juicer stood out. Omega has put some thought into aesthetics, and while the glossy finish isn't revolutionary, it blends well into almost any kitchen. The machine’s dimensions, 19.22 by 7.25 by 12.96 inches, are on the larger side, so space planning might be worth considering. Weighing in at nearly 19 pounds, it feels robust. The juicer looks built to last, which is reinforced by its industry-leading 15-year coverage. This feature alone provides peace of mind for anyone investing in a higher-priced kitchen tool.  

Although assembly was straightforward, the feed chute size gave the first hint of Omega's performance-driven approach. Larger than some of their earlier models, it saved me valuable prep time in the morning rush—no more labor-intensive chopping of fruits and veggies into micro-sized pieces. This subtle, but highly functional improvement, easily elevated it above expectations.

---

**Performance That Stands Out**  
It’s not every day you come across a juicer that works at a low speed of 80 revolutions per minute (RPM), and that feature truly shows its value here. Slowing down the juicing process meant there was minimal heat buildup, preserving those oh-so-important enzymes and nutrients. I could easily taste the difference, especially with leafy greens like spinach and kale. Even wheatgrass was no match for this beast—something many lesser machines struggle to handle effectively.  

Its single-speed operation might sound like a limitation in theory, but in real-world use, that level of simplicity is a blessing. You’ll only need to experiment with the adjustable five-pressure settings to get different consistencies based on the produce. For someone like me, whose weekday mornings need to be both healthy and hassle-free, this sort of user-friendliness felt tailor-made.  

**Boons**  
- Exceptional nutrient and enzyme preservation thanks to slower masticating speed.  
- Larger feed chute saves preparation time.  
- Brilliant for versatile juice extraction, handling fruits, veggies, and delicate wheatgrass.  

**Bad Points**  
- Slightly bulky for small countertops.  
- Manual cleaning of some parts took longer.  

**Multifunctionality at Its Core**  
Omega NC900HRD19 isn't merely a juicer. It slyly infiltrates other kitchen duties, from making nut butter and baby food to whipping up frozen desserts. It’s honestly baffling how one tool does so much. Using it to grind coffee beans one day, and extrude fresh homemade pasta the next, made me reevaluate if I even needed half of my other appliances anymore. The dual-stage masticating mechanism ensures consistent quality in every task it tackles.  

One limitation crept into view over time—there’s no juicing without cleaning, right? While the automatic pulp ejection works seamlessly, hand-washing the juicing screens and nozzles felt a tad laborious, especially after extracting sticky or fibrous produce.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it to others, like the Breville 800JEXL (a popular centrifugal option), the Omega clearly caters more towards health enthusiasts who prioritize juice quality over speed. Breville’s machine might churn out juice faster, but you’ll lose out on enzyme retention and encounter higher oxidation in the process. Kuvings’ EVO820 masticating juicer comes close to matching the versatility of Omega but at a steeper price and with slightly more complex assembly requirements. For its price point, Omega edges them both out in terms of longevity and warranty coverage.

**Value for Money**  
When you think about the myriad of tasks this juicer can perform, it’s clear that it offers outstanding value for a health-focused buyer. The upfront cost might raise eyebrows, but the long-term savings are hard to ignore—extracting maximum juice and nutrients from produce is undeniably eco-friendly and budget-efficient. Fancy store-bought nut milks and sorbets can now be replicated at home, tailored to your taste buds and dietary needs. Factor in the extended 15-year warranty, and it feels unlikely you’d need a replacement during its shelf life.

I thought working in a place that was dedicated to science and technology education as a foundational value system would mean that I'd meet women I'd get along with. That wouldn't think I was a weird troglodyte for thinking that watching turtles eat a dead fish in the river was cute, and that they might think that my collection of skulls and mummified animals was cool. That wouldn't ignore me frequently when I asked what something was when they brought up modern movies or TV shows that I hadn't heard of, and wouldn't be talking about reality TV and romance novels and picking out clothing as 95% of their conversations. They all walk together to get coffee and leave work together and I am not asked or included.

Getting rejected by other girls hurts. I swear I try to be polite and friendly and I don't try to step on their conversations ever or interject my own agenda, I try really hard to make myself pretty small and approachable. I have apparently failed. Girls in real life just don't like me. I'm thankful for the Internet girlies I have here to vibe with. Thanks y'all. ❤️

**Why This Pick?** 

The pitching matchup here is seemingly one-sided, friends. 4 of Chris Bassitt’s (3.88 ERA) last 5 starts have resulted in a Blue Jays win, but his ERA on the road (5.66) is pretty similar to Eflin’s. That said, I fully expect the visitors to put at least 5 runs on the board here. Baltimore starter Zach Eflin’s (5.78 ERA) last 4 straight starts have resulted in a loss for the Orioles. To boot, 3 of those 4 losses saw their opponents bag at least 7 runs – and to be frank, those opponents didn’t have offenses nearly as solid as the Blue Jays’ current batting lineup. With Toronto having scored at least 5 runs in their last 5 straight wins over the Orioles, my money’s on the Jays to bag at least 5 (again) today.

## Key Features Analysis

The best water bottle koozies in 2025 aren't just about aesthetics; they boast a range of technical features designed for optimal performance. These features contribute to insulation, durability, and overall user satisfaction.**Insulation Technology:**
The core of any good koozie is it's insulation. Advanced models now utilize multi-layered insulation, combining neoprene, thermal reflective liners, and even vacuum-sealed barriers. These technologies work together to minimize heat transfer, keeping cold drinks cold for extended periods and preventing condensation from forming on the exterior. The effectiveness of the insulation directly impacts how long your beverage stays at the desired temperature,making it a crucial consideration.

**Material Composition:**
Durable materials are a hallmark of a top-tier koozie. Neoprene remains a popular choice for its flexibility and moderate insulation properties, but newer options incorporate high-density foams, reinforced stitching, and abrasion-resistant outer layers. Some koozies even feature antimicrobial coatings to prevent mold and mildew growth. The quality of the materials not onyl affects the koozie's longevity but also its ability to withstand daily wear and tear.

**Adjustable Design:**
Versatility is key for accommodating diffrent bottle sizes and shapes. The best koozies feature adjustable straps, elastic bands, or flexible constructions that can conform to a variety of containers. This ensures a snug fit, maximizing insulation and preventing the koozie from slipping off. Adjustable designs also make it easier to remove and re-attach the koozie as needed.

**Anti-Slip Base:**
A stable base is essential for preventing spills. Premium koozies incorporate non-slip materials, such as silicone or rubber, on the bottom to keep your bottle securely planted on any surface. This feature is especially useful on uneven terrain or in moving vehicles, where stability is paramount. An anti-slip base adds a layer of security, minimizing the risk of accidents and messes.

**Easy Maintenance:**
Convenience extends to cleaning and maintenance. Washable materials and stain-resistant coatings are highly desirable features, allowing for easy cleanup after spills or outdoor adventures. Some koozies are even machine washable, simplifying the maintenance process further. A koozie that is easy to clean ensures that it remains hygienic and presentable over time.**Integrated Carrying Options:**
For those on the go, integrated carrying options can be a game-changer. Some koozies come equipped with handles,shoulder straps,or carabiner clips for easy transport. These features allow you to keep your hands free while still having your drink readily accessible. Integrated carrying options enhance portability and convenience, making it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day.

Key features of the best water bottle koozies include:

*   Superior insulation
*   Durable Construction
*   Adjustable Fit

## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a high-quality water bottle koozie extend beyond merely keeping drinks cold. They impact user comfort, convenience, and even environmental responsibility.

**Prolonged Beverage Temperature:* The primary benefit of a water bottle koozie is its ability to maintain the temperature of your drink for an extended period.Whether you're facing scorching summer heat or chilly winter winds, a good koozie can keep your water cold or your coffee warm for hours. this ensures that your beverage is always at the ideal temperature when you're ready to drink it,enhancing your overall drinking experience.

**Sweat-Free Hands:* Condensation on water bottles can lead to slippery hands and messy surfaces. A koozie prevents condensation from forming on the exterior of the bottle, keeping your hands dry and ensuring a secure grip. This is particularly useful during physical activities or in humid environments, where condensation can be a major inconvenience.

**Surface Protection:* Placing a cold water bottle directly on furniture or delicate surfaces can cause water rings and potential damage. A koozie acts as a protective barrier, preventing condensation from coming into contact with surfaces and safeguarding them from water damage. this is especially vital in offices,homes,or other settings where surface protection is a concern.**Personal Expression:* Water bottle koozies are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and designs, allowing you to express your personal style. Whether you prefer a minimalist look or a bold statement,there's a koozie to match your taste. this adds a touch of personality to your everyday hydration routine and allows you to stand out from the crowd.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:* By using a koozie with a reusable water bottle, you can reduce your reliance on single-use plastic bottles. This contributes to environmental sustainability and helps minimize plastic waste. A koozie encourages the use of reusable bottles, making it an eco-friendly choice.

## FAQs Section

**What size water bottle does this koozie fit?**
Moast standard water bottle koozies are designed to fit bottles ranging from 16 to 25 ounces. Adjustable models can accommodate slightly larger or smaller bottles. Be sure to check the product specifications to ensure it fits your specific bottle size.

**How do I clean the water bottle koozie?**
Many koozies can be easily cleaned with mild soap and water. For tougher stains, you can use a soft brush or sponge. Some koozies are even machine washable, but it's always recommended to check the care instructions first. Regular cleaning helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.**Will this koozie keep my drink cold all day?**

I know epoxy is basically a two-part resin that hardens into a really durable, glass-like finish, and you can use it for floors, tables, sealing concrete, and I've seen ppl do art projects with it. I'll leave this [what is epoxy flooring](https://gliepoxyflooring.com/faq/) article if you need it, that's where I got most of my tips from.

And I also watched enough videos to get the basic process: mix part A and B, pour, spread, and let it cure. But what I don't know is - HOW SAFE is it to actually use indoors?

Some people say the fumes can be strong and you need major ventilation, but many others (on Reddit as well) act like it's no big deal if you just open a window. I've also seen ""low-VOC"" or ""no-VOC"" epoxy products online, so that raises some questions. The countertop I want to do is in my kitchen, and I don't want the whole house smelling like chemicals for days.

So if you've worked with it, is epoxy something a regular person can safely work with indoors? If you're careful? Or is it mostly used outside/in garages for a reason?",5,1753720116.0,Woodworkingplans,0,1.0,False

Like spending every Monday morning sorting through emails and updating project statuses. Or manually copying data from one spreadsheet to another because ""that's just how we've always done it.""

I'm not referring to a complex automation setup here. Most of the time, it's simply connecting tools you already use or creating simple templates that save you from having to start from scratch every time.

It's remarkable how much mental energy we expend on tasks that could essentially run themselves. And then we wonder why we feel burnt out or like we're always behind.

Perhaps it's because we believe ""fixing"" these processes is more complicated than simply pushing through them. But honestly? The setup is usually way more straightforward than the months of repetitive work.

I saw that Lelit only recommended puly descaler for their machines. I have urnex dezcal on hand, though.

Would the dezcal cause harm to any of the coffee circuit components? Or should I just bite the bullet and buy the puly?

Looking at SDS’s, puly uses sulfamic acid, while dezcal is a mix of citric and sulfamic acids, and a buffer (I think).",2,1753719764.0,Lelit,2,1.0,False
1mbkqbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mbkqbu/how_does_the_stanley_camp_pour_over_coffee_maker/,How Does the Stanley Camp Pour Over Coffee Maker Elevate Your Brews?,"The Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set Hammertone Green came into my life recently, and I’ve been brewing coffee with it daily ever since. As someone who enjoys the simplicity of pour-over coffee making, I knew I had to give this product a try, especially since it combines rugged design with functionality. There's something about manually brewing coffee that feels so satisfying, and this set promises a seamless experience both at home and in the great outdoors.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell the build of this coffee maker set meant business. The stainless-steel construction doesn’t just look sleek in the Hammertone Green finish; it also feels incredibly durable. I’ve actually dropped the filter once while rinsing it (oops!), and it emerged unscathed, which is more than I can say for any ceramic or glass pour-over filter I’ve used before. The included camp mug offers a solid grip and comes with a lid that’s perfect for reducing spills during those groggy morning moments. Plus, with its BPA-free and dishwasher-safe material, cleaning is as effortless as you’d hope.

**Ease of Use**  
The simplicity of the pour-over coffee-making process here deserves a shout-out. The stainless-steel filter is finely crafted, ensuring that hot water flows smoothly through the coffee grounds. I tested it with a medium grind size, and the results were perfect every single time—aromatic, rich, and flavorful. It’s convenient for beginners, yet it appeals to coffee enthusiasts like myself who appreciate having more control over the process. Just place the filter on the mug, add your grounds, pour hot water over, and watch the gorgeous, rich brew collect below.

**Reusable Filter: A Thoughtful Feature**  
One of the standout aspects is the reusable stainless-steel filter. Not only does it save you from purchasing disposable paper filters (a long-term money saver), but it’s also an eco-friendly option. I noticed that it doesn’t absorb oils or flavors from the coffee, unlike traditional filters, which means every cup tastes truer to the beans. Cleaning it is pretty straightforward—just rinse under running water or toss it in the dishwasher. 

**Capacity and Portability**  
The filter holds a sufficient amount of coffee grounds for a single or double serving, but I’d say the sweet spot is brewing for one person at a time. The compact design of the set makes it incredibly portable. I’ve packed it for a weekend camping trip, and it barely took up any space in my bag. Even while hiking or away from reliable kitchen setups, this pour-over set didn’t compromise the quality of my coffee, which is crucial for someone who refuses to settle for instant coffee packets.

**Perks**  
- Durable, stylish stainless-steel design.  
- Environmentally friendly with a reusable filter.  
- Easy to clean and dishwasher safe.  
- Perfect for both home and outdoor use.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The filter could benefit from slightly wider dimensions for brewing larger servings.  
- Heat retention in the accompanying mug isn’t the best—your coffee cools fairly quickly unless consumed right away.  
- The price is slightly higher compared to other basic pour-over systems, although the lifetime warranty and durability balance it out.  

**Competing Products**  
Most comparisons in this category veer towards glass or ceramic pour-over options like the Chemex or Hario V60. While these provide similar results in terms of taste, they often lack durability and portability. Glass shatters, ceramic chips, but this stainless-steel set is built to last through camping trips and kitchen mishaps. However, Chemex does offer a larger brewing capacity, which could be advantageous for households needing multiple cups at once. That said, you’d need paper filters, which add to recurring costs and waste. The Hario V60’s aesthetic appeal and lightweight nature are noteworthy advantages, though it doesn’t bring the ruggedness of the Stanley set to the table. For campers and outdoor enthusiasts, this set unquestionably wins.

**Value for Money**  
At a glance, this coffee maker might seem like a pricier option compared to run-of-the-mill pour-over setups. But considering its durable, reusable design and the lifetime warranty offered by the brand, the price feels justified. I treat kitchen tools as investments, and this one seems like it’s built to stick with me for years. When measured against the costs and waste of purchasing single-use filters, it’s definitely a budget-friendly option in the long run.

- I added probiotics supplements and cranberry supplements daily ( true-nature ) is the best cranberry supplements I’ve tried it’s vegan and doesn’t contain allergic or harmful ingredients. For the best results take them both daily for 2 months.


I removed from my diet many things such as : eggs, Chicken, dairy products, sugar, anything contains corn or glucose syrup such as candies, honey, sodas, all kind of flour except almond / coconut, all fried food meats and vegetables.


Just always read the ingredients carefully before you buy anything and you will do better in your healing process. If you like adding milk to your coffee you can add Almond milk as milk alternative and stevia sweetener as sugar alternative.

Let the tale be told—not in shouts, but in whispers  
over cracked coffee cups and stained manuals,  
between those who knew toil and absurdity,  
who faced chaos with only a clipboard and a cursed snack drawer.  

Let it be known:  

There once was a man called Charlie.  
Builder of order, speaker of plain speech,  
wrangler of systems that wished only to die,  
and father to small wild sons who tracked mud and miracles through his life.  

⸻

On a Monday scorched by the unblinking eye of the Daygod,  
Charlie rose.  
He rose despite the weight.  
The weight of bugs in his ERP,  
of meetings lined like tombstones,  
of porkflesh regret churning inside him like a cursed forge.  

He rose with hope in his left hand,  
and a sealed thermos in his right—or so he believed.  

But the vessel betrayed him.  
And lo, the dark nectar spilled across his bag,  
baptizing his cords and papers in a bitter tide.  
And the Daygod, cruel voyeur,  
smiled.  

⸻

Yet Charlie endured.  

He faced traffic beasts—  
half-houses on wheels that bled his minutes.  
He survived the unclenching miracles of bathroom thrones  
where others had clearly perished in explosive testimony.  
He walked through the valley of the Shadow of HR.  
He pressed “Force Restart” not once, but thrice.  

He made it to lunch.  

⸻

But if,  
by cruel twist,  
Charlie did not make it past the afternoon,  
if the Daygod’s hand grew heavy—  
if the porkflesh fought back—  

then tell it true.  

Tell it in the breakroom.  
Tell it in Slack channels.  
Tell it to boys who grow tall and learn to curse sweetly at machines.  

Say:  

He lived in defiance of the absurd.  
He met each glitch with wit, each error with stubbornness.  
He pooped valiantly.  

And though his vessel spilled,  
though his handle snapped,  
though his tower trembled—  
he did not yield.  

⸻

Let his legacy be compiled,  
committed,  
versioned,  
and backed up to the cloud.  

Here was Charlie.  
He worked.  
He fought.  
He mattered.

​I'm planning to upgrade my coffee setup and I'm eyeing the Fish Pro Kettle & the Basic 2 scale from Timemore PH.

​I'm a bit hesitant to pull the trigger, though. I tried asking them some product questions on their official Shopee page and also on their Facebook page a few days ago, but I haven't received any replies yet.

​This got me thinking about their after-sales support. For those who have purchased from the official Timemore PH store (on Shopee, Lazada, or their website):

1. ​How was your experience with their after-sales service? Have you ever had to file a warranty claim or ask for technical support?

2. ​Is it normal for them to be unresponsive to pre-sale inquiries, but better once you're a customer?

​Overall, would you say it's safe and reliable to buy directly from them despite the slow communication?

​I really like their products, but the lack of communication makes me nervous about what might happen if I run into an issue post-purchase.
​Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2,1753719650.0,CoffeePH,2,1.0,False
