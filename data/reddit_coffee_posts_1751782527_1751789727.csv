1lsw2ym,https://i.redd.it/8qsatzcxp7bf1.jpeg,Filter coffee / powder recommendation similar to A2B,"I usually love the filter coffee from A2B (Adyar Ananda Bhavan) - strong, smooth, and perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness. I tried their packaged powder and really liked it.
Tried Costa's Specially Blend (yellow pack) and AVT but didn't enjoy the taste — they were slightly bitter and lacked the depth and flavor I'm used to.
Any recommendations for filter coffee powders with a similar taste to A2B's? Preferably available in India.
TIA

1lsw1ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1lsw1ut/looking_for_a_specific_kdrama_on_hulu_years_ago/,Looking for a specific k-drama on Hulu years ago,"Ok so I've pretty much tried to look at every source. Beginning to drive me nuts. I used to watch a melodramatic romantic tv show around the same time as the Coffee Prince & Boys Over Flower.

So the description of the show is really vague for me but for some reason I remembered a few details. It's a female lead, she was looking after the orphanage. She fell in love with the rich guy, the mother did not approve of her.

The cover of the show was the outdoor type, two people standing, looking at each other, and grasses surround them. The title says ""When..."" something. I have definitely looked this up and it's not ""When Life Give You Tangerines"". This show was in early 2000's (I wanna say 2003, maybe?) and I just cannot, for the life of me, remember. So if anyone kind of knows what I'm talking about, please do comment!

This main character has this similar hairstyle, I'm hoping this would help as well.

“I am going to see my mother and father!” Astrid demanded as she began walking toward the VIP entrance. 

“Paladan Taclis, have an escort of ten see to the princess.” Lord Herald said with a wave of his hand.

“I will see it done,” replied Paladan Taclis, who looked more like a common soldier standing against the far wall where he opened a side door and escorted Astrid out.

I sat across from the desk of the garrison commander's office, listening to Lord Herald Unthew explain the current situation. 

“The Alphardians had a coup, and their council of elders was overthrown. There are several vying for the right to become their king. The current front runner is Amroth Fergon Blue, and head of the Thranduil faction. His only claim is that he is descended from Orodreth's second consort wife. That makes him at best a junior and very distant non heir branch of the Hyborean Royal Family. In reality, Amroth is too far removed to be considered a High Elf but does have a very remote connection to King Melinir. Next is Elder Arun Oriphyra Grey Havens, who is backed by General Alfr Haldir Lothern, who is the only other legitimate rival to Amroth and one who could become king. Both are trying to prove to the populace that they are the true worthy ruler now that the Council of Elders has been disbanded. It is obvious that this coup has been simmering under the surface for some time. The fact that most of the factions hoping to become king were very organized and immediately activated long thought out plans on how they would achieve their goals. Within a day, all would be kings, but three were either defeated in battle or went into hiding. The top two factions immediately invaded our lands before news of the coup reached our king, which was successful.” Explained Lord Herald Unthwe

“I see. I heard some Alphardian soldiers mention General Alfr. They were chasing a High Elf couple but lost them.” I reported what I knew and had heard. 

“That is good. General Alfr is trying to seize land, resources, and hostages in a quick move that obviously had been planned for a significant time to achieve the goals before the move to overthrow the Council, or was done at the same time. Alphardians have been led to believe that we have been deliberately keeping them from being successful by oppressing them, as that narrative has been ongoing for a little over two cycles. The Council of Elders since it was created has basically done nothing for the people of Alphardia. It has gotten to the point that many with power and coin have hired mercenaries to exploit their own people and especially their rivals.” Lord Herald Unthwe continued his explanation of the crisis that had unfolded. 

“The Rangers who were to guard us are missing. Do you know what happened to them?” I asked as I rubbed my chin in thought. 

“Two were taken captive, and the third was able to report what happened. The Rangers seeing how outnumbered they were drew the Alphardians away from your location so that you would not be discovered. I was assured that you were safe.” Lord Herald Unthwe said with confidence. 

“Well, I did not see any Alphardians at the hut, so I guess it is as they say. Now, get to the point concerning my people. You are deliberately trying to avoid the obvious. I know several of my servants, and at least two knights were supposed to meet me this morning. What happened?” I demanded with a pointed finger and a look I hope would scare the Elf before me. 

“They were taken hostage by an overwhelming force. Shortly after that, the two  leading Alphardian factions battled one another. Each wanting to claim your ventu volpis companions. During the battle, your bodyguards were able to free your people and secure their weapons. They fought their way into the forest where they, well, disappeared. Our scouts could not follow. General Alfr seems to have won the battle, which was quite brutal. From what our scouts have relayed, General Alfr is looking for your people or more importantly, the ventu volpises.  Should either Elder Arun or Amroth get a ventu volpis under their control, they will automatically seal the deal and become the next king of Alphardia.” Lord Herald Unthwe said as he looked out the window, as he could not look me in the face.

“I see. So, my people are on the run. That is not good. Tell me, what will King Melinir do? I saw your forces holding back. In fact, your forces are only engaging in brief clashes to keep the Aphardians away from certain areas or to help those who got caught in the open.” I asked as I looked at Lord Herald Unthwe and crossed my arms.

“King Melinir has issued an ultimatum. Alphardia must withdraw from Hyborean lands by first light when Helios peaks above the horizon. If they have not withdrawn, our forces will hunt them down and either capture or eliminate them. Alphardia should know well that they are not a match for us militarily. They are craftsmen, forest keepers, farmers and fishermen. The main military of the Elvish race has always resided within the High and Dark Elves. Besides, we maintained the the university and the the nobility's original military training course.  Alpharida chose to reject those institutions in favor of the apprentice trade method of learning. However, there are many who served as levy forces in the wars against the dwarves from time to time. Those few have experience and training for war.” Lord Herald Unthwe said in a matter o fact manner. 

“I see. I was told as much from a very old Alphardian named Quarrin Greenwood Blue. By the way, I also met an Elf who claimed to be Herald to King Melinir named, what was his name again? Ah, yes,  Ecborne.” I replied to Lord Herald Unthwe's explanation of the political dynamics between Hyborea and Alphardia. 

“Yes, Herald Ecborne is a common messenger herald, where I am the official Lord Herald for King Melinir and the Court of Hyborea. Ecborne relays basic messages, invitations, and routine errands. Whereas, I speak the direct words of the King in diplomatic or royal personal matters. ” Lord Herald Unthwe said with beaming pride and full of self worth.

I thought for a moment that Lord Herald Unthwe was just a basic common political press secretary whose sole job was relay information from King Melinir to other nobles or countries. Not exactly a high position. I then quickly looked at Lord Herald Unthwe seriously.

“I see. Well, tomorrow I will venture out to find my companions and people. Since I am bonded to Pamba and Todd, I am pretty certain I know where they generally are.” I said as I rubbed my hands together and ended with a smirk. 

“I thought as much. I am fairly certain King Melinir will have a thousand soldiers accompany you as he has already considered this and what you would do. I will inform King Melinir of your decision and will let you know what time is best for departure.  I believe you will want to wait at the very least a span after first light to allow our main forces to clear out any Alphardians who were foolish enough not to heed our good King's warning.” Lord Herald Unthwe said with a chuckle and a big smile. 

“Very good. Now, if you would be so kind as to have someone escort me to my lady wife, I would be most grateful.” I requested with a nod of my head.

“It would be my pleasure to escort you to the palace. I will have a couple of Rangers see to your florses and carry your things. Come, I will show you the way.” Lord Herald Unthwe said with a big smile.

I followed Lord Herald Unthwe through a side passage that emptied onto a broad street that ran along the north side of the garrison where an awaiting simple two wheel carriage was waiting. I was quickly escorted to the palace in about thirty minutes, as the city streets were choked with soldiers.  At the palace, I was taken immediately to the rooms I had occupied before. The exception to the previous stay was a good three dozen High Elf guards stationed as guards to my rooms. 

“I am certain King Melinir will wish to speak with you as well as dine with you. Remember that your wards and knights are welcome but the rest must remain in this wing. Anyone caught wondering about could be taken to the cells.” Lord Herald Unthwe cautioned before he bowed and took his leave. 

“I understand. I will let my people know.” I replied with a nod and entered the hallway to my rooms.

Walking into my room, I saw Astrid sitting in one of the high-backed chairs clearly unhappy with a very sour look on her face. 

“What is wrong, sweetie?” I asked as I walked over to Astrid, taking her right hand in mine. 

“My personal servants and maids were taken captive. I do not have any trained servants who knows my wishes and needs.” Astrid complained in an exasperated outburst.

“They are no longer captive if I understood correctly. I believe all those with my people escaped and are currently in hiding. I will rescue them tomorrow.  Do not worry, I generally know where they are. So, rest easy. “ I said, hoping to comfort Astrid, who was visibly shaken by the events of the day.

“You are certain?” Astrid asked near almost to tears, at hearing my news.

“Lord Herald Unthwe gave me the full story of what happened and your father's response. So, be at ease at the moment. They are free for the time being. Before I forget, I was informed that we will be summoned to speak with your father and then dine with your family. You should prepare. If you need things from your rooms, you should have servants bring them to you.” I advised Astrid while touching her cheek to calm her nerves.

Astrid quickly went to inform the Elf guards that she needed servants and to retrieve belongings from her former room as a princess. While she was gone, I saw to my own constitutional needs. Looking through my traveling box that carried my additional supplies, I found extra bars of soap and sandalwood scented oil. I quickly washed up with Stephan's help, where he helped to apply the sandalwood scented oil. Since I had been a bit ripe after the long journey, Sandalwood would cover for my lack of a full bath.  Rana came in with my red and black Zorro-like outfit and helped me dress. Since Gus and Lukas were on the run from the Alphardians and had my razor and grooming items, I had to forgo shaving.  I was sporting visible standing beard stubble as I had not shaved in almost four days. I shrugged as I realized there was nothing I could do about it. However, this situation made me realize I needed to have a spare grooming kit that I could keep separate for emergencies or situations like I was in.

After I was cleaned up and fully dressed, I went into the sitting room and waited. A short time latter, Astrid returned with four servants and a stream of guards carrying her luggage that had been packed and ready before our wedding. Astrid then saw to her own constitutional as she had a formal bath drawn. I quickly gave Astrid the bar of soap I had used, as Elves, from what I could tell, used a small pink to purple five-petalled flowers that they chopped up from root to flowers before grinding them up. They then steep the plant in hot water then pressing and squeezing out a greenish clear liquid. They use this as a soap. It works but nowhere as good as the soap I had made that was scented with lavender. I also found lavender scented oil, which I handed to one of the serving High Elves who looked at the glass bottle like it was full of poison. I gave the single instruction to put a little on their hands and wipe down Countess Astrid with the warning to not use too much. With that, I returned to the sitting room to brood about the day's events and what I had to do.

A little over an hour later, a messenger came to inform me that King Melinir requests Astrid and I to join the royal family for dinner and I was to come immediately. I was expressly told it was a closed affair. However, my Wards were welcome as I was their guardian. With that, I went to speak with Illya and Rina who were looking a bit worried. However, I reassured them all would be well. I had them prepare for immediate departure as I would return with Lady Astrid shortly.

Within twenty minutes with Astrid on my arm, we followed the messenger with Illya and Rina in tow with Lorna, Stephan and an Elf servant chosen by Astrid to assist her at dinner. We traveled to a part of the palace I had not seen before, which was up on the third floor. However, the floor plan was definitely different from the second floor. What would be just off the stairs from my rooms to the third floor were two doors. The door to the right was open to an obvious dining room or informal meeting room. The door to the left had several guards before it.  

“Ah, Count Wyatt and my darling daughter Astrid, please come in and have a seat here to my left.” King Melinir welcomed with a broad smile that did not reach his eyes. 

“Thank you, father,” I replied as I greeted the king.

King Melinir seemed amused by my greeting as he sat at the head of the table. To his immediate left, was Queen Ayrenn, then First Prince Tyrion, and finally a very young looking Elf girl to his left.  

“It is a pleasure to see you this evening. Let me introduce my wife, Countess Astrid Wyatt and my Wards Illya and Rina Svarta Wendu.” I formally introduced Astrid and my wards to the raised eyebrows of all present.

“My such formality.” King Melinir replied with a slight smirk and smile. 

“Who might this young lady be? I do not believe we have been formally introduced. I am Count Ryan Wyatt.” I introduced myself to the young Elf girl who seemed very shocked at my direct address.

“Ah, yes. My daughter Princess Andriel Hyborea Borealis. She is just twelve cycles old. She now takes up the position Lady Astrid held. Andriel until the day you bonded with Astrid, was in the care of nursemaids. Now, Andriel must take up the position she holds even at her exceptionally young age.” King Melinir said with a cool and direct statement while looking Princess Andriel in the eye.

“It is a pleasure to formally meet you, Princess Andriel. Perhaps you can come for a visit at my home in Astria at Greystone Manor.” I said with a gentle smile.

“Yes, that would be lovely. Perhaps Andriel can in a couple of years.” Astrid said as she grasped my hand in hers with a slight tug of warning.

“Yes, when Princess Andriel and King Melinir feel the time is right and it is safe for such journeys.” I quickly added as both the King and Queen looked a bit concerned with the invitation. 

“I think it will be a few of years before Andriel can make such journeys.” King Melinir said with finality as he gave a look that hinted at the end of this topic.

“No invite for me?” Asked Prince Tirion who seemed to be pouting. 

“Of course, you are also welcome. I thought that was clearly understood. After all, you are my brother in law.” I replied with a smile.

The King brought his fist down on the table with a small thud sound, which brought a downcast look from Prince Tirion. The Queen immediately ordered the meal to be served as there was an awkward silence that had fallen. The meal was a vegetarian's delight in three general courses. The first was an herb medley salad of sorts that was pretty good. The second course was a mushroom and leek soup with wafers of Elvin bread. The last course was steamed herb and vegetables in a buttery sauce. All in all pretty good given there was no meat or major protein in the meal.

The meal passed with very little conversation, which I had come to expect given my time with King Melinir. I understood that meal time was for eating not for talking with the Hyboreans. However, they do love to talk when most others would rather relax. I considered this oddity as I had finished my meal and was sitting quietly sipping on the nice dry white wine, and just covertly looked around the table to judge what the others deemed normal.

“Clear the table.” Queen Ayrenn ordered the serving staff to look around the table in a blatant manner and seeing all had finished eating.

After about five to ten minutes, with the dinner table cleared and wiped down where needed, the staff retreated. A new group of male servants came with a wine barrel and poured a nice pink-looking wine into a serving pitcher. What appeared as newly crafted white pristine ceramic or porcelain goblets where brought and everyone had their cup filled.

“To the future!” King Melinir toasted with a slightly raised cup.

“The future,” I replied and lifted my cup in response.  

No one else at the table said anything, but they all raised their cups and drank. After the toast, King Melinir looked at his family for a good five minutes. I could tell the king had something on his mind, but did not really want to talk about it.  So, I decided to break the ice so to speak.

“Father, would you rather I call you Melinir or something else?” I said and paused with a raised eyebrow as I looked at the king.

I could hear a sharp intake of breath, but I was not sure if it was from the Queen or Tirion.

“Either is fine. However, when I am on the throne and doing my royal duties, then address me as King Melinir.” King Melinir said as he nodded toward me. 

“Understood. I thank you.,” I replied as I  leaned forward and put my elbows on the table with my chin resting on my clasped hands.

“Tirion, do you understand what Count Wyatt just did? It is important. What did he do?” Asked King Melinir of his son the first prince. 

Silence passed quickly as my mind raced as to what I may have done wrong.  I was beginning to sweat thinking that I had broken some sort of taboo protocol. 

“I am not certain, Father. Forgive me.” Prince Tirion replied to King Melinir with downcast eyes. 

“You need to pay more attention, boy. Your manners have been atrocious. Count Wyatt inquired about his place and protocol in forms of address. He was making sure no offense would occur. This is how a proper noble conducts himself when in a foreign land. Ryan made sure to verify what his position is and the correct protocol in forms of address. You blunder and just say the wrong things and causing a diplomatic incident and offense despite being taught and told what is expected. Ryan just verified his proper position with our family and how he should address us. Ryan, your brother-in-law, introduced your sister Astrid as Countess Astrid Wyatt. Yes, Astrid is also a Hyborean princess. However, her official title is that of a Countess. When in Hyborea, she can be called Princess or Countess. Outside our kingdom, she is Countess Astrid. Do you understand now?” Asked King Melinir in a fatherly teaching moment tone that was awkward to witness by others in the room.

Leaning over to Astrid, I asked in a very quiet, whispered voice in her left ear, “ How old is your brother?”

Astrid leaned over and just as quietly whispered in my right ear, “Sixteen cycles come vetr.” 

“Yes, my son is very young and still a little child. Though by human standards, he is almost an adult by age alone. However, all Elves live long lives. When an Elf turn thirty cycles , he will choose his life's path and will pursue that path until he becomes an acknowledged full adult upon their fiftieth cycle. How one pursues their path is how they are judged by our society. Bad choices lead to society seeing those individuals as a failure or disappointment. The choices one makes effect how ones  life's path unfolds to an easy or difficult life.” King Melinir said, looking at me briefly before staring hard at Prince Tirion as he gave his little lecture that was really directed at the prince.

“I promise to work harder and do better,” Prince Tirion answered meekly with his head downcast and pouting.

“It takes more than hard work or just doing better. You must dedicate yourself to your studies and train your body. Tirion, you are my heir. You must live up to the standard or be rejected as one worthy of the throne. Now, more than ever, it is important to train your body and mind so that you do not waste time later trying to catch up to where you should be when you enter the university and its military academy curriculum. I also wish to send you for ten cycles to the Quenya's military academy school where you will be an elite in military sciences, tactics, and weapons use.” King Melinir said as he softened his tone.

“I will do better, father,” Prince Tirion replied once more while still looking down  at his hands in his lap. 

Queen Ayrenn motioned to the servants, who brought a small dish that reminded me of an Earth dish from France. It was a flan desert topped with berries and what looked like caramel. However, when I tasted it, the sauce was a maple-flavored syrup that had been reduced and thickened. After about ten minutes of silence while eating this delightful dish, and the table cleared once again, I decided I needed to take charge.

“King Melinir, I will be heading out in the morning to rescue and retrieve my people. I roughly know where they are or more specifically, I know where Pamba and Todd my companions, are. I plan to head out with my people who can fight. I was hoping you would look after those who can not come with me. Will you accept my request?” I asked with humility and a deeply bowed head that nearly touched the top of the table as I was seated.

“Very well. I will have fifteen hundred soldiers accompany you and five hundred Rangers. Lord Herald Unthwe informed me not long after your arrival in Borealis of your plans.” Answered King Melinir with a neutral look on his face.

“I thank you from the bottom of my heart. In my absence, my Lady Countess Astrid, will oversee and direct my people who remain here in Borealis and insure that my Wards are kept doubly safe.” I announced and saw the look of shock not only on Astrid's face but King Melinir's as well.

“Well, yes. I will make certain my daughter, your wards, and people are kept safe until your return.” King Melinir said as he seemed slightly disturbed at my request as the ramifications of such a request were clear.

It was after I left the dining room with Astrid on my arm that it hit me what my request actually meant and the fallout should things go bad. I shook my head and realized I now had a debt I must repay, given the shortsighted request I had made. However, what was done is done. I decided it was better to owe a debt rather than have disaster befall my people while I was away, no matter how remote the possibility was.

That night, after I had bathed, I went to bed early. Astrid joined me a bit later and I hugged her to me as  we spooned as we both slept very contently though I was missing Pamba and Todd.

I heard the city bells ringing as I opened my eyes the following morning. Looking over to the window I saw dawn had yet to break as it seemed still fairly dark. Getting up and stretching, I went to the window and looked out onto the city, which I could see a few streets as the bluish purple pink sky off in the east was just beginning to show. There were not many people about, but I saw plenty of soldiers running up the street toward the garrison illuminated by glow stones at the different palace gates. Just when I was about to go back to bed for a bit, a knock came at my door. 

“Lord Wyatt, General Taclis requests your presence. He would like you to meet the commanders of the soldiers who will accompany you.” Announced Stephan who looked a bit bug-eyed seeing me naked next to the bed.

“Very well. Have Rana fetch me my clothes that I wear for battle. Have water heated so I can wash up then inform my knights to ready themselves for departure within the hour.” I ordered as I stretched, then headed to take care of my constitutional. 

Thirty minutes later, with Stephan's and Rana's help, I was fully dressed. Luckily, Rana brought me my first pair of boots that I found in the abandoned merchant's cart. They were still a bit tight, but would do.   
I had Stephan pull out my armor, and I began putting it on in the dressing room when Sir Guntar and Sir Cleef arrived and helped me with the bulkier and more difficult parts of my heavy armor. 

A little over an hour from the time  I received the summons, I was walking down the stairs with Sir Guntar and Sir Cleef with Beowulf, Leon and Karhu as I exited the palace. My second carriage and a cart were waiting with Doug the driver and  Raulo who would be driving an extra long covered cart.  Beowulf rode in the Tiger perch of my carriage while Leon and Karhu rode in the cart. Sir Cleef rode with Doug, and Sir Guntar rode with Raulo on the long cart.

A short time later, at the garrison, I was admitted into General Taclis' office with Sir Guntar and Beowulf as my escort. Sir Cleef  was charged to get all my soldiers billeted at the garrison ready to move out and fully kitted for battle, as well as arranging the rest of my noncombatant servants to report to Astrid post haste for direction and duties.

“Count Wyatt, it is good to see you this day. Please have a seat while tea and sweet bread is served.” General Taclis greeted as he stepped away from his desk and over to a social area with two sofas opposite one another, with a coffee table in between. 

“Thank you, General Taclis. I hope you are well this morning.” I replied as I followed General Taclis to the two green colored sofas and took a seat. 

“Yes, I am well enough. I will be leaving after this meeting to clear out the Alphardians if they dared to remain after the warning King Melinir issued. 

“I see. Good to know.” I replied as I accepted a cup of tea from one of General Taclis's adjutants. 

General Taclis took a seat and motioned for another person behind me to have a seat next to him and facing me. 

“Let me introduce Paladin Glorfindel Golden Flower Valar. He carries the esteemed name of his grandfathers grandfather the greatest High Elf warrior of all time. Lord Glorfindel commands the five hundred Royal Rangers escorting you.” Introduced General Taclis with a smile with a tone of high respect to the Paladin.

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Paladin Glorfindel,” I replied with a smile and a nod of my head.

“I am honored to ride with you in your honorable mission.” Paladin Glorfindel said with a formal salute and bow in the custom of humans from Astria before he took a seat next to General Taclis.

“This is Paladin Elthar Salendor Nyr-Lindor, who will command the regular soldiers who will accompany and help you should Alphardians insist on attacking and battling you.” General Taclis continued his introduction of the High Elf who stood to my right.

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Paladin Elthar,” I replied to the Paladin with the same smile and nod I had given earlier to Paladin Glorfindel.

“I am honored to be of assistance to Count Wyatt. I have witnessed your deeds and leadership first hand..” Paladin Elthar answered with a deep bow and a serious warrior look and also took a seat next to me.

“Do you know which direction you will be heading once you leave Borealis? I ask as it will determine where I will deploy the first of my units.” General Taclis asked as he took a cup of tea from his adjutant.

“I will generally be heading north. I will go east out of the south gate and continue generally north of the city. I will adjust my direction the closer I get to my  bonded companions. They should also be attuned to my location, and hopefully, my people will follow their lead. Then again, they may be in hiding or surrounded. I do not think they have moved since I learned of their plight and escape.” I answered honestly as I set my cup down on the coffee table and looked at each High Elf in the eye.

“Understood. I will send the first three Corps to the north. The First Corps will head north for about twenty five to thirty milos before heading east to Riverdale. They will reinforce our forces before moving on to Strongbow. We must be certain that the cities of Blue and Strongbow are well protected and patrols reinforced after the cowardly invasion of Mardor. The Second Corps will continue north to secure Maplewood forest and our border with Alphardia. The Third corps which is our main force will head north northwest to secure the City of Maplewood and the Western Maplewood Forest and our northern border. The Western fifth Corps will head down the main road to Maplewood and on to Gondolin to secure the river crossing to our lands west of the Green River where they will reinforce our coastal cities. The Fourth Corps will head west to secure everything  west of Borealis to our border  along the headwaters of  the Limelight River down to the outlet of The Lake of Light.” General Taclis announced as he openly outlined his plan of action of where he was deploying his forces. 

“I see. I hope I have not upset any plans that could cause you trouble later on?” I asked General Taclis as I know I was getting more then just courtesy assistance.

“No major change in plans. The First Corps will basically scout ahead of where you will be going. If they find Alphardian's then they will deal with the issue. Should they find your people, they will have a detachment to escort them back to Borealis.” General Taclis responded with a shrug of his shoulders.

“I see.” I answered and decided it was best to keep my mouth shut in times like this.

“If no one has any questions, then I will see you back here when our missions are complete.” General Taclis said as he stood up and giving his subordinates and my self a hard long look. Nodding, General Taclis motioned for all to follow him out of the office.

Thirty minutes later I was standing before my men as the last of the High Elf warriors headed out save the garrison soldiers and the two thousand assigned to me as escort with General Taclis leading the Third Corps of Rangers and soldiers which nearly half were bowmen. 

After the High Elf units had left the garrison, I saw Paladin Elthar speaking to another High Elf dressed similarly as himself. Walking over as I was curious and could not resist given the how tight lipped High Elves could be wanted to know who he was. After all, High Elves may talk but not all of what they say is useful for understanding what they are doing.

“Count Wyatt, I am glad you are here. Let me introduce my cousin Paladin Carrick Aeone Ravens Bluff. He is Vice Commander of the Royal Seventh Corps and Royal Order under Greve Therberon Cynebald Hiddenwood who is assigned to guard the Capital under the current crisis.” Introduced Paladin Ethar with a broad smile. 

“I am Count Ryan Wyatt of Astria. It is nice to meet you Captain, er, ah,  Paladin Carrick.” I introduced myself as I held out my hand which Paladin Carrick after a pause reluctantly shook my hand.

“Yes, nice to meet you. Just so you know, I am not like Greve Therberon who disrespected you. I was there but only saw the after effect of what was done. King Melinir was so angry that he yelled for a good span then yelled some more later that night.” Paladin Carrick disclosed with an embarrassed expression. 

“No worries. Water under the bridge now. Besides, you did not disrespect or insult me.” I answered with a smile.

“I am so glad.” Paladin Carrick replied with a look of relief. 

“What can I do for you Count Wyatt?” Asked Paladin Elthar who looked at me expectantly.

“I would like to have the men assembled as I wish to give them a briefing. Should we go into battle, I need you and your men to understand how my people and I do battle. The last thing I want to see  is your men getting injured or killed if they get between me and any enemy. My attacks have considerable range and very deadly. Like an arrow, once loosed it can not be pulled back. Should someone suddenly move in the arrow's path well you get the idea.” I explained as I shrugged my shoulders while flicking my head as an expression of “Oh Well”.

“Very good. I will have our men assembled right away.” Replied Paladin Elthar with a quick salute and headed off calling out for his men.

About forty minutes later, all of Paladin Elthar's and Paladin Glorfindel's men were assembled in three  squares with my people forming the final group completing the square around me. I lectured the High Elves about never getting in front of me unless I specifically ordered it for their safety. Paladin Glorfindel and his Rangers who made up the square to my left murmured softly but other than that it was quiet.

“Alright, let's move out,” I ordered as I went over to my florse Rusty and quickly mounted. 

Sir Guntar took charge and began giving orders as to where my people were to be. Paladin Elthar quickly went to his florse and mounted which he called for the soldiers to begin moving out with him in the lead. Paladin Glorfindel quickly mounted his florse and motioned for his men who fell in close behind my men as we exited out of the garrison and out the southern gate.

After we were outside the city,  Paladin Glorfindel led the Rangers in a gallop to get a head of me by about twenty yards before slowing down. We proceeded around the City of Borealis and finally entered into the local forest. The forest was generally quiet save a few sounds which I considered disconcerting given I was from earth were animals make lots of noise.

We continued moving north for about an hour before I spurred Rusty to quickly catch up with Paladin Glorfindel.

“Paladin Glorfindel, please wait,” I shouted with a waving arm to get the Ranger' Captain's attention. 

Paladin Glorfindel put up a hand and stopped and just sat waiting for me to approach. 

“I will be moving northwest as I am certain that is where I need to go. If you would not mind, could your Rangers take up a screening position?” I asked after giving my order of change of direction. 

“Very Well,”  Paladin Glorfindel replied and immediately began giving orders for the Rangers to move off to the east in a screening flanking maneuver.

I continued moving deeper into the forest as time past. As it was approaching mid afternoon and I was about to call a halt for rest and something to eat, I felt it. Then suddenly I heard a voice in my head that said, “We are here.”

I called a halt and looked off into the trees where I saw Sir Jas and Razor walking toward me. I dismounted and relief flowed over me.

“Sir Guntar, have the cart brought up and have water and food ready for our people.” I ordered as I smiled as my hands shook with obvious relief. 

Twenty minutes later, I was reunited with my people who looked exhausted. Astrid's servants looked forlorn but seemed to be in better physical shape than my people. We set up camp to allow the rescued to get something to eat and drink as well as rest a bit. 

“I am sorry Lord Wyatt. The Alphardians took your carriage. It was taken away in a different direction than we were taken. If it was not for the ambush of other elves, we would most likely be prisoners in Ardu. Razor was the hero of the day. None of us would be here without his bravery and taking out our guards with quick efficiency.”  Sir Jas reported after he had something to eat and drink. 

“I understand. Things happen that sometimes are out of our control. I am just overly relieved and extremely happy that you are all safe. All are safe or did anyone get hurt or worse?” I asked as I considered the possibility of the worst possible outcome for my people. 

“Everyone is alright but tired. Thank you My Lord.” Sir Jas replied as I could he let his breath out and I could see him relaxing and nearly collapse from exhaustion. 

“Razor, I am extremely happy and glad you are a valued member of my house.” I said loud enough for everyone to hear while I lightly pounded my right fist against his broad muscular chest.

“I am most honored, Lord Wyatt. I have almost no words to give how I feel at this moment. You have always treated me and my kind very well. We have never lacked for anything. Now, I see you are truly relieved and concerned for our health and safety. It is almost more than my heart can stand.” Razor answered and then sniffed before making a strange deep mewing sound.

I realized that Razor was actually crying in the manor which his kind could only do. With one more light strike with my fist on his chest, I turned to walk away to allow my proud bodyguard to let his emotions out without reproach or scrutiny. 

“Lord Wyatt, I do not know how to say this. Pamba and Todd went missing during our escape. I do not know where they are. They both ran away after Beowulf broken them out of their cage.” Explained Gus as he dropped to his hands and knees and just bowed before me. 

“I see. Well, its not so doom and gloom as you think. Pamba, Todd come!” I answered Gus then quickly turn and called out to my companions as I looked off to the west. 

Everyone just stare at me as only silence seemed to answer me. After about a minute, there was a faint yipping, high laughing barking and que que sounds that began to be heard. The sounds grew louder and to everyone's surprise Pamba and Todd burst out of the dense forest running and leaped into my arms. I hugged Pamba and Todd as they made whimpering sounds between enthusiastic licks to my face. I just knelt down and allowed my emotional joy to overflow. Looking around, I saw Alice crying in relief with Tiana comforting her with Jace my carriage driver standing close by.

It was about two hours after rescuing my people Pamba and Todd, I was leading everyone back south. I had all my people load up in the long cart that normally was used to transport a large squad of soldiers. Gus once again was looking after Pamba and Todd as there was not enough room for me to ride in the cart and I still had not requested a pouch made for them to ride on a florse. The trip back to Borealis was quite jovial and I could hear my people singing as they too were happy and realized what could have been.  

As I passed through the southern gates of Borealis and on into the garrison, I wondered how I would get my carriage back. After all, there was my hidden compartment and the money chest that was hidden there. I frowned and realized there was no good options. Well, maybe there was just one thing I could do. I shrugged as I dismounted where my people were given their orders for the evening and dismissed. The High Elves did likewise soldiers moved about to seek their preferred comforts. Likewise, I headed back to the palace with my knights, bodyguards, Gus, Stephan, Tiana and Alice with me with the rest of my people back to their billeted rooms. 

Back at the palace, I sent a message to King Melinir to begged off the evening meal with the Royal family as I wanted to have a personal celebratory dinner with all of my people. Plus, I wanted to hear every detail of what had happened and every heroic deed done and by whom. I also wanted some one on one time with Astrid, Pamba and Todd that I knew would sooth my soul after the emotional roller coaster and feelings of dread. I had undergone. I just wanted time to mellow out and just be happy.",1,1751789052.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1lsvxvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaliTravelTips/comments/1lsvxvz/travel_tips_for_indians_full_guide/,Travel Tips for Indians [Full Guide],"I recently completed a 12-day trip to Bali (mainly Ubud and Canggu). One of the main issues I faced while planning was the lack of resources specifically for Indian travellers. 



So I’m putting everything I wish I knew before the trip in one place.



The Basics:

a) Visa
Visa on arrival is available for Indians, but my advice is to just get the e-visa beforehand. It costs ₹2,774 for a 30-day visa.


Link - https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/web/application_voa



You’ll get it within an hour on your email.


Only your passport scan is required - no need for hotel or flight bookings.

When you land in Bali, there’s a long queue for immigration. 



Took me nearly an hour - not because the process is long (the stamping takes 30 seconds), but because only two counters were open.


Indians can’t use the e-gates, so just find the long queue and get in it. That’s the one.



b) Customs
Customs form link - https://ecd.beacukai.go.id/
You can only fill it 3 days before your flight - not earlier.


A QR code will be sent to your email. You’ll need to scan that at the customs counter after immigration.



c) Flights
I took the direct IndiGo flight from Bengaluru to DPS - Bali (6.5 hours). Paid ₹41,000 round trip.


Didn’t want to waste time with layovers in KL or Singapore (most other options have 8 - 9 hour layovers).


The seats aren’t very comfortable. Don’t fall for IndiGo’s XL seat - it’s just front row with more legroom, not wider seats. Total scam.



Best food tip - pre-book the dal chawal. It’s the ready-to-eat kind, but one of the best I’ve had.



d) IDP (International Driving Permit)
I didn’t get one. RTO agents in Bengaluru asked for ₹4,500.


DIY costs ₹1,000 but needs multiple trips and some bribes.


I didn’t have the time or energy so decided I’ll “shake hands” with the Bali cops if needed.


In 12 days, I wasn’t stopped even once in Ubud or Canggu. Rode around freely.



e) Currency
Carry USD from India - Credit Card charges are a bit expensive (mine was 1.5%)


Avoid converting at the Bali airport - the rates are terrible. You’ll find exchange shops everywhere outside.


They ask for passport or Indian DL for verification. Takes 2 minutes.
100,000 IDR = ₹500 (roughly)



Don’t convert everything in one go - that’ll be too many notes. I converted small amounts every few days.



I carried $600 and didn’t end up using all of it.


Whatever USD you have left, don’t exchange it at Indian airports - total scam. 



They offer a bad rate, add hidden conversion charges, and don’t tell you any of this upfront.


I lost ₹2,500 converting $150 at Bengaluru airport.



f) Local Transport
Grab is your best friend - for food delivery, scooter taxis, car taxis, groceries, everything.



Tried Grab scooter on day 1 - ₹80 for a short ride (~2 km).


From day 2, I rented my own scooter - ₹300/day for 10 days.


Petrol is dirt cheap - ₹200 for a full tank (4L). I didn’t need to refill the whole trip.



Scooter rentals are super chill - no inspection, no blaming you for scratches like Goa/Pondicherry.


No license or IDP needed - just a copy of your passport.



g) Gym
Went to Ubud Fitness Center - ₹1,500 for a 7-day pass.


Vintage equipment but works fine.



h) Accommodation
Stayed at Paon Desa Hotel in Ubud - ₹25,000 for 10 days.


Big room, balcony, daily cleaning, pool access. Staff is helpful.


Booked via Agoda. Good location and value.



i) Food
Favourites in Ubud:

Mango Cafe
Kalos
Clear Cafe
The Barn
Avoid Madhuban - the Indian food was terrible.


Don’t eat from random local street vendors (like shawarma stalls) - high risk of falling sick.



Favourites in Canggu:

Zins
Nude Cafe (not what you think)
Food is reasonably priced. A solid omelette with toast + smoothie was around ₹600 - and the quality was great.



j) Medicines
Carry your own favourite meds - hard to find exact ones there.



k) Water
Some restaurants don’t serve regular water. They try to sell fancy bottles (500 ml for ₹300). Not worth it.



l) Shopping
Honestly, most stuff is junk. I got some tote bags and T-shirts for friends, that’s it.



Always bargain - they quote absurd prices upfront expecting you to negotiate.



m) Kopi Luwak
Most “premium” coffee in the world (don’t Google how it’s made). Overrated, but worth trying once.



n) Sightseeing
I was on a workation, so didn’t explore too much:



i) Cantik Agriculture
Kopi Luwak plantation - short free tour + 13 tea/coffee samples for free.
You only pay if you try the actual Luwak coffee (₹250). It’s okay. 



I bought many teas and coffees (mangosteen, turmeric, coconut) to take home.



ii) Tirtha Empul
Famous temple with a water ritual to cleanse sins.


Highly recommend getting a guide (₹500) - they’ll explain the process and also take 100s of photos for you.



iii) Manuaba Waterfall
Nice experience - there are two waterfalls and it’s not very crowded.



iv) Canggu Beach
Average beach, poorly maintained. Kerala beaches are better.


Surfing is available. Some decent beachside cafes.



v) Clubs/pubs
Went to a few, but won’t review here - they’re all easy to find on Google.



o) Duty Free
Not worth it for alcohol. Prices were better in Bengaluru duty free.


Also, the duty-free shop in Bali was sketchy - I reserved 2 bottles online and they claimed both were out of stock at checkout.


Price on the shelf didn’t match the final invoice - apparently the offer “wasn’t valid”. Skipped it.



p) Power Converter
Don’t rely on fancy global converters - most don’t work properly.

Just buy a local one in Bali - I got mine for ₹100 and it worked fine.



q) Mobile Network
I took the Airtel international roaming plan - ₹800 for 10 days, comes with 3 GB data and 200 minutes of calls.


Didn’t need to buy a local SIM. Had WiFi everywhere I went, so barely used mobile data - still had 1.3 GB left at the end of the trip.


Worked perfectly throughout Bali. No issues.

I’m a 27 year old from India, recently moved to Abu Dhabi for work. I was previously living and working in Dubai, but just shifted here for a new opportunity. It’s been an exciting change, but I’ll admit, I don’t really know many people here yet, and it’s starting to feel a bit quiet.

I’m hoping to connect with some like-minded people in the city who are open to getting to know someone new and maybe building a solid friendship over time.

A bit about me:

I love exploring cafes and trying out new coffee spots or dessert joints.

I enjoy reading fiction, especially thrillers or emotionally deep stories.

Always down to visit local events, town festivals, or cultural spots. I really enjoy soaking in the vibe of the city.

I also hit the gym occasionally, mostly to clear my head rather than chase six-pack dreams lol

I’m not a super extrovert by nature, and making friends IRL has always been a bit of a struggle for me, especially in a new city. So, I figured I’d give Reddit a shot and see if I could find people who vibe with me here.

If you’re someone who's open to chatting, maybe grabbing coffee, or just sharing recs and random convos online to start with, hit me up! Always great to meet people who are kind, chill, and not afraid of a little small talk turning into a deep conversation.

Cheers! ✌️

I eat enough sodium and potassium. I don’t really feel tired at least so far. 

I’ve been planning on doing keto but the foods I eat I end up around 35-45g net carbs. The reason why is because my diet consists of lots of salad, dressing, pre cooked chicken breast, some days I’ll have lavash bread and make a a chicken wrap, eggs and lastly because of sugar free coffee creamer.

I know that I shouldn’t have this or that and whatever but these foods are what make low carb possible for me. They make it easy, convenient, easy to prepare , and this way I have the perfect amount of electrolytes (sodium/magnesium) without needing to measure lite salt before the gym because I feel so drained or without having to buy expensive ketoade. Especially because of the pre cooked chicken breast. 

Plus I just know if I eat just meat, cheese, and force feeding myself fat, based on my experience it does not keep me as satiated as i’d like. But with these foods genuinely make low carb easy for me. My question is, how likely am I to stay in ketosis ranging from 35-45g carbs? My activity level isn’t consistent.
It just seems like low carb is so easy I might as well just do keto if I can.  But how will I know if 35-45g will get me and keep me in ketosis? 

Again so far I feel fine but it’s only been like 4 days. ",4,1751788657.0,keto,7,0.83,False

1lsvtu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lsvtu4/my_break_up_hurts_like_hell/,My Break Up - hurts like hell,"

I’m a 35-year-old man, and last October, I met a woman (30) who I really connected with. For the first few months, we kept things casual, but eventually I asked if we could be exclusive. We shared some wonderful experiences together, including trips around Southeast Asia and Europe. We spent a lot of time together because we had similar interests and lifestyles.

Over time, I fell in love with her. About four weeks ago, I told her how I felt and also suggested she spend more time at my place. I even cleared out half my closet to make space for her.

A bit about me: I’m very social and have always had lots of friends, including women. I find it easy to talk to women, and in the past, I struggled with unresolved childhood trauma that made me seek validation from women—often through sex. I’ve worked hard to improve and set boundaries. I don’t cheat or go out with other women, but I do sometimes send flirty texts for an ego boost. I know this isn’t right, and I’m working on it.

After about two weeks of being a more serious couple, she found some flirty messages between me and a coworker on my laptop. The messages were suggestive, but nothing ever happened between us—they were just empty plans for coffee or drinks that I never intended to follow through on.

When she saw the messages, she packed up her things in less than half an hour, destroyed all our photos in my apartment, blocked me everywhere, and sent me a harsh message telling me to leave her alone.

I tried reaching out to explain, but she didn’t respond. I sent a few emails, and eventually got a very negative reply three days later.

Desperate to talk, I went to her place (I still had a key), but she locked herself in the bathroom and screamed at me. One of her friends arrived within ten minutes and escorted me out.

A few hours later, a mutual friend called and told me not to contact her again or she would take legal action.

I was devastated. I took a week off work and flew home to be with my family. It’s been more than two weeks since we last spoke, and I’m still hurting a lot. I know what I did was wrong, and I wish I could have explained myself and included her in my journey of healing. But now, I have to accept that it’s over.

1lsvsgm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsvsgm,"Looking for honest input - Considering double jaw surgery for sleep apnea, bite issues, and jaw structure (Class II)","I'm 36 and have been on the fence about double jaw surgery for over a decade. I was finally diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea last year (AHI of 27 and 37 in two separate studies), and it's been seriously affecting my energy, sleep, and daily functioning.

I have a Class II malocclusion (confirmed by a U.S. surgeon at 25), with around 5–6mm of jaw discrepancy. My symptoms include:

1. Crooked teeth, overbite, and it is hard to chew or tear food with my front teeth

2. Chronic jaw and facial pain that sometimes leads to headaches

3. Inability to fully close my mouth comfortably. When I do, my teeth feel unstable and start to jitter

4. Severe fatigue during the day, loud snoring, and confirmed small airway from an ENT

5. History of mouth breathing, dry mouth, occasional drooling (even while standing), and difficulty breathing through my nose for long

6. My tongue sometimes feels like it's obstructing my throat, especially when I lie on my side. Almost like this feeling that I am choking on the base of my own tongue.

7. CPAP at the hospital during sleep test made me puke. The only one that worked was a nasal one and I was able to sleep with it for a week, but it made no different to my energy levels throughout the day. Basically, I am fatigued all day and rely on coffee and stimulants to work.

8. I've had dark under-eye circles my whole life. My family says it’s genetic, but I wonder if it's related to fatigue or circulation from poor airway function

9. I can't smile naturally. Only my crooked upper teeth show, my bottom teeth stay hidden, and the lower lip protrudes. My smile always looks forced or awkward. It's basically a horror movie smile so it's like I can't express genuine emotion.

10. My teeth clang together a lot, especially when I try to align my bite

I’ve seen maxillofacial surgeons in both the U.S. and Thailand. The one from the U.S. was back when I was 25 years old and he said “I could do it” but seemed indifferent. Another in Thailand (who studied from California) said I had clear upper and lower jaw recession and recommended double jaw surgery right away and that it was obvious. He was the only one who said that, though, while others didn't seem to think my jaw/chin was that big of a problem. I’ve also seen ENTs who focused on my nose/tongue and said I needed tongue reduction surgery for my apnea. It's so confusing because everyone says something different based on their area of work or monetary agenda.

I just want honest feedback about whether jaw surgery seems like the right step, based on what others have gone through or seen, because I'm still on the fence.

Also unsure about doing it in Thailand. I live here, and it’s cheaper than in the U.S., but I don’t know how reliable the outcomes are long-term. Going back to the U.S. would be much more expensive, and I don’t have insurance. My mom has offered to take out a loan if I go that route, which makes this decision even heavier.

Make them feel this,"It was a **typical Saturday morning**, and I found myself sitting in my favorite coffee shop, lost in my coffee, when suddenly I heard a loud commotion at the door.

https://preview.redd.it/yg6jufvul7bf1.jpg?width=1679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d47c63c940ededbad83c8eeb0cbf8743ef9705c3

I looked up to see a **group of people,** all dressed in **football** kits, walking into the cafe.

They looked like they had just come from a game, and by their body language, laughter, and the excited voices of some of them loudly discussing incidents from the match, it was clear that they had won.

All of them were smiling, **celebrating their victory** as they ordered their coffee.

As I sat there, watching this **group of strangers bond** over their **shared experience**, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy, even though I did not know anyone from them.

But then it hit me, this was a classic example of the ""**in-group effect**"" in action.

You see, as humans, we have a natural tendency to identify with and feel a **sense of belonging** to a certain group based on shared characteristics or experiences.

And in this case, those matching kits, and the high 5s were the equivalent of a secret handshake, signaling that they were part of the same exclusive club.

Well, while the story ended, here is what some brands have understood this, and have enjoyed the benefits.

Hey everyone, thinking about some of the strategies we discuss here, I feel like I made a big mistake by missing a crucial piece of the puzzle. I wanted to share my story and get your thoughts

Here’s what happened: I was an intern at a company. People there were pretty friendly and interested in me. My approach was to be super polite but keep to myself, just focus on my tasks. I thought this showed I was serious and good at my job. Back then, it seemed to work okay.
Then, I got a full-time, entry-level job at the same place. Suddenly, over half the people who used to be friendly just became… neutral. My quiet, professional approach didn't change, but the situation did.

My big realization (and I could be totally wrong here, so tell me if I am) is this: When I was an intern, my quietness was probably seen as being respectful, a bit shy, or super focused. But as a full-time worker, part of the team, that same behavior was probably seen as cold, uninterested, or like I wasn't playing the social game. Those friendly gestures when I was an intern (small talk, offering coffee, asking about my weekend) weren't just nice things; they were like little invites to connect. By just being polite and nothing more, I accidentally said 'no' to those invites and didn't build any real connections. I wasn't thinking smart; I was just being socially disconnected.

I'm starting to think my value isn't just how well I do my job, but also how I fit into the social side of things. It’s not about faking it or being super bubbly, but really getting that reciprocity isn't just about helping out, it's about noticing and returning people's social energy. This feels like a big lesson I missed in the 'rules' we talk about here.

Has anyone here run into this? How do you stay strategic and a bit reserved, but still play the basic social game so you don't get left out? I'm trying to figure out how to change my approach without looking like I'm suddenly trying way too hard. Any thoughts would be super helpful!",3,1751787620.0,48lawsofpower,0,1.0,False

1lsviy3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsviy3,A Caol Ila-pocalypse tasting with friends... and a few other yummy treats!,"# A Caol Ila-pocalypse: A Crazy Vertical with Friends (1968–1984)

Yesterday, a friend graciously hosted me at his office to try a newly bottled *1984 Caol Ila Cask of Distinction* — 40 years old, bottled at cask strength (50.4%). Naturally, I couldn’t resist bringing a few other Caol Ilas along to taste side by side.

Here’s what I brought:

* Caol Ila 1969 Celtic Label, bottled 1985 – 59.9%
* Caol Ila 1968 Celtic Label, bottled 1985 – 60.9%
* Caol Ila 1978 Rare Malts Selection, 23yo – 61.7%
* Caol Ila 1969 G&M CC (miniature) – 40%

And here’s what my friend added to complete the madness:

* Caol Ila 1975 Rare Malts Selection, 20yo – 61.12%
* Caol Ila 1984 Prima & Ultima, 35yo – 50.8%
* Caol Ila 1982 Cadenhead, 38yo – 47.2%
* Caol Ila 24yo ‘175th Anniversary’ – 52.1%

An 8-bottle vertical spanning from 1968 to 1984... Woohoo!

**Warm-Up**

We started with two old Glendronachs (1970s Rufino import and a 1980s UK import) to get our palates going. Then… it was Caol Ila time.

# 1969 G&M Mini (40%)

Despite being only 40%, this was a monster. Thick, oily, powerful. I remarked that if tasted blind i would've thought it at 48%, a friend said mid-50s.  
Flavours: earthy peat, engine oil, greasy tools, churned soil, mouldy orange peel. 

# 1968 & 1969 Celtic Labels (60.9% & 59.9%)

These were bottled young (15yo), but wow.

* **1969 Celtic** – Rosewater, brine, lemon curd, crystallised fruit, with a dirty industrial core. A friend also added that there are notes of clean charcoal smoke, honeydew, coffee grounds.
* **1968 Celtic** – Much more sherried. Roasted chestnuts, tar, burnt leather, grilled meat, orange peel. Old islay style peat at its idiosyncratic best!

We were split: two of us loved the distillate-forward 1969, the others initially preferred the sherry-meets-peat of the 1968. Eventually, one defected — 1969 takes the win!

# Post-Rebuild: The 1970s

* **1978 Rare Malts (23yo, 61.7%)** – Bright lemon, sunflower oil, gasoline, big coastal peat.
* **1975 Rare Malts (20yo, 61.12%)** – Mud, tar, seawater, gasoline... almost Port Ellen-esque.

My PE-loving friend and I preferred the 1975. The other two leaned toward the 1978 for its balance of freshness and power.

# Into the 1980s

These were immediately more familiar — closer to modern Caol Ila in DNA, but aged beautifully. We noticed a stylistic shift: less briny/industrial, more ashy and polished.

The **1984 Cask of Distinction** and **Prima & Ultima** both had a waxy, industrial playdough note. Strangely pleasant. I liked the COD bottling for its purity — reminded me of **Port Ellen 40yo – 9 Rogue Casks**.

We even tasted the COD beside the original cask sample that was bottled 5 months prior. It was cool to see how just that short period of extra aging resulted in a noticable difference. The cask owner speculated that the bigger difference may have come from Diageo’s filtration — an interesting idea I’d like to explore more! If anyone knows about this please comment :)

**COD Tasting Notes**: light leather, sunflower oil, ash, oyster brine, white fruit pith, field flowers. Delicate, refined and layered.

If I had to nitpick: the 1982–1984 Caol Ilas were so consistent in quality and style that they lacked some of the surprise factor. But that’s a very privileged complaint, haha.

We also drank some stunning Banff, Brora, Glenury Royal, Port Ellen, Lagavulin… but that’s another post.

Massive thanks to our generous host. What a fun night.

  
Would love to hear: **What’s your favourite Caol Ila you’ve had recently?**

1lsvgkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/1lsvgkq/sons_girlfriend_is_now_a_concern/,Son’s girlfriend is now a concern.,"Son (Beau) is 17, his girlfriend (Jenna) is 18. She seemed like a cute sweet girl, they’ve been dating for 1 year. 

He has recently told me a few things that are red flags in my mind. 

1) when he gets upset about something, she in turn gets upset and cries so he’s now comforting her. His feelings are never addressed. 

2) she can be mean and degrading in a passive aggressive way. 

3) he’s working long hours for his summer job. His phone died at work today so she couldn’t reach him all day.  When he contacted her after his 15 hour work shift she yelled at him for being unavailable. She was already aware of his hours. He handled it and got off the phone. 

4) last night he needed to go to bed to prepare for his long upcoming 15 hour shift. She kept him up on the phone late at night, crying about god knows what. He ended up sleeping through his alarm and he was a few minutes late to work. 

5) she graduated HS last year and she’s working at a coffee shop making very little money. My husband offered her a well paying job, my older son offered her a great paying job as well, she refused because she has “so much fun at the coffee shop.”

Well, this is frustrating because Beau seems to be paying for everything. They also have plans to move into an apartment together after he graduates and I can see that she’s counting on him to make that happen. She’s doing nothing to become financially secure. She’s not pursuing a higher education and she’s not accepting better job opportunities when they’re practically given to her. 

This isn’t how we’ve raised our kids. We’ve secured his college courses which he’ll be working on throughout his senior year and he’ll move forward with his college courses after he graduates. 

I had a brief talk with him tonight after he opened up to me but I plan to talk in more detail about the concerns I’m having. 

It’s late and I’m exhausted. I could use some advice on what to say to my son without causing him to become defensive. ",2,1751787072.0,parentingteenagers,4,0.75,False

I'm in my late 50s and I know I really need to get my hearing checked properly. But man, I'm having such a tough time even finding an available audiologist here in the Clearwater area. It feels like every office is either fully booked or has really long waiting lists.

So I am wondering if anyone in our community has tried any over the counter hearing aids? Do they actually work for you and what are some affordable options you'd recommend? Also if they do work, where around Clearwater did you manage to get them? Any advice on how to get some quick relief for my ears would be a huge help.

“Thunderbolts”? More like “Blunderbolts.” It’s like Marvel Studios got a room full of interns, fed them expired Red Bull, and told them to cook up a half-baked Suicide Squad clone in between coffee breaks.

Let’s talk lineup. This is supposed to be Marvel’s answer to the Suicide Squad, a crew of morally grey anti-heroes coming together for some chaotic good, right? Then why does this feel like the “Leftovers: MCU Edition”? Yelena? Fine. Red Guardian? Okay. But Taskmaster? Ghost?? Bucky randomly thrown in like someone hit shuffle on Disney+? Where is the actual edge, the chaos, the teeth? These aren’t the Thunderbolts. These are the Sad-bolts. The Meh-bolts. The Discount Avengers you get when you order on Temu.

And don’t get me started on the tone. It’s trying so hard to be dark and gritty while also forcing in Marvel’s trademark quippy humor every 3.7 seconds. You can't build tension when everyone’s busy cracking mid-tier sitcom jokes while the world’s on fire. It's like trying to serve steak with whipped cream. Pick a lane.

Also, WHERE IS ZEMO?!
You take the dude who actually started the Thunderbolts in the comics, gave us the best villainous performance in the entire MCU phase 3, and then just… toss him aside? That’s like making an X-Men movie and going, “Eh, screw Wolverine, let’s focus on Jubilee.” Who is calling these shots? Genuinely, who? I want names. I want receipts.

This movie feels like it was stitched together in a boardroom with one eye on a profit chart and the other eye closed. Where’s the originality? The stakes? The actual writing?? It’s all just empty fan-service and leftover plot threads duct-taped together with CGI. And they expect us to care?

Honestly, “Thunderbolts” isn’t a superhero movie. It’s a studio panic attack in IMAX.

I just finished my first Hyrox Opens. Though I am happy I was able to complete it, I’m still a bit disappointed with the time, as I had done lot better times on sims with pro weights.

A few reflections:

Pre Race: I had black coffee instead of my usual latte on the race morning (~2 hours before the race) thinking the milk would affect my gut. But I had felt more dehydrated than usual and felt pretty bad acid reflux during the race.

First Half: When feeling the dehydration mid race (after sled pulls) I started stopping more on the hydration stations sipping electrolytes and water. I feel like this contributed to the stomach cramps I started feeling on run 4 - which highly affected my time there 

Second Half: I’m now coming off the rows and the stomach cramps have subsided a little - so I try pushing on run 6. But then, my quads start cramping up really badly. I survive through farmers carry but the lunges were brutal which made the cramps worse. So I basically walk-jog the last run and push through the wall balls with whatever strength I have.

I’m not sure what caused my quad cramps and if my leg strength was the culprit of the quad cramps 

Training: I have trained for about 7 months. I have prior strength training experience for about 6 years but no running or endurance experience.
During the time, I have completed a 5k plan and a 10k plan on runna, and also progressed from a quarter Hyrox sim to a full Hyrox sim with pro weights.
I’d train 3 days a week of running, 2 days of strength and 1 Hyrox sim day. I had to stop leg training during the 10k running plan as it’d impact my running and Hyrox performance. 

Let me know if guys have any tips for my next race!

1lsv8fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1lsv8fi/help_all_hardwork_going_down_the_drain/,HELP | All hardwork going down the drain,"Hello everyone

In October 2024, I started my weight loss journey from 82 Kg. I used to do 30 min HIIT daily (45 sec exercise + 15 sec break), along with a proper calorie deficit diet containing a lot of protein. By mid march 2025, I had lost 14 kg, bringing down my weight to 68 kg. I was so happy looking at my grind giving me results.

But since then, I have suddenly started weight, even with a similar diet and workout plan I had earlier. I am unable to control the weight gain, even after intensifying my workout. Right now, I stand at 74.5 kg. The fat I had lost has now started to show up on my body again.

Kindly help me. There is no pain in life worse than seeing all your grind, hard work and results going down the drain.

Edit : More context on diet and workout plan :

1. Workout : I follow videos of Rowan Row and Chris Heria on YT.
2. Diet :

1. Start with 1 Apple + black coffee
2. 5-6 bananas while going to office
3. Lunch : Generally a Dosa when in office. In weekend, chick steak or chicken biryani. At times, I also eat  4-8 pieces of Dhokla too.
4. Evening : Half Papaya/Half water melon after returning from office (once in 2 days on average, depending on when I return from office)
5. Daal Chawal or may even skip dinner
6. Occasional munching : Ice cream or Moong daal halwa once in 10 days.",5,1751786140.0,Fitness_India,10,1.0,False

Here it goes

3 years ago i messege’d a old church family friend , (let’s call her J) that im in california and if she’s ever in texas, come and stop by and maybe we could go to the beach or something like that, she said She has nothing to do in the next 2 Weeks so Why not come from New mexico to Texas so that’s what she did, i was Living with My uncle for temporary Because i needed to get away from my dad and Brother, (for short i just wasn’t getting along with them and i just needed to get away from them and same with my mom and my other brother they weren’t getting along with my brother and my dad and so they also needed to get away from them so she flew me to texas because she only had the money to fly me while she saves up and my uncle had me in with open arms (let’s call him unc A) so anyways back to where i invited J and her kids and Husband(also an Old church friend) to an amusement park and my mom and my a other brother flew to texas finally and my unc and his 2 daughters and wife (let’s call the oldest cousin D and the youngest K and call my aunt N) so we went at the amusement park everyone got along and such this was the first time our old church friends saw my moms side of the family but they all hit it off and had a great time. 

fast forward 3 weeks later, i find out my unc A and aunt N are getting divorced, J and her Husband are also getting a divorce, and unc A and J are quote on quote, “Courting” They basically just ran away together. left their marriages and started dating. life was like, kinda hell? idk how to describe it but it was ruff. Aunt N’s side of the family just blamed me even though they barely even met me? they met me when i was 6 at my counsn birthday party and now they think i ruined their daughters life. anyways for more context on unc A and J’s Marriages, according to them unc A never felt appreciated with his wife and and his wife never is thankful or is affectionate and he just wants to feel happy and appreciated and feel loved. and J on the other hand had a Domestic violence issue her husband and Her husband drinks and gambles, i don’t get it because unc A drinks? and smokes? like a lot a lot. i don’t eevn know atp but he doesn’t gamble he just plays videos games a lot ngl anyways my mother and brothers never blamed me my aunt N never blamed me my cousins never blamed me i just wanted to invite an old family friend whom i haven’t seen in a while to an amusement park. however my other uncle, ( let’s call him unc O.) who basically silently loathes unc A, blames me, is on aunt N’s family’s side even though aunt N never even blamed me infact we are good pals we have the same music type same clothing style etc she’s cool but unc O blames me? i was 15 when all this happened btw. fast forward 3 years now present, i’m 18 now, drive, and i still live in texas and and aunt N and unc A are divorced after over a decade of being together and Unc A is now with J married and J is currently Pregnant and so far nothing too bad has happened with custody and divorce and stuff with Unc A and aunt N. aunt N was heartbroken at first with the breakup but she got a boyfriend 6 months after her and Unc A’s separation. Now 2 weeks ago i was driving to visit my mom to help clean her house but i pass my little cousins school (she’s 8 now) and i see her playing outside the school with her cousin on aunt N’s (her mom) side i walk up to her and ask her “hi K it’s 5 pm the sun is going down where is your parents?” K said “ i don’t know i thought they were going to pick me up hours ago “ and same with her cousin they said “Aunt N was suppose to pick us up hours ago!” and they were just playing chawk on the sidewalk of the school while the librarian of the school was watching them from afar. i text and call unc A no response. i text and call aunt N no response. i text and call J no response. i text and call cousin D no response but makes sense because she’s a medical student lol anyways i call my mom she said to just pick them up she gave me cousin K’s cousins address so i drop him off there first and i bring cousin K to our house and i gave her pizza and i put on moana on the TV while my mom and me were just deep cleqning the entire house lol we had a big infestation so we had to clean for the exterminator ANYWAYS that was off topic im sorry if i ramble, aunt N comes by and picks up cousin K and apologizes a lot saying she forgot and she had coffee with a friend and her boyfriend and a family member she just forgot about picking up her daughter etc etc i said it’s fine please don’t let it happen again it’s pretty hot outside im glad the librarian let the kids read books in after hours after schools over she apologizes again and said she won’t let it happen again and we move on and stuff. 3 days later my mom tells me aunt N’s family is talking sh*t about me and stuff like that and aunt N is being convinced by them that this was all unc A’s doing and he sent me to belittle aunt N???? i don’t even know what that means. again everyone is defending me except unc O and NOW aunt N and everyone’s just fighting and it’s so frustrating i need Advice any and every Advice is appreciated, Am i the Asshole?",2,1751786116.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I really want to stress this, I'm not asking her to deprive herself of sleep. I'm asking her to shift her sleep schedule by an hour or two, maybe 3. Sleep in a bit later, or take a nap. So that she's *able* to stay up with me for a little bit longer after I come home. I don't need to, nor am I asking her to, stay awake with me until I fall asleep, just a little bit longer than she's been capable of with her current sleep schedule. 

This is a really complicated situation and I have no idea what to do. I really need advice. 

Me (23M) and my gf (22F) have been together for 3 and a half years, known each other for 8 (since we were 14 and 15). 

For some context: 

- I work time and a half. 12-14 hour shifts 3-5 days a week. (I've worked a few 7 day work weeks)

- we both struggle with mental health issues

- I deal with severe insomnia (that's caused by my several severe mental disorders)

I get off work anywhere between 10pm-1am. I have never and will never have a shift that ends earlier than 10pm and those aren't common. 
When I wake up, she's sleeping. Then I work a 12-14 hour shift where I'm alone most of the day.

When I get home from work, she's super tired, and she wants to go to bed. I'm incredibly thankful that most days she stays awake until I get home. But I really want to spend time with her, and it's not just about being lonely. I have extreme panic issues, stemming from ptsd and severe OCD. I've been hospitalized inpatient for panic attacks that have lasted days at a time, so bad that even with several doses of valium I couldn't stop screaming and throwing up. These episodes come in waves, luckily they aren't that bad all the time, but when I'm not at that point, it's still DEBILITATING 

When I'm at work I HAVE to not freak tf out, it's not an option not to. I'll lose my job and I absolutely cannot lose my job. Luckily when the sun's up it's not as bad, but it's still terrible. Once it starts getting dark, it gets worse, and between 10pm - 4am it's the worst. 

I've been asking her if she can sleep in a bit later (which she's already waking up 1-5 hours after I am) or take a nap during the day, so that 1) I can spend time with her cause she's the absolute love of my life and I *miss her* 
2) I won't be alone for the hardest part of my day 

I'm *not trying* to be awake so late. I try so hard. I've been struggling with this insomnia since I was 13. I often go a full 24 - 30+ hours without sleep. I have been awake for 48-72 hours multiple times. At one point when I was 18 I was prescribed 5 sleeping aids/sedatives (Olanzapine, Seroquel, risparidone, Abilify, and zopiclone) every single night (and yes my next psychiatrist lost his mind and was appalled that I was on that combo, didn't know it could have killed me). During that time *I STILL COULDN'T SLEEP!* At least, often I couldn't. 

I try so goddamn hard to sleep. I do. But she keeps telling me to try harder. But I try to hard. But the second I lay down without something to distract me I lose it. I can't stop ruminating and panicking and it gets to the point where I'm sitting upright gasping for air and gripping the bed. Every. Single. Night. I've tried sleep sounds. They don't really do much. I've tried podcasts. I found one that works called ""nothing much happens"" and it used to be extremely helpful (somehow moreso than the meds???) but now I've somehow Pavloved myself into panicking when I turn it on some nights because I relate the sound to those moments of panic. I'm *trying* I promise.

But I just... Can't... I don't sleep until the exhaustion completely knocks me out, and even then I have nightmares and wake up every 1-3 hours. 

I keep begging her to stay awake with me. And some nights I mean until like 3am. And I know that's unreasonable. I get that, that's why I'm making this post. 

But goddamn it man I do everything for her. With my level of mental and physical disabilities (all diagnosed btw), I'm the only one who works. I've been saying for weeks that the only reason I haven't checked myself into the psych ward recently is because I can't afford to take the time off work. Last time I said that repeatedly for weeks, I ended up attempting suicide with so much determination that I was dead for several minutes and spent 3 days in a coma. This was about a year ago.
But we gotta pay rent, pay our phone/wifi/electric bills. We have to buy food. I can't admit myself.

When I say I do everything for her, I mean basically everything. I handle making sure she gets to doctors appointments, I pay her phone bill, I'm exclusively her only emotional support (outside her amazing mother who she ghosts for weeks - months at a time), I handle her breakdowns, when she lashes out, her mental health crises, budgeting, apartment searching/applications, credit checks, showings (we've moved 6 times in 3.5 years), I help her with banking shit, getting new ID... Ffs she doesn't shower or brush her teeth most of the time without me pushing her. On top of that, I don't want anyone to think I believe ""the woman belongs in the kitchen"" or that the woman should handle all the house work. BUT I'm gone all the time, and she doesn't take care of the house at all, her cooking for me (which I do really appreciate please don't misunderstand) involves her throwing a piece of breaded chicken in the oven, chopping some vegetables, and bringing them to me so I can assemble a wrap. Or microwaving me a hotdog or throwing a pizza in the oven. 
 

I wanna note that she does semi often stay up with me. But I feel like an abusive piece of shit cause it's because I *don't let her sleep* out of desperation. When I'm drunk I'll play music and push and push and push for her to stay up with me. We'll put on a tv show and I'll keep saying ""one more episode"" over and over, I'll insist on showing her videos on my phone. And I'll be honest I really feel like I guilt trip her sometimes. I don't really mean to, but I'll be sad and anxious as fuck and let it slip out how fucking *devastated* I am that she's leaving me alone and it makes her feel like shit. Sometimes she pushes to stay up, sometimes she ends up going to sleep feeling like shit. 

She says it's not good for her to sleep in and stay up late. That it's bad for her mental health... But she doesn't work, she doesn't go to school, she doesn't really have friends... 

I don't even want to deprive her of sleep!!! I just want her to sleep in a bit later some days or take naps. Also I am a fucking asshole though cause the other day she *did* stay up with me cause I told her she could sleep in all day. I managed to get less than an hour of sleep before work, so I didn't pack a lunch, and I woke her up at 1pm to bring me food and coffee. At that point she had a few hours, but I know it wasn't enough for her. 

Before I got a job (about 2? Years ago) I was on disability. I was a fucking trainwreck. I was drinking an insane amount and off my rocker. I used to get hammered and stay up all night and keep her awake way too long. And she told me I was abusive because I wasn't letting her sleep. And that fucking eats me up inside.... I know it messed with her.. but she still got 8-15 hours of sleep at a time, just at ridiculous hours. And I do genuinely feel terrible about that.

I need to say:

I am absolutely not breaking up with her. That's not an option. We have our issues but we are both actually healing and young. She's the only person who I've ever felt safe with. We genuinely love each other so much, and I don't want anyone to misunderstand this long winded ramble about the *flaws* in our relationship to take away from the good. I'm already making this too long and it would take 5 days to read if I shared all the good parts of our relationship.


Idk... This is so much longer than I meant for it to be... Idk if any of this made sense... 

Fuck... So... Idk...

I am looking for help to finalize my purchase decision and would greatly appreciate advice from those who have experience with these machines.

Approximate total budget: about €1800/€2200 coffee maker + €600-€1400 grinder. 

The machine options I am considering are:

✅ Profitec Ride

✅ Profitec Move

✅ Rocket Mozzafiato R fast

I make about 3–5 coffees a day, mostly espresso, but I like to make frothed milk from time to time. I am looking above all for consistency, temperature stability and reliability.


⸻

Questions about the grinder:

Here I am between two very different styles:

✅ Eureka Atom W65: with integrated scale, very convenient to weigh on the go if I always use the same coffee.

✅ Eureka Mignon Single Dose Pro: more oriented towards single dose to change grains with ease and less retention.

I'm not sure if the convenience of weighing with the Atom is more worth it or the versatility of a pure single dose to try different coffees.

⸻

If anyone has these machines or grinders, I would greatly appreciate knowing:
	• Daily use experience.
	• Maintenance and real heating times.
	• Opinion on the machine + grinder combination that would best fit.

1lsv58c,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lsv58c/my_20_secret_weapon_against_wrinkles/,My $20 Secret Weapon Against Wrinkles?,"My wife and I recently decided to upgrade our coffee game.  We'd been using a basic drip machine for years, and frankly, the coffee was… adequate.  But we craved that rich, velvety texture you get from a pour-over, without the fuss. That's where the Fellow Ode Brew Grinder came in.  I’d been eyeing it for months, reading countless reviews, and finally took the plunge.  My testing involved brewing a variety of beans, from light roasts to dark, and experimenting with grind sizes to dial in the perfect cup.

## Grind Adjustment & Precision

The Ode's defining feature is its stepless grind adjustment.  This allows for incredibly precise control over the grind size, a crucial factor in pour-over brewing. Forget those clunky, numbered settings; the Ode's adjustment is smooth and intuitive.  I found it easy to dial in the perfect grind for different beans and brewing methods.  The grind consistency is also excellent, crucial for even extraction and a balanced cup.  I rarely saw any clumps or inconsistencies in my grounds, even after weeks of consistent use.

## Build Quality & Design

The Ode feels incredibly solid and well-built. It's made from high-quality materials, with a hefty weight that conveys a sense of durability. The brushed stainless steel looks sleek and modern, and it's a pleasure to use.   The design is simple and functional, with everything placed logically and intuitively.  There's a minimal footprint, which is ideal for our small kitchen counter.  Overall, this is one piece of equipment that should last for years to come.

## Grind Speed & Efficiency

While the Ode is not the fastest grinder on the market, the speed is quite acceptable for home use. It's not going to grind a pound of beans in seconds, but it's certainly efficient enough for daily use.  I rarely find myself waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The quieter operation compared to some burr grinders is a significant plus.  This allows for a more pleasant morning coffee experience.

## Cleaning & Maintenance

Cleaning the Ode is remarkably simple. The hopper is easily removable, and the burrs are accessible for cleaning, though I found I only need to do this every few weeks.   Fellow provides clear instructions on cleaning, and the entire process takes just a few minutes.  No special tools are required.  The minimal maintenance required is a huge win in my book.

## Hopper Capacity & Handling

The hopper size is ideal for most home users.  It holds enough beans for several days’ worth of brewing.  It does not, however, accommodate the average one pound bag which can lead to some repeated filling throughout the week.  Refilling is easy thanks to the wide opening and the hopper is generally easy to handle and sturdy enough that beans do not spill out.

## Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $399, the Fellow Ode isn't a budget grinder.  However, compared to similar high-end grinders like the Baratza Sette 270 (often in a similar price range), the Ode's stepless adjustment and build quality justify the cost for those who prioritize precision.  It’s a premium pick for serious coffee enthusiasts willing to invest in a quality product that will last for years.

## Pros:

* Exceptionally precise stepless grind adjustment
* Excellent build quality and durable construction
* Relatively quiet operation
* Easy to clean and maintain
* Consistent grind size, leading to better extraction

## Cons:

* High price point
* Hopper size could be slightly larger

## Final Verdict & Recommendation

The Fellow Ode is a superb grinder for serious home coffee brewers. Its precision, build quality, and ease of use make it a joy to use. While the price is high, it's a worthwhile investment for those who demand the best from their coffee brewing process.  Highly recommended for anyone who prioritizes quality and control over their coffee grind.",1,1751785786.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False
1lsv3vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lsv3vx/started_off_as_fwbs_realized_we_loved_eachother/,"Started off as FWBs, realized we loved eachother at different times.","Me (29/M) and my coworker, lets call her P, (30/F) began a FWB relationship in January after working togehter for a year. She and I always joked around at work, she brought me cookies randomly and really enjoyed eachothers company before this agreement.

As usual and as delusional it was we told eachother from the getgo to not catch feelings for eachother. Since I write here you can guess how that went!

We never just made love, we always stayed as long as we could each time, talking, joking, eating. Weeks at a time I basically lived at her place. I would pick her up at her hairdresser friend one night while being sick just because she needed a drive. I won't get into too much detail about this time but she told me after the ""breakup"" that we were basically a couple. I guess that's one of the reasons this hurts so much.

The worst reason this hurts the most is because in May I felt she loved me, and she has told me as much now afterwards. I was afraid of comittment myself because she already has two kids with her ex and I've never had a relationship. She never told me this until after the breakup because she was SURE I was in love with an ex situationship or what to say. She knew from before our time together I was heads over heels for this other girl. What she didn't know at the time was that those thoughts of the other faded as we were together. But I did not realize I loved her until she was gone. Like a mantra I told myself I can't get in a relationship with one who already has children. I know it's immature of me. And I hate myself for it.

Anyway since she thought I loved another girl she went searching for a new guy. By late May she went off work until after the summer, and by mid June we stopped seeing eachother. 2 weeks ago she ""broke up"" with me, very kindly. ""I think I have feelings for this other guy so I don't think we can't see eachother anymore at this time. I enjoyed my time with you very much and nothing has changed there I really like you. But I need to explore this since I have feelings for him. I didn't see you guys at the same time, I just want you to know that.""

After reading that I realized I've had feelings for her from the start, I've been surpressing them just because of the children and also sometimes because I still thought I wanted the other girl. We texted for like 4 days straight and we both cried and hated that this has happend. We went on an afterwork togheter the Friday after she broke up with me (tuesday) and told eachother to pretend nothing has happend, since some at work know but most didn't even know we saw eachother because we hid it since her ex knows basically all at work. That Friday anyway we were inseparable and we had the best time. She told me the same thing. We agreed to see eachother for a coffee on Monday morning before work and at first she wanted her children to attend so I could meet them, but she later remembered they had pre school that week too, no summer break yet. We also agreed not to text beforehand, we have texted almost all day since she began at work 1,5 years prior.

When I arrived at her place she was crying in the couch. I began to tear up as well. We spoke for like 2 hrs about our feelings for eachother and how stupid this whole situation has gotten. She and I both cried like crazy, but she was still kinda undecided. She also told me that she missed me like crazy when didn't text at all the day before. I told her I won't text anymore since I want her to come to a conclusion herself of what she want to do but if we continue we won't hide it from anyone anymore and we should develop a deeper relationship. She agreed.

That was Monday and the days following were very hard for me. I began writning in the Notes app on my iPhone memories and feelings I've felt for her from the beginning. By Wednesday evening after work she wrote me angrily because a other coworker who has been sabotaging this since the start had asked her why she hated her. That coworker, lets call her the toxic one, had told me the day after the afterwork that P was with this other guy. P and I has hated it from the start that this toxic one has been sabotaging since she got wind of this and we repeatedly told her not to intervene in anyway. She never stopped intervening tho, and because of me being drunk and got sad when she told me this I told her of harshly that both P and me hates that she continues to intervene and we want her both to stop. Then I blocked her. So by Wednesday I had to call up P and explain what I had said. She told me she wasn't mad at me she understood that I got hurt when I heard she met this other guy and told me she would call me up in the morning.

She called me up and as usual we both cried. For 40 mins we barely spoke 10 mins but we enjoyed hearing eachother breathing. She told me that these 3 days without any contact has been so hard for her. ""My life feels so hard and empty without you."" I told her I had to cope by writing about my feelings for her in the Notes app. She wanted to read them so I sent them to her. She told me they were very nice and she got tears in her eyes. I asked her what she wanted to do because I can't deal with her not being with me anymore. She told me that since she has feelings for this guy now she needs to try with him. She also told me he's very dry and arrogant via text. I told her to go see him in person then, if he is so dry while texting. I also told her I won't continue to write because I don't wanna confuse her with this new one and wished her best of luck with him. Also that if anything changes she must write me but I won't wait for you (she was very determined that I should not wait for her at all).

Sorry about this rant, I've left out a ton of stuff and I'm not that comfortable writing in English. I am just sad because this ended because of a missunderstanding, while it being a beautiful ""relationship"" for both of us. We realized that we loved eachother at different times and it hurts. Since I suspected she loved me I went by my day waiting for her to bring it up but she never did. Instead the ""breakup"" text came, and it really broke me. We'll see what happends in like 5 weeks when we both work together again. All I know is that I can't go back to being friends with her, and that hurts alot. She has been one of my closest friends for over a year and we got way closer during our FWB phase. She woke up in my bed at her 30th birthday and since that day I hoped I would wake up with her when I celebrate my 30th birthday late August.

I really do hope we find a way back together in the future. I sent her the last Notes text and the last paragraph was: ""I remember when they called about finding your lost cat. I asked if you wanted me to come with you and get it, unsure if you wanted to be seen outside and alone with me. When you told me to come with I was very happy, sadly that was the first and last time we didn't hide in my or your apartment. I have never been so proud.""

1lsv3va,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lsv3va/my_bf_feels_uncomfortable_with_me_catching_up/,My bf feels uncomfortable with me catching up with an old friend,"I (26F) recently went to my college reunion with my boyfriend of 2 years (27M). During that reunion I reconnected with a lot of old friends that I don’t typically reach out to and introduced my boyfriend, since we’re likely getting engaged/married soon. One of those friends, call him Guy, I hung out with in college, had the same uncommon major, but really hadn’t kept up with post college despite us being in the same city. He was perfectly nice to me in college but my bf mentioned afterward he felt Guy was particularly chilly towards him in their 3 min interaction - I hadn’t picked up on it since there was so much going on at the event and figured Guy might have been distracted by something in the crowd. But I told my bf that it might have been because Guy could’ve had a thing for me in college that I didn’t lead on (we went for coffee once for instance, and I couldn’t tell if it was a date). My bf laughed it off.

Afterwards I reached out to everyone I reconnected with at the reunion - including a list of maybe a dozen people offering an opening to meet up since we were in the same city. Only two responded with concrete plans - a girlfriend and Guy. It hit me then that if I were in my bf’s shoes it would be strange to go catch up with a former friend I knew might have had feelings in the past for my gf. I told him and he was silent for a few seconds, and ultimately said to do what I wanted but to consider how the situation looked objectively. We agreed it was really a slip in judgement that I even included him in the invitations to hang out in the first place, since now I had to decline.

The thing is I agree with my bf. I honestly don’t want to complicate things by catching up with Guy. But I was the one who suggested a catch up, already declined once saying I was out of town, and he has now messaged me again asking what date I’d be free. I feel like I’d lose the connection if I ghosted him. Should I be upfront and text him that we shouldn’t? I’m don’t want to victimize my bf and say he felt uncomfortable as the reason why, especially since Guy may not have been intentionally chilly toward my bf. My bf is not controlling, and I’ve hung out with other male friends from before our relationship with no issue at all, so I have reason to believe he is not exaggerating his discomfort.

One other factor in this decision is that a lot of my former friends/acquaintances from college have been successful in their fields and great professional contacts - it’s one of the reasons I chose to go to my school. Part of the challenge is that I feel that I’ve built this connection over four years of college and feel hesitant to throw it away.",1,1751785637.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

In 2023 a girl let’s call her M (about 12 years elder to me), became very close with my mom, they used to talk everyday and my mom treated her like her own daughter. I called her aunty at first but even called her didi and maa couple of times. She was very fun, was very qualified and interested in science and technology just like me.  
We spent a lot of time together talking, eating out, went out for movies etc (together with my mom).  
However a month ago she suddenly blocked us out of nowhere, I was terribly hurt as I am very much attached to her.

We did talk very normally on Insta and Call that to pretty regularly but parallely we were blocked on WhatsApp and she lied out to us. Now a bit of context is my parents were divorced when I was mere 2 years old (my dad had an affair and my step sis is about 2 months younger to me about whom I came to know recently) I literally have no one to call as family after my mom, maybe M was the one.

I sneaked up my mom’s phone and found out a shocking truth, I had 2 elder step-brothers and M was the girlfriend of my eldest brother. (My mom had him when she was 16 and she was previously married to his father)

M had lost her mom at a very young age and he(step bro) had told everyone that her mom’s no more as well however to her he revealed this truth.  
She searched the social media and found out my mom and messaged her and tried to made them reconcile, my mom made his favorite food which he hadn’t had for years, however he still holds immense hatred for my mom.

I knew about them during my childhood but later my memory became very fuzzy, Regarding my mom I had been very upset that she had hid this from me maybe she had made several mistakes but I am really proud of the life she gave me! She raised me single handedly covered all my expenses ad we have been living in rent for past 21 years (my father gave nothing).

My Brother made M block us on WhatsApp and send him an SS and made her promise she will never contact us again, my brother already moved on from her and started dating someone however still made her do this.

We went out for coffee (Me and M) and she told me that I remind her of my step brother and my characteristics and looks match exactly with him. She told she will keep us blocked on whatsapp due to her promise but definitely be in touch.

Cut down to today, she rarely picks up my call and mostly ghosts my text and insta messages. I have endured immense trauma from my childhood and couldn't make much close friends. All this had been too much for me but now and distancing with her had broken me off immensely, now I feel like she always thought of me as her boyfriend's step-brother where I though she thought of me as her own brother. 

  
I was unaware of the existence of my brother and mom's previous marriage, my step bro has extreme hate for my mom and me, but am more worried for M.  

I feel Devastated and unsure if she will ever return and things will be as before or we have been distanced forever.",1,1751785188.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

This way I discovered I am deficient in basically everything. B12, iron, vit A. 

Phytates and dairy in coffee bind to iron molecules and form strong bonds which the body is unable to break down so they just pass down the intestine. This way if you're drinking caffeine 2 hours before or after a meal you're not really absorbing any iron, leading over time to iron deficiency. To check this you HAVE to check your ferritin levels. Anything below 100 is considered iron deficiency without anemia. Thankfully without coffee it's possible to get these levels back up, but without supplements it can take years! So check that out. I also want to add that a deficiency in one element is grounds for checking the rest of them because it's never just one deficiency, so take care. ",8,1751784986.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1lsuw8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/grittytruth/comments/1lsuw8l/grievery/,Grievery,"It's not grief.
Grief is too clean.
Too ceremonial.
A punch in the gut—
then the casserole arrives.

This is grievery.
The long-haul bastard.
The slow rot.
The fog that forgets to lift.

It doesn’t just take the person.
It takes their voice
from your voicemail.
The rhythm
from your mornings.
The smell
from the sweatshirt
you swore you’d never wash
but did—
because life keeps happening
even when you beg it not to.

Grievery moves in,
changes the locks,
leaves your insides
looking like a house after floodwater:
damp,
warped,
and still somehow full
of memories that ache.

You start to romanticize
the way they laughed—
like a window cracking open.
The way their coffee mug
had that stupid little chip
you used to curse
and now would give anything
just to touch.

You smell bar soap
and cry in the grocery store.
You hear a cough
and whip your head around—
hope crashing before it even lands.

A drawer they touched
becomes sacred.
Their handwriting
becomes scripture.
The mundane
becomes monumental.

And guilt?
Guilt is a bastard roommate.
It eats all your joy,
leaves Post-it notes on your chest:
You should have…
Why didn’t you…
You were too tired that day…
You’ll never get that time back.

But listen—
you were living.
You were tired.
You were human.
You didn’t know
that one ordinary moment
would become
the thing that claws at you
at 12:33 a.m.

That’s the secret
grievery keeps:
it makes saints of the gone,
and martyrs of the ones
who stayed.

And still—
you carry it.
You wear it
like a second skin.
Heavy.
Unwanted.
But holy, somehow.

Because it means
you loved.
You remember.
You wanted more—
even when the more
wasn’t coming.

Grievery doesn’t leave.
But it teaches you
how to hold pain
like a relic:
fragile,
terrible,
and worth everything.

1lsuw76,https://i.redd.it/nv7pyi3mb7bf1.jpeg,🧴 My Budget Fragrance Rotation – Honest Review 🇮🇳,"Hey folks! I’ve slowly built a perfume collection on a budget over the past few months—mix of EDPs and a couple of affordable dailies. Mostly used for office, casual café workdays, and the occasional night out. Sharing my rotation + honest thoughts after regular use.

My Current Lineup:

1. BellaVita Magnetic for Him

⭐️ Rating: 4/5

Warm, spicy, woody—this one is my go-to for date nights or crowded evenings. Starts off with cardamom/amber tones, settles into a sweet masculine dry-down. I also use this a lot for layering especially with Beardo Godfather or Ajmal Kuro when I want to boost richness without overwhelming the space.

Longevity: 4–6 hrs
Use: Evening wear / layering base / flirty vibe

⸻

2. Ajmal Kuro

⭐️ Rating: 4/5

My go-to office / clean look scent. Fresh-spicy but elegant. Smells way more premium than the price. Holds up in both office and casual settings.
Longevity: 6–7 hrs
Use: Work, smart casuals, daytime meetings

⸻

3. Beardo Mariner

⭐️ Rating: 3/5

Honestly, I love how this smells—super fresh, aquatic, light. But yeah, it vanishes fast but I put on 8 sprays and it’s smells fresh. Great for quick café hangs or layering under another freshie like Kuro.
Longevity: 3 hrs
Use: Chill days, coffee shops, gym

⸻

4. Wild Stone Edge

⭐️ Rating: 3/5

Can’t shit on it because this was a blind buy cz of you guys but personally—I liked this one if it lasted longer. It’s sharp, fresh, and has that nostalgic everyday guy vibe. Not complex, but solid for quick wear or layering.
Longevity: 3 hrs
Use: Daily driver, layering base, errands

⸻

5. Beardo Godfather

⭐️ Rating: 2.5/5

Tried to get into this, but the DNA just doesn’t sit right on me. It’s bold and synthetic, almost too vanilla. I got tempted to buy this becuase it was 75% like Versace Eros flame. Not my style, but may work better on others or in colder weather.
Longevity: 5 hrs 
Use: Maybe layering base only, date nights, 

⸻

6. Skinn Raw (Travel Spray)

⭐️ Rating: 3.5/5

This used to be my clean white-shirt scent. Green-citrusy and uplifting. Almost done with it now—looking for something equally fresh but with better staying power.
Longevity: 4 hrs
Use: Café work, fresh vibe, casual day plans

⸻

7. One Man Show (Jacques Bogart)

⭐️ Rating: 3.5/5

Old-school powerhouse. Earthy, leathery, unapologetically masculine, Barbershop scent if you call it. One of my favourite, I know it’s polarising, but I vibe with the boldness. Not everyone’s cup of tea, but it hits for me. Indians locals haven’t loved this smell, was actually asked to stay away 
Longevity: 8+ hrs
Use: Close circle parties/ if you want to leave an impression/ meeting your ex.

Right now, my cuban company has all of my coffee plantations and most of my sugar plantations. So I think it may be more valuable to keep cuba as a puppet just so that their companies continue to exist in my market and provide prime good and throughput.

It was such a small thing, but honestly, it made my day so much better. 

Maybe it sounds kinda silly, but those little moments where someone goes out of their way to just say something nice... they create this unexpected peace in my heart. Almost like a reminder that there's still goodness to be found when you're not even looking for it. 

Anyone else ever find that a few kind words stick with you longer than you'd think? How do you hang onto those good vibes when life's busy or overwhelming? 💛",11,1751784493.0,EmotionalHarbor,0,1.0,False

1lsuspg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lsuspg/site_rules_rule_3/,"Site rules, Rule 3","Rule 3: If you hear rattling of chains, go to conference room 139, which is in building 87, in which, one of four scenarios will happen. 

 

Heya, it’s me Jhon again, nah, I'm just kidding, it is me, Samantha, you remember me, right? Oh well, it doesn’t matter that much. 

Anyways, today, Jhon encountered Rule 3, which is very simple but also confusing, rattling chain can be heard, no matter where you are, then you, yes, only one person can hear them at a time, normally Smith hears them, no idea why that is to be honest. 

Oh, but before I just get ahead of it, let me tell you what the rule is and the four outcomes ok, here they are. 

Rule 3: If you hear rattling of chains, go to conference room 139, which is in building 87, in which, one of four scenarios will happen. 

Rule 3-A; If the room is empty, return to your office, ignore the rattling of chains, during this time no other rules apply except rule 7. 

Rule 3-B; If the room has the corpses of children, close your eye and count to 100, don’t open your eyes, ignore everything trying to open your eyes. 

Rule 3-C; If the room has the corpses of adults, close your eyes and count to 10, after this use your weapon to shoot the corpse at the head of the table, that one is not dead. 

Rule 3-D; If the room has both children and adult bodies, run, run out of the building, ignore every other rule and run. Once you have left the resident’s, you are his target, your other watchmen will know why you are leaving, call us, 0000000000. 

 

So, Jhon was on his normal shift, he was on his 5 patrol of the night before he had heard the chains, and so, as you would expect from him, he consulted his rules, yeah, he carries the copy with him, most people do, except for Smith, he know them all of his heart. Well I can’t really say heart for Smith, I felt his pulse on my first shift around 4 years ago, and I felt a pulse yes, but, from the effects of Rule 106, yes, 106, pretty much you need to get an X-ray, he doesn’t seem to have one. 

Ahhh, sorry again, sidetracked again, anyways, uhh, where was I again? Oh yes, Jhon heard the chains, and he checked his rule book, and of course, Rule 3, chains, check certain rule, yada yada. And so, he went into building 87, and went to room 139, and, well, from what he told me he saw his little sister's body, alongside a bunch of other kids body, so a standard 3-B, I know, I'm sounding dismissive and all, but I have gotten use to all the rules, but i do still carry a copy of the rules, there is a few I can’t remember. 

Oh, yes Jhon, he didn’t shut his eye’s straight away, and I believe that is what made him, well, passed out right now, I'm in his apartment right now, oh and Smith took the blame for it. Yeah, Jhon, he is just passed out right now, Smith found him, just outside the building, hardly still awake, so I'm writing this based on what Smith told me Jhon told him, so I can’t confirm much of this. 

Jhon told Smith that he walked up to the room, and he had a feel run down his spine, a chill kind of, but it was something he hadn’t felt before, and o, to follow the rule, Jhon opened the door, and found a total of 15 children bodies, one of which being his sisters, and don’t worry, his sister is ok, she is sleeping next to him right now actually, she cried a bit when she saw her brother in my arms. 

She thought had had been drained of his soul or even stabbed, very cute to be honest, oh sidetracked again, sorry. Anyways, he didn’t close his eye’s, and he didn’t count, it took no less than 3 seconds for the man at the head of the table to start moving, he wasn’t there at the beginning, I promise. The man slowly got up from his seat and then just, appeared behind Jhon, and just slowly held Jhons shoulder, and the after that, it just went, dark for him. 

Don’t worry, there is still more info, there is cameras in every building, this includes building 1-38, and the camera, after Jhon passed out showed the man slowly draining Jhon’s blood, slowly, and he wrapped him in chains, this was before Rule 7 came along, Kito walked into the building and cut into the man, ad from that, they fought, and Jhon woke up and just slowly walked out, where Smith found him. 

Just before i let you all go, Smith did mention one last thing, Smith said that wind occurred at that time, i didn’t feel it, but i trust Smith, he wouldn’t lie, and considering the camera’s picked up on the man in the wind, I believe it, he walked into the building as well, and, I'm confused what happed, maybe we won’t need to worry about those rules anymore, and they kill each other off, it would be amazing if that happened. 

Oh, and I know Jhon will wake up soon, so, I'll go make him some coffee, he will be upset he will get a bit of a dock. ",1,1751784423.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1lsurvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1lsurvn/justifying_purchase_as_a_creative/,Justifying purchase as a creative,"I just realised the cost of the Apple pro monitor is £1500 which I’d be looking to buy for my new office set-up in the near future. Take that off the price of the AVP and it brings it down to 2k for a state of the art technology as a creative, wedding photographer who spends his day looking at his MacBook Pro. 

I go around coffee shops to get into a hyper focus edited a few days of the week so I know the AVP would give me that in abundance. 

My wife sees it as a big purchase regardless of how good it is but I feel like over the past year she has come round to the idea of it.

Turning 30 this year so I see it as the perfect purchase to mix business / gift. Plus I can claim back as an expense.

As others have said, I actually think for what you’re getting. Yes it is an expensive purchase but the value for what you get seems so worth it!

I’m sharing my thoughts but what do yall think? Agree/disagree?

1lsuoky,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lsuoky/breville_dual_boiler_or_barista_touch_impress_1300/,Breville Dual Boiler or Barista Touch Impress [$1300],"I’ve been wanting to upgrade my Nespresso machine for a while, and now that it’s finally died, I’ve decided it’s time to move on to a proper espresso setup. I’ve narrowed it down to two options: the Breville Dual Boiler or the Barista Touch Impress.

For some context: my partner and I both work from home, and we each drink at least two cups of coffee a day. I usually go for lattes, while she prefers her coffee black.

On one hand, I like the idea of a semi-automatic machine that doesn’t require constant tweaking to get a good cup (I value convenience and practicality). On the other hand, I know that pairing the Dual Boiler with a good grinder (I’m considering the DF64 V2) would likely produce better coffee, though it comes with a learning curve.

Here in Australia, both setups cost about the same, and I know many people in this sub would lean toward the Dual Boiler and separate grinder over an all-in-one machine. That said, I’m really curious to hear from enthusiasts who also value convenience. What would you recommend?

If there are any other options around the same price point that strike a better balance between quality and ease of use, I’m open to suggestions.

  He understood what they were thinking and saying: Old man that he is, what’s to become of him? Let’s talk it out, they were saying cautiously.  
  
  Let’s talk it out and come up with some solution while we’re here, all of us, and it’s on our minds. See if we can approach him about it, reason with him even if the timing’s bad.  
  
  Makes sense. Can’t put it off forever, no matter how painful it’ll be to say aloud.  
  
  I don’t know. Not now. Can’t we wait? Just a few days, maybe.  
  
  But he’ll not make it being alone, not likely, not half-crippled as he is.  
  
  Not used to being alone, they were saying. Not at all.  
  
  That’s true. That’s true. Always been somebody else around, even with all of us taking our leave, one by one.  
  
  She was here. When we were all gone, at least she was here.  
  
  Yes, that’s true. Won’t be the same now, not at all, not without her. Something’ll have to take up the slack.  
  
  What are we going to do? We can’t say anything, not now.  
  
  Soon. We’ve got to, soon.  
  
  He’ll be stubborn about it, whatever we think.  
  
  He’s got pride, all right. It’s his mark. Thinks he’s still bull  
\-strong, and it’s sad.  
  
  Still that way in his mind—bull-strong.  
  
  They were saying these things about him and did not know that he understood them, that he knew what they were saying. They were whispering among themselves that an old man’s mind plays tricks, that it feeds on the swill of illusion, like carnival shell games that are faster than the eye. They were saying it would be a great pity to see him that way.  
  
  It was now past midnight. They had arrived—his sons and daughters—in the afternoon and during the hours of the dark May evening, and they had embraced him and wept before him and then they had huddled around the large kitchen table to drink strong coffee and talk quietly among themselves in sad, worried voices.  
  
  They would not know it, but he understood what they were thinking and saying: Old man that he is, what’s to become of him?  
  
  He sat alone in his padded rocker in the middle room, near his rolltop desk, his good leg propped on the bottom brace of his aluminum walker, his head against the pillowed headrest of the chair, his eyes closed. He was not asleep, but he pretended sleep. It was better that way. He wanted his sons and daughters to get it said. Maybe by saying it, they’d get over it and wouldn’t hover over him as though he was an invalid.  
  
  He knew about hovering. He had been called home from Madison, from school, to care for his grandfather when he was seventeen and he’d hovered, watching his grandfather wither into death. He had not wanted to stay with his grandfather, but it was expected and he’d done it. He’d hovered, watching, watching. He did not want his children to be watching, watching.  
  
  They mean well enough, he thought. And they need to talk of something. They need to feel needed. They would not bicker, though. It was not the time or the place or the mood for bickering. Not now. Perhaps later, when they had stopped their pitying. And perhaps they should. They had tempers for it, each of them—temper and his pride (and hers). It would not be enough for any of them to give up an argument without their say. God knows, he thought, I’ve listened to them for more than fifty years, and they’ve never backed off without having their say. But they mean well, sitting there in the kitchen, drinking their strong coffee at the crowded table, talking of what would become of him.  
  
  The window beside his roll-top desk was open and he could smell the greening of spring and hear the squalling of swamp bugs, and clearer than the swamp bugs and the low, serious voices of his children from the kitchen, he could hear the sharp, spirited whistle of a whippoorwill below the barns. He opened his lips slightly, moistened them, drew in a breath and soundlessly answered the whippoorwill. She had liked him answering birdcalls—the whippoorwill, the bobwhite. In spring and in summer, at dusk, they had often sat on the screened-in sideporch and listened to the birds, and he had answered them, cry for cry, and it had pleased her to hear him playful after a day of field work. Sometimes the bobwhites would walk into the grass of the lawn when he whistled for them and she would whisper, “Look!” She would not permit anyone to kill the bobwhites that lived in the grainfields of their land. The bobwhites were too trusting, too easy to call up for the gunsights of a hunter.  
  
  Because of her, he had learned to look for the birds—the darting flight of wild canaries (yellow sun on yellow wings), the chesty preening of redbirds and bluebirds, the blackbird with the red-tipped wings like startling epaulets. Often he had strewn grain over the ground outside the kitchen window so she could see the birds feeding as she worked.  
  
  The grass of the lawn had been cut earlier that day by one of the sons-in-law off work, and the smell of the cut grass, through the window beside the roll-top desk, was sweet as mint.  
  
  He reached for a letter on the desk. It was an invitation to a reunion for the classes of 1910–1915 at Madison Agricultural and Mechanical—Madison A&M. Sixty years, he thought. Sixty years. The invitation had arrived that day. She had said, “I want to go to this. It’s been a long time since we went back.” And he had taken the letter and put it away on his desk. He had said to her, “We’ll see about it.” He read the letter again in the dim light of the table lamp. It was signed by Martha Dunaway Kerr. He put the letter back on his desk and nestled his neck against the pillowed headrest and closed his eyes again.  
  
  He could hear the footsteps of someone—perhaps two people—entering the middle room from the kitchen, but he did not open his eyes. The footsteps stopped at the door. There was a pause of silence, and he knew he was being watched. Then he heard the soft, backward steps of retreat. He knew what was being said inside the kitchen: “He’s sleeping.” And he knew someone (one of the daughters, likely) answered: “Let him. He needs it.”  
  
  Curious, he thought—knowing there was someone, perhaps two people, at the door leading into the room, knowing exactly where they were standing as they watched him, knowing they had walked back to the kitchen table. Or was it curious? No, he decided. No. It was his house. He knew it board by board, could hear the voices of its timbers and walk its walls in blind dark, reading its raised-lettered Braille with his fingertips.  
  
  He had walked the walls many times at night, going to her bed to see if she was sleeping, but he would not go to her bed this night. No, not this night.  
  
  He opened his eyes, felt them dampen. He moved his head on the headrest of the chair. He could feel the ache in his bad leg, in the thigh, in the hip that had been twice replaced with an artificial joint. One of his daughters (he could not remember which) had given him aspirin for the ache, but it had not helped. Tomorrow he would ask for something stronger from the druggist, something to numb the bruise deep in his hip, something pleasant to calm him, to keep him from reeling before the dizzying swarm of sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters and drawn-faced neighbors who would fill the house with their mumblings and their platters of food offerings. The druggist was wise enough to know what was needed. The druggist would know better than anyone.  
  
  The whippoorwill called again, but was farther away, deeper in the swamp.  
  
  He pulled his watch from his shirt pocket. The watch was tied by a cut-off shoestring that he had threaded through a buttonhole high on his shirt—a practice that annoyed his daughters because it made him appear unkempt. It was twelve-forty. It does not take long to die, he thought.  
  
  He stared at the face of the watch, at the dull lime green of the see-in-the-dark numbers and the long and the short hands, and he subtracted away the hours in his mind. Five? Almost six? He counted the hours again. Yes, almost six, he decided. It had happened quickly. He slipped the watch back into his shirt pocket and closed his eyes again. From the kitchen, he could hear the mewing of crying.  
  
  I, too, want to die as quickly, he thought.  
  
  She did not answer when he called (though he could no longer hear all voices well, he had trained his senses for her, knew her quietest words) and he pulled himself from the oversized armchair, up to the top brace of the aluminum walker, and dragged-walked from the living room to find her.  
  
  “What’re you doing?” he said in a loud voice. “Thought you were coming back. Thought you wanted to see the show on the TV.”  
  
  She did not answer, and he went from the middle room to the kitchen and then to the back bedroom. He saw her on the floor, near the bed, on her left side, and he knew immediately what had happened. He shoved his walker aside and tried to run to her, but could not and he hobbled, good leg, bad leg, leaning against the walls for support until he reached her. He touched her neck. He could feel a quivering pulse, a twitch of blood flow, but he could not feel her breathing, and he sank beside her on his good leg and turned her to him and slipped his arm beneath the cradle of her neck and pushed open her mouth with his fingers and closed his own mouth over hers and began to search for life with his tongue, but there was only the cooling taste of saliva. He kissed her gently.  
  
  “Don’t,” he said aloud. “Don’t do this. Don’t do this.”  
  
  He knew he could not lift her and it angered him. Old damned body, he thought. Old damned body. He eased her head down and pulled his arm from beneath  
her neck and rolled awkwardly and caught the knob of the closet door near him and drew himself up from the floor. The telephone was in the hallway and he stumbled, good leg, bad leg, to it and dialed a number. Four hundred yards away, across the sidelawn and a road, a daughter answered.  
  
  “It’s your mama,” he said.  
  
  “Mama?” his daughter asked, frightened. “Mama?”  
  
  He could not answer. He put the receiver back onto its rest and moved painfully back into the bedroom and sat on the side of the bed and looked down at her.  
  
  “Don’t do this,” he said again. “Don’t.”  
  
  He did not hear them entering the house and the room. He saw his son-in-law, worker-strong, lifting her and placing her on the bed beside him, and he knew the daughters—there were two living close and the one he called had called the other—were talking frantically, saying words to him that he did not understand or did not care to hear. And then there were men with a stretcher, and he could feel the muscled arm of another son-in-law helping him to his walker, and he was in the hospital where the antiseptic smell of medicines flowed into his senses and he was aware of other daughters, hastily called, and one of his sons.  
  
  His son led him to a chair near the bed and he sat, holding his son’s hand, and watched as his daughters approached her, leaned to her, whispered in small-child voices, “Mama? Mama?” And his son, the youngest of their children, a large, strong man, cried in a large, strong voice, like a prayer flung from his throat, “Old woman, I love you.” He could feel his son’s hand tighten in his hand. His son was sobbing.  
  
  He saw her push her head into the pillow and she opened her eyes and her lips parted, but she did not speak. Her eyes drifted across the faces of her children, then turned to him, held on him, closed. She swallowed once.  
  
  “Daddy?”  
  
  He opened his eyes and looked up. It was his oldest living son, who had driven the greatest distance in the dark May evening, across the mountains from Tennessee.

It’s late, Daddy. I think you’d better go to bed,” his son said. The voice of his son was baritone and gentle, an orator’s voice.  
  
  “What time is it?” he asked.  
  
  “A little after one,” his son answered.  
  
  “That late?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  He had slept remembering her dying, and he did not know it. He thought again: It does not take long to die.  
  
  “The others are here,” his son said.  
  
  He turned his head toward the kitchen door. His other children were cuddled, touching one another, staring at him. His children seemed very old to him.  
  
  “We’re all about to get settled in for the night,” his son told him. “Some of us will be here with you. We just wanted to say good night.”  
  
  He nodded and pulled himself forward in the chair and caught his walker with his hands. His son helped lift him. He could feel a burning in his bad leg.  
  
  “Do you hurt?” his son asked.  
  
  “A little.”  
  
  “You want something, Daddy?” asked one of the daughters.  
  
  “I gave him some aspirin,” another daughter answered.  
  
  “I’ll be all right when I get to bed,” he said.  
  
  “We’ll get the doctor to give you something stronger tomorrow,” his oldest daughter said forcefully. “He’ll do that.”  
  
  He stood leaning against his walker. He could hear the static of the swamp bugs, but not the whippoorwill. There was a pause, an uncomfortable lapse of time, an off-beat hesitation. His oldest living son embraced him. “We love you,” his son whispered. And they all came to him, bending across his walker, each embracing him, each mumbling to him, each stepping away, back into the cuddling of the group.  
  
  He looked at them. He could feel his head nodding. He said, almost numbly, “We’ll miss her.”  
  
  One of the daughters cried very suddenly, “Mama! Mama!”  
  
  2  
  
  There were many flowers at her funeral and many people, and he believed she would have approved of the service, though, for him, the preaching in the eulogy was a message of panic rather than promise—“Everybody’s going to die. Get ready for God now, while there’s time. O sinner, nobody knows the time. Nobody knows but Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen.”—and he tired of the singing trio with its off-key whine conjuring up images of angels and an old rugged cross and a gathering at the river.  
  
  He had always missed her intensely when crossing rivers, going away to work in other places. The rivers had been a ground rip in the space that separated them. Yes, we shall gather at the river. Gather. But why? Gather to wait? Gather to stare across? Gather to hear the waters rushing?  
  
  He wanted to touch her face.  
  
  “Remember this day,” the Preacher said to him and to his sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters. “Remember the passing of this loved one.”  
  
  On the night of her death, he had taken from his desk the journal that he kept daily and he had written:  
  
  Today my wife died. We were married 57 good yearsj.  
  
  It was the simplest entry he had ever recorded.  
  
  He would not forget the day. The Preacher would. But he would not.  
  
  He was led from the sanctuary of the funeral home where the service had been performed (her desire) to the car of his oldest living son and was driven to the gravesite where his oldest son—not living, but dead—had long been buried, and there he listened to a final, toneless litany. The Preacher paused before him, bowed just so at his gravesite chair, offered a handgrip and supplicant mutterings, and then moved to his sons and daughters, repeating himself like a parrot.  
  
  “Let’s go home, Daddy,” one of his sons said.  
  
  “In a minute,” he replied.  
  
  The coffin was before him, balanced on strong nylon straps like a prop in an aerial act. A blanket of roses covered the chest of the coffin. He looked at the dug grave and, beside it, the grave of his oldest son—smooth mound, brilliantly white, glittering with mica dust—and he wanted to be alone. He could feel a hand on his shoulder.  
  
  “All right,” he said softly. “All right.” He stood at his walker. He could sense eyes staring at him. “Goodbye,” he said to the coffin. He turned on his walker and moved away.  
  
  It was a day of sun—warm, bright, a soft wind from the west. The earth was green. The sun felt good on his face and hands.  
  
  In the afternoon, he took the druggist’s pill and went into his bedroom and slept and dreamed of Neelie, the Negro woman who had worked with his wife. In his dream, Neelie was sitting beside his wife’s coffin, talking to it. “I’ll put up the beans. Don’t you worry none. And cook up the biscuits, just like you been doing. Don’t you worry none about it, none at all. I’ll be around, taking care.” And from the coffin, in a voice from the roses, his wife answered, “Put his water glass on the table, Neelie. Put ice in it. He likes it that way. And salt and pepper. He’ll be asking for his salt and pepper.” And Neelie said, “Oh, yes, I will. All them things. Don’t you go worrying none. You just go on over and don’t be worrying none about it. Neelie’s here.”  
  
  When he awoke he could hear voices through the walls of the bedroom. The house is still crowded, he thought. The church committee of women, there to clean and cook and grieve, would still be placing food on the tables and there would still be buffet lines of visitors picking at the sorrow feast. He wondered if Neelie was there, with them, telling them what needed to be done. Neelie had rushed into the house when she learned of his wife’s death, had stormed loudly inside, shoving past children and grandchildren, and had embraced him with a squealing cry of torment. “Don’t you worry none,” she had said in a wail. “Neelie’s here. Neelie’s here.”  
  
  He could hear the smaller grandchildren outside, playing.  
  
  “Patty’s it.”  
  
  “No, she’s not. Patty’s already been it. Greg’s it.”  
  
  At the funeral home, one of his daughters had said, “This is only the second time we’ve all been together, in the same room. The first time was the anniversary. You remember, Daddy? The fiftieth anniversary for you and Mama?” And the funeral director had asked—for the obituary notice—how many grandchildren there were in the family. No one knew, and so the director had taken his pen and written down the name of each child and that child’s husband or wife in parentheses, oldest to youngest, and the number of children each couple had. The children were Alma (Hoyt), Lois (Tabor), Sam, Jr. (Melinda), Kate (Noah), Carrie (Holman), Paul (Brenda) and James (Saralyn). When the director added the number of grandchildren, the number had been twenty-eight.  
  
  “You’d think somebody would know how many grandchildren there are,” Sam, Jr. had said.  
  
  “Mama did,” Lois had answered. “She was the only one.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  He did not leave his bed until late, after the visitors and the church committee of women left. He ate a bowl of soup (made by Neelie; she had remained) and listened to his daughters speak of house-cleaning. He knew he could not object, though the house-cleaning was only part of it. They would want to watch over him now, hovering. For a time, at least. They would want to study him, like an uncertain experiment. They would want to know if he could care for himself. If he could not, they would want to say what should be done for him.  
  
  “We won’t be in the way, Daddy. We just want to get things straightened up.”  
  
  “There’ll be a lot of thank-you notes to write. We’ll take care of that.”  
  
  “Anytime you get tired of us, you can just tell us to leave.”  
  
  “Daddy, you think you’ll be all right here by yourself?”  
  
  In his journal, late at night, he wrote:  
  
  This is the saddest day I have lived in my 81 years. My wife of 57 years was buried today beside our son, who died in 1941 as a result of a truck accident when he was hitchhiking to take a job. She has longed for him all these years and now she is with him. I know they are embraced in happiness. Today ended for me a lifetime of joy and I am grateful to the Almighty for giving me the wife I wanted and the children  
we both wanted. Times were not always easy and I wished often that I could provide more than I was able to, but I can say that we had things that money could not buy. I will miss seeing her face and hearing her voice and knowing she was always there close to me. She has crossed a river from me that I must wait to cross before I see her again. When I see a river, I will think of her. All of our children have been here. They are very kind.  
  
  Again he took the druggist’s pill and again he dreamed of her. She was in the kitchen, at the cabinet counter, kneading dough. Two of their daughters were with her in the kitchen, working.  
  
  “He’ll be marrying again when I go. You’ll see. He’ll be marrying again. Find him some woman to come in here and do the cooking, some woman to take care of him. You’ll see.”  
  
  “Mama, don’t say that.”  
  
  “You don’t know him. I do. You’ll see. Somebody else’ll be living here, making him biscuits with my biscuit cutter, three times a day.”  
  
  “Is that right, Daddy?”  
  
  “That’s right. But she won’t have to cook a lick. Gonna find me a woman from one of them leg shows out in Atlanta.”  
  
  “Daddy!”  
  
  “He will, too. Find some old woman, hiking her skirts. Maybe Sybil Hillard. She’s had her eye on him twenty, thirty years. Used to come around at the canning plant when your daddy was running it. Didn’t know beans about canning. But he’d do it for her. Didn’t think I noticed, but I did.”  
  
  “Mama, that’s just being silly. Sybil Hillard’s one of the nicest women around here. She’s got a husband. They must have been married forty-five years.”  
  
  “You don’t know her like I do. I remember her at the canning plant.”  
  
  “Daddy, is that so?”  
  
  “I don’t remember Sybil Hillard ever being at the canning plant.”  
  
  “See, Mama.”  
  
  “But she’s a fine-looking woman, all right.”  
  
  “Daddy, stop it!”  
  
  “Let him go on about her. I don’t care. You wait and see. You just wait and see. There’ll be somebody here making biscuits.”  
  
  He awoke with the dream still clear in his mind. He smiled easily. The dream pleased him.  
  
  3  
  
  His daughters returned the following day to clean the house, and Neelie was there, also—not because she had been asked, but because she insisted and none of his daughters knew how to object.  
  
  “How can you tell her she’s not needed?” they said among themselves. “She thinks she’s got the right to be here. Ask her. She’ll tell you. She’ll tell you she’s been around longer than any of us, helping out when Mama needed her.”  
  
  And: “She’ll be telling us what to do, that’s for sure.”  
  
  And: “I guess she will. She always has.”  
  
  And: “Seems to make Daddy feel better, having her here.”  
  
  And: “Maybe she thinks we’ll be taking things out of here without her permission.”  
  
  He did not stay in the house with his daughters and Neelie. He got into his truck and drove it to the edge of the field and got out of the truck and began to work in the small nursery plot of pecan trees, pulling away weeds, laboriously pushing himself from tree to tree with his walker. He thought of himself as an ancient turtle, dragging in inches across the crust of topsoil, legs clawing and legs pushing, stopping, resting, moving, resting again. But it did not matter. He was at peace in the nursery plot. Once he had had acres of trees growing out for the selling, but now there were only a few rows. She had not wanted him to plant them, but he had. “No need of it,” she had said. “You can’t get about on that walker as it is. Can’t take care of them. No need of it.” And he had argued, “I’ll go easy with it. Just put out a few, just enough to have some on hand if people want them.” But he had known, even when he planted the seeds, that the trees were for him, not for people who may want them. He liked the growing of them, liked the surgery of budding and the smell of the wood and the pruning of limbs. “They’ll be the last,” he had promised, and she had scowled at his stubbornness. She had said, “You get to hurting, and see if I run off to get you some medicine. No sense in it. You got trees all over this county. No need to be growing any more.”  
  
  He moved along the row of trees, setting the walker, leaning his weight onto it, feeling the walker sink into the topsoil, slowly, slowly moving, pulling at the dead weeds of winter and the new, tender weeds of spring, shaking the soil from roots of the new weeds, throwing the weeds, roots up, into the middle of the row to wither in the sun.  
  
  He looked back down the row, at the peculiar tracks he had made—the single, hard footprint, the four punch-holes of the walker. He looked at the slender stalks of the trees, at the pulled grass in the row’s middle. He had not moved more than fifty feet in two hours. Old turtle, he thought. Going nowhere slow. The sun gathered like a pillow in his hat and across the bridge of his shoulders.  
  
  At lunch he would take the druggist’s medicine and sleep, but he did not want to be in the house now, not with his daughters and Neelie rummaging like thieves through cabinets and closets and drawers, filling boxes to be carried away. They would take away much of her in the trunks of their cars, leaving just enough for her to be vaguely present. A jewelry box. A robe in a closet. A hat for Sundays. Slippers. A shoe carton of letters. Enough for him to see her in rooms, like fragments of telltale clues in a shallow mystery. But there was no mystery. She had died, and his daughters—their daughters—and Neelie were removing her, room by room. They would work quickly, he thought, agreeing among themselves that it was best for him not to see what they were doing. And he would not question them. It was their ritual—a rite of daughters. And of Neelie. Neelie deserved to be there. Neelie knew the house better than any of them.  
  
  He stood upright and stretched the muscles of his back and then took his handkerchief and rubbed the perspiration from his forehead and eyes and from the band of his hat. Then he fanned his face with the hat.  
  
  There would be only one place his daughters and Neelie would not clean, he reasoned: his desk. The desk was private. None of them had ever opened his desk or asked about its contents. “Don’t bother the desk,” she had warned their children. “That’s your daddy’s. Leave it alone.” And their children had obeyed and had passed the warning to their children and they, too, had obeyed.  
  
  The desk contained his records and letters and journals. The records and letters and journals contained his history, and hers and the history of their children, written in the shorthand of days and seasons and years. Children born. Dates, names, weights. Measles and chicken pox and mumps and broken bones. Date occurred, date healed. Year by year. The planting of crops, with free-hand drawings of contour maps. Year by year. Date planted, date harvested, yields, prices, net-from-gross sums. Cow names, cow breedings, calves dropped, calf names. Tree seeds planted, trees budded, trees sold. Droughts. Freezes. Gain, loss. Gain, loss. Year by year. His letters and records and journals were like orderly albums of photographs—words in odd, staring poses. But no one had ever opened his desk or asked about its contents.  
  
  He could hear the sharp clap of a door closing, and he twisted his weight on the walker, propping on his good leg, and looked toward the house. Neelie was crossing the yard in a long stride, her arms swinging in exaggeration like a triumphant swim stroke. She has them doing what she wants done, he thought. Exactly. Neelie was in command. It was in her walk, in the erect carriage of her slender, tall body, in the polished, hard blackness of her face. Neelie was in charge of the house-cleaning and his daughters were helpless to stop her.  
  
  Neelie crossed the road and followed the path under the orchard of pecan trees near the field. She stopped at the edge of the pecan rows. Neelie had worked most of her life in the fields. On her sixtieth birthday she had vowed never again to walk into one.  
  
  “Not even if Jesus told me to,” she had said defiantly.  
  
  “You come on to the house and eat you something,” she called in her high, shrill voice. He waved his hand and nodded.  
  
  “Don’t you go  
pulling up no more of them weeds,” Neelie ordered. “Too hot out here for old folks like me and you. You get yourself back inside before you go falling out. Lord, Jesus, Neelie can’t lift you up, you go falling out.”  
  
  He waved again and turned carefully on the walker and began to move back down the row, over the pulled, withering grass. Neelie stood watching him, arms crossed. She was talking rapidly (scolding him, he guessed), but he could not hear what she said. He knew it would be useless to argue with Neelie. She would badger him with her voice until he surrendered. And it was hot. And he was tired. Neelie watched him until he reached the end of the row and his truck. “You need some help?” she asked in a loud voice.  
  
  “No,” he said.  
  
  “Lord, Jesus, I swear you gon’ kill yourself in that old truck,” she complained. She shook her head in disgust and began striding back to the house.  
  
  He lifted the walker and put it into the bed of the truck and, holding to the door handle, pulled himself up into the cab. No one trusted his truck, or him in it. He did not have a driver’s license, but he did not care. The truck was a grand possession—old, paint bleached to the metal and the metal stained with rust. Its motor banged, parts hammering against parts. Its gears were loose.  
  
  “What gear you got it in, Daddy?” his sons and daughters would ask.  
  
  “I don’t know. One that moves,” he always answered.  
  
  The truck jerked like an animal shuddering under its skin. But it was his truck. His. He could no longer walk over his land, and the truck carried him, two sluggish old things getting about. Let them snicker and shake their heads in pity. It was his truck, by God, and he loved it. And his grandchildren loved it. His grandchildren were always pestering him to take them for rides.  
  
  He did not inspect the house or ask his daughters about the boxes stacked on the sideporch. He went into the kitchen and sat at the table where Neelie and Lois and Carrie were sitting, polishing silverware. Alma and Kate were clearing cabinets, stacking the contents on the counter.

At a glance, the vibrant red finish and metallic sheen immediately make it a focal point in the kitchen. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, this masticating juicer performs impressively well, boasting a special 80 RPM slow speed processing that extracts juice efficiently without causing foaming, clogging, or unnecessary heat. This dual-stage system ensures you get every drop of nutrition from fruits and vegetables, making it a must-have for anyone prioritizing health.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact size of the juicer, measuring 6.5""D x 10.6""W x 13.39""H, blends function with elegance. Its sturdy metallic finish adds a premium feel while ensuring durability. The juicer is relatively heavy at 17.66 pounds, which keeps it steady on the countertop during operation. Quiet-operation appliances are always a plus in my book, and the Omega J8006 delivers remarkably in this area. It runs smoothly, proving that a small kitchen appliance doesn’t have to roar like a lawnmower to get the job done.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using this juicer is a breeze. The single speed combined with self-feeding functionality allows me to juice carrots, leafy greens, and even the occasional orange without much fuss. The auto pulp-ejection function means extended continuous juicing sessions are possible without constantly pausing to empty the container. I also appreciate the thoughtfulness in design—everything assembles and disassembles seamlessly, making cleanup hassle-free, even though it’s not rated dishwasher-safe.

**Strengths**  
- Quiet operation makes it perfect for morning juicing without disturbing the household.  
- The slow masticating process ensures no loss of nutrients from excessive heat.  
- Durable build quality with stainless steel blades and a metallic finish.  

[Discover if Omega J8006 is on sale at Amazon.](https://kitchenchampions.com/p/b01exel1i8/)

**Performance and Outputs**  
Having juiced everything from hard produce like beets to softer ones like pineapples, the consistency and yield are top-notch. During one of my “experiments,” I threw in some kale followed by an apple, and the juicer handled the varying textures without hesitation. The resulting juice was vibrant, perfectly filtered with minimal pulp. While I enjoy an occasional fiber-boost, those who prefer a silky-smooth juice will find the fine strainer perfect for their needs.

**Key Benefits**  
- High efficiency that minimizes waste.  
- Produces clear, nutrient-dense juice.  
- Runs on just 150 watts, making it energy-efficient.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While using the juicer has been mostly satisfying, there are some hurdles worth mentioning:  
- The lack of dishwasher-safe parts might deter those who prioritize convenience.  
- Its weight makes frequent relocation inconvenient.  
- Limited to juicing; no spillover functions such as nut milk or coffee pressing.  

**Other Competing Products**  
Having dabbled with other juicers like the Breville JE98XL centrifugal model, I noticed some differences. Breville focuses more on high-speed performance, but this often leads to heat buildup and a less smooth juice texture compared to the Omega J8006. However, the Breville is easier to clean and slightly more affordable. If noise reduction, nutritional integrity, and durability are your top priorities, the Omega shines bright in comparison. It’s also worth noting the Hurom slow juicer as an alternative, though it’s priced at a premium and produces comparable results.

**Value for Money**  
Given its stellar efficiency and robust construction, the juicer justifies its cost for those passionate about fresh and healthy juices. The peace of mind from the extended 15-year warranty helps offset the initial investment, albeit it isn’t the most budget-friendly option. However, if you juice regularly, this can quickly become a smart purchase over time.

1lsugsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1lsugsd/observations_on_the_effects_of_alcohol_and/,Observations on the effects of alcohol and caffeine while on SR,"When I was younger, I looked forward to parties with alcohol or even just having a few drinks at the bar with friends. It made things more fun and lively or in other words, it raised my vibration. Events were more enjoyable under the influence.

I used to also be an avid coffee drinker. Three to four cups a day was a normal occurrence. I wouldn’t be able to function at full capacity without it. This also raised my vibration. 

I’ve noticed a very clear pattern while on SR - the opposite happens. I end up not enjoying social gatherings as much when I drink and caffeine overwhelms my system instead of helping me focus and stay alert. 

Simply put, these two substances consistently raised my vibrations before SR and consistently lowers my vibrations while on SR. 

I believe this is because my base form is different now. I was constantly depleted and running on low vibrations during my PMO days but didn’t know it yet because I didn’t know what it felt like to not release. Now that regular retention has made me see what life is like at a higher vibration, it’s obvious that alcohol and coffee no longer serve me.

It’s a simple yet profound discovery for me. It makes me that much stronger of a believer of the long term effects of SR. So many people rely on substances to enhance their experiences in life. Now my base form is higher than my alcohol and caffeine enhanced experiences in the past.

I hope this hits for some of you because this has been a powerful realization for me. Never in my life would I have thought that what used to enhance my experiences would one day do the opposite. Our semen really is a magical substance that should be respected. ",5,1751783127.0,Semenretention,4,1.0,False
