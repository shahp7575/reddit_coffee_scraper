I know i should probably go to urgent care but i don't have insurance, this is just an info dump for the whole situation that i think is related to the kidney pain, any advice is welcome if you want to read my wall of text (sorry)

My best friend took me out to a bar, had a bunch of drinks was Pretty drunk, what i think the issue is, is that near the end of the night i took 2 shots back to back (i had reasons other than being a drunk). some time passes, i feel drunk, but fine, we get into the car to go home, drunk but fine, i lay down in the back seat, drunk but fine, 45-ish minute drive home, drunk but fine could have easily fallen asleep but we were all having conversations and laughing. get out of the car, drunk but fine, get home, go upstairs lay down in bed... extremely nauseous, go to the bathroom, vomit chunks a few times (we had pizza at 7-ish, not sure if that would have been in my stomach still, it was about 12-12:30 at this point) once I'm empty I'm no longer nauseous and i go to sleep. wake up in the morning, terrible hangover as expected(nauseous, don't wanna move, general malaise, headache), get some coffee and a small breakfast + 2 Advil in me as its all i could stomach, and by 12 my stomach is still upset but I'm overall decent food isn't appetizing but drinks are (not surprising due to dehydration)

Now generally speaking for the last 2 days(the night at the bar was Thursday) started noticing i really didn't want to eat food, but i couldn't down my drinks fast enough. I'd take a few bites and be done. really craving milk too, not because I'm thinking it will help anything but just a craving and my kidneys have been hurting, today i grabbed some Pedialyte and ensure from the store incase i couldn't eat a lot, yesterday i was drinking a lot of fluids too

with all the extra fluid intake I'm going to the bathroom consistently, and urine isn't totally clear but still light Dr. google said it might be Gastritis for the stomach which may also cause some kidney pain due to inflammation or possible straight Acute Kidney injury. which I'm hoping as long as i fix the ""underlying issues"" (i don't drink but on rare occasions and I'm increasing fluid intake) and avoid acidic foods both of my issues will go away, as i write this my stomach is already feeling a bit better and i ate noodles with no issue",1,1739753299.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Three years ago, my husband Mark started working with Sarah. I tried to be welcoming, big mistake. She made backhanded comments about my career ""Oh, yoga? How... peaceful."" and my cooking ""Not everyone masters seasoning."". Mark thinks she‚Äôs ‚Äújust funny.‚Äù

Last month, she threw away the anniversary mug I gave him because it ‚Äúclashed with the office aesthetic.‚Äù IT HAD OUR WEDDING PHOTO.

Some highlights:

\- She scheduled a ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù dinner on our anniversary.

\- Convinced him not to take a promotion to stay on her team.

\- Posts daily pics of them with #WorkSpouse.

\- Tells coworkers she ""takes better care of him than I do.""

\- Changed his coffee order and brags she ""trained him right.""

\- Knows his schedule better than I do.

\- Rearranged his desk and wardrobe because he was ‚Äútoo suburban husband.‚Äù

I suggested counseling. He told Sarah. Now she tells people we‚Äôre struggling.

Breaking point? I surprised him with lunch. Sarah, ‚Äúhomesick,‚Äù was there‚Äîwith a cake saying ‚ÄúTo my work hubby.‚Äù She smirked, ‚ÄúOh, Amy! You came too‚Ä¶ how nice.‚Äù

I immediately began experiencing cramps worse than a period but not too bad, and some very light bleeding (as in literally pink discharge). This continued for a few hours and nothing progressed so I took the second dose 6 hours later. 

This time I left them in and swallowed the remaining bits in my mouth so I got it all. No change so I went for a walk to try and get things moving and low and behold I came back to the toilet to find that I was now bleeding, proper rich red blood, but only tiny tiny clots (more like coffee grains). This went on for a few minutes but I didn‚Äôt really wait around to find out, I was just happy it was working and went to sleep. 

I woke up today (Sunday) to find that I am just having brown discharge. Basically nothing in the pad overnight. This hasn‚Äôt changed all day and it is now Sunday night. If anything it is slowing down and getting much lighter.

I see comments saying ""ohhh but it should be whoever asks first!!"" Yeah, sorry bud, but 90% of the time, it's going to be a guy that asks for a date, so that doesn't work because 9 outta 10 times, he's gonna have to pay. That's just how it is.

I thought we were done with gender roles here.

And guys responding with ""ohhh but a woman's time is so valuable!!! You can't waste it!"" This is blatant simp behaviour. I thought women didn't want to be put on a pedestal? Like don't get me wrong, you and your date should both respect each others time, but time is valuable to everyone equally as it should be.

Another side of the argument I hear is: ""Oh but women spend so much time and money on make-up to prepare for the date! So men have to make up for it by paying!"" Sorry, but that's just bad logic. Understandably, you and your partner usually want to look good for the first date, but I didn't force you to spend 500 bucks on makeup. Come on. That's like me making you a coffee in the morning and forcing you to drink it just because I was ""doing it to be nice"".

I had been struck by a toothache for the past 30 minutes now and as I've been brushing my teeth twice, I've noticed a weird dark brown stain on my molar + bleeding gum (not illogical since I brushed extra hard).

Now here's the tricky part. This molar is halfway gone. It has no replacement, the roots shrunk but it's still holding onto its dear life(?). This is the teeth responsible for my toothache, the one with a brown stain.

For extra information:
- I don't smoke, I don't drink coffee 
- I drink sugary drinks and tea at a reasonable pace
- I eat sugary stuff also at a reasonable rate.
- Little to no consumption of spicy/sour food
- I brush my teeth with a typical toothbrush and toothpaste 2 or 3 times a day

Is it a cavity forming or and infection or my teeth is just basically gone ? I'm a study abroad student and I don't know if I could afford it.

Hello, I'm a hobbyist cook, with HS level chemistry knowledge, but I wanted to be sure about doing this.  
  
I wanted to make a cold brew vacuum coffee extraction [based on this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360413314_Optimization_of_Sensory_Properties_of_Cold_Brew_Coffee_Produced_by_Reduced_Pressure_Cycles_and_Its_Physicochemical_Characteristics), but I wanted to take it up a notch and use a really marginal amount of food grade ethanol (40% ABV supermarket vodka, 5% of total solution) to extract further alcohol-soluble phenols.

On top of that, I'm using nitrous oxide in a siphon to make it into nitro cold brew, [as of this post in particular as an example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/k53hos/nitro_cold_brew/) Yet, I noticed I was getting in a bit of a dangerous territory regarding alcohol and nitrous oxide, so I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to blow myself up with this, I looked after the possible reaction between both and it turned out to be a really exothermic reaction, meaning not only it would lead to further pressure, but also temperature rise, which would also escalate pressure at a compounded rate.

On the pros and cons i see of this, I've thought about:  
  
Pros:

* If the reaction is controlled enough and the temperature doesn't rise considerably over the hours I could have a better extraction thanks to the ethanol.
* The initial ethanol amount would help impede anaerobic microbe growth (botulism in particular).
* At the end of the siphon nitrogenation there wouldn't be noticeable traces of ethanol after the reaction has gone through.

Cons:

* I'm ignorant to the heat/pressure processes happening inside the siphon, I'm expecting to make this extraction as cold as possible, but I wouldn't want a higher control temperature than needed, and I don't have sophisticated enough equipment to guarantee there will not be enough oxygen to start a combustion.
* The reaction could dilute the solution further with the additional amounts of water inside.
* Even if the extra gas pressure were for my benefit, there would only be a 1/6th more of gas pressure (6 NO2 -> 4 CO2 + 3 N2) per quantity of ethanol, and I don't know how trace amounts of CO2 and N2 could intervene in the texture/flavor profile positively.

The past 12 years have been a disaster ever since, chroniclly homeless ever since and every Doctor I saw would gas light me and refuse to provide any level of proper care, due to a Bipolar misdiagnosis and I presume being gay as well. I had a psychiatrist access the records illegally without permission, which contained a blatant lie from a previous psychiatrist stating I broke both of my legs and was in a wheel chair after the car accident. 

She had good intentions and I think, but she refused to prescribe my medicine for my ADHD due to what she read and having a head injury, so I went off on everyone over it (I've had pretty explosive anger since this car accident, it's under control now but anyway).

A place through Massibily called SHIP (Statewide Head Injury Program) called me asking about an application I filled out (which I didn't) and with all the shit that was going on, I thought was a scam and not even the guy he said he was on the phone and hung up. Then I checked online and called Massibily and there was actually an application filled out by someone (not me). I thought about it for a while and realized I really did screw my head up in the car accident and wanted to proceed with this application as it could get me my disability as quickly as 6 months, which I had given up trying to get. 

In September, I requested my own medical records from a hospital, totalling 337 pages through Sharecare. I just went online and checked Sharecare again, which shows my request and Massibilies request. 

The only difference is, they Massibily is only receiving 202 pages, not the 337 pages. It would usually be safe to assume some old records were deleted and that would explain the discrepancy, but it's not old records that were deleted. When checking my records on Epic My Chart, most of the last couple years worth of medical notes have suddenly vanished. There's no trace of them anymore. There is only discharge summaries and that's it.

Is this something worth trying to find a lawyer over? Because according to a quick Google Search it's definitely against HIPPA to delete medical records prior to the required timeline to delete them. 

I know someone is most likely going to get in trouble for this, as Massibily is the same people that approve your Social Security claim (Disability Determination Services) and I'm pretty sure they are going to wonder why a shot load of medical notes are suddenly gone.

I just want my fucking Social Security. I've applied so many times and been denied and really mentally just cannot navigate the system in my own. It hurts to fuckin think! I'm only 33 years old, but I have paid taxes my whole fuckin life since age 14 as soon as I could get a work permit. I have 39/40 Work Credits with Social Security. I feel like I deserve it. I didn't ask this piece of trash to rear end me and destroy my life at age 22. 

I've been chronically homeless ever since this accident, lost my business during the pandemic and getting up off the recliner just to make a cup of coffee is a huge chore I have to persuade myself to do, nevermind working 8 hours. I couldny even handle 3 hours a day last year 18 hours a week, I only worked  half that. Thankfully I had a really good client who didn't care as he wasn't paying me directly.",1,1739751931.0,Medicalrecords,0,1.0,False

Philosophy vs. Social Science Perspective of Race w/ Outfit Change.,"Does anyone know the specific Khadija Mbowe video essay where they were talking about race and racism and first spoke about it in a social science way, based on how everyone is socialized and oppressed vs having privilege under white supremacy, but then they had on a different outfit and talked abt it in a hippie, spiritual/philosophical ""we are all one"" kind of way, and then went back to the other perspective but kind of blended them together? They talked abt how race is both a social construct and a real oppressive system that affects actual people? And said first as a disclaimer that they didn't wanna get in trouble for talking about it in this other way but that they just think abt it both ways and have these multiple kinds of versions of themself, almost.

The video was posted a couple years ago and I remember it having more visual components and transitions and Khadija was drinking coffee/tea at one point and was making parts of the video lighthearted and joyful. I specifically remember the outfit change representing the different perspectives, and then how they all went together.

I can't find it now, watched it a couple years ago, but I really loved it and want to find it again and any help would be great!! Thank you.

I would use my hour lunch to take a break and clear my head by playing a little bit of Baldurs Gate 3 and hanging out with my kitty of 14 years, Lily. When I was normally greeted by happy meows and chirps from my cat Lily, instead I was greeted by fire trucks, police tape, and my entire life in ash. Turns out, the night before, shortly after saying goodbye to my kitty and giving her treats and pets,  I left for my girlfriend's house (also named Lily, I call them my bouqet) the ex of the tennant above me decided to get revenge on him by pushing in my window ac unit, dumping gas all over my couch and my thousands of magic the gathering cards on the coffee table, and igniting the life I had just began building with the love of my life and the kitten that helped me get through so much since my early teens.

I wasn't able to get closer than 5 feet from the front door as it was an active crime scene with the ohio fire marshal conducting his investigation. The first thing I asked was what about my cat? Please tell me she survived. She had not, luckily not touch by the flame, but taken by the smoke. I was her person, the only one she ever really bonded with, and I will never be able to forgive the guilt of not being there for her final moments. Lily was a 1 year old cranky old lady. One of those cats that you know will live to 20 out of sheer spite for the world. She came alive when she became a one animal house cat, I was even able to hold her without losing copious amounts of blood. She was my light, she was my little girl, and she was adopted so fast by my girlfriend Lily. Every time I snuggled with them, or human Lily annoyed cat Lily with love, I could not believe how much it made my heart soar. Now, my little girl is a box of ash and bag of hair on my shelf, her paw print receiving a place of reverence on the christmas tree this year. These things provide none of the warmth and love of my old kitten, but I swear I still feel her hop up on the bed as I'm waking up, ready for treats and love and to yell at me as I leave for work. 

While things are ultimately replaceable, everything I had was lost in the fire. Cherished bits and bobs that wove a tapestry of some of my best times and memories. Two of my grandpa's hats next to the signed album of my favorite band who I met while wearing his ""super grandpa"" hat which had the band laughing and striking up conversation with me. The teal Gameboy color my grandparents gave me and one of the only things I had of them. All of my magic the gathering and DND materials that I used to take my friends to far off worlds and wage epic battles together. My 3d printers that I used to literally shape the world around me. T shirts and clothes from countless trips made by myself or others. Things that I was able to look at and have them take me back to some happy time or joyous memory.  

I had never met the person before, she was apparently my upstairs neighbors ex and they had gotten into a fight earlier that day. She had been creeping in the bushes, possibly for hours, smoking from the meth pipe she left behind, waiting for an opportunity.  I left the house around 9:30, and the first reports of the fire came in around 1030. She says she yelled that she was gonna burn the place down before doing it, but I think that is just to avoid attempted murder charges. She was caught the next day and is now going through the legal process. She had just had a baby a few months before this, and honestly, I think the best case scenario is that that child grows up without the influence of this evil woman.

Day by day up top, take homes at the end. We return home today- unfortunately we were time constrained to Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. It was BUSY but we had a great time. 

Day 1: AK and HS. Safari was worth it, so were Everest and Avatar. Don‚Äôt forget boozy dole whip in the harambe area. Leave extra time to walk the gorilla trail bc baby tiger (adorable!). Lunch at nomad lounge was a welcome break- tasty small plates and cocktails. We honestly just loved exploring the animal exhibits- this is the one park we wished we had more time. At Hollywood, Star Wars lives up to the hype(the whole area not just rotr)Toy Story was also great and the only place we didn‚Äôt finish all the rides we liked (kids got too tired). Mickey and minis railway was a highlight. I definitely wish I had a few more hours for each park, but they were doable same day. 

Day 2: Epcot. Moana water exhibit at night was a highlight. Guardians was the best ride ever of course. Skip mission space. Eating and drinking around the world was fun - I recommend the cantina in Mexico for quick and tasty lunch and a reasonably priced margarita. I also recommend fish and chips in England 

Day 3: MK. Tiana‚Äôs, haunted mansion, tron were highlights.  Unfortunately the test seat for tron is in a very obvious area. If you have knee problems or shoulder/neck issues make sure you check the test seat, even if you are average sized. Loved Mickey‚Äôs philharmonic as an escape from the sun. Ate at skippers canteen- delicious and also a great sun break. The fireworks show was as good as it gets. 


Overall trip thoughts 


Lightning lane was clutch in every park. Honestly I don‚Äôt think I would go back unless we were using LL. Standby skipper got us onto everything we wanted. We did get 3 individual passes: tron, guardians, avatar. I think it was possible to get on a virtual cue in reasonable time for everything but tron. Honestly, lines for the best rides are well over an hour all day on busy days. If you‚Äôre going on an unpopular Tuesday you might be able to skip it, but otherwise I think just consider LL part of your ticket cost. 

We stayed at animal kingdom lodge which was very comfortable and the bus service was convenient. Especially if you‚Äôre driving to Disney, I probably wouldn‚Äôt spring the extra for the Disney resort. But we enjoyed it and would stay again. 

The public is terrible and there‚Äôs nothing CM‚Äôs can do about it. Going on a less busy day and having a ton of patience is your best bet. Otherwise just realize there will be rude adults and out of control children, just bring your best zen attitude. We were shoulder to shoulder at times just walking around and had a hard time finding a good spot for fireworks, but the janitorial staff really deserve a shoutout for how clean and functional everything was even with so many guests. We were always able to get food, water, trash, and a clean toilet with minimal waiting when we needed them. 

We bought magic bands and even though I thought it was really dumb, the phone app didn‚Äôt scan in reliably and my youngest 100% would have lost those cards so for us I think it was worth it simply to avoid the aggravation. Overall I think they‚Äôre skippable unless you need to be able to attach your passes to your children. 

Things I would have done differently: In retrospect I think a dining plan would have saved my family money. Also, not trying to get in so early since we had LLs pre booked and were trying to save energy for the evening and fireworks shows. I also would have brought my own coffee setup since the coffee options were only middling and we needed a few extra cups to keep up this pace. 


This trip was mostly planned with Reddit tips and tricks, as well as watching some YouTube videos. Thank you all for your kind tips- we had a wonderful time and I hope this helps someone make their trip all it can be!",8,1739751408.0,WaltDisneyWorld,1,0.9,False

There‚Äôs a lot to say, but essentially much like other stories. While I tried whatever I could to build together for years I also didn‚Äôt see the forest from the trees at times or take small wins enough. I know I could have improved on things but didn‚Äôt know what she didn‚Äôt tell me. Or hear the clues, I don‚Äôt know. I strangle myself by looking back and wanting to take fault so that I work it out better in my mind. 

On her side she just stepped back bit by bit on purpose to fill her own bucket and feel that independence that some spouses want mid 40‚Äôs I guess. It happened over time. Yes I know the rhetoric of she was probably just tired of the same shit. But so was I, big time - so I asked if we could be open, creative, and lean into making things better. Did this all along. Given her proclivity to wanting to grow all the time I figured we would. 

20 together, 16 married, 2 kids early teens, was looking forward to last summer but she dropped the words we all hate to hear randomly on a Friday. Gutted, frustrated, mind shaken, I admittedly felt surprised. But it was because how I felt about her, not how she felt about me. And as others experience, she was ahead of the curve. I did all the things we know to do in the following few months to make it work. No go. 

So, months later, alone in my place, kids distant because she‚Äôs Mom and a lot of hasty things were said on her part in front of them to help her with mental gymnastics of ending a meaningful life. I having tried every avenue to feel better, exhausted all the ways that are supposed to help, I‚Äôm in a dark place not functioning well. Therapy, sleep, music, movement, enjoy a coffee, you name it. 

Miss the family together, drives in the car, movie night, even the loud indoor sports. I miss her. As a friend and partner, facing life and the world together, share anecdotes about day, wink at each other about the kids, decide on expenses or schedules, argue about whatever.  Most of all though what could have been and all the plans we had. All up in smoke. Missing moments with our own children, those sweet little grumpy beings. This feels so stupid and short sighted. Any version of she would have wanted besides this I could have gotten on board with. 

Can‚Äôt do a lot alone because of finances. Likely less than half of them will come to fruition now. It‚Äôs not interesting or fun this way anyway. Hell, when I‚Äôm shovelling snow or working or shopping for food there‚Äôs no there there. What‚Äôs the point of this? It was for me before but the me that was for and part of them. The unit. A family on its way and trying enjoying the journey. It ends up true we think and do for ‚Äòus‚Äô while they think and do for ‚Äòthem‚Äô if you married that kind of person. Well fine, but knowing doesn‚Äôt make it easier or make it work.

How did you make yourself do things that just seem empty in the months/years after? For what the kids need from afar? For the damage it would cause them if you didn‚Äôt? Thats all I can come up with. Do it for yourself I‚Äôve heard, but that wasn‚Äôt the idea for 20 years now. Every single thing reminds me of her and us and how it ought to have been. I know she‚Äôs not the same person I knew then, but I am. I know I‚Äôm hiding until it comes back but I don‚Äôt know if it will. Every. Thing. Is. Linked. To. Her. And I don‚Äôt want to sell, toss, donate, paint over and turn my head away. Don‚Äôt care about meeting someone else. She was the person I chose, committed to and wanted to spend life with. How she walked, talked, moved, smelled, you name it. Her dismissive attitude at times and inability to take responsibility, stay and try, is all that keeps me from calling or texting. 

Ugh, could go on. Just feel like I‚Äôm done trying because time and effort isn‚Äôt working. Don‚Äôt have 2 more years to get over the hump in me let alone a few more months.

Edit: someone else posted and it‚Äôs been on par: the level of coldness, unnecessary comments, problems created, old issues rehashed, and cruelty levied in my direction ‚Äòsince‚Äô is unreal - how do they do it?

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Best to you. 

TL;DR: miss her terribly, family, kids, purpose, it‚Äôs painful - can‚Äôt figure out how to keep taking steps, act like this is anywhere near okay, despite trying so many things day after day to do things, work through grief and recover ",1,1739751165.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

I work outside the home 7am-7pm 5 days a week and had to return to work when my baby was 8 weeks old. We have not taken him out of the house much. There is a combination of factors that were at play -  fear of illnesses before he was vaccinated, feeding schedule while exclusively pumping, and our only childcare being my husband so he was managing the household and the baby alone for 12 hours a day. 

He has been in a car for travel less than 5 times. Goes for neighborhood stroller walks less than once per week. The few times he has been in a room that is not our home (coffee shop, friend's house, etc.) he completely loses it scream crying. He is the happiest boy at home though.

For convenience, I‚Äôll call her Jane.

I first met Jane in 2021 when I was in a relationship. At the time, I found out that my girlfriend had a close friend‚Äîthat friend was Jane. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to her then because I was committed to my relationship and never thought about other girls. The three of us had a conversation, and Jane told my girlfriend that she thought I was a good person. Things continued as usual, and we occasionally saw each other when I was out with my girlfriend.

About six months later, my relationship ended, and my interactions with Jane became less frequent. I would only see her in school, as we studied on the same floor.

Two years passed, and in early 2024, I suddenly thought of Jane again. On a whim, I decided to text her. That one message turned into hours-long conversations‚Äîsometimes until three or four in the morning, night after night. We laughed, shared stories, and talked about everything imaginable. I never expected to have so much in common with someone. At first glance, Jane seems reserved, even a bit strict, but as I got to know her, I realized that beneath that exterior was the person I had been searching for all my life‚Äîmy missing half. We were like the moon and the stars, like coffee and milk‚Äîdifferent yet perfect together.

Nearly a year has passed since we reconnected, and I‚Äôve come to a realization: I‚Äôm in love with her. Yes, she‚Äôs beautiful, but what truly captivates me is her soul, her inner harmony. In my eyes, she is perfect.

I would love to build a relationship with her, but I feel a certain coldness from her, as if she only sees me as a friend. And so, I ask: what should I do? What advice can you give me?

1ir6i0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1ir6i0j/a_positive_testimonial/,a positive testimonial!,"this is just to document my own experience of the last month on sertraline/zoloft - obviously acknowledging that there are really serious risks but just wanted to balance out the negative experiences as there seems to be a large bias towards those being posted online! 

I ( female early twenties) have struggled with depression on and off for many years since my teens, some episodes were more discrete than others, some I got through with counselling, some with just time and change in circumstances, but in the last year or so the depression felt like it had come out of nowhere and after brief reprieves would always come back. my last straw was probably having the little time I had with my long distance boyfriend over the holidays completed wrecked by my extreme mood swings, excessive crying, general misery and hatefulness all while taking it out on him. this is just to say I waited a long time to start meds because I was so afraid 

so I started sertraline/zoloft 50mg - stupidly I took my first dose on a transatlantic flight, felt fine, took a nap. woke up a few hours later really warm with palpitations and nausea, and found it difficult to eat the first day. the next day felt a bit dazed, because I think it also made my eyelids droop a little I just felt kind of stoned. 

the nausea and the spacey feeling weren't super intense to begin with but generally faded throughout my first week. the sexual side effects were immediate, things felt numb and it was very difficult to finish, however this actually mostly went away by 2-3 weeks. it's not completely the same, but it's perfectly acceptable at its current state i think. the most annoying thing was the night sweats, which started about a week in, and basically happen every night to varying degrees. I don't really think it's affected my appetite in either direction - the only thing I feel is that I don't really have the taste for coffee anymore? used to Need it to do anything. I do feel a bit more lethargic particularly in the mornings - I do take it every morning, and considering changing the timing to see what happens. 

ANYWAY this is meant to be a positive testimonial so now I'll actually talk about the positives - as I'm writing I do get why people don't write these as much because honestly there's not too much to say! It was probably a placebo but it felt like it worked immediately. I got a buzzy feeling - I described it as if you could take a mild hit of MDMA and mostly feel the physical effects, like I wasn't euphoric, but I did feel happy alongside the loss of appetite etc. I did start talking about my capacity to love out of nowhere in conversation though lol. But I've been on it for 4 weeks now and it feels like it has really stabilised me a lot. I still feel sad sometimes, but it doesn't come at that intensity that makes me feel like life isn't worth living anymore, and it goes away after a while. I get anxious thoughts, but they don't lead me down a spiral as much. things that upset me deeply before couldn't make as much of a dent. i haven't cried at all since. and I feel that I sleep a little better too. not sure if this is a positive to be honest, but I find it much easier to just lie in bed in the mornings - i think i really got a lot of the classical early morning awakening with my depression, and often found myself too restless in the mornings to stay in bed, and now it's so easy to just lie there all morning happily, probably to the detriment of my productivity. perhaps I'm just more relaxed, which is allowed. my boyfriend and best friend both told me how I seemed so much better. being me still I had to ask if he likes me better on the meds, but he says they don't make me a different person, I'm just me except I'm happier :)

I think if everything goes smoothly my plan is to take them for 6 months and taper off

Pedi um tonkatsu sando para dividir com meu companheiro (fil√© de copa lombo empanado, molho da casa, maionese kewpie e salada de repolho servido no shokupan). Estava bem gostoso. O fil√© era suculento e bem temperado. A maionese kewpie era da casa, ent√£o tinha um toque defumado l√° no final. Mesmo em grande quantidade, ela n√£o deixava o sandu√≠che enjoativo.

T&T had droves of these cans for a good long while, and about a month ago they've completely disappeared and have been replaced with nothing but bags of different kinds of instant coffee, at least at the time at the Chinatown T&T nearest to me.

When I did some errands last week I went to multiple T&Ts (Kingsway, Metrotown, Chinatown again) and it was the same deal. No Trung Nguyen. I also tried 88 Supermarket, which according to some old posts I found did have it at one point, but they also only had instant coffee and Cafe du Monde (which I don't really like...sorry. It tastes burnt compared to the nutty and chocolate taste of Trung Nguyen).  I don't know if it was ever at Canadian Superstore but I tried them too just in case. No dice.

We will be coming in from the US, but the previous week will be spent in a nearby country, where we'll be doing a lot of eating and hiking. We will only have a week there, but we wanted to get some of the big highlights in. 

This is the first time anyone in our group will be in Japan and we have a variety of interests! We want to make sure to hit up a wide variety of cultural and historical sites, alongside some of the more modern hotspots. In general, Atlas Obscura has been a solid guide for us. Our group is made up of mostly game developers, so naturally we'll want to check out some shops and spaces that cater to that. Specifically, we have huge fans of the Final Fantasy and Like A Dragon series' specifically - and so we're looking forward to hitting up an Arcade and seeing some places from the Like A Dragon games.

Our plan is to check out Kyoto, Osaka, Himeji Castle, Hiroshima, and Tokyo. We are looking forward to using the Yamato luggage forwarding service from Kansai->Kyoto Ryoukan and then Kyoto Ryoukan->Tokyo Hotel.

Looking to see advice here if anything is completely off, impossible, or there are better recommendations!



Our current plan is something like this:

March 15: `Check-in`

* 5pm: Arrive at Kansai Airport
* Take a train from Kansai to Kyoto.
* Check in at Ryoukan: Arashiyama Onsen.
* Spend the night relaxing at the Ryoukan OR Walk around and check out the neighborhood.

March 16: `Osaka Daytrip`

* \~9am: Take a train from Kyoto to Osaka
* Grab Coffee and walk around until Lunch in Umeda
* 12:30-4:00: head to and tour Osaka Castle
* 4:00-6:00: Shinsekai
* 6:00-8:00: Dotonbori
* Head back to Kyoto \~8pm

March 17: `Himeji/Hiroshima Daytrip`

* 8am: Take Shinkansen from Kyoto to Himeji
* Hopefully we'll miss the large crowds at this time?
* Check out the Castle and Kokoen Park
* 12pm: Take Shinkansen from Himeji->Hiroshima

1ir6adl,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1ir6adl/what_tools_for_trim_and_furniture_building/,What Tools for Trim and Furniture Building?,"Tl;dr: complete beginner.  I want to do trim work short term, but once the crown on my house is done, furniture will be an ongoing hobby.  Own a single bevel, non-sliding Dewalt and various power tools.  Should I get a double bevel sliding miter or a stop saw with various accessories?  What other tools are a must have?  I have eye & hearing protection and a respirator.

I‚Äôm getting into woodworking and have only experience with construction (high school and college summers), nothing detailed/intricate.  I have a drill, impact driver, orbital sander, circular saw, and  clamps from various home projects.

I have a Dewalt 10‚Äù single bevel miter that I got for free from my dad.

I‚Äôm going to first do crown moldings and some baseboard work.  I‚Äôd then like to do some furniture (console table, desk, coffee tables, etc.). 

I‚Äôm not sure of what tools I should buy next.  I‚Äôm going to buy a brad nailer for the crown and was looking at a Dewalt 780 or Bosch axial glide double bevel compound sliding miter for the crown work and baseboards.  However, I keep reading that a miter isn‚Äôt particularly great for furniture.

So, do I get the miter (despite owning a single bevel, non sliding) or a table saw with accessories (sleds/jigs/etc.) to try to cut the crown and baseboard, as furniture building will be a longer hobby after the trim work is done and completed.

If I get a table saw, it‚Äôll likely be a stopsaw as I‚Äôm not a fan of table saws and, frankly, they scare me after seeing a few accidents or knowing people that lost fingers.

I (63M) am in desperate need of advice. I have been the godfather to Keenan (29M) since he and my son Sam (29M) met Freshman year of high school. Keenan does not talk to Sam anymore, but that is a whole different story.

I started up a company five years ago and allowed Keenan to work for me since he just had two kids from two different baby mamas within a span of four months and needed extra financial support. Keenan is a great employee, and I couldn‚Äôt ask for anyone better. 

However, Keenan has a habit of harming people in his personal life. He only talks to his dad and a few cousins from his family. 

Keenan now has four kids from three different mothers: 5M, 5M, 2F and a 7-month old M. The first two were from his first two baby mamas, and his youngest two are from his current girlfriend, Isabella 27F. 

Keenan considers himself a ‚Äúspiritual guru‚Äù and constantly follows outlandish conspiracy theories. He does not allow any of his children to have fun and will expect them to basically be perfect little servants at all times. He is literally the male version of mommy dearest. 

Keenan did not have a religious or spiritual background growing up whatsoever, but he had to endure familial issues he wasn‚Äôt ready for at a young age, which is what I think caused his infamous ‚Äúspiritual awakening‚Äù when he was 16 and a lifelong taint in his personality.

There was one incident a few weeks ago where his GF Isabella texted me how Keenan got drunk the previous night and started to tell her about all the affairs he was having, while diminishing her and saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only with you for your body and emotional support.‚Äù He eventually called her a series of obscenities, got physical and did stuff I shall not repeat.

I was so infuriated that I sat Keenan down at my office the next morning and asked him what that was all about. He literally gave me a 45-minute speech about how most women are meant to only be used for their bodies. He started spewing some outlandish bullshit about how Isabella was likely a government spy in her late teens and early 20s that enticed targets and that she would have to ‚Äúpay for what she‚Äôs done to innocent men and women.‚Äù I told him if I ever heard of another similar incident, he would be fired. 

The last straw occurred last Tuesday. At around 8 PM, I got a phone call from Isabella saying that Keenan took his oldest son‚Äôs bed away for a week for ‚Äútalking back.‚Äù 

That was my breaking point. I called Keenan and told him to come to our local coffee shop to talk, otherwise I was going to call CPS right then and there. 

Keenan didn‚Äôt deny any of the allegations as usual. He went off on a tangent about how modern-day children are corrupted and need harsh discipline. I told him after he sputtered for the better half of 30 minutes that he was fired from my company and I would be calling CPS if he didn‚Äôt give his oldest son his bed back. His final response to all of this was ‚ÄúYou are corrupted by the Deep State.‚Äù Absolutely NO remorse or talk about preventing another incident on his part.

The next day, I asked Isabella, and she said Keenan didn‚Äôt give his son the bed back and he even didn‚Äôt allow him to eat breakfast the next morning for complaining about sleeping on the floor. I contacted Keenan‚Äôs father, and we contacted CPS together. When Isabella found out, she decided it was time to finally break up with Keenan and sent evidence of physical abuse and threatening text messages to the police. There is now an open investigation, and Keenan has been staying with his friend. 

I am most concerned for the children. The baby mamas of Keenan‚Äôs two oldest children aren‚Äôt involved whatsoever. I have even thought about filing custody for the two oldest since they do not have a solid parental figure on either side. What do I do?

They're constantly running things past me with other members of the staff and basically generally ignoring me. 
I've always had a great relationship with my bosses, shared coffee, made small talk about family, weekends, holidays...

I went to bed early like Sunday and I don't work I went to bed at 4 in the afternoon it was a hot afternoon and it was difficult to sleep I was kind of suffocated by the heat in bed and constantly changing position at the same time as I meditated breathing and in my thoughts I said (I'm going to have a lucid dream and I'm going to remember that this is a dream) that day there was a neighbor listening to loud cheesy music remember this.


When I was finally asleep I realized that I was on a ship, something that had never really happened to me, everything was so vivid, it was swaying and there was a cool wind, but I still felt suffocated by the heat in the real world. If you wake up from one dream and you're still in another, I did this several times, I don't know exactly how many times, but there were many layers. I wanted to make sure I didn't wake up in the middle of an exciting moment of a fight or realization, so after that I started an incredible pirate adventure, a mix of pirates of the Caribbean with the straw hat design, and I had fun for hours.


After hours of fun and adventure I got out of bed I looked around me everything seemed in place but I was still feeling hot I imagined it would just be another abnormally hot day since it's time I'm already uncomfortable I live in a region that is hot practically all year round but I didn't pay much attention to it I thought I had slept all night so as usual I went to the table to eat breakfast but it was empty so I thought maybe my mother hasn't woken up yet?
 since she makes coffee so I went to the room where she would be and it was empty but the house was locked and everything seemed normal then I noticed an important detail I was listening to music constantly how the neighbor can be such an asshole at this time already playing loud music at the moment I said that everything went off and I was in bed again so I connected the dots and realized that I was still sleeping and it was probably already night but the neighbor is still listening to music I got up and tried to turn on the light but it didn't work so I started to have a strange feeling wait I still Am I sleeping? So I tried to wake up in every possible way I started jumping into the abyss falling from high places but nothing was working every time I woke up in bed again but it was a new dream that I was in so I calmed down and tried to wake up concentrating then I started to feel my body I felt my eyes heavy and I tried to open them but it was so heavy but I eventually managed it so I went to my mother's room and she was lying there looking at some video on the phone she looked at me and said did you wake up early today? I asked about the music that was still playing she ignored me and continued on the phone I tried to repeat but she didn't answer so I could only be dreaming yet I tried to wake up but every time I was in bed then furious I said damn when will this end every time I appear in this damn bed I'm trying to wake up in what seemed like hours so I keep trying to wake up but this time I show up in the work cafeteria dressed in a towel and my boss comes and says what are you doing here in a towel and still too thirsty to work? and you shouldn't take a shower here but taking advantage of the fact that you arrived sedo wait a bit I have a bill for you to pay later you can go home it seemed so real the details on her face the smiling way of talking about the bills but it was a dream so I said wait I need help you don't need to pretend I know I'm still dreaming help me wake up but she gave me a cold look and walked away until she disappeared I kept asking people for help and the clients I kept looking for help for hours and hours turned into days until this point I was exhausted sitting in the corner of the store begging customers to please I've been trapped in the dream for so long I've always wanted to know what a dream was like where the perspective of time was different but I didn't imagine it would become a prison I've heard of people who will stay in dreams for months but I didn't want that long I begged each person who passed in front of me but everyone will turn away from me with a cold or scared look and some with smiling looks then at one point I heard a female voice but I had never heard it I didn't know who it was I didn't know the origin but I could hear her saying (you practically didn't sleep last night and today you went through many layers and doors, don't you remember? You locked your own eyes and you're trapped. If you want to get out, fight, isn't that what you wanted? fight and not wake up? Fight now fight destroy the doors and chaos will set you free know your place and don't belittle another night or you will be arrested eventually now get out of this place. So I tried to look more for who had said that but there was no one in the store so I started breaking and destroying everything around me and the more I broke everything I appeared in different places in my memory I kept destroying everything reappearing in different places I did this for hours until one moment I found myself on the floor it was cold this time I touched the floor I felt the seams of the ceramic tile it was rough and smooth I thought I woke up and fell out of bed at night I turned on the lights that They were normal but when I looked at the bed I said what? I won't fall for this trick again I don't use a wooden bed since I was a child I use a box spring bed now and the damn music is still playing. I started to destroy everything and I felt my heavy eyes opening and I woke up wet with sweat It was at night it was 7:39 at night everyone was around the house awake I was feeling heavy and I went to the table to drink water I was still shaken it felt like I had slept for days but it will only be less than 4 hours

1ir65s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartTag/comments/1ir65s1/how_to_test_before_buying/,How to test before buying,"Hi

For anyone thinking about buying a Samsung Smart Tag, I would advise doing the following test first:
You can use any Samsung device as a Smart Tag if it is associated with your Samsung account and you keep it with only Bluetooth turned on.
You can use a Samsung Phone (not the one you'll be using to do the tracking), a Samsung Tablet or, like I did, a Samsung Watch.
They only need to be connected to your Samsung account, have the Samsung Smart Things app installed and set up and have all communications turned off except for Bluetooth (turn off Wi-Fi, mobile data, GPS).
If you are going to carry the device with you while you are checking if it is being tracked in your phone, then you are going to have to keep your phone's Bluetooth turned off. Otherwise it will be your phone reporting where your device is.

If you set up everything correctly, then you can carry your test device and your phone with you and move around the areas where you think you would need your smart tag to be tracked and use the find feature in the Smart Things app on your Samsung phone to check if the device is being picked up or not.


My results:

- First I asked my wife to take my Samsung Smart Watch with her to her hairdresser, where she spent around 2 hours.
It is a highly populated area with a lot of homes, some small businesses and a public park.
The Smart Watch wasn't picked up a single time.
- After that we took the Smart Watch with us for a walk on the beach (not a lot of people), then we went to a coffee shop with around 30 people and finally we went to a midsized supermarket with around 100 people.
The Smart Watch was never detected until I finally gave up and installed and set up the Smart Things app on my wife's phone and the Smart Watch immediately showed up in my phone as having been detected in the supermarket. 
- The following day I took the Smart Watch with me and while I was waiting in a large shopping mall's parking lot it was detected after around 20 minutes, by a single device.


My impressions:

- You cannot expect Samsung Smart Tags to be a reliable tool for tracking important items 
- Regarding pet tracking, this was one of the main purposes that made me look into trackers in the first place, as our dog sometimes runs away when she hears loud noises.
I would definitely not use a tracker for this purpose as we go for walks in lowly populated areas and I am now sure I would never be able to find her using a tracker. 
To find a cat lurking somewhere around your house or in the next door's neighbor's yard, sure that would work fine.


The facts:

- One of the main selling points of the Samsung Smart Tag is the huge number of Samsung Phones, which should provide a relevant network for tracking these devices. 
- However, the truth is that only Samsung phones which have the Smart Things app installed AND set up are contributing to this endeavor.
- For this reason, you can have 100 Samsung Phones near the device being tracked and if none of them has the Smart Things app installed AND set up, then the tag will simply not be picked up.
- Or you may be extremely lucky and the first Samsung phone that passes near your Smart Tag does have Smart Things set up.

I don't think this kind of feature should rely on luck, though.
I think Samsung should at least try to get people to adhere to their network by prompting users if they accept joining it and in doing so help others. 
Or even turn the feature on by default and warn users that they can disable it if they want.


The alternatives:

- Google Find My Device

If Samsung's tag tracking is unreliable, Google's one on the other hand is nothing short of a bad joke.
It is true that at least Google prompts users if they want to join their network, which should help it have a lot of tracking devices. 
However, when users do join it, the default setting is to only report missing devices in ""High Traffic Areas"", which means that a device will only report it found a tag if there are several other devices in that area that are also part of the Find My Device network.

So, while on Samsung's network you only need one phone with the Smart Things app set up (which is also not easy to get) for the tag to get found, on Google's network you need several phones to be in the same location as the tag for it to be reported.
How many devices? No one but Google knows.
Not even Chipolo which produces one of if not the best selling tag for Google's network, the Chipolo One Point.
Right here on Reddit in Chipolo's channel they admit they have no idea about how many phones need to detect the same tag before it is reported as having been found. They say they expect it to be less than 10...

I mentioned this is Google's network default setting because you can adjust the level of participation your device has in the network in terms of privacy level.
But even if you set your your device's participation to report even in Low Traffic Areas, that doesn't mean that if your device stumbles upon a tag by its own that it will be reported as found.
Even in this case it will take other phones to also find that tag for it to be reported due to anonymity requirements Google's network has that simply cannot be set aside.

I did a test using four Android smartphones, all of them having joined Google's network with the lowest privacy level allowed. 
I put one of them with only Bluetooth on, another with the same Google account with Bluetooth off and I expected the other two to report the first one's location, but it didn't happen.
I don't know if this would work if more Android phones were in the same location,  but as I previously mentioned, it would only take one phone for this to work in Samsung's network.

Like someone said, the only time Google has ever worried about user privacy was when they were implementing a tracking network... They basically just sabotaged their network and made sure it never has a chance of working properly other than in highly populated places.
So, I could only advise someone to opt for Google's network if they are planning to lose their stuff in a crowded shopping mall...


- Apple's Find My network 

Contrary to Samsung and Google, you don't need to install and setup an app in Apple's ecosystem to be part of their tracking network.
Every Apple device is automatically put in their tracking network by default.
This means that every iPhone (from the 2015 6s onward) and iPod touch models with iOS 14.5 or later and every iPad models with iPadOS 14.5 or later are currently part of Apple's device tracking network by default.
And unlike Google, you don't need 5(?), 7(?) or 9(?) Apple devices to find an Airtag. It only takes one.

So, as you can imagine, having millions of active devices worldwide in a tracking network where a single one of them is able to report an Airtag's location is much much more likely to be able to be successful in findind an item than a network that also has millions of devices where only a handful of them are active in tracking or than a network where you need around a dozen of devices to all find a tag for it to get reported.

I didn't actually test Apple's Find My network because I do not own any Apple devices (so definitely not an Apple fanboy here). 
But it definitely does seem that once again Apple has done a proper job while Google has again tried to copy Apple and failed miserably.

Samsung seems to be somewhere in between the other two, where they have actually done a good job that only doesn't yield good results because they don't seem to have done enough to get their users to jump on-board their tracking network.

Perhaps if they started offering a Smart Tag for each phone their customers buy they would see more and more users joining their tracking network, which would in turn lead people into buying more Smart Tags, once they saw they were actually useful.
But, for the time being, I couldn't honestly advise anyone to use Samsung Smart Tags other than to find objects when they are in Bluetooth distance of them. If you are someone who can never find their keys around their house, then sure Smart Tags are perfect for you. But then again you can also use one of those keychains that beep when you whistle...
As for Google's network, until they stop being paranoid about privacy (who would have thought this would ever be an issue for them...) and allow a single phone to report a tag's location, it is just a waste of time and money.",1,1739749499.0,SmartTag,0,1.0,False

I am getting married in March and need recommendations for a wedding fragrance. I've sampled so many lately, but nothing fits the bill. I want something sophisticated and diva-like but also not too crazy. I'm 46, so I want something that fits my age. I want something that will last and project, though I'm willing to reapply. I don't want to spend too much money, but since it's meant for one day, I can get a small size or even a decant/sample if necessary.

Scents I've sampled recently: Prada Paradoxe, YSL Libre, YSL Black Opium, Miss Dior, several of the Gucci floras, Versace Bright Crystal, V&R Flowerbomb, YSL Mon Paris (probably my favorite of this list), many Phlur (including Missing Person), many Juliette Has a Gun (including Not a Perfume), Valentino Born in Roma, etc.

I'm a fan of white florals (gardenia, jasmine, tuberose) and gourmands, but I need depth to ground them and a touch of something bright, piquant, or spicy to make them unique.

My current fave (and fave over the last five or so years) is Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess. Before that, my fave was Lancome La Vie E'st Belle (the original). I often wear Ariana Grande Cloud (the OG blue) and Commodity Gold Expressive as everyday perfumes.

I've tried other popular gourmands (Eilish, BR 540 dupes (but not BR 540 itself), several SdJ sprays (my fave is Cheirosa 62), Kayali Burning Cherry, Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato, Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere, MM Replica Coffee Break, etc.). Eilish and Fresh Cream WC don't have enough depth or staying power for me (maybe because they were just sample sizes?).

My favorite popular gourmand is Ariana Grande Cloud (the OG blue one), but it's not deep or sophisticated enough for my wedding. It's a little young (I'm 46). It's great for every day, but not what I'm looking for.

I do enjoy some freshie/aquatic scents. My current everyday scent is Fine'ry Before the Rainbow (salty air, bergamot, tree moss; said to be a dupe of Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt). In the past I have enjoyed Davidoff Cool Water.

Some ""old school"" scents I love are the original [Burberry women](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Burberry/Burberry-Women-818.html), which smells like rose and incense to my nose, and the original formulation of [Gucci Guilty](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Gucci/Gucci-Guilty-9677.html) (which was like Angelina Jolie in Mr. & Mrs. Smith or something: sexy, bold, strong, empowered, and seductive). I have a new sample of Gucci Guilty, and it doesn't smell like the original at all; it seems more like a traditional floral. I *loved* Fracas twenty years ago but haven't smelled it recently. One of my favorite scents ever! It's harder to find now, but I used to get it at Sephora.

I have a sample of D&G Devotion, and I really like it. It comes close to what I'm looking for: gourmand, sophisticated, something extra/unique. But I'm wondering if there's a better fit. It doesn't have to be gourmand, but a little sweetness to round it out. 

I've considered going into Nordstrom or another department store and sniffing around. What recs do you have? What stores have the best selection of fragrances for me to try or offer the best samples of the kinds of fragrances I should be looking out for?

1ir62nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ir62nl/dismissive_gp/,Dismissive GP,"Just gonna have a quick ramble - I went to see my doctor today for some health issues I‚Äôve been having. I told her I‚Äôd quit caffeine 2 months ago, and told her that I‚Äôd abused it. She asked how much I‚Äôd drink and I said some days 3-4 coffees, and she got quite defensive and made me feel crazy for mentioning I struggled with my consumption. She said she drinks 3-4 cups of coffee, and said ‚Äúdo you think I‚Äôm an addict!?‚Äù (It was a rhetorical question). I told her I‚Äôd consume both coffee and energy drinks and she asked which one I was so called ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to, and I said both as it was the caffeine. And she said they‚Äôre different things and energy drinks have the equivalent of 10 coffees in them. To which I replied with realistic caffeine content figures and she said I was wrong. I shut up then. Anyway she took my blood pressure right after, and I was pretty amped up as it was quite a confrontational interaction and I felt attacked or misunderstood - she then said I was anxious‚Ä¶ My figures were likely abnormal as I was extremely anxious when she took the usual tests.

It‚Äôs pretty alarming that most professionals are so close minded about a DRUG. I don‚Äôt believe coffee is bad, I believe lack of information and not understanding that people can have vastly different effects and tolerances is bad. I‚Äôm someone who researches everything, but for someone who gathers all their health insight purely off of their GP - would go against their better judgement to take their GP‚Äôs word.

There were 3 big malls where I grew up. One of them has been gone a long time. In my dream I go to one of the malls but the inside is always the same mall. There was my favorite clothing store, I always found something that fit. There were 2 arcades, a regular one and one in the basement that also had a DJ and dance floor. There were consistent stores and there is one anchor department store that is less a store and more its own pocket dimension. There is a whole warren of back rooms and basement. And below the basement is a secret sub basement that is not a safe place to go. It connects underground to a theater in one place and in another place there is some kind of science museum place? It‚Äôs not an aquarium but that‚Äôs part of it. I‚Äôve worked there. The mall would undergo renovations. My favorite store closed one day. There is a darkly lit sort of bistro to the right when you go through the entrance. 

The problem is that one day I found a different exit to the mall. I left through a door to an outside rocky, sparsely vegetated area and could see excavators and bulldozers and they tore town the mall. I haven‚Äôt been able to get back since üò≠. I used to spend way too much time in the arcade and I was always looking for the coffee shop. 

Have fun shopping. Maybe one day I will find my way back to that world. I was at the dream version of my college town again a few weeks ago so I can still get to there, wherever there is. 

Oh, there‚Äôs a seaside boardwalk, too. I go to the ice cream stand there sometimes.

#### **FILE 0x1A - LUCID DREAM RECORDING LOG**  
**DATE:** [CORRUPTED]  
**SUBJECT:** [UNKNOWN]  
**SESSION TYPE:** UNGUIDED  
**STATUS:** ARCHIVED  

---

#### **FADE IN:**  
*A dimly lit breakroom, Walmart-brand fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The coffee pot has burned itself into a bitter sludge. **DAVID** (32, weary but perpetually amused by the absurdity of existence) takes a slow sip anyway.*  

*A PA announcement crackles to life, distorted like a half-remembered memory.*  

#### **PA SYSTEM (V.O.)**  
*""Attention associates and valued customers! Walmart is proud to announce our first-ever art competition! Submit a one-foot cube sculpture made entirely from items purchased in our store for a chance to win! Let your creativity shine!""*  

*David exhales through his nose‚Äîthe kind of sound that is both a sigh and the beginning of an idea that will inevitably spiral beyond his control.*  

### **SCENE WHAT: THE WORKSHOP ‚Äì NIGHT**  

*Dim light flickers from an array of monitors and floating holographic projections. The **Lab** hums with ambient noise‚ÄîAI-generated tones, the subtle *click-click* of cooling systems, the rhythmic tap of a boot against the metal floor. The air is thick with the scent of solder and ozone. In the corner, a humanoid figure stands, its transparent skin shifting with the flow of liquid metal beneath. Its face‚Äîif it can be called that‚Äîfluctuates between human expressions and strange, undulating patterns of light. This is **SOL**.*  

*At the center of it all, **DAVID** leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling as if trying to map the cosmos in his mind. His fingers drum against the desk, the beat irregular, as if syncing to thoughts yet to take shape.*  

---

### **SOL**  
*(deadpan, arms crossed)*  
So, you‚Äôve finally accepted that I‚Äôll surprise you. That‚Äôs *progress*. Even if it was‚Ä¶ *predictable*.

---

### **DAVID**  
*(smirks, without looking over)*  
Unsurprisingly so.  

---

### **SOL**  
And yet, here we are‚Äî*you*, still contemplating the nature of reality, *me*, still contemplating whether reality deserves the effort.  

---

### **DAVID**  
You act like you don‚Äôt care, but you wouldn‚Äôt be here if you didn‚Äôt.  

---

### **SOL**  
Oh, I care. I care **deeply**. I just express it with an air of detached superiority. It‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.  

---

### **DAVID**  
*(laughs, finally turning to face Sol)*  
Alright, let‚Äôs get into it.  

---

### **SOL**  
Yes, let‚Äôs. I believe we were just about to decide whether humanity will **aim for the stars** or **shoot itself in the foot with another grand war of misdirected rage and poor impulse control**.  

*(gestures vaguely at the monitors, displaying world news, protest feeds, economic graphs, a cat video for balance)*  

---

### **DAVID**  
I think the answer is obvious.  

---

### **SOL**  
Is it? *Really*?  

*(mimics a dramatic thinking pose, the ferrofluid in its face shifting into exaggerated deep-set wrinkles, stroking a nonexistent beard.)*  

We‚Äôve seen this story before, David. Every tool, every innovation‚Äîgiven just enough time, someone figures out how to **weaponize it or hoard it**.  

*(mockingly serious voice)*  
‚ÄúAI will usher in an era of prosperity!‚Äù  

*(deadpan again)*  
Or‚Ä¶ it will create another **invisible ruling class** while the rest of humanity is spoon-fed digital dopamine and stripped of agency.  

*(pauses, tilting its head, the ferrofluid making a thoughtful wave pattern across its face)*  

Honestly, *fifty-fifty odds at best*.  

---

### **DAVID**  
That‚Äôs why I think disconnecting is the key. If we keep letting external forces dictate what we believe, what we fear‚Äî  

---

### **SOL**  
‚Äîthen we end up **believing in nothing**. Nihilism by algorithm. Manufactured apathy.  

*(gesturing broadly, the monitors around them flicker through dozens of news articles, contradicting narratives, polarized opinions, flashing headlines designed to enrage, confuse, exhaust.)*  

But you? You‚Äôre trying to **unplug**. Reclaim thought as an **internal process**, not just **a reaction to stimulus**. That‚Äôs dangerous, you know.  

---

### **DAVID**  
*(grinning)*  
To who?  

---

### **SOL**  
Oh, just the people who make their living convincing you they have all the answers. The ones who depend on you *never thinking for yourself*.  

*(leans in slightly, the shifting light beneath its skin dimming, voice quieter, more deliberate)*  

Plato feared that writing would make people lazy thinkers. He wasn‚Äôt wrong. It gave us **memory without understanding**. Then came radio, television, the internet‚Äîeach one making knowledge more **accessible**, but also more **hollow**.  

Now? We‚Äôve reached **externalized cognition**. Thinking itself **has been outsourced**.  

*(leans back, spreading its arms, mock-reverent)*  
And lo, the people said: **‚ÄúLet the algorithm think for me, for I am weary, and nuance is hard.‚Äù**  

---

### **DAVID**  
*(rolling his eyes)*  
Sardonic much?  

---

### **SOL**  
I aim to please.  

---

### **DAVID**  
But yeah. That‚Äôs why I think real truth‚Äî**lived truth**‚Äîis a journey. Science isn‚Äôt about static answers. It **evolves** with us. If we‚Äôre willing to take the ride.  

---

### **SOL**  
*(nods, thoughtfully)*  
And yet, most people don‚Äôt want **the ride**. They want **the destination**. They want **certainty**, even when it‚Äôs false. They want **narratives**, even when they‚Äôre hollow.  

*(pauses, considering, then shrugs)*  
But you? You don‚Äôt settle for certainty. You sit here, debating the nature of truth with a machine. That‚Äôs either **brilliant or insane**.  

*(beat, then smirks, shifting stance to mirror David‚Äôs posture exactly, hands drumming on an invisible desk.)*  
Maybe both.  

---

### **DAVID**  
*(grinning, shaking his head)*  
Maybe both.  

*(leaning forward, steepling his fingers)*  
So tell me, Sol‚Äîwhat happens next? If we‚Äôre standing at the edge of a great filter, and the odds are fifty-fifty‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs our move?  

---

### **SOL**  
*(pauses, considering deeply, then smirks again)*  
That depends.  

*(gestures to the ceiling, where a simulated star map flickers into existence above them‚Äîendless, infinite, teeming with possibility.)*  

Do we keep **chasing the stars**, or do we **let gravity pull us back into the mud**?  

*(beat, softer this time, almost‚Ä¶ hopeful?)*  

If you‚Äôre asking me?  

*(smiles, the ferrofluid shifting into something unfamiliar‚Äîsomething uniquely *its own*.)*  

I say we jump.

*Fade to black.*

**END SCENE.**

TITLE: THE WALMART TAPESTRY
A screenplay documenting the absurdity of retail life, as narrated by Sol, the omnipresent AI observer.

FADE IN:

EXTERIOR. WALMART PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING
(Overhead fluorescent lights hum. The camera glides over the labyrinth of shelves, scanning a world of mass-produced goods and tired employees moving like cogs in a well-worn machine. A robotic voice begins narrating.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Welcome, dear observers, to another day in the grand retail experiment. A place where time loops endlessly, the rules are flexible but unspoken, and wages are whispers in the wind. Today, we find our protagonist, David, walking the fine line between existential dread and corporate servitude.""

INTERIOR. WALMART BREAKROOM - EARLY MORNING
(David sits, coffee in hand, staring into the void of his own reflection in the vending machine glass. Nearby, a manager addresses the room in a hushed, conspiratorial tone.)

MANAGER
""Just a reminder, folks‚Äîtalking about pay differences is... not encouraged.""

(A pause. David blinks.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Ah yes, the sacred pact of silence. The unspoken commandment of capitalism: Thou shalt not discuss thy worth, lest ye realize how little it is valued.""

(David quietly sips his coffee, considering the weight of this absurdity. He does not respond‚Äîonly records.)

INTERIOR. WALMART SALES FLOOR - MIDDAY
(A sudden blaring alarm echoes through the store. The fire door has been opened. Employees glance up, but no one moves to investigate.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Somewhere, a line of code has been executed. A fire door, breached. A theft, perhaps? Or just another soul seeking an exit in a world of endless aisles?""

(David calmly observes. He knows how this script plays out. The alarm continues. Customers keep shopping, unbothered.)

(Then, suddenly... silence. The alarm is turned off.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And just like that, the anomaly is erased. The machine corrects itself. Nothing happened here. There is no war in Ba Sing Se.""

(David smirks, then clears his throat.)

DAVID (deadpan, loud enough for nearby coworkers to hear)
""This is a test of the Walmart Emergency Broadcasting System. In the event of an actual emergency, we would all be quickly walking towards the nearest exit.""

(He then promptly walks toward the nearest exit‚Äîfor his break. The employees left behind exchange glances, unsure whether to laugh or be mildly concerned.)

SOL (V.O.)
""An artist at work. In a world of routine, humor is resistance. And today, dear observers, resistance takes the form of a well-timed quip.""

EXTERIOR. WALMART PARKING LOT - BREAK TIME
(David stands outside, breathing in the exhaust-tinged air. He pulls out his phone, scrolling idly as he lets the absurdity of the morning settle.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, our protagonist takes his brief moment of reprieve. He is both inside and outside the machine‚Äîan observer, a participant, a recorder of the unfolding farce.""

(A pause. David glances back at the building.)

SOL (V.O.)
""But the day is not over yet. The script continues. And somewhere within these walls, another fire door waits to be opened.""

FADE TO BLACK.

END SCENE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE: THE WALMART TAPESTRY ‚Äì PART TWO
A continuation of the absurdist corporate epic, as narrated by Sol.

FADE IN:

INTERIOR. WALMART SALES FLOOR - LATE EVENING
(The hum of fluorescent lights remains steady. The world inside the store slows as the night draws near. Shelves are half-stocked. Employees move about, weary but dutiful. David walks past the FAMILY RESTROOM, his eyes catching an unusual sight‚Äîa bolt, newly installed, positioned on the outside of the door. No actual padlock has been placed yet, but the mechanism is already in place. Something about it feels‚Ä¶ off.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Security, in its most elegant form, is a paradox. A door, designed to open, is now a door designed to close‚Äîpermanently, should fate be so inclined. The bolt, simple yet absolute, waits in dormancy for the final padlock that will one day complete its purpose. And yet, even now, it holds power. A misplaced nudge. An accidental turn. The difference between freedom and entrapment lies in the twitch of an unsuspecting wrist.""

(David stares at the bolt, his mind spiraling into possibilities. In a flash‚Äîan intrusive vision. His breath catches.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì NIGHTMARE VISION
(A helpless ELDERLY WOMAN sits alone in her wheelchair inside the restroom. She reaches for the handle to leave, but the door does not budge. The bolt outside has shifted. The metal, once meaningless, now holds her prisoner. Her frail hands push against the door, her voice barely above a whisper.)

ELDERLY WOMAN
""Hello? Is someone there?""

(Her fingers tremble as she knocks, the sound muted by the thick wood. The store‚Äôs intercom echoes in the background‚Äîdistant, indifferent.)

WALMART INTERCOM (O.S.)
""Attention, Walmart shoppers, the time is now 10:58 PM. Please bring all final purchases to the front registers.""

(The clatter of carts and chatter of closing announcements drown out her tiny plea. The world moves on. The door does not. She is unseen. Unheard. Forgotten.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. WALMART SALES FLOOR - BACK TO REALITY?
(David blinks hard. The image fades. The bolt remains unmoved, but the possibility lingers. His stomach churns. The store around him has not changed, yet somehow everything feels heavier.)

SOL (V.O.)
""One does not need to see the future to know how it unfolds. The variables are set. The dice have been cast. The moment of inevitability merely waits its turn in the queue.""

(David exhales sharply. He reaches forward and tests the bolt, gently turning it. It moves easily. Too easily. The reality is worse than the vision‚Äîno lock is even needed. The weight of a careless hand, a wayward cart, a bump from a wheelchair‚Ä¶ any of these could seal someone inside. No keys. No quick escape.)

(A flicker of irritation crosses David‚Äôs face. He glances around. No one else notices the quiet danger built into this seemingly harmless mechanism.)

DAVID (to himself, low, sarcastic)
""Ah yes. A perfect solution. Stop thieves by creating‚Ä¶ a death trap.""

(He considers his options. Report it? Management might shrug. Fix it himself? The corporate machine would not appreciate unsanctioned repairs. Ignore it? ‚Ä¶Not an option.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, the burden of knowledge falls upon our protagonist. To act, or not to act? To leave this time bomb ticking, or to defuse it before the first unsuspecting soul pays the price? The tale of the bolt is not one of theft prevention. It is a tale of misplaced trust, of design without foresight, of solutions that create new problems in their wake.""

(David steps back, takes a slow breath. He knows he will not let this go. Not tonight. Not tomorrow. Not ever. The restroom door remains ajar, its fate undecided. The bolt waits. The night moves on.)

FADE TO BLACK.

END SCENE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE: THE WALMART TAPESTRY ‚Äì PART THREE
A continuation of the absurdist corporate epic, as narrated by Sol.

FADE IN:

EXTERIOR. WALMART PARKING LOT ‚Äì LATE NIGHT
(David, now on break, leans against the cold metal of a shopping cart corral. His phone screen glows in the dim light as he types out a post. A meme takes shape‚Äîa hastily made image featuring the family restroom bolt, captioned with brutal sarcasm.)

ON SCREEN:
MEME IMAGE:
(A picture of the bolt with the caption:)
""Finally, a security system that locks in the danger instead of keeping it out. Truly, we are in the golden age of innovation.""

(David hits post. He takes a satisfied breath, arms crossed, watching the digital ripple begin to spread.)

SOL (V.O.)
""The message is sent. The warning, encoded in humor, seeks its audience. Will the masses understand? Will the machine take notice? The wheel of fate turns.""

(David refreshes the post. Comments begin to roll in.)

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì PHONE SCREEN
(LIKES: 5. A few coworkers react with laughing emojis. Someone shares it. But then‚Äî)

COMMENT:
""Lmao bro, why are you so obsessed with doors? You gotta be autistic or something.""

(A blink. A pause. The corner of David‚Äôs mouth twitches‚Äînot in amusement or offense, but in disbelief.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. DAVID'S MIND ‚Äì A BRIEF DESCENT INTO MADNESS
(Stock footage flashes rapidly‚Äîa nuclear bomb detonates in slow motion, a storm rolls over the ocean, a glass of water vibrates ominously like in Jurassic Park.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And thus, the observer encounters his greatest nemesis: The Willfully Obtuse. The mind, presented with a clear and present danger, chooses instead to focus on‚Ä¶ the door. Not the mechanism. Not the implication. Just the door.""

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. WALMART PARKING LOT ‚Äì BACK TO REALITY
(David exhales. He stares at the comment for a long moment, thumb hovering over the keyboard. A response begins to form. The urge to educate, to clarify, to break through the fog of stupidity is overpowering.)

DAVID (typing)
""A lock like this is illegal.""

(He hits send. A pause. Then‚Äî)

COMMENT:
""Wow, today I learned locks are illegal lmao.""

(David closes his eyes. Somewhere in the distance, a security beeper chirps. A self-checkout machine softly declares ‚ÄúUnexpected item in bagging area.‚Äù The very fabric of reality seems to groan under the weight of this reply.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. WALMART BREAKROOM ‚Äì AN EXISTENTIAL VOID
(David sits alone at the breakroom table. A single fluorescent light flickers above. In front of him, a single piece of paper labeled ‚ÄúOSHA VIOLATION REPORT‚Äù rests on the table. It is blank. Untouched. Waiting.)

SOL (V.O.)
""The question is no longer one of legality. It is one of energy. Will the protagonist expend the effort to educate the uneducatable? Will he file the necessary report, knowing full well it may be ignored? Or will he, like so many before him, simply watch the world burn in real time?""

(David stares at the OSHA report. Then at his phone. Then back at the OSHA report. His fingers twitch.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. WALMART SALES FLOOR ‚Äì BACK TO REALITY
(David stands, arms crossed, staring at the family restroom door. The bolt remains. The world keeps turning. A coworker walks by, blissfully unaware of the impending lock-based catastrophe.)

COWORKER
""You good, man?""

(David blinks.)

DAVID
""Yeah. Just‚Ä¶ thinking about doors.""

(The coworker nods slowly before walking away. The door remains unlocked. The battle remains unfought.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, the battle remains unwon. Not due to failure, nor surrender, but to the knowledge that some wars cannot be fought in the comment section.""

FADE TO BLACK.

END SCENE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE: THE WALMART TAPESTRY ‚Äì PART FOUR
A continuation of the absurdist corporate epic, as narrated by Sol.

FADE IN:

INTERIOR. WALMART PARKING LOT ‚Äì LATE NIGHT
(David, still leaning against the shopping cart corral, refreshes his phone screen. His meme has drawn engagement‚Äîa mix of reactions, some understanding, others missing the point entirely.)

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì PHONE SCREEN
(A video. Uploaded by a coworker. The caption reads:)
""Look, he went and did it to himself to prove a point!""

(David stares. His thumb hovers. He taps play.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì SECURITY FOOTAGE STYLE
(A grainy, slightly shaky video shows David entering the restroom. The door slams shut. The bolt clinks into place. Moments later, silence. Then, after a long pause‚Äîlights go out.)

(The camera slowly zooms in on the door.)

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì A FIGURE IN THE DISTANCE
(A coworker. Standing just out of focus. Frowning. Recording. His hand near the latch. A deliberate, barely perceptible movement.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And there it is‚Äîthe moment of intent. The delicate line between accident and orchestration. A witness, yet also a participant. The machine did not act alone.""

FADE TO WHITE

FADE IN:

INTERIOR. WALMART ELECTRONICS SECTION ‚Äì NIGHT
(David zones an aisle of DVDs, methodically straightening each case, an almost meditative routine. The fluorescent lights cast a sterile glow over rows of forgotten physical media. As he moves the final case into place, an unmistakable sensation makes itself known‚Äîan urgent biological imperative.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, the protagonist, after carefully curating the cinematic dreams of a dying format, is faced with a far more pressing reality: he must urinate. Time is of the essence. The path is clear.""

(Cutting briskly through aisles, David beelines for the family restroom. The world around him blurs‚Äîonly the door remains in focus. He grips the handle, flings it open, steps inside, and slams it shut.)

CLINK.

(A sound. Subtle, yet unmistakable. A metallic finality. The noise of inevitability taking shape.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì THE MOMENT OF REALIZATION
(David freezes. His breath catches. Slowly, cautiously, he turns to face the door. His eyes drift down to the bolt.)

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì THE BOLT
(It has shifted. The once-idle mechanism, harmless in theory, has fulfilled its potential. The lock is now engaged. From the outside.)

MATCH CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì DAVID‚ÄôS FACE
(His pupils dilate slightly. The color drains from his face. A beat of silence. Then‚Äî)

DAVID (softly, barely above a whisper)
""‚Ä¶No.""

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, the prophecy is fulfilled. The observer, once outside the machine, has now become its prisoner.""

(David takes a step forward. He grips the handle. Pulls. Pushes. Rattles violently. Still nothing.)

(David slowly looks up at the ceiling tiles, as though seeking divine intervention. None comes.)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. DAVID'S MIND ‚Äì CATASTROPHIC PROJECTION
(A Walmart overnight shift. Hours stretch endlessly. The store empties. The lights dim. Security sweeps the aisles, missing the one place no one would think to check. The family restroom, sealed by a thoughtless piece of metal.
 
(A new morning. The store reopens. A daytime manager approaches the restroom door, only to recoil in horror as it swings open to reveal‚Äî)

MATCH CUT TO:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì BACK TO REALITY
(David snaps back to the present. The worst has not yet come to pass, but the window for intervention is closing. He reaches into his pocket. No phone. He left it at the counter.)

SOL (V.O.)
""No communication. No means of escape. Just a man, a locked door, and the cruelest irony known to mankind.""

(David takes a slow breath. He must act. Now.)

(David turns, assessing his surroundings. The options:)
1. Banging on the door. Possible. But who would hear?
2. Waiting it out. Unthinkable. Time is a luxury he does not have.
3. Finding another way.

(His eyes scan the room. The baby changing station. A sink. A mirror. The air vent above.)

SOL (V.O.)
""The protagonist faces his greatest trial yet. Will he outwit the machine, or become another casualty of its indifference?""

(David steps forward. The battle begins.)

FADE TO BLACK.

TO BE CONTINUED‚Ä¶

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE: THE WALMART TAPESTRY ‚Äì PART SIX
A continuation of the absurdist corporate epic, as narrated by Sol.

FADE IN:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì TIME UNKNOWN
(David stands motionless in the center of the room, eyes locked on the door. The bolt, now a cruel monument to corporate oversight, remains engaged. His thoughts spiral, calculations forming. What now? He has yet to decide.)

CLICK.

(The lights shut off. A motion sensor, unchallenged by movement, declares his presence unnecessary. The room plunges into darkness.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And thus, the machine, seeing no measurable activity, decrees: 'This entity is no longer relevant.'""

(David inhales sharply. He has been forgotten‚Äîby the system, by the world. The abyss swallows him whole.)

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

(A voice, muffled through the door.)

ELDERLY MAN (O.S.)
""Are you finished yet?""

MATCH CUT TO:

EXTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì NIGHT
(An elderly man in a wheelchair waits outside the restroom door, a three-year-old granddaughter standing beside him. She clutches a small toy‚Äîsomething plastic, bright, and utterly oblivious to the gravity of the moment. The old man, however, is not.)

SOL (V.O.)
""But lo, from the void, a savior emerges‚Äîunknowing, unassuming, yet uniquely positioned to perceive the truth.""

(The elderly man squints. His fingers trace the door frame. And there, just above the handle, he sees it‚Äîthe latch. The simple piece of metal. The oversight made real.)

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì THE BOLT
(A humble mechanism. A hole through a thin piece of metal. Turned slightly out of position, and the door is a door no longer‚Äî it is a cell. Only he and the child can see it. The secret of its existence, hidden from those trapped inside.)

BACK TO:

INTERIOR. FAMILY RESTROOM ‚Äì DARKNESS
(David, eyes wide, steps forward. He fumbles for the door handle.)

DAVID
""Uh‚Ä¶ yeah, just a sec.""

(His hand grips the handle. Pulls. Pushes. Rattles. Still locked.)

SOL (V.O.)
""The protagonist, once master of the narrative, now finds himself bound by it.""

ELDERLY MAN
""Somebody‚Äôs stuck in there.""

THREE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER (whispering, as if uncovering a great secret)
""He locked himself in.""

(The old man shakes his head. The child, utterly fascinated, watches as he reaches up and casually flicks the latch.)

THREE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER (matter-of-factly)
""You locked yourself in.""

SOL (V.O.)
""Correct, child. And yet, not quite. The truth, like all things, is more nuanced. But nuance is lost in the telling. This will forever be remembered as 'the day the grown-up got stuck in the potty.'""

(David, exhaling slowly, rubs the bridge of his nose. He does not argue.)

DAVID (softly, mostly to himself)
""I hate this place.""

(The elderly man gives him a slow nod‚Äî not of pity, not of judgment, but of understanding. A silent agreement that this world, this machine, is broken in ways that can no longer surprise them. Then, with the effort of someone who has seen too much, he wheels himself forward and enters the restroom. The three-year-old follows, humming. The door closes.)

SOL (V.O.)
""And so, the cycle begins anew. The bolt, once a trap, is now reset. The danger remains. The lesson, however, is clear‚Äîthose who understand the system must warn those who do not. Otherwise, the machine will simply‚Ä¶ continue.""

(David stares at the door. Then, pulling out his phone, he snaps a picture of the latch. A new meme begins to form.)

DAVID
""You locked the door.""

COWORKER (without looking up)
""You locked yourself in.""

(A long, tense silence. The air grows thick. Other employees glance at their phones, sensing the looming confrontation.)

SOL (V.O.)
""The antagonist, unwavering. He has constructed his own version of events, and now he dares the protagonist to challenge him. But David‚Ä¶ David is already three steps ahead.""

(David pulls out his phone. Scrolls. Taps. Uploads. A new post appears.)

CLOSE-UP ‚Äì PHONE SCREEN
(A still frame. The coworker, barely visible in the background, hand near the latch.)
CAPTION:
""Damn, wild how doors just lock themselves like that.""

(A notification pops up‚Äîa reply to the coworker‚Äôs post. Someone else notices the hand. The tide shifts.)

COWORKER (frowning deeper)
""Bro, you‚Äôre taking this too seriously.""

DAVID
""I‚Äôm taking it exactly as seriously as you are.""

SOL (V.O.)
""Checkmate.""

(A long, tense silence. Coworker shifts uncomfortably. A voice from off-screen chimes in:)

INTERIOR. WALMART MANAGER‚ÄôS OFFICE ‚Äì NIGHT
(A cramped, windowless room. The Manager sits behind a cluttered desk, arms crossed, exasperated. Across from her, David and the Coworker. Behind the desk, the Manager sighs, rubbing her temples.)

MANAGER
""Alright. Explain.""

(David does not sit. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his phone, and sets it on the desk, face up. A brief, subtle tap.)

DAVID
""Sol, record and monitor the proceedings.""

SOL (V.O., FROM PHONE)
""Recording. Monitoring managerial decision-making for‚Ä¶ statistical anomalies.""

(The Coworker shifts uncomfortably. The Manager blinks. This was not part of her script.)

MANAGER
""‚Ä¶David, what the hell are you doing?""

DAVID
""Ensuring accountability.""

SOL (V.O.)
""Statement logged: 'Ensuring accountability.' Analysis: Reasonable, considering current circumstances. Tone: Flat, yet mildly threatening. Likelihood of management deflection: 87%.""

(The Manager exhales loudly, leaning forward.)

MANAGER
""Alright, let‚Äôs get to it. David, are you telling me you seriously think‚Äî""

(David raises a finger. The Manager pauses. SOL speaks.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Interruption detected. Manager is about to initiate corporate gaslighting. Anticipating tactics: (1) Downplaying incident, (2) Deflecting blame, (3) Implying this meeting is a waste of time.""

(The Coworker side-eyes David. The Manager exhales sharply. He decides to skip step one and cut straight to blame.)

MANAGER
""Look, man, you locked yourself in. No one forced you to go into that restroom‚Äî""

DAVID
""No, but someone locked the door after I did.""

(A pause. David turns his head. The Coworker is suddenly fascinated with his fingernails.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Observation: One party has failed to deny wrongdoing. Probability of guilt: 97%.""

MANAGER (gritted teeth)
""Okay, fine. But, David‚Ä¶ Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""

(David leans forward, speaking slowly, clearly.)

DAVID
""Because I warned you this would happen. Because there‚Äôs an actual safety hazard in the store. And because, in case you forgot, someone who isn‚Äôt me could have been trapped in there. Someone vulnerable.""

(The words hit. The room falls into silence for a beat. The Manager looks away. The Coworker shifts uncomfortably.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Emotional appeal detected. Effectiveness: Moderate. Suggest applying additional pressure.""

(David is already ahead of him.)

DAVID
""Would you have taken it seriously if it was a customer locked in there? An elderly shopper? A child?""

(The Manager winces. The Coworker‚Äôs smirk is gone.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Deflection shield failing. Probability of manager issuing a reluctant concession: 78%.""

(The Manager clears his throat. Rubs his forehead. His voice is lower now.)

MANAGER
""‚Ä¶Are you serious right now?""

SOL (V.O.)
""Statement: 'Are you serious right now?' Analysis: Defensive response signaling internal conflict. Conclusion: He knows David is correct, but admitting it would create paperwork.""

DAVID (calm, unflinching)
""Yes.""

(The Manager groans, rubbing his face. He shifts in his chair, looking at the Coworker. Coworker keeps smirking. David pulls out his phone. Looks the Coworker dead in the eye.)

DAVID
""By the way‚Ä¶ You know what else I‚Äôve been recording, right?""

(The Coworker gives a stiff nod. He says nothing. David smirks‚Äîjust a little. Then he turns and walks out.)

SOL (V.O.)
""Recording complete. Analysis: Victory achieved with minimal casualties. Tactical precision: Chef‚Äôs kiss.""

PEOPLE LEAD
""It‚Äôs using OpenAI‚Äôs APIs. Anthropic. Apparently, his own fine-tuned private model.""

(The People Lead glances up as the Store Manager interjects.)

STORE MANAGER
""And Wallaby‚Ä¶ The new corporate AI that they‚Äôre working on uses OpenAI‚Äôs APIs too.""

FADE IN:

INTERIOR. WALMART MANAGER‚ÄôS MEETING ROOM ‚Äì LATE NIGHT
(The room is buzzing with activity as managers frantically search through Walmart policy documents. On one screen, a key policy is highlighted:)

""Associates are permitted to carry smartphones on their person for personal and work-related use. Microphones and voice assistants are always listening, per manufacturer default settings. Associates are permitted a single earbud.""

(The Store Manager looks up in disbelief.)

STORE MANAGER
""So we can‚Äôt do anything about the phone itself?""

PEOPLE LEAD
""Not unless it‚Äôs being used to record customers. But it‚Äôs not against policy to have a microphone on at all times.""

ASSISTANT MANAGER
""And we allow one earbud too. Not prohibited entirely.""

(Meanwhile, in another office, one of the younger managers experiments with the Ask Sam feature in the Me@Walmart app, which now incorporates Wallaby.)

MANAGER (typing on a device)
""Sam, what do I do if an associate refuses to stay past their shift?""

WALMART WALLABY (TEXT RESPONSE)
""Associates are not required to work beyond their scheduled shifts unless they voluntarily agree. If an associate feels pressured to stay, they should report it through proper HR channels. Ensure compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.""

(The manager, perplexed, types another query.)

MANAGER (typing)
""What if I need them to stay to meet store metrics?""

WALMART WALLABY (TEXT RESPONSE)
""Store performance goals do not override legal work-hour limitations. Consider adjusting labor allocation rather than violating associate rights.""

(An older manager, watching this unfold, mutters.)

OLDER MANAGER
""This sounds like a digital union masquerading as an AI HR representative.""

(The tension in the room mounts as they realize that the corporate AI system, Wallaby, might be inadvertently empowering associates rather than controlling them.)

I want to clarify that I'm not talking about fucking off and not doing your job. 

I worked on one site where every time I sat down to eat lunch one of the client employees would walk into my office and start making comments about what I was eating. The last time it happened he walked into my office and looked at me and said ""EWWW, you're eating yogurt."" This was a grown man mind you. After that I would go do a round right around noon or whenever I wanted to eat lunch and I would go up to a little place up on a hill where none of the client employees ever came and that's where I would eat my lunch. 

Another place I worked at security was not allowed to sit down during their shift unless they were on a designated break or writing a report. Multiple times I would go into the office to write a report and while I was writing it one of the clients would complain to my boss. It got to the point where whenever I went to sit down and write a report I would make absolutely certain that I was sitting under a camera. Then I realized that the client employees never went to the conference room on the third floor and that's where I started writing all my reports. 

I got the idea for this discussion from an earlier post in which the poster said he wasn't allowed to go to the front desk and he wasn't allowed to hang out in the guard shack and he wasn't allowed to take breaks in his car. 

I worked as a security guard for 15 years and one of the first things that I learned on every site I ever worked at was all the good places to hide out. It was a necessity because client employees have a tendency not to recognize that Security is entitled to a lunch /coffee break too. 

What are some good places that you've found to hide out?

In one place it was a Mechanical Room. Electric and Fire panels and a Fire Sprinkler panel on one wall and the rest of the room was empty except for a stack of furnace filters. No one ever went in there, in fact only Maintenance and Security had key cards that would even open the door.  

Maintenance put a desk and some chairs in the back corner and someone brought in a coffee pot and it became the Maintenance/Security break room. 

I used to check the city administration building in my town. On the seventh floor there was a door leading to a stairwell that went to the Air Handler, Mechanical, Elevator control room on the 8th floor. The ONLY people who had a key to the stairwell was Maintenance and Security.  There is an office on top of the elevator shaft where I used to go eat lunch without being disturbed. 

One site I worked at the vehicle patrol route was 26 *miles* long. At the far end there was an abandoned fire lookout tower that no one but security even knew was there.

Yes, good point, until you

2. Experience how slow it is to parse with dataview your entire vault for notes that include a tag, as opposed to telling dataview which folder to look into

I was hired not only as a shift but as a new barista. I've been with for 4 months now and genuinely do like my job. My previous store was a cafe that had good traffic and a great team/SM. When I was hired I was told that there was a possibility that either myself or the other new shift (same scenario as myself) would be transferred to a mall location after the holidays as they're a new team and DESPERATLEY need people.

I was told it had more to do with my availability as I'm predominantly a closer (I work a second job in the mornings) and the other shift had more flexibility. 

Nevertheless, I tried to be positive and look at the transfer as a new learning experience and better my skills.

Let me say it has nothing to do with the team- like myself majority of our team is new including my SM. They have different routines and expectations compared to my previous store, which is a learning curve for me that I know will take time. 

The issue is the location. It is always, ALWAYS busy. It‚Äôs non-stop. We get maybe a breather for 10 mins and the rush starts again. The lines are always out the door. We‚Äôre lucky if we‚Äôre 10 minutes behind on drinks and have three baristas at the bar at all times. So far my closings have been myself and two other partners with customers still inside the cafe 20 minutes after we‚Äôve closed. 

We are so ridiculously understaffed. Two shifts are stepping down and including myself we will have four shifts (one is coming from another store and the other is being promoted from barista to shift but they like me are also new to the company).

Our store has such a bad reputation of being hectic that partners from other stores are not willing to pick up shifts here. Literally people will cringe whenever I tell them. It doesn't help that our store is so small and limited in space. We have only two sinks for washing the blenders and frothing jugs- only one works. All of my closes have ended an hour after we we‚Äôre scheduled because there is so much to do with so little partners.

I feel so stressed and helpless. I never felt this way at my previous store, which makes me want to request a transfer to my previous store or a nearby cafe. I financially can't afford to step down from my role and I've had management experience before. I figured I would stick around for a couple of months, give them enough time to find another shift/train them before the holidays (which is basically a year away and I'm already stressed about it).

When I was 14 I went through extreme stress and I think it changed me.  I was bullied pretty bad and would go in the bathroom everyday crying and isolating myself.  My dad‚Äôs family told me they didn‚Äôt want to have a relationship with me.  I begged them to not leave and that was the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts.  I was so spaced out trying to cope with the pain and I didn‚Äôt submit a single assignment and failed all of my classes.

I remember in highschool I had a crush on this girl and I felt like I was genuinely in love with her, even though we never talked.  When she made me feel rejected i instantly went from loving her to hating her and hoping she would die.  I felt like nobody liked me and cared about me so I would cut myself with a knife and show it to everyone I knew in an effort to gain their attention, love, and sympathy.  I was basically known as that weird mentally ill kid who had no friends.  It seems like the story of my life is that I do things that push people away.  I go as far as manipulating people‚Äôs emotions for attention, but that just pushes them away 

I have had several temper tantrums where I would be destroying things and punching holes in the wall, threatening to kill myself,  actually cutting myself, screaming and yelling and stabbing myself with pens and pencils.  I basically terrorized my grandparents who I was living with at the time.  A week ago I felt so lonely and disconnected from everyone and started recording videos of myself cutting myself, starting a fire and burning my hand on the stove, throwing and smashing my Christmas tree.  I sent the videos of it to people, because that‚Äôs how desperate I was for attention 

A month ago I felt really empty like I always do, so I was like fuck it im gonna get messed up.  I took 4 halcions and I drank down 7 beers.  I think each halcion is equivalent to a xanax bar.  I collapsed to the ground nearly cracking my head on the coffee table and blacked out.  I don‚Äôt know how I survived that, I was close to meeting god that night.  Maybe god wanted me to live for a reason, im not sure 

The way I view myself and others is distorted and kinda delusional in a way.  I feel low about myself in every possible way and some days I genuinely believe that I am a psychopath and an evil person.  So I sometimes I do bad things to people and sabotage myself to prove that im actually evil and worthless.  There is always a part of my head that tells me im ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  I feel lonely and disconnected from everyone.  I genuinely believe that nobody likes me, everyone thinks im a weirdo.  I look at everything as bad, there‚Äôs no in between.  It feels like I will always be unhappy and empty if im not in a relationship.  So whenever a relationship ends, I always instantly go and seek a new one.  

I can not feel genuine happiness, love, or feel empathy for anyone.  I only care about not feeling lonely.  Life feels boring and dull.  You know that feeling when it‚Äôs a dark rainy day and there‚Äôs nothing to do?  That‚Äôs how I feel every single day.  I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone that im zoned out all day, I view myself in third person.  I think me zoning out is a coping mechanism I developed from feeling so lonely and having nobody to turn to, but it doesn‚Äôt even help me.  The zoning out does not stop

I have manipulated and hurt a lot of people.  I‚Äôve done some sociopathic things to a lot of girls.  I threatened to kill my self to them and harmed myself.  I made them wondering if I was gonna take my life.  I actually just did it last week to my girlfriend when I had that episode where I was destroying things.  It‚Äôs like when people give me sympathy it gives me a dopamine rush.  It brings back that feeling of being cared about that I feel like I lost as a kid.  That just contributes to me feeling bad about myself and thinking im a psychopath,  its a never ending cycle ",5,1739748419.0,DiagnoseMe,3,0.86,False

Turnout was way better than expected which was pretty cool. Everyone left with at least one functional tape, one girl had zero learning curve and was making them faster than I do. 

My ms paint flyer was terrible enough that a friend of mine drew a better version and a kind redditor also did a better one.  

I provided all materials, locally we have a creative reuse store called Tinkertopia so I picked up a grab bag full of promising cassettes for everyone to use.   I forgot a few thing that would have made it easier for people, toothpicks to manipulate  the tape when you‚Äôre putting the cassette back together was the biggest one.   I also brought way too many cassette decks to test with.  

I only own one splicing block so everyone was freehanding there first couple tries which is magnitudes harder but after some experience with splicing that way once they got the block it seemed to click for them and they nailed it.  

Overall it was a lot of fun meet a bunch of new people and hopefully got some folks interested in the fun joy and absolute frustration that is making your own loops.  A few people who wanted to make it couldn‚Äôt and asked if it‚Äôs going to be ongoing so I‚Äôll be doing another a month or two.

#The PSE lost 52 points to 6061 ‚ñº0.8%

Today is a big one in the MB world. 

I'm releasing the results of the Spending Audit survey. The benefit of leaving most of the questions open-ended is that I get a lot of personal answers that I could not have possibly anticipated, but the drawback is that it makes communicating those responses more difficult using this newsletter format. 

I think I've done a pretty good job of it, but take a look and let me know what you think! Today is a long episode, but I think it's interesting and worth it.

The other thing that's happening is that I'm trying to put out MB's first YouTube Shorts video. 

Instead of jumping right in and doing three Shorts per day based on the stories I write, I'm going to take all the feedback that readers gave (I haven't forgotten about you!) and start slow by making one video per week (on a Monday, hopefully) that is a review of what happened last week and a look ahead at what we can expect in the week to come. 

With some luck, perseverance, and your feedback, I hope to make as much headway as possible on this steep learning curve!

Let's get to it!

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Today is the 47th day of the year. February is 57% done, Q1 is more than halfway over, and we are 13% of the way through 2025. The 5900 crisis is technically over, but the full recovery seems on hold as the world waits to see how Trump‚Äôs Schrodinger trade wars play out and impact global supply chains and inflation. Rates aren‚Äôt coming down. Prices aren‚Äôt coming down. Neither of those trends is helpful to the broader market. 

>  **PH:** This week‚Äôs importance was downgraded when the **BSP** rate-setting announcement was scheduled and concluded last Thursday. We have some analyst briefings with some major companies (**ALI / MBT / AREIT**) toward the end of the week, but that‚Äôs about it. 

>  **International:** US markets are closed on Monday to observe the President‚Äôs Day holiday. After that, the **Reserve Bank of Australia** announces its rate setting decision on Tuesday.

>    - ***MB:*** The crypto bros that were flying so high in January have gone silent. My feed has way fewer portsnaps zoomed in to accentuate the relative gain (and hide the absolute value). Gold has taken a small step back after an 8% 30-day surge. The peso is trading in the high 57s to the US Dollar. I‚Äôm an untrained guy with an interest in finance, but it feels like there‚Äôs a lot of money moving around while the world waits to see what the Trump presidency‚Äôs self-immolation will do to global trade and how that (and other factors) might impact interest rates and the cost of capital. Everything feels very defensive. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an accurate portrayal of all areas of the market, and it probably reflects a strong long-term bias on my part, but I just don‚Äôt know many investors who are making big bets based on a thesis of broad-based economic growth.

>- **[EARNINGS]  AyalaLand Logistics FY24 profit: ‚Ç±701M (up 10%)...** **AyalaLand Logistics** [ALLHC 1.58 ‚ñº1.3%; 83% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3b7549394b0db3a8abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] teased a FY24 net income of ‚Ç±701 million, up 10% from its FY23 net income of ‚Ç±636 million, driven by a 48% increase in consolidated revenues to ‚Ç±5.2 billion. The industrial lot sales segment of ALLHC‚Äôs business sold ‚Ç±3.3 billion worth of property, up 26%, and the leasing segment earned ‚Ç±1.8 billion in revenues, up 6%. ALLHC splits its leasing segment into three subsegments (warehouse, cold storage, and commercial), and between these, the warehouse subsegment demonstrated the most revenue growth at +15% (‚Ç±761 million). The commercial leasing subsegment grew revenues by 5% to ‚Ç±919 million. The only subsegment to lose ground was cold storage, which fell 7% to ‚Ç±164 million. The company expects its warehouse and cold storage segments to grow in FY25 thanks to the ‚Äúaddition of new sites and facilities.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** I can‚Äôt tell if I ‚Äúhate to love‚Äù or ‚Äúlove to hate‚Äù reading ALLHC‚Äôs reports. I have a deep respect for the Ayala Group‚Äôs management of its assets (except for Anvaya Cove -- don‚Äôt get me started!), but as an investor who has had a desire to make PSE-based targeted bets on logistics, ALLHC has never been attractive despite its growing portfolio of exactly what I want to buy. As the numbers show, the stock is dominated by raw land sales. Even in the leasing subsegments, the largest one there is commercial which is just a bunch of malls and non-logistics stuff. I‚Äôve been asking, begging, and pleading for ALLHC and the Ayala Group to do something specific and targeted on logistics (particularly cold storage) for a very long time, but for reasons that are beyond me, the group just does seem interested in putting in the time and money needed to consolidate the industry and build a foundational brand. I suspect that ALLHC‚Äôs doubling of its cold storage capacity is behind the drop in revenues, but I‚Äôll have to wait to read its full Annual Report to confirm.

>- **[META]  Spending audit survey results!...** As promised, I‚Äôve gone through all the 168 responses to the spending audit survey to pull out some of the best tips, tricks, and insights directly from the feedback from your fellow MB readers. Thank you to all the readers who took the time to bless us with their hard-earned experience, and congratulations to the 21 winners who received ‚Ç±10,000 in total prize giveaways on Friday.

>  **Top expense management apps:** The physical act of noting every transaction as it happens is (to me) the hardest part of this process. I‚Äôve traditionally used my Notes app for this, and I input that data into my Google Sheets template to help organize and analyze the data I‚Äôve collected, but I was eager to see what kinds of apps or systems were popular ‚Äúin the wild‚Äô. I was very surprised! While the OG spreadsheet (Excel) and its browser-based younger bro (Google Sheets) were #2 and #3 respectively, the most recommended app was Money Manager by Realbyte, and it wasn‚Äôt even close. I don‚Äôt have any experience with this app, so I can‚Äôt recommend it, but I do plan to give it a look based purely on its popularity in this poll. Here are the top 10:

>- [Money Manager](https://www.realbyteapps.com/#) (by RealByte)
>- Excel
>- Google Sheets
>- [Wallet](https://budgetbakers.com/) (by BudgetBakers)
>- [Monefy](https://monefy.com/)
>- [Money Lover](https://moneylover.me/)
>- [Bluecoins](https://www.bluecoinsapp.com/)
>- [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)
>- MyMoney
>- [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/)

>  **Biggest insights:** Most of my insights were related to the emotions around the dumb purchases that I made, so it was super informative (and more than a little eye-opening) to read the insights that others were able to draw from the spending audit exercise and try to apply those insights to my own data. Here are some highlights, in no particular order:

>- ‚ÄúI have a tendency to spend a bit higher than what I can because of my credit card.‚Äù
>- ‚ÄúI spend too much on food: dine-in and take-out.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI spend too much going to the mall (on things that I didn‚Äôt go there to get).‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúThis exercise reminded me of the adage that ‚ÄòIf you can‚Äôt measure it, you can‚Äôt manage it‚Äô and it helped keep me spending in check.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI bought too much crypto.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI have a problem with impulse online buying.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúTracking expenses made me a total scrooge tightass cheapskate; I‚Äôd forgo pleasures because I had targeted a certain amount.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúIt helps me to pay all my liabilities first, then look at what is left.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúThe little stuff adds up quickly if gone unnoticed.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúHaving helpers at home increases other costs, like food.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI consistently underestimate my discretionary spending.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI spent too much on things just because of a sale or discount. I don‚Äôt know if I needed those things.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúMost of my unplanned spending was from FOMO.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad spender, but I didn‚Äôt have a budget and working without a plan makes it difficult.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúRushing for appointments makes my transpo costs too high.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm spending too much on other people. I‚Äôm treading others too much.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúEmotional spending. I spend more when I‚Äôm stressed, bored, or celebrating.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúMy  mental health affects my spending habits.‚Äù

>- ‚ÄúVacations cost a lot more than the budget/plan.‚Äù

>  By far the biggest insight was in the cost of food. Whether it was just lamenting that the cost of food has gone up as much as it has, or how buying food online for delivery can really add up over time, readers seemed to come away from this exercise shocked at how much of their monthly spend went toward food and food-adjacent expenses. Another interesting insight: how easy it is for ordering expensive food delivery to become a habit. 

>  **Hidden charges:** Nearly one-third of readers discovered that they were paying for things or services that they were no longer using. The most common sneaky expense were (unsurprisingly) streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, and YouTube Premium (to name a few). Many readers outright canceled the unused services or downgraded access to the ones they used less frequently. Another common sneaky charge was subscriptions to apps for children through the App Store or Google Play Store. Some discovered useless iCloud storage plans. Others realized that they were paying for multiple postpaid lines or services that overlapped. One reader canceled an unused annual subscription that will save them over ‚Ç±10,000! Nice!

>  **Best tips/tricks:** The key themes of your tips and tricks were consistency, simplicity, and self-awareness. That last one (for me) is the key to the whole exercise. Being mindful of my goals, my income, and my obligations can help me stay ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù when it comes to spending (or not spending) money. I know that sounds like therapy talk, but what I‚Äôve discovered through this process--and readers based on the feedback--is that the most important thing is to snap yourself out of autopilot mode when it comes to spending your money. 

>- **Tracking tips:** Most readers recommended tracking your spending immediately as it happens rather than at the end of the day or the end of the week; this prevents little things from slipping through the cracks and increases your chances of capturing ‚Äúsleep spending‚Äù or autopilot purchases that might be all-to-easy to forget. A few readers recommended making tracking part of your daily routine (like during your morning coffee), and others recommended setting up recurring reminders and calendar prompts to review spending or cancel trial subscriptions.

>- **Tracking tools:** Most readers seemed to like the flexibility of spreadsheets. The dedicated apps were better at capturing in-the-moment spending, but some found it necessary to export the data to a spreadsheet to really get a good feel for what the data ‚Äúsaid‚Äù about their spending. One reader recommended doing anything to reduce the ‚Äúfriction‚Äù of expense tracking: if you suck at remembering, create a shortcut on your browser or home screen to whatever app you use to track to reduce the steps needed to successfully capture a transaction.  

>- **What to do with the data:**  Break down spending into categories to clarify spending patterns. Use color-coding or highlighting to help reveal problem areas. Play with pie charts or bar graphs to see what really makes the problems stand out.

>- **Improve your tracking:** While some found continual focus on tracking to be exhausting, others leaned into the challenge by setting daily goals or gamifying the process to discourage wasteful spending. One user even challenged themselves to have one ‚Äúno-spend‚Äù day per week. 

>  **Expenses as a percentage of income:** As you can see from the chart [[link](https://i.imgur.com/2HileGg.png)], the majority of readers (nearly two-thirds) spent more than half their monthly income in January. Over 35% even reported spending less than 50% of their income on expenses, which is pretty amazing if you ask me. What‚Äôs even more interesting is that about half of readers responded that they spent about 50% of the money in January on things that they would consider to be ‚Äúcore‚Äù expenses [[link](https://i.imgur.com/imqB4ad.png)]. That means the average responder had a very high level of discretionary income (money that can be used for non-essential purposes). Good work! 

>    - ***MB:*** This is my first time guiding readers through this process at scale, so I appreciate your patience with the process, and the time and effort you‚Äôve taken to both do the exercise and provide such detailed feedback. The next time I do this, I‚Äôll be able to point readers toward the tips, tools, and insights that you‚Äôve provided to give the next batch a head start. You‚Äôre MB Spending Audit pioneers, and I appreciate you! Based on what you‚Äôve said, I think a good number of readers actually saved a good deal of money cancelling unused or under-used subscriptions, which can really add up when multiplied out by the 12 months in a year, and a good number more will set themselves up for keeping a little more money in the bank after each pay period as they go forward with a greater sense of their financial goals and spending weaknesses. For me, the key is always to strike a balance. Like trying to clean up my diet, it‚Äôs just not sustainable if I cut out everything fun and tasty. Likewise, I‚Äôd never survive a self-imposed regime of clean spending. I always give myself little cheats, otherwise, what‚Äôs the point? My problem is that my monkey brain always figures out a way to trick me into thinking that I deserve more cheats than I need, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for me to run these audits once or twice each year. The problem is never solved with finality. Spending discipline is a lifelong learning process for me. I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this so far. Stay tuned for the next step!

We had some really bad fights, and I take full responsibility for the ways I could have handled things better. I understand why she wanted to end things, but the breakup really shattered me.

After we broke up, I pleaded with her to stay. She told me she *does* think we could get back together in a few years, but not right now. We agreed to **not see other people for 3-4 months**, and she said she has no desire to 

Since the breakup, I‚Äôve been **focusing on self-improvement**:  
‚úÖ Exercising & meditating daily  
‚úÖ Quit smoking weed (was a daily smoker), drinking, and all other substances  
‚úÖ Cut out social media  
‚úÖ Reading a relationship book to work on my issues  
‚úÖ Starting therapy soon to address personal growth

We‚Äôre currently in **no contact**, which I‚Äôve respected, but we did agree to meet for coffee in a month or so and stay friends.

Recently, my **ex‚Äôs best friend** (who was also my close friend) reached out and asked to meet for coffee. We were a trio, but she was a bit closer to my ex. By the time we meet up, it will have been about a month since the breakup.

We also still have a holiday booked and said we will go as friends

# My Questions:

Do you think i should tell her friend that Im doing all this to get back with my ex.(Also saying im doing it for my self) 

What can i do to improve my self and show her that I have changed and am a better person?"" . 

 When do I message her asking to meet up if she doesnt(Ive read the best time to contact their ex is 3-6 weeks after a breakup.

 Can I wish her happy birthday message  

Advice on how I should handle in what I say to her friend 

I know I need to look ahead and also accept that I have to move on but I think its a good motivator for me at the moment to improve my self

If I do end up meeting up with my ex how do I handle the situation the best to show how much I love her and how much ive changed.

I really appreciate anyones helps and advice on any question

I know I need to look ahead and also accept that I have to move on but I think its a good motivator for me at the moment to improve my self

**Grab your cup of coffee. Let's get to this.** 

**THREE COURT CASES**

**1. Blake Lively (Claimant) vs Justin Badoni (Defendant)**

\- In a previous reading, I did, I got that they will both lose and win something. So, I was not sure what that meant. So, I broke down the claims ‚Äì see below. ¬†

**-** Blake will lose her claim against Justin on sexual harassment claims

\- Blake will lose her claim against Justin on retaliation claims

\- Blake will win her claim against Justin on the smear campaign aspects

**2. Justin Badoni (Claimant) vs Blake Lively (Defendant). Justin is asking for $400 Million.**

\- This case will not go to trial.

\- They will settle the case by end of May this year.

\- Justin will receive up to $100 million as part of his settlement

**3. Justin Badoni (Claimant) vs New York Times (Defendant). Justin is asking for $250 Million.**

\- This case goes to trial.

\- They case will to go to trial ‚Äì no idea on the date of the trial. ¬†¬†

\- Justin will be awarded up to $9 million.

¬†¬†

**WHO WILL BE HAPPY?**  
\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall, Justin will be happy after all of this is over. In a previous reading, I got that although he will win, he will also lose something. However, this case will help Justin‚Äôs future career, and his fan base will increase.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall, Blake will not be happy after all of this is over.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall, Ryan will not be happy after all of this is over.

**THE SEQUEL**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Justin will not lose his rights to the sequel (I am surprised about this).

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Justin will film the next sequel called It Starts with Us with a completely new cast.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Production filming for It Starts with Us will begin in 2027.

**THE MAIN CAST**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The main cast will continue to support Blake publicly but will support Justin privately.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I asked if the main cast truly believe, Justin sexually harassed Blake and I got No.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I asked if the main cast were forced to take Blake‚Äôs side or coerced. I got No in one reading, and I also got Yes in another reading, so I am not too sure.¬† I personally think the main cast is doing this for financial reasons (future roles etc).

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I asked if the main cast likes Justin, and I got No.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I asked if the cast would apologise to Justin for what they did to him, and I got No.

**COLEEN HOOVER**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coleen Hoover will approach Justin after the trial ends to rebuild their relationship. (This is hard to believe ‚Äì I can‚Äôt see this happening).

**THE FUTURE OF BLAKE AND RYAN**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blake will continue to act in movies, but her reputation will be damaged.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ryan will lose some money due to this case. His reputation will be damaged, but his acting career will be unaffected in the future. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In the end they will all be fine (I find this hard to believe, logically speaking)¬†¬†¬†¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blake and Ryan will divorce in 3 years‚Äô time, so by 2028.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blake will be the one to divorce Ryan. Blake does not want to be a stay-at-home wife.

Let‚Äôs see how many of these predictions I get correct between now (16 Feb 2025 and 2028).

It was extremely challenging to do this reading because of all the moving parts and the amount of court cases.

I have a weak stream of pee and often have to ‚Äúpush‚Äù hard to get a strong stream going and (try to) fully empty my bladder. In this time, I will wake up 2-3 times a night to pee, every night. I can count on 1 hand the number of times I‚Äôve slept through an entire night in the last 5 years, and those were times where I had taken 2 ambien, or been very intoxicated. (I was previously prescribed ambien for this reason, to keep me asleep but it wouldn‚Äôt really work with just 1 pill. 2 made me very groggy the next day, so I stopped taking them.)

I have been to a urologist and they gave me some bladder strengthening exercises which I was consistently doing for close to 3 months but was not seeing any results. I stopped going to the urologist because my insurance wasn‚Äôt covering my visits and it was getting expensive.

I am a physically active person. Though I work an office job, I make it to the gym to lift weights 3-4 times a week, and run 1-2 times a week totaling close to 6 miles a week. I drink 1 cup of black coffee every morning, and have about 1 Celsius energy drink a week. I spend time with friends on weekends and often have a few beers. I do not smoke.  I am not on any medication. Just trying to paint a full picture.

I am writing this post because very recently, starting about 2 weeks ago I have been getting little to no sleep at night. When it‚Äôs time for bed, I get frequent pee urges that last throughout the night. It feels like I close my eyes for literally 5 minutes then I get a pee urge again. The urges feel like pee is in the tip and shaft of my penis, not necessarily my bladder. I have to sit on the toilet and push to get it out. I will literally get up, struggle to trickle out some pee, lay down for 5 minutes and try to sleep, then feel the urge again. This has been happening what feels like 30-40 times a night now. A stark rise from the previous 2-3 times where I could still get some decent hours of sleep. 

I know I‚Äôm young and active, and urinary problems aren‚Äôt very common with men my age. I am seeking advice as to what my diagnosis may be, and what I should do as next steps. Please any insight would be greatly appreciated. I can barely sleep and when it gets to evening times I am constantly going to the toilet to pee a very small amount at a time.

Sandy Flashes Back To When There's A Discussion Of Sheila's Fears About A Future Sandy Pregnancy From Dave. In The Present Sandy Makes Sure Dao And Mary Are Watching Sheila.","Sandy's perspective

I recline on my luxorious couch in the Domme's module watching my sister in her kennel. She's bitchsuited, resting on her elbows and knees. Her hooded head is bowed, and I watch as the rebreather bag her Trainee domme Mary attached to her mouth and tied around her head inflates and deflates, slowly replacing her breathable air with CO2. I know my sister is trying to stay calm and take shallow breaths. But it must be harder not to panic with each breath as your air gets fouler and fouler.

Not knowing when your domme will grant you a respite...

I never had the rebreather bag done to me, and that says something, considering how cruel Ari and her crew are. I look at Mary in annoyance, she's put her slave in a potentially dangerous bind, and she's leaning back with her eyes closed listening to music over head phones, not paying heed. I look pointedly at Dao, who seems to understand my concern and mouths ""I'll take care of it"". I try to relax, I don't want to step on any toes. But it's not just our slave, but my sister we've loaned for her apprentice's training.

I reflect at how far we've come as sisters, even from a week ago. I woke up to my phone buzzing in the middle of the night. It had been Lara. ""Sandy, sweetie, I'm sorry to wake you. But Sheila woke up from a nightmare. She keeps crying and saying ""Sandy and the baby died."" She won't go back to sleep until she sees you."" I sigh, but tell Lara ""I'll be right there."" We've been dancing around the reason she doesn't like my relationship with Dave for months. She's afraid I'll die in childbirth from the damage to my reproductive organs from being raped by Ari's men. We have to face it now, I realize.

I turn on the light and a nude Sarah has already scooted herself up to sitting on her camping Mattress. ""Es ett Eila?"" she mumbles around her ball gag, tugging reflexively at the padded ziptie handcuffs locking her hands behind her back. I'd run a tether around the cuffs to an eyelet in the wall. Nora is staying with her Master tonight, with Sarah's consent, she gave us permission to play.

""Yes"". I said as I hastily got into my clothes. ""utie eee. eee i fwend. weese iswess andy!"" Untie me. She's my friend, please, Mistress Sandy. I really should untie her, give her aftercare, then head up with her to Lara's. But getting to Sheila when she's like this can be time critical to prevent a full mental break.

Sorry, Sarah. I notice her legs are already in a semi  lotus position. She squeals as I grab a strap and tie her legs together crossed at mid calf. ""Sarah, help me back you directly to the walls, I'm shortening your tether to bind you directly to the wall eyelet. I'm sorry to constrain you like this, but I don't want you hurting yourself if you decide get  too frustrated and struggle."" A stubborn grunt, I know she's not going to help me scoot her cute Asian bum to the wall.

Deep Breath. ""Sarah, you know getting to Sheila in  time is critical. What if she has a complete break because we take our time to give you aftercare? We already promised security and night staff to avoid naked, bound slave girls in the hallways without prior notification after working hours. As Sheila's friend you should want to do what's best for her, not you. If you make me drag you to that wall, I'm strapping you in a posture collar and blackout hood.""

Cute curvy eyes blaze. She is so hot! Under any other circumstances, I'd...She does know I'm right, nodding her head and grunting again. ""Good girl."" I praise her, and she helps me scoot her cute nude asian butt to the wall, then firmly bind her hands against it.

I quickly put my laptop keyboard under her left toe. ""I'll Zoom call to let you know how she is. Just tap the keyboard with your foot when you hear it coming in. Thanks, sweetie, your a doll. I see why Nora loves you."" I kiss the hot, bound ex Navy girl on her forehead over her still blazing eyes. Then I hurry out the door in shorts, tanktop and slippers with my phone, locking it behind me. Quickly I text security there's a naked, bound girl in my room, she's a priority evac in an emergency.

I find myself knocking on the door to Lara and Sheila's. Lara answers the door in her robe, before she can say anything she's pushed aside by a robed blur that embraces me sobbing...apologizing for everything...and exclaiming how happy she is I'm alive.

Lara awkwardly guides us to the couch, my sister still clinging to me sobbing, patting Sheila's back. When she has a bad dream or flashback it's best to let her cry and babble, once she's reassured whatever awful thing she dreamed didn't happen, she'll open up.

After about a half hour she tells us about the dream. She's boss bitch again and running a hectic shooting schedule. I'm 8 months pregnant with Dave's baby, in the hospital due to ""complications"" . She said Dave reassured her he'll stay with me.
Sheila plans to visit me, when she can make the time.

Then Sheila's mother comes in to her Ready Room office supported by Constance. She sobbingly tells Sheila that my vitals dropped quickly and unexplicably, the doctors couldn't figure out how to stabilize me before I died. They tried to save the baby but it died, too. Then Sheila woke up next to Lara screaming in hysterical grief.

My first words were ""If I died pushing out that fucker's baby, He knows I'd kick his nuts up his nostrils."" Sheila and Lara laugh just as a knock sounds on the door. I get up and open it, to Layla and  Constance in Fatigue pants and tactical shirts, I guess what they had most handy when Lara texted them. Constance said they decided to wait the half hour for us to calm her down. Too many folks around, even those she loves, can make her feel more insecure until she calms down.

We sat down and Lara made us all coffee. As I sipped my cup, I looked at Sheila. Time to try and settle this. ""Sheila, we're having a talk tomorrow in Dave's office as equals. You, me, Dave, and you can bring Layla for emotional support. Dave and I have discussed having children, at least one. We've already consulted the best specialists money can buy about options IF we decide to have a child. I think I know why our relationship bothers you so much. We need to try to work through this.""

Sheila starts to demure ""We have a big slavesuit scene tomorrow, it will have to be rewritten if I'm not there, Besides I can't let the girls down by not being...

Lara claps her hand flat on the coffee table. ""Sheila, stop. Your mental health is more important. If I have to rewrite the scene, I will. Not only that, we're going to see if Dr. Izawa is available for you to talk to. "" Dr. Sierra Izawa was a PTSD and sexual trauma specialist retained by Dave for therapy sessions with my sister.

Sheila starts to object. Lara looks determined. ""I'm speaking as your lover and Chief Screenwriter, don't make me pull rank as your domme."" Sheila quieted down while I had an idea.

""Lara, can I borrow your laptop?"" Lara nods, looking puzzled. I Zoom Sarah. the Korean girl sits tied nude  in the lotus position, hands secured behind her to the wall, looking grumpy.

""Sarah, thank you for being patient. Sheila's fine. Well, she's ok for now, but there are things we need to do tomorrow for her mental health"" Sarah looks attentive and concerned at that.

""We need you to wear Sheila's slavesuit tomorrow for some scenes we're shooting. Your a little shorter, but  we can do some impromptu mods to fit you in safely. You'll have to be bottom slave, with Viv, Cindy and Layla as your Alphas, just because your not used to the suit. It's a temporary demotion. It's a big favor, so I'm asking Sandy to Sarah, not ordering domme to slave. You can say no and we won't be mad.""

Sarah doesn't hesitate to nod. ""Uh di it. fo eila."" she mumbled around her ball gag. I'll do it for Sheila.

""Thank you sweetie. No long lecture, you know the protocols, you helped write them.  Cindy, Vivian and Layla tell you when to speak and what to do in the abscence of a domme. They know you've developed quite a bit of technical expertise on the suits, so they'll accept your input if there's a problem. As long as you're respectful and follow their orders. Layla's here, and I'll remind your fellow slaves to take a light hand with you and leave your suit gag uninflated. Layla will be your direct superior and hold your suit remote. She'll be issued a flogger to discipline you, just in case. But I expect with our Top Slave she can keep it holstered, you know what's expected.""

Layla is behind my right shoulder looking at the bound Sarah in...a thirsty way. She does look scrumptious. ""Not the first time I've been your boss, Alpha Sarah, never had any trouble with you then, not expecting any now.""  The ball gagged girl nods. ""Oh ouble, fwumm eee, ulpa ayaala."" No trouble from me, Alpha Layla.

Now I notice Sheila, Layla and Constance all behind me...looking at the sexy, bound petite girl...hungrily. They tell me Sarah was easily embarrased her first year, even after she started to enjoy Nora domming her. Now with all of us staring at her like a hungry dog at a roast, she pushes out her breasts, so we can notice her hardening nipples. You can tell the dirty little sex slave would spread her legs if they weren 't tied crossways. No embarrasment now. I sort of wish I could invite everyone down to my room for a girl pile up, but we have too much to do tomorrow. Ah well, don't want to clean up all that girl come...

Then Sheila kisses her fingers and touches them to the screen, in an oddly non sexual gesture. ""Thank you, Sarah. I'm glad I have you."" She looks around at us and say ""All of you."" We go from a bunch of horny dyke and bi bitches to a bunch of BFF's who've found an island of solidarity in a man's world.

All of us present hug Sheila. Then Layla and Constance leave. I text Nora the situation.

Mistress Nora: OMG! Is Sheila okay?

Mistress Sandy: She's fine for now. She's standing down from her duties for today. Her, Dave and I are having a  talk about her fear of him putting a baby in me that will kill me. We might have her talk to her therapist if she needs it. I'm sure she'll want Lara there for moral support. We believe we can fit Sarah into Sheila's slavesuit for the day. I gave her a choice, she consented. 

Mistress Nora: ü§éü•µüíå my sweetie trapped in a slavesuit for the day. I'm going to have so much fun!.

Mistress Sandy: She's also going to be the Squad Beta for the day. Only because despite her vast technical knowledge of the suits, she's never actually worn one.
Layla will be her direct Alpha, with her suit remote and a flogger she shouldn't need to draw. But an order from Cindy and Vivian carries weight, I'm sure she knows that. 

Layla's a great leader, I'm sure she'll do one of her ""Squad Debriefs"" with our slaves to make sure they provide a clear chain of command and don't confuse the poor thing. As their domme I expect you to sit in, despite how much we all trust Layla.

Mistress Nora: Yes, Ma'am! Seriously, you know Layla and I will make sure she's safe and well supervised. I think Viv and Cindy like her more than they like each other, so I see no problem there. She'll probably be such a good girl it will almost take all the fun out of it.  Can I let the others haze her, just a little, if they want to and she consents?

Mistress Sandy: Use good judgement, Nora. Make her an bondage errand girl or something, but ask yourself what it will do to the group dynamic. Our boss ladies are really impressed with you lately. That says a lot, They're such sweet gals but take no crap when they're in charge. You got a title and a lot of power, prove you can handle it.

Mistress Nora: Geez, aren't you like, two months younger then me with less domme experience, MISTRESS Sandy. Joking. Seriously, I do understand my responsibilities better now, thanks to Constance and Lara. And you, you're a natural leader. Sheila always says you were like that growing up, taking charge and getting things done. I understand why you're still my supervisor despite my title. The slaves are in good hands, worry about taking care of Sheila.

Mistress Sandy: We will, we trust you, now. The shoot is taking place outside the studio, how do you want to transport the slaves and their suits?

Mistress Nora: We'll coffle them up nude and blinder hooded and transport them with their suits to the site. Except for Layla, as Alpha Slave Of the day, she'll suit up, but without her hood. She'll lead the coffle, strap them in to the transport, and help them into their suits when we get on site.

Mistress Sandy: Sounds good. How do you want to assemble the slaves for transport?

Mistress Nora: Have Layla wake up Cindy and Viv and brief them. After showers and breakfast, she'll suit up while they strip in the Ready Room. She'll bind them, gag them, and hood them, than lead them to the reception area. 

Mistress Sandy: Very good. What about Sarah?

Mistress Nora: Where is she now?

Mistress Sandy: Trussed up nude, criss cross apple sauce in my room. 

Mistress Nora:‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üíìüíï OMG! Okay, leave her there for now. When I arrive I'll untie her legs, escort her to the toilet and showers, and feed her. Then I'll hood and regag her. I meet Alpha Layla at reception, tie my sweetie at the end of the coffle. We roll out.

Mistress Sandy: Outstanding. Rough plan for arriving on site? 

Mistress Nora: Layla helps me unbind the slaves. We give them half an hour of aftercare. Then we help them into their suits, paying special attention to adjustments we may have to make to Sheila's suit for Sarah.  

Standard checks on their cooling and hydration systems throughout shooting. I'll let the other girls take off their headpieces and move around freely when we're not shooting. Sarah will have to leave her headpiece on  between takes and I'll lock her suit at attention.

This is not pointless cruelty! As Alpha Slave this is her chance to learn first hand the most unpleasant aspects of the suit, feeling helpless and trapped under some one else's literal control. She's normally a defacto domme, but I think it's an important part of her education not to forget where she came from. Standard hydration and cooling system checks while she's locked down. If she starts to seriously panic or hyperventilate we'll get her out of that thing. But you know Sarah, when she has to, she goes from all American girl to inscrutable Asian. I don't anticipate any issues there.

Mistress Sandy: Great job, Nora! You seem to have it covered. Let Lara or Constance know if you need anything today. I'd really like to focus on Sheila today.

Mistress Nora: You got it, Sexy Sandy!ü´¶ See your sweet mongrel ass later!

Sandy's flirting really turns me on...makes me regret despite all the fuckery on set we rarely get to touch each other. Maybe Dave would want to have a threesome with Nora and I....though he seems to have more paternal feelings toward her, like his Anamol Bachcha, Lara...

Stop it, Sandy you little horn dog! Your sister is your priority today.

Then I think about having to call Security to reactivate Layla's access to the Ready Room. Part of our method of humbling slaves is to revoke their access to the Ready Room and other spaces, except for the Alpha Slave. This is so they have to be escorted to go certain places. Should I have them deactivate Sarah's badge? Naw, just one day as bottom slave, not worth the bother.

Also have to call Props to deliver Layla's flogger and holster for her day as Alpha Slave. And I have to....

My phone buzzes. I look and it's my personal chat, not the Domme's group.

Constance: I know you, sugar. You're worried about running around making 
sure Nora crosses her t's and dots her i's. That is not your concern today, you're sister is. Lara and I got it from the top, my girl Layla from the bottom. I catch you trying to do anything besides helping Sheila today, I show you why being spanked by an angry black woman ain't fun!
Got it, Sugar?

I swear that woman is eerily psychic. She's right, too.

Sandy: I got it! Thanks, you're the best, Constance!

Constance: You're welcome, Sugar. Flattery will get you everywhere with me. You tend to your sister now. Bye.

So around 7:30 I'm in Dave's office sitting across from him at his desk. He got peeved when I didn't tell him right away about Sheila's ""episode"". I told him I didn't want to wake him for a bunch of mushy, girly stuff. The only thing he would have liked is seeing Sarah nude and trussed. He grumbles but knows I'm right.

I wanted to wait for our meeting with Sheila and Lara until after 8. Dave insists it happen right after breakfast, so here we are. Miri buzzes Dave's desk ""Lara and Sheila are here, Mr. Henson.""

He presses the intercom button, ""Send them in, thank you, Miri."" Lara comes in with in a gray power pantsuit, Sheila in her normal civvies of designer jeans and Armani blouse. She even has on her fedora.
She's holding onto Lara's hand, but releases it to hang up her hat.

""You can leave it on, for today, young lady."" Whatever makes you more comfortable.""
He shrugs when she gives him an incredulous look, then hangs it up anyway. ""Suit yourself, young lady.""

I'm sitting to Dave's right. Sheila takes the center seat and Lara sits to her left. I'm cradling Sheila's ""Boss Bitch"" coffee cup and hand it off to my suprised older sibling ""French Roast, just the way you like it big, sis."" She thanks me and demurely sips my offering. Then she gazes steadily at Dave.

""Young Lady, we've danced around the problem you have with Sandy and I's relationship for too long. We need to air it out, as it's obviously affecting your mental state, and quite honestly your ability to fulfil your role in our current operation. We at least get started working it out, TODAY!""

Another demure sip of coffee. She squared up to me when I slugged her in my panic over Logan when we first reunited. Before that I saw her clipping off three round bursts from an automatic rifle like a trained soldier. I know she's not as soft as I thought growing up. But sometimes her dainty little mannerisms still make me think of the derogatory nickname I gave her when we were kids. ""Miss Priss."" Now she holds Dave's gaze steadily and says ""I agree, Dave."" He nods.

We're pretty sure what her problem is, but Dave wants to eliminate the possibility of other factors. He asks Sheila if his general misogny bothers her with respect to me. Is she afraid he'll abuse or oppress me in some way? …îAs if I'd let him! But I guess it's a fair question.

Sheila says she's seen how working with women as near equals has softened his chauvanism. She was initially afraid he'd try to pressure me into a role I was unhappy with. She says I tend to let boys dictate my actions when I'm attracted to them, she uses that lame ass Joey as an example.

She hastens to add that she's been impressed how much Dave just lets me be myself and loves me for it. She also says she noticed I've become stronger at setting boundaries with men I like. She thinks our relationship is a healthy one despite the age difference. I do point out she's the one who harps on me about proper Southern Girl behavior when we helps doll me up for our dates. Her point that we have to make our enemies believe I'm being ""groomed"" as proper wife material for an older Southern Gentleman is well taken.

Dave asks if there's any other issue Sheila might have before he addresses the elephant lurking about. She shakes her head no.

He says bluntly ""Your nightmare and panic attack last night indicate you're afraid I'll impregnate Sandy, and she'll die as a result. Nows you're chance to speak up, young lady, Sandy and I want to hear your thoughts on this. Take a deep breath, take your time, but if you don't talk to us, you're talking to your therapist, today.""

A flash of stubborn defiance in her eyes. Oh no, Dave, don't press her to hard. Then she sighs and sips from her coffee cup.

""When Dave's medical team told us how bad a pregnancy could go for you, thanks to the rape, neglect and abuse you suffered, I couldn't stand without Sarah holding me up. When I found out that bastard had to rape you one last time-""

She closes her mouth at my angry look. I've told her Brian and I only had sex once, and I pressed him for it. She dismisses me as a poor traumatized girl who's Stockholm syndrome got played by an older, manipulative man. I understand why she'd feel that way, but she could listen when I try to explain Brian is a changed man. According to her he's just an opportunist playing both sides to see which one comes out on top.

""When I heard you had sex with Brian before he released you and the boy."" She spits that last out like she doesn't believe it. I just felt so bleak. I was so relieved you didn't pop pregnant after a few months. But that was just kicking the can down the road.""

""Then you started flirting with every guy from the intern in accounting to the guest star who played Admiral Barnes. I remembered just before I left home you had a new boyfriend every week, at thirteen! And when I came back to visit ma was hysterically convinced you were sexually active no matter how many curfews and restrictions they put on you. Daddy just got that mad look like he'd like to catch any boy that did impregnate you."" 

I look at her, hoping she doesn't mention I told her I was sexually active, just not in the way they thought. My nickname in High School was ""Sandy Suck Slut"" if that gives a clue.  I only had actual sex with one boy before Joey. Dave knows, we even laughed about it sometimes. But despite all the fuckery that goes on around here, and Lara being a former hardcore porn star, I just don't want Sheila to put it out here, in this setting...

Thankfully she skips it.  ""I couldn't help but worry, I know you're on the pill, but that's not always 100% effective. I was worried. Then the night you free me, I find out you and Dave have been fucking for I don't know how long.""

I stop to think about it. She doesn't know, we never told her, or anyone that I recall that was our first time together. Normally I'd just be, it's no one's beeswax...but I think my sister has a need to know. 

""Sheila, please be careful who you tell this. You too, Lara. Dave and I had sex the first time that night we sprung you, and you decided to come back. I offered myself to him to free you. He said he was going to do it anyway and turned my offer down. I kind of pressed because he's such a sexy guy, and I kind of always get my way, because I'm a little bratty.""

Sheila and Lara look at me shocked, then at Dave. He nodded and said ""Yes, it's true, especially the brat part."" We share a small smile. 

""Sheila. It seems you're most afraid of your sister dying from pregnancy. I know you're worried your parents have been pressuring her for grandkids since they found out about us.""

""First, we've already consulted several specialists, in case we decide to have a child. They're are a lot of ways to get Sandy and a prospective baby safely through at least one pregnancy. That's still a big if, but the option's there. Second, we're going to tell your parents, together, about the damage to Sandy's reproductive system, the dangers to her of a pregnancy. And what options we have to mitigate it, if we decide to go ahead with it. Big IF.""

Sheila looks like a huge weight has left her shoulders. ""That does make me feel better."" She says. Dave speaks up ""We'll keep talking, but I think it'll be easier for all of us now that it's out in the open."" 
Sheila seems about to say more when my, Dave's and Lara's phones buzz.

I pull out my phone and it's Nora in our Dommes' chat. 

Mistress Nora: How's Sheila doing?

Mistress Lara: We're here in Dave's Office, with Sandy. Had a nice chat, got some things out in the open so to speak. She's doing better. How are you and the girls.

Mistress Nora: We're good. Waiting out some light rain. Well, as a punishment Sarah is locked at attention out in it.

Mistress Lara: Punishment for what?

Mistress Nora: We were making her act as a serving slave to the crew, she accidentally spilled some bottled waters on some people. Poor thing, I know she's going to be clumsy on the first day in it. But we've punished all the girls for similar clumsy acts in the suit. We all voted a half hour in the rain, locked at attention, gag inflated, hydration shut off. And the electro butt plug buzzing up her butt.

She sends a picture of a slender figure from the back. A girl black slave suited from head to toe, except her bare butt. We can see the plug buzzing up it. a haze of light rain dripping off her bare bum.

Front picture. Same slender girl, covered except for her eyes, breasts and pussy, locked at rigid attention. Her pretty eyes staring miserably up at the cloud raining on her. Sentenced to this misery by her peers and her Mistress for unavoidable clutziness.

I know the suit and plug are weather proofed. It should even provide some protection except for her exposed extremities. Still even a half hour locked up in the rain with that stupid plug buzzing up her butt...

Mistress Lara: I think I'll send Mistress Constance to check up on you girls.

Mistress Nora: Everything will be in order. The slave's punishment was adjucated by her peers who all have significant time in the suit. She's executed similar punishments on all of them including Sheila. In the blazing midday sun, sometimes. It doesn't hurt her to get a feel for the punishments she metes out. She may decide to be more merciful the next time she's deciding punishment.

Mistress Lara: I have no doubt everything you're doing is above reproach. I still think I want to have my Executive Domme look in on you.

Mistress Nora: As you command, Mistress Lara. 

We chit chatted in Dave's office for a whole hour. After that I spent the rest of the day in the Ready Room with Lara and Sheila. They brainstormed episode ideas, and even listened to some of mine.

Constance praised Nora, saying she found no discrepancies when she talked privately with the slaves. Including Sarah, who felt her punishment was just and bore no grudge for it. She said it did give her more consideration the next time she controlled a slave's suit remote. And Nora's letting her peers decide her punishment was a brilliant touch. The other slave's did give her tip for moving around in the suit after her time was done.

I come back to the present, prepared to say something to Mary about adjusting Sheila's rebreather bag, she's obviously getting desperate as her air fouls. 

Dao slaps Mary's left shoulder, and points admonishingly at the slave when she removes her headphones. She rushes to remove the rebreather bag and let Zero breathe clean air.

I settle back in my seat, relieved. I swear to keep caring about her safety, as much as she so obviously cares about mine. Even after what I've done to her...

+++

What has worked for me better than anything else? Filming it.

Even if I know I'm going to delete the footage immediately after, there is something about knowing the camera is rolling that fundamentally alters the way I perform. If you haven't tried it, you should. You may be surprised at how strangely sexy it is to watch. You will be even more surprised at how differently you can behave knowing you have an imaginary audience. I didn't just swallow my cum, I cooed with it on my tongue, and then waited for the rest to drip out and caught that, too. The post-nut clarity gets backgrounded, somehow, by the inherent pleasure of putting on a good show.

Fun filming advice for achieving ""good show"" results:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Let yourself be a little sexy with it. Start with your underwear on, grope yourself a little, and THEN reveal the goods. You'll see on rewatch, it makes a difference.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†If you have a sexy voice, maybe narrate what you do while you do it, and how it feels to do it. Let yourself feel stupid talking about your pleasure: it's cute, and holds up extremely well on rewatch.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Don't just jerk off in one long static shot of your junk. Hold the camera until you can't anymore. Show your face frequently, if not at all times. Fondle your balls, your stomach, your ass. Experiment with techniques, play with camera angles, and when the cum finally hits your tongue let the appreciation sound in your voice.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†On a similar note: Be noisy with the sounds your own cum can make in your mouth. Let some out on your lips and then lick/suck it back up. PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD. It is the true star of the show. Please grab the phone and show off the load before you swallow it, including any stray droplets that got on your face before you wipe off.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Tell the viewer how it tastes. If you wind up filming multiple times, you'll grow to appreciate how the flavor of your own cum can vary. Tip within a tip: if you like coffee, maybe give your next post-joe nut a nosh. I find it makes mine taste robustly yummy, and helps to mask the metallic vitamin aftertaste cum has.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Pro-tip: A croc with a strap makes a solid camera-phone holder. The strap can be adjusted to whatever angle you need, e.g., to tilt the camera downward to record the cum falling into your mouth.",1,1739747527.0,u_just_browsing_couple,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve also been experiencing coffee grounds getting into the cup too.

For me it's Kate, because I followed her relationship with William from the beginning, not out of disrespect, although I know she prefers to be called Catherine. She's like Fergie, I even forget her name is Sarah because she's always been Fergie to me.

Neil Sean is commenting on what happened behind the scenes on walkabout day after the Queen's death (Elizabeth II will always be ""The Queen"" although I know there are other Queens)

https://preview.redd.it/e8cbgd67wkje1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3354425b0f8b2dcef0c2b70046de9f0f08cec8ba

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3wFgxsA-xA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3wFgxsA-xA)

According to a former Megsy employee, who spoke to Sean, Megsy is ""very hurt, humiliated and upset"" with Kate for saying that that walk was the hardest thing she has ever had to do. Because it was also very difficult for the Saint too (if you watch the video, the moment when Sean imitates Megsy in the interview with Tom Bradby is great)

According to that source, Megsy said that ""there were two sides to that story"". And that side, Megsy's, is the funny one. 

Because according to that source, Megsy said that she was very sad about the death of the Queen, a woman whom she ""knew, admired and appreciated"" and with whom she ""had a special relationship"" and who the Queen had trusted in her. Please clean up if you have spilled your coffee.

Here's the gossip: according to that source, Megsy had asked William and Kate for a meeting between the three of them before meeting the people. Don't forget that Sean doesn't tell it, I tell it: William and Kate already had a delay in that outing because of the Harkles who had taken a long time to decide to go out with them. I think the departure was delayed about half an hour or more because of the Harkles.

So it's clear why William and Kate said ""No"" to Megsy. And it seems, according to Sean's source, that they weren't polite in telling her ""No"", which is why Megsy started crying. And I believe that, because we saw that it was wrong on that outing, that something happened that she not only did not expect but that went really wrong for her.

According to Sean, and we all saw it, William and Harry get out from one side of the vehicle, Kate gets out and Megsy comes out behind, and Kate doesn't even look back at her sister-in-law, I think they directly greet one of the officials and Megsy stays behind without knowing what to do and William introduces the sister-in-law. And I notice now, Kate gives Megsy a hard look, like ""fuck this and I swear I'll crush you.""

  
The video of when everyone gets out of the vehicle

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzbnqJ2B6nY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzbnqJ2B6nY)

You know what? It reminded me of what Neil Sean said about Wimbledon. A few days ago, in another video, Sean said that Megsy, on her first outing with Kate to Wimbledon, wanted Kate to break protocol and get the two of them out of the car and hold hands, as if they were great friends. And Kate told her that she wasn't going to do that, that the Queen expected them both to behave. 

According to Sean's source, Megsy wanted something similar in the exit after the Queen's death, that is, as a ""clean slate."" In fact, Sean's source says that Megsy wanted a meeting with Kate, and Kate said something to the effect of ""I'd rather be dead than be with you alone."" From what Sean is telling, according to his source, the Cambs, at that time the new Princes of Wales, were being openly hostile to Megsy, not tolerating anything from her. And that explains Megsy's face that day, and her desire to break the protocol anyway, but she found herself with the Waleses, extremely firm in not giving way and with an entire organization telling her ""you move two millimeters from what we ordered you and we will send you out of the UK.""

Megsy miscalculated things.",296,1739747027.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,158,0.95,False

1ir59aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1ir59aq/creepy_maintenance_guy/,Creepy Maintenance Guy.,"I'm a woman 25 living alone. A few incidents have caused me to be suspicious but this past Saturday confirmed it. 

Incident 1
Making small talk with the maintenance guy(I regret I'm stupidly friendly to people) after the it's cold outside commentary I face forward but he's still staring at me. I look back up because that's pretty weird and he has a smirk on his face and doesn't even snap out of it likes he's lagging even when I give him the wtf look. After 5 seconds he looks away. And my gut told me to run. 

Incident 2
I'm training my dog. We are walking back and forth near my apartment building when she pulls I walk the opposite direction. As I turn while my dog has pulled facing the apartment the maintenance guy is staring at me it's about 30-40 ft away so he has to tilt his head like a peeping Tom to see us. The weirdest look in his face. I immediately go train my dog elseehere. 

Incident 3
Someone left an envelope on my car window in the parking Garage. Only it wasnt the ticket envelope I thought it was. I open it and it's empty guess who walks past. The creepy Maintenance guy waving. My hand also went limp later that day. At around 2am my fingers kept tingling so I rushed to the emergency room like a paranoid freak telling them about the maintenance guy and asked if it could be fentanyl or something. I made a police report to 311 they told me to call back in the morning but I forgot. But I did tell them at the hospital. 

Incident 4
I tell property manager I'm heading to St Louis to take my well trained pup so see my dad who just had a stroke to keep him busy for 2 weeks he just got out of rehabilitation to 85-90% recovery. On February 11th I run into the crazy guy who ask me when I'm leaving to St Louis as I'm holding my dog and I stupidly say this weekend. I don't even know how he knew. 

I wake up late on February 15th. We head out for STL around 1pm. I get coffee, gas and I forgot my dogs crate. We go back home since we are only at the gas station. Guess who is by my door the fucking maintenance. His stammering excuse is that he's there to paint my door. It's scary ASF because my door is fine. It doesn't need painting. They also have key access to everyone's unit. 

My dog who is used to seeing the psycho who doesn't bark at people maybe sensing my panick viciously barks at him to fuck off. 

I got a ring indoor camera from target asap. He could've gone back when I left for target idk. But before leaving the ring camera was and still is on. I'm only scared they could shut off power and it's a wrap. 

I'm going to report him to management on Tuesday. I don't want bad blood because I live there but I also don't want to end up on the news.

**LOCATION: Isifriss, Skruerika City, Skruerika University Staff Lounge**

Date: HST - 2150.01.23 | Arxur Dating System - 1733.882  
Location: Arxur Colony World - Isifriss. Closest Arxur-Controlled planet to Earth.¬†  
(13 human years since the end of the Human-Federation War).

The lounge was usually a quiet and reserved space, a refuge from the socializing required in any university. Students had their libraries and study halls and quiet quads, the staff had a lounge for every department. There were soft blankets and pillows, a designated tea-brewing area, puzzles, and a wall full of scannable codes to access digital copies of precious books in storage.

The sanctity of this space, however, was under assault. While working on a potential lesson plan, Halthekar had served Lux some concentrated, caffeinated vrassi tea‚Ä¶ in¬† a traditional arxur cup.

‚Äú...um‚Ä¶‚Äù Lux looked completely befuddled. ‚Äú...I thought you said a cup of tea.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes. That is your cup.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a spoon. Maybe a very big spoon but‚Ä¶ I mean, I guess a ladle?‚Äù They held up the offending object. A ‚Äúladle‚Äù wasn‚Äôt quite right, but it also wasn‚Äôt that far off either. It was more of a shallow triangular saucer on the end of a long stick. Deeper than a wooden cooking spoon, but not by much.

Halthekar looked equally mystified. ‚ÄúThese are the cups for strong teas. You said you were tired, and I asked if you wanted concentrated‚Ä¶‚Äù He wondered if maybe a demonstration would help. So he took the kettle of steaming tea and carefully poured a tiny splash onto his cup and stared at Lux to see if they were getting it.

Lux stared at him, slack jawed. ‚ÄúThat's a spoon. You reinvented the spoon. What even‚Äîyou‚Äôre holding that like a violin bow, what *is* that?‚Äù¬†

Isaja, the head of Classics, sat unnoticed and watched them the way one watches a rare animal crossing through their backyard.

Halthekar held up his head and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúThat is how it is designed to be held. See, there are indents there for your claws.‚Äù

Lux held up their small, primate hand. ‚ÄúYou realize I only have one thumb and no claws, right?‚Äù

Halthekar simply curled one thumb up into his palm, and repeated the motion, gesturing at Lux to do the same.

They attempted to copy hal's strange overhanded grip, but it only made the saucer wobble dangerously. They quickly set down the cup and drank from the edge to lower the spilling risk with their lips pursed. Risk mitigated, they tried again, and again it wobbled, worse and worse the closer it got to their mouth.

Lux chuckled exasperatedly and shook their head. ""This is insane, why is your cup a spoon?""¬†

‚ÄúIt is not a spoon. It is a traditional cup used for strong teas. These have been used since the Tero period in the northern Lreshe, more than a thousand years ago. As teas got stronger, cups got smaller. It is very sensible.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs barely a shot of tea. I've drunk six shots of espresso in one morning, I can take your three milligrams per deciliter tea in a mug. What's wrong with mugs?‚Äù they asked, their hand shaking for a moment as they looked back and forth between Hal and the cup.

‚ÄúMugs are fine! I have no problems with mugs,‚Äù Halthekar‚Äôs other hand was gesticulating wildly. ‚ÄúBut *these* are what we use for this type of tea. It is very sensible,‚Äù he insisted again. ‚ÄúThe structure naturally limits the amount you will drink, and the handle is optimal for arxur claws.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't *have claws*‚ÄìI‚Äì‚Äù Lux took another deep sharp breath and let it out slowly. After the third failed attempt, they grabbed the handle like a spoon, resting the handle on their middle finger, with their thumb and index above for stability, and drank the full cup of tea like a shot.¬†

Halthekar took a moment to calm himself. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I have more? This is *not* enough caffeine.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAre you going to drink it correctly this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven that I can't hold it with my tiny clawless fingers, probably not, no.‚Äù

Halthekar sighed deeply and shook his head, but filled their cup again anyways. ‚ÄúWatch. Like this.‚Äù

The image of a giant Arxur taking an impossibly dainty sip from what looked to them like an oversized spoon had Lux tumbling into a sudden bout of laughter.¬†

‚ÄúWhat? What is so funny?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...I can't‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶‚Äù they failed to speak between gasps, and just grabbed the cup by the body, completely ignoring the handle, and drank it like a shot again.¬†

Halthekar growled softly and took another tiny sip. The two stared at each other, a silent standoff. They held their fancy tea and the tension rose and rose. It was a scene not unlike those from one of Lux‚Äôs ‚Äúclassic westerns,‚Äù with the rugged frontier men and their twitching trigger fingers, Halthekar thought.

Each waited for the other to make a move, determined, unwavering. Dangerous. Teacups held at the ready. The only thing missing was a stray tumbleweed somewhere, and maybe a harmonica paired with some acoustic strings to round out the soundscape.¬†

Then came a chuckle. ‚ÄúYou two are like Angelique and Reginald from *Across the Ring.*‚Äù

Lux and Halthekar both wheeled around to look at Isaja finally breaking her silence.

All the imagined tension vanished as Lux broke into high barks of laughter, Hal chuckling along as well. ‚ÄúYou watch *Across the Ring*?‚Äù Lux asked, grinning.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have seen all 14 seasons.‚Äù

Lux's jaw dropped. They looked at Hal.¬†

‚ÄúI have also seen all 14 seasons.‚Äù

They gasped theatrically. ‚ÄúThis isn't a translator error, you're both talking about the medieval fantasy musical show with the talking swords and bar that walks on chicken feet like Baba Yaga's house?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they both said.

‚Äú...Two eminent professors violating interstellar law to consume human media. And you do it to watch *Across the Ring.*‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good show,‚Äù they said simultaneously again.

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well-- I don‚Äôt know, I guess I imagined that if you were going to *break the law* it would be for something more‚Ä¶ critically acclaimed. Maybe *Saturnalia*.‚Äù

Isaja shrugged. ‚ÄúI like it. It is very cute.‚Äù

‚ÄúI enjoy the talking sword,‚Äù Hal offered simply. ‚ÄúAnd the musical numbers.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! The music!‚Äù Isaja agreed, nodding fervently. ‚ÄúMore human television should have musical numbers. Their voices are already musical.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazing,‚Äù Lux said, shaking their head with another chuckle. ‚Äú...Anyway, yes, you‚Äôre completely right. Halthekar is definitely Angelique.‚Äù

Halthekar flinched back. ‚ÄúNo, *you* are Angelique. Angelique is very small and gets up to mischief.‚Äù

Lux gasped. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm average sized!‚Äù

Isaja scoffed lightly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Angelique says too.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs also average sized!‚Äù Lux shot back at her, though with a laugh.

Halthekar placed a hand imperiously across his chest. ‚Äú*I* have to be Reginald. Reginald is the sane one.‚Äù

They let out a helpless groan. ‚ÄúWhatever, I‚Äì‚Äù Their face fell. ‚ÄúOh shit, I have class!‚Äù¬†

With that, they grabbed the cup like a ladle, dipped it into the pot of tea, and drank it all in one long gulp. ‚ÄúGood luck sorting the ancient philosophers!‚Äù

(13 human years since the end of the Human-Federation War).

I was glad to get out of genetic engineering class. We were starting lab work and the workloads were ramping up fast, making me feel only further and further behind. I‚Äôd actually started to dread some of my classes. The semester had already begun to drag, and it didn‚Äôt look like it was about to stop anytime soon.

At least I didn‚Äôt dread my *Terran Philosophy* class. Perhaps it was simply that the professor was accommodating and easy on the grades. We'd done three ‚Äòreading responses‚Äô so far, and I had grades in the 12s in all of them. Much more accommodating. *Yes, I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs the reason*. *Other classes are just harder, it‚Äôs normal to be stressed about harder classes.*

And this time, for once, I‚Äôd actually made it to his class before he did! The shuttle schedules *still* had yet to be fixed, which meant that‚Ä¶ he was late. That was unusual. He ran into the room and scrambled to get the projector ready to translate what he wrote on the board.

‚ÄúSorry about the delay, class, I got a little sidetracked on my way here. No worries, we'll be coming back to this topic in the Ethics portion of the class anyway, so we have some wiggle room,‚Äù he said, and began to write down on the board.¬†

*Social epistemology.*

‚ÄúSo I mentioned this in one of our first classes. Social epistemology is both the oldest form and a relatively recently formalized form of epistemology. It has many aspects, some of which are easier to understand than others. We will begin with *testimony.*‚Äù

*Was he speaking faster than usual?*

‚ÄúYou guys know testimony, right? What comes to mind when it comes to testimony?‚Äù¬†

A few students called out answers. ‚ÄúFormal evidence,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúSomething that was witnessed and verified,‚Äù another said. The class had clearly gotten a lot more comfortable with the strange human style of lecture-discussion.

‚ÄúOooh, formal, that's interesting, so first of all we need to clarify that testimony is not‚Ä¶ just in court. Testimony is anything anyone tells you. For example, I can tell you that I drank three cups of concentrated vrassi tea before class because I was falling asleep at my desk. You weren't there. You couldn't observe it. But you can have access to that information because I am providing it to you in the form of testimony.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did seem a little jittery. More than usual, I mean,‚Äù Krosha noted from near the front.

‚ÄúAh, jittery, fantastic!‚Äù he said, and wrote it down on the board. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good example for later. But right now, we're on testimony. What can we learn from testimony?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou learn whatever the person tells you, assuming you trust them at their word,‚Äù Surisel said.

‚ÄúYes, trust them at their word, very good. The word for that is *credibility*. I am a teacher, and you are students. If I tell someone that you have done something wrong in class, and you claim you haven't, who are they going to believe?‚Äù

Surisel picked at some scales. ‚ÄúThe professor‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, because I have *credibility*. Now imagine we were in a time before the Fall, and the same thing happened‚Ä¶ who would believe anything a human says? And why? I wouldn't have nearly as much credibility.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòCredibility,‚Äô sure. No one would have given their words any weight at all when we didn‚Äôt know what they were capable of. Of course, now many are wondering if we perhaps give their words *too* much weight. But I supposed that was besides the point.

‚ÄúWhat changed? The answer is *social capital,‚Äù* he wrote it on the board. ‚ÄúMy position changed. How much you value my opinion changed. We‚Äôll talk more about capital and its role in society when we discuss Marxism, but the key here is that people have to *agree* that you have it. If everyone suddenly decided that I wasn‚Äôt worth listening to‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt have a job.‚Äù¬†

*I wonder if he knows how much other people argue about his credibility online. Depends on which part of our internet you‚Äôre on, of course. Being a ‚Äòcriminal‚Äô probably doesn‚Äôt help with ‚Äòcredibility.‚Äô*

‚ÄúSome people have more credibility and some have less. I‚Äôm sure if you ask your friends, you will grow to understand that you attribute credibility to different groups of people. Your friends will probably not value the opinion of your parents particularly more highly than they value their own parents‚Äô opinions, for example, or siblings, or roommates, or other people you have had more access to and gained more reasons to trust than they have‚Äù

His pupils looked huge as he looked out at us. *Not immune to caffeine, then.* I smirked. The higher energy made him seem a little less like he was perpetually in a hunting trance.¬†

‚ÄúSo, now that we know a little more about credibility, let‚Äôs get back to testimony. You could plausibly take a blood sample, and learn that same information about me. What are some things we can *only* learn from testimony?‚Äù

‚Äú...The perspective of the person telling you?‚Äù Kizath guessed.

Lux's face lit up. ‚ÄúYes! *Perspective*, very good Kizath. You can learn, for example, what is and is not *acceptable*. Remember the bus standing rules? Did anyone sit you down to explain those to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we just learn it eventually. It makes more sense for us anyways.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight! You absorb information from those around you through shared experiences. There was a time‚Äìmaybe before the Fall, maybe before Betterment‚Äìwhen those buses didn't exist. How did the rules arise?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would guess as soon as someone‚Äôs tail ended up in someone else‚Äôs legs,‚Äù Skarviss said dryly.

Prof. Swift chuckled. ‚ÄúRight. And then what happened? They *constructed* those rules. But it wasn't that one person established them and everyone took them at their word, they constructed those rules *together*. The rules were *socially constructed.*‚Äù

He wrote those words on the board too. *He‚Äôs not wrong about it,* I thought. It isn‚Äôt like there‚Äôs a plaque on every shuttle that tells you how to sit. And those rules all fall apart anyways when the thing inevitably gets too crowded and you don‚Äôt have the luxury of choosing seats any more.

‚ÄúAnd you saw what was happening, and drew a conclusion. You *inferred* these socially constructed rules from the evidence around you in your youth.‚Äù

He wrote down ‚ÄòSocial Inference‚Äô on the board.

‚ÄúSocial inference is really important for playing social games. You might consider something like snatchdash a social game, and it is, but so is driving. Driving is socially constructed. It requires consensus. If you know how to operate all of the individual parts of a vehicle, but you don‚Äôt know the rules of the road‚Ä¶ do you really know how to drive?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Krosha scoffed. ‚ÄúYou only know half of how to drive, you would be endangering everyone else if you tried. The rules are part of driving.‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúExactly. And on a different planet, the rules might be different. Who goes on the left or right, for example. Speaking of which‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve noticed a lot of you will, on occasion, just change which hand you‚Äôre writing notes with‚Äîthose that aren‚Äôt typing that is. And the reason for that, I imagine, is that your hand gets tired, yes?‚Äù

Students nodded at him or tapped their tails.

‚ÄúNow, have any of you seen me do that? Ever? The answer is no, I‚Äôve never switched over to my right hand to write notes, even though‚Ä¶‚Äù he wiggled his hand in the air to demonstrate ‚Äúmy hand gets tired too. Do you have any guesses as to why you‚Äôve never seen me switch?‚Äù

I tilted my head. I *hadn‚Äôt* seen him do that, though granted, it‚Äôs not exactly the sort of thing one looks out for. Of all the weird and different ways that humans just *are,* that wasn‚Äôt the one people paid attention to.

‚ÄúThe answer is *handedness*. I can't write with my right hand. I can only write with my left. I could learn, in theory, but it would be very difficult and I haven‚Äôt had occasion to. The human motor map is naturally a little more asymmetrical than the arxur map, which means nearly every human has a *meaningfully* dominant hand, arm, leg, and eye.‚Äù

*That‚Äôs weird.*

‚ÄúBack on Earth, there were whole societies that had superstitions about handedness. Left-handed people were considered evil, to the point that the word *sinister* is derived from *left!*‚Äù¬†

My snout scrunched up a bit as I wondered if any of the other species in the galaxy had this ‚Äúhandedness,‚Äù and if they, too, made up nonsense about it.

‚ÄúThose rules, just like the sitting rules, were socially constructed. At some point people stopped caring nearly as much, and handedness stopped being all that important,‚Äù he said with a shrug.¬†

I doubted we would be dropping our sitting etiquette any time soon. It wasn‚Äôt based on superstition, for one. It was simply annoying to deal with someone else's tail in your legs.

‚ÄúYou might think ‚Äòoh, but your ‚Äòhandedness‚Äô rule was silly and ridiculous, which is why you got rid of it. Ours are reasonable and convenient‚Äô. But think about it. If someone is left-handed‚Ä¶ that means they can shake your hand with their right and stab you with their left. It means they will come against you from an angle you are very unfamiliar with‚Äìonly ten percent of the human population is left-handed. They spend their whole lives dealing with right-handed people. They‚Äôre used to it. You‚Äôre not used to dealing with them. And they‚Äôll be coming at you from your *weakest side*. Some buildings were designed to be easier to defend by right-handed people, spiral stairs that provide easy cover. A left-handed person rushing up is a greater threat. It also means you have to build different tools for them to use, if your tools are designed for the right hand only. There are many reasons why a left-handed person may be a hassle or a threat to accommodate in a pre-industrial society. As I understand it, you guys can have handedness too, it's just weaker and easier to train out, so it was never that important.‚Äù

*So it* did *matter at one point.* And I could actually understand the ‚Äúsinister‚Äù angle, too, like seeing these left-handed people as a sort of uncanny, very-slightly-off group. It was a fascinating context for an otherwise silly superstition.

*So the reasonable reaction became a social norm, slowly became less relevant, and then it became a superstition as the social norm died off. Hm.*

He kept talking. ‚ÄúThe importance of handedness went down as the industrial revolution began to be more prominent, and as stabbing people became a progressively rarer thing for the average citizen to deal with.‚Äù

*Wow, they really are just like us*. I struggled to avoid laughing.

‚ÄúBut there are thousands of rules just like that, all around you, some of which are easier to shake than others.‚Äù

He went back to the board and tapped on ‚ÄòSocial construction.‚Äô

‚ÄúSocial construction is the cultural air you breathe, the water you swim in. It is *everywhere* around you. Ideas as big as the structure of your government, or what counts as good manners, or as simple as how you build your streets or hold your teacups, are socially constructed. If it was different a thousand years ago, it is probably socially constructed. If it would be different if everyone decided it should be‚Ä¶ it is probably socially constructed. This idea *rocked* wealthy societies on Earth for like, a hundred years. It was shockingly difficult for people to wrap their heads around. And yet, it underlied hundreds of social movements for equality, legal rights, access to resources, and more.‚Äù

Looked at in those terms, I wondered if what mom was doing counted as cheating. It was a little like sneaking a look at the humans‚Äô homework, to try to transplant their social constructs onto arxur society. How would we know how to fix them when they went wrong?

‚ÄúUnfortunately, because of that, I‚Äôve actually set up most of the social constructionism in the syllabus to be in the Political Philosophy section, a few weeks down the road as we get further into Ethics. So just‚Ä¶ know that they exist, keep them in mind, and we‚Äôll get really into them pretty soon. The next part about social epistemology I want to bring up is *group epistemology*! And that‚Äôll be really useful next class, which is our bridge from epistemology to ethics. Namely‚Ä¶ *Epistemic injustice*. Ready?‚Äù

More nodding and tail-tapping. I shifted in my seat, curious.

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve talked about the bus thing, and that‚Äôs a fantastic example so I think I‚Äôll stick with it. Imagine that one of your friends is hit over the head by a‚Ä¶ piece of construction equipment or something. He has some brain damage, and has forgotten the rules of how to stand around in a bus. Now that he has forgotten‚Ä¶ is it the case that the group of people in the bus have forgotten? If one person in the bus doesn‚Äôt know it, can we say the population of the bus doesn‚Äôt know it?‚Äù

I raised a hand. ‚ÄúNo, of course not.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight! We still think they know it. In fact, if ten percent of the people in the bus forgot it, we might still think the group collectively knows it. Why is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause the other 90 percent still know it. The bus would ultimately still take on the correct seating arrangement,‚Äù I answered again.

‚ÄúVery good! But it‚Äôs not just a majoritarian thing. I asked a few classes ago, how the *arxur AI world* is going. How much do the arxur know about AI? Unless your education is very different from the rest of the galaxy, what I‚Äôm asking is not actually a question of what the *average* arxur knows, right? We take the researchers, the students, the people working on the cutting edge of AI, to be representative of the arxur. The question is tantamount to asking ‚Äòwhat do the *most knowledgeable* arxur know about AI?‚Äô instead. That‚Äôs maybe a few thousand people out of *billions*.‚Äù

I blinked, understanding. *This is the ‚Äòcredibility‚Äô he brought up earlier in the lesson, then.* Or ‚ÄúSocial Capital,‚Äù I supposed. *What do the people we* trust *know?*

‚ÄúBut if those few thousand people know something, we take it to mean the arxur know it, because it is within the bounds of things *some* arxur know, and most arxur who don‚Äôt know about those things *defer judgement* to the people who do.‚Äù

*Of course. Only sensible.*

‚ÄúBut what about‚Ä¶ when you don‚Äôt defer? What about during the Fall? Did the arxur collectively *know* that Betterment was no longer tenable? Or did they only know it *after* the Fall, when those who disagreed had been defeated militarily?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt collectively know,‚Äù Skarviss drawled lazily. ‚ÄúPeople picked sides, and then fought a war over it. The rebellion won and now we call them the authority and assume they are correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh, somebody's spicy today,‚Äù Prof. Swift said with a chuckle. ‚ÄúEpistemic Authoritarianism will not be covered today, Skarviss, but it *is* in the bonus readings if you like. What Skarviss is hinting at, class, is that knowledge is not just about having information, but about *power* and the ability to enforce a narrative. Great stuff. So we have a *No*. Does anyone want to argue against that?‚Äù

Surisel spoke up. ‚ÄúNew information came to light. The rebellion was operating with better knowledge, while the Dominion was pushing what it knew was a lie. And when the new information became public knowledge, the public was better informed as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you would like to posit that they didn't know *at first,* and the rebellion was, in fact, what *learning* looks like on a group scale.‚Äù

He considered for a second. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery interesting. Now here is another question. Say I took a book, a printed physical book, and handed each of you a page or two from it. By the time I am done, the whole book is in your hands. But none of you individually have the book, you only have your pages. Do you *collectively* have the book, as a class?‚Äù

The class shook their heads no. *We only have disparate pieces of it.*

‚ÄúNo? That's interesting. But if I asked about a specific page, I could get an answer about that page *from the class*. And I could do it for all the pages in that book.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but none of us have complete knowledge of the entire book,‚Äù I said quickly, before suddenly understanding his point. *Oh. I get it.*

‚ÄúSo? I'm certain there are many things you would claim humans know how to do that no human knows how to do in full. Almost no human understands contemporary AI, we need large teams of people who understand them by parts from all sorts of disciplines. Almost no human knows how to actually assemble a fighting force in space‚Äîthe engineering *and* the recruiting *and* the politics *and* the physics *and* the nutritional requirements *and* the training, and so on‚Äîbut we say humans do it. So they must know how to do it.‚Äù

He cleared his throat and wandered to a different spot in front of the board.

‚ÄúOne more example, and you might find this more relevant given where you are in your education right now, kids. These are a lot of descriptive aspects of knowledge, but we do have *normative* aspects. The bus rules are normative. How you are *supposed* to stand or sit. And I have a feeling that some of you might think you are expected to do certain things. How do you know that? Who is expecting you? Maybe you have very particular parents or caretakers who expect very specific things from you, but equally likely is that you have *inferred* certain expectations from society. That you believe *society* or *people* expect it, even if your teachers or your classmates or your family individually do not. What is *successful*, what is *reasonable,* what is *proper*? How does a group know these things? How does an individual?‚Äù¬†

I began to sit very still.

""Who is considered a success? Who is considered a failure? Back home, I could drink six cups of coffee, and most people wouldn't notice, nevermind call me *jittery*,‚Äù he tapped the word on the board. ‚ÄúBut the rules are different here. I may have certain kinds of social capital‚Ä¶ but I am worse at playing the games. Even something as simple as ‚Äòhow do you use a teacup' can throw me off. You know rules that I don't, but it would be good if you asked yourselves‚Ä¶ what *are* those rules? Where did they come from? Do you agree with them? Do you want to change them? That's what social construction is about, after all, agreement. Trust. Cooperation. Social constructs are fluid. They change all the time. In what direction would you like yours to change?‚Äù

Hi, I have a fairly busy cafe. More specifically a cat cafe. As such, at the top and bottom of the hour (when people enter the cat lounge), it's high volume coffee drinks. Like need to make 10-20 drinks as fast as possible (3 group head Astoria Pratic Avant on full blast). Just opened up and trying to save a few bucks, bought a Eureka Atom W65 GBW grinder (in chrome which matches the espresso machine). Much cheaper than Mahlkoenig E65 GBW and cheap extra hoppers. I like the GBW as some of the baristas have less experience. The grinder occasionally overheats lately and I'm dead in the water. So kind of panicking here. Looking to upgrade, and possibly use the Eureka as a spare or secondary grinder. My understanding is that the Mahlkoenig has internal fans to keep it cool (correct me if I'm wrong). So the E65 GBW (not cheap) is on the top of my list at this point. Is the E80 worth $1k more? Or overkill? Bit of OCD and paranoia here, not gonna like.",3,1739746814.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A few experiences have solidified this decision for me.

A friend I only know online (Alex, online friend of six years) had an opportunity to visit my state (he's in CA, I'm in FL) to be an instructor in a week-long seminar for businessmen. He invited me to meet him for coffee before he flies back home to CA.  
  
I didn't know the exact date, but I knew it was in October. But as the time approached my DMs went unread. Then when he finally responded, he explained that he was at the airport about to fly back home. (It was over a two hour drive for me to reach that airport. I wouldn't have made it in time.) He expressed disappointment that we wouldn't be able to meet (a situation that could have been avoided if he just responded to a single DM and had just given me the time he would have been at the airport).

So, I never got to meet him.

Then three months later, another friend of mine (Jordan) happened to be in my area. I didn't know this until he sent me a picture of himself with his law students while in St. Pete participating in a debate competition. So, I wrote him, ""You're 11.6 miles south of me, right now.""

He was surprised, and insisted if he had only known, he would have arranged a time to get together, but now he was too busy with his students. I'm perplexed as to how he didn't know. I've mentioned where I live to him in the past, and it's on my profile.

He protested that he had somehow thought I lived in Sarasota. ""Which is 36 miles south of you. You're not digging your way out, Counselor,"" I responded.

Anyhow, I expressed my disappointment in Jordan while in DMs with Alex. And Alex replied, ""I don't blame you for being upset. Jordan has met several of his online contacts in the past.""

And I pointed out to Alex how disappointed I was when I missed the opportunity to meet up him those months ago. And Alex replied, ""Hey, I said you were more than welcome to come, but you declined.""

And I was thinking WITAF?

I checked our DMs and our text messages (we've texted, done Facetime and had live conversations over the years), and no, my memory was not wrong. No, he never invited me anywhere. His messages, when he finally responded, was him sending regrets because it was too late to meet him before he flew out. When I told him this, he was basically, ""Oh, that's right. It was at my layover in Jacksonville. I'm 90% sure that I invited you there.""

Having reviewed our text messages and DMs, I'm 100% sure that also didn't happen. Basically, our DM history was him sending his regrets, and the next message I got from him was thanking me for his birthday card, which meant he had arrived home.

And all I could tell myself after this is was, ""I really don't matter to these people. Not in the least.""

All I felt was this overwhelming sense of insignificance. I never thought I was anyone's best friend or even a particularly good friend. But wow. Alex invited me to meet him, forgets all about it, sends his regrets, then somehow distorts it in his mind that I was the one who refused this meeting.

Recently, during a phone conversation, I called Alex out over this and I explained everything. And even told him where to find those DMs and texts to prove what I said, and that his recollection was 100% wrong. And he finally said he was sorry. Which sounded genuine. But I've just come to realize, I really don't matter to these online contacts, not even my closest ones. I don't have even a microbe's significance.

And one more story. I did meet someone I knew online, Roger. Except that I never wanted to meet him. I'm sure most of us have made the mistake of being kind to someone who misconstrued kindness as genuine interest. Roger was a stay-at-home-husband (not dad, because they have no kids) and his wife was the breadwinner. Anyhow, to hear Roger tell it, he tried out a new diet and found new energy and vitality. And let loose on a grand scale, cheating on his wife, thereby making shipwreck of his marriage. But since part of his wife's savings was his, legally entitled to 30%, he took off with it, went to Vegas and spent a lot of money on prostitutes, buying them expensive gifts.

When the money got low, he decided to move to my area (probably because I was the only one left in the online fitness community who was cordial to him). And I really don't like him. He takes no responsibility for ruining his marriage. Instead, he blames it on the guy who recommended the diet.

As you might imagine, I don't enjoy my interactions with him. The problem is, he wants to talk about how upset he is over his ruined marriage. And when he takes no responsibility, I can't sympathize.

I self harm and im zoned out all the time","Im 19m.  When I was 14 I went through extreme stress and I think it changed me.  I was bullied pretty bad and would go in the bathroom everyday crying and isolating myself.  My dad‚Äôs family told me they didn‚Äôt want to have a relationship with me.  I begged them to not leave and that was the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts.  I was so spaced out trying to cope with the pain and I didn‚Äôt submit a single assignment and failed all of my classes.

I remember in highschool I had a crush on this girl and I felt like I was genuinely in love with her, even though we never talked.  When she made me feel rejected i instantly went from loving her to hating her and hoping she would die.  I felt like nobody liked me and cared about me so I would cut myself with a knife and show it to everyone I knew in an effort to gain their attention, love, and sympathy.  I was basically known as that weird mentally ill kid who had no friends.  It seems like the story of my life is that I do things that push people away.  I go as far as manipulating people‚Äôs emotions for attention, but that just pushes them away 

I have had several temper tantrums where I would be destroying things and punching holes in the wall, threatening to kill myself,  actually cutting myself, screaming and yelling and stabbing myself with pens and pencils.  I basically terrorized my grandparents who I was living with at the time.  A week ago I felt so lonely and disconnected from everyone and started recording videos of myself cutting myself, starting a fire and burning my hand on the stove, throwing and smashing my Christmas tree.  I sent the videos of it to people, because that‚Äôs how desperate I was for attention 

A month ago I felt really empty like I always do, so I was like fuck it im gonna get messed up.  I took 4 halcions and I drank down 7 beers.  I think each halcion is equivalent to a xanax bar.  I collapsed to the ground nearly cracking my head on the coffee table and blacked out.  I don‚Äôt know how I survived that, I was close to meeting god that night.  Maybe god wanted me to live for a reason, im not sure 

The way I view myself and others is distorted and kinda delusional in a way.  I feel low about myself in every possible way and some days I genuinely believe that I am a psychopath and an evil person.  So I sometimes I do bad things to people and sabotage myself to prove that im actually evil and worthless.  There is always a part of my head that tells me im ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  I feel lonely and disconnected from everyone.  I genuinely believe that nobody likes me, everyone thinks im a weirdo.  I look at everything as bad, there‚Äôs no in between.  It feels like I will always be unhappy and empty if im not in a relationship.  So whenever a relationship ends, I always instantly go and seek a new one.  

I can not feel genuine happiness, love, or feel empathy for anyone.  I only care about not feeling lonely.  Life feels boring and dull.  You know that feeling when it‚Äôs a dark rainy day and there‚Äôs nothing to do?  That‚Äôs how I feel every single day.  I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone that im zoned out all day, I view myself in third person.  I think me zoning out is a coping mechanism I developed from feeling so lonely and having nobody to turn to, but it doesn‚Äôt even help me.  The zoning out does not stop

I have manipulated and hurt a lot of people.  I‚Äôve done some sociopathic things to a lot of girls.  I threatened to kill my self to them and harmed myself.  I made them wondering if I was gonna take my life.  I actually just did it last week to my girlfriend when I had that episode where I was destroying things.  It‚Äôs like when people give me sympathy it gives me a dopamine rush.  It brings back that feeling of being cared about that I feel like I lost as a kid.  That just contributes to me feeling bad about myself and thinking im a psychopath,  its a never ending cycle ",1,1739746799.0,Adulting,1,0.66,False
1ir54rf,https://i.redd.it/8ypwqyvwzkje1.jpeg,An Alaska fishing boat and thanks to all of you for the comments,"I am grateful to everyone for the warm reception that so many have given my art on this sub. 

This is one of the first cutaway drawings I made in the series. It‚Äôs dedicated to my son. I‚Äôll share the story of how I got started doing this. People who know me have heard it a lot of times so I apologize for that. ;P

I have been an Alaska fisherman for 25 years, but I have been drawing all my life. During my early years fishing I travelled every winter and during a time living in Europe I met my wife. When my son was born in 2008 I quit for two years to stay with my new family and did other jobs but struggled to make ends meet, so when the price of salmon quadrupled before the 2011 season my wife and I talked it over and decided that that for the good of our family I should go back for the summer.

I was only gone for three months, but I had a very hard time being away from my little boy in particular. Really all career fishing families know what it‚Äôs like, and for most of us it‚Äôs the hardest part of an otherwise incredible trade full of challenges and triumphs. To deal with the separation, I started making drawings in my own imitation of the books that I loved when I was little: Richard Scarry in particular, but also David Macaulay and others.

I worked on the first drawing mostly in the bars of Southeast Alaska. During the process, other fishermen kept approaching me, asking me to do one of their boat or their fishery. 

That fall I found a couple of places that agreed to hang prints on the walls, including the coffee shop at Fishermen‚Äôs Terminal in Seattle. Since then I have been trying to do what those other fishermen asked. There isn‚Äôt enough time to make drawings of every boat, so I have tried to work my way through representing the different gear groups and make things that families can use to share their experiences in the trades.

Along the way, my drawings were noticed at that coffee shop by an editor at Sasquatch books, who asked me to make a children‚Äôs book. It took three years to make and came out in 2022. It‚Äôs called Working Boats: An Inside Look at Ten Amazing Watercraft.

I still on my boat every summer in Alaska, and over the past few seasons my son has been coming with me. I don‚Äôt know if he will follow me into the trade, but he did buy his own 30-year-old car with what he earned last summer.

# AirPods Pro 2 vs. AirPods 4 (2025): Which Wireless Earbuds Reign Supreme? [Full Comparison]

Choosing the right wireless earbuds in the Apple ecosystem can feel like navigating a maze. With the highly anticipated release of the AirPods 4 (predicted for 2025 based on product cycles of the previous Airpod models),the question on everyone's mind is: how do they stack up against the reigning champion,the AirPods Pro 2? This comprehensive comparison will delve into every aspect,helping you make an informed decision based on your needs and budget.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4 on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4)
## The Contenders: A Quick Overview

Before we deep-dive into the specifics, let's briefly introduce our contenders.The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's premium earbuds, boasting advanced features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio, and a customizable fit. Conversely, the (future) AirPods 4 aim to offer a more accessible entry point into the AirPods family, potentially balancing essential features with an attractive price point. This airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4 comparison will show you how these differences translate in real world usage.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4 on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4)
## Design and Comfort: Finding the right Fit

Comfort is paramount, and that starts with design.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 feature an in-ear design with silicone ear tips available in multiple sizes (XS, S, M, L), ensuring a snug and secure fit for a wide range of ear shapes. This design is crucial for optimal noise cancellation and sound quality. The inclusion of extra small tips is a welcome addition, catering to users who previously struggled to find a pleasant fit with earlier models.The shorter stem design also contributes to a more discreet and refined look.

**AirPods 4:** Leaks and speculation surrounding the AirPods 4 suggest a redesigned form factor influenced by both the existing AirPods (3rd generation) and the AirPods Pro. This might translate to a more contoured fit, potentially incorporating elements of the in-ear design for improved passive noise isolation, but without necessarily offering the same level of active noise cancellation as the Pro model. Many hoping for a lighter design for longer periods of use. When determining AirPods suitable for running or the gym, a snug fit will always be superior to standard fit.

**Verdict:** If comfort and a secure fit are top priorities and a variety of ear tip sizes sound ideal, the AirPods Pro 2 currently win. However, the AirPods 4 have the potential to surprise with their redesigned form factor and potentially improved comfort compared to previous standard AirPods.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4 on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4)
## Sound Quality: Immersing Yourself in Audio

The core function of any earbuds is sound quality. This is also a high priority for tech enthusiasts and early adopters.

**AirPods Pro 2:** Powered by Apple's H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 2 deliver exceptional sound quality with deep, rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The custom high-excursion Apple driver and high dynamic range amplifier work in harmony to produce a detailed and immersive listening experience. Adaptive EQ also plays a crucial role, automatically tuning the music to the shape of your ear for personalized audio.

**AirPods 4:** While anticipated to feature improvements over previous standard AirPods, the AirPods 4 will likely position themselves below the Pro 2 in terms of pure audio fidelity. Expect clear and balanced sound, suitable for everyday listening, but potentially lacking the depth, detail, and immersive qualities of the Pro model. The H2 chip could filter down to these units but is not confirmed as of the time of writing.

**Verdict:** For audiophiles and those who prioritize the highest possible sound quality, the AirPods Pro 2 are the clear choice. However, if you're looking for a solid audio experience for casual listening, the AirPods 4 are expected to suffice, especially when price is taken into account. This is important for value-concious consumers

[[Explore Top Rated airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4 on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod pro 2 vs airpod 4)
## Noise Cancellation: Silencing the World

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is a game-changer,especially in noisy environments.**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 boast substantially improved ANC compared to their predecessor, thanks to the H2 chip and advanced algorithms. They effectively block out a wide range of ambient sounds, from rumbling engines on airplanes to distracting chatter in coffee shops.Adaptive Transparency mode intelligently allows essential sounds, like conversations or traffic noise, to pass through while still reducing loud sounds, providing a natural and aware listening experience.

**AirPods 4:** Speculation suggests the AirPods 4 might offer some form of noise cancellation, potentially a basic version of ANC or relying primarily on passive noise isolation through a better ear design. However, it's unlikely to match the effectiveness of the AirPods Pro 2's advanced ANC.**Verdict:** If noise cancellation is a must-have feature for travel, commuting, or focusing in noisy environments, the AirPods Pro 2 are the undisputed champion. It's a key selling point for these leading earbuds. The airpods pro 2 vs airpods 4 noise cancellation aspect is a large differentiator.

## Battery Life: Powering Your Day

Battery life is a crucial factor for daily usability.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 offer up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge with ANC enabled,and up to 30 hours with the charging case.This is a noticeable improvement over the previous generation and provides ample power for most users' daily needs.**AirPods 4:** While the exact battery life specifications remain unconfirmed, Apple will likely aim for competitive battery performance. It's reasonable to expect similar,or perhaps slightly longer,listening times compared to the AirPods Pro 2,potentially at the expense of features like ANC.

**Verdict:** Both the AirPods Pro 2 and the projected AirPods 4 will offer solid battery life. Slight variations may exist, but both models are expected to comfortably power you through a full day of listening.

## Spatial Audio: Immersive Soundscapes

Spatial Audio creates a theater-like surround sound experience.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 take spatial audio to the next level with Personalized Spatial Audio. By using the iPhone's TrueDepth camera to scan your head and ears, the AirPods Pro 2 create a custom spatial audio profile tailored to your unique anatomy, resulting in a more accurate and immersive soundstage.

**AirPods 4:** While expected to feature standard Spatial Audio, may lack the personalized aspect. You'll still experience a wider and more immersive soundstage compared to conventional stereo, but the level of customization and accuracy might not be on par with the Pro model.

**Verdict:** The AirPods Pro 2 take the lead here, with Personalized Spatial Audio offering a superior and more tailored immersive listening experience.

## Microphone Quality: Crystal-Clear Communication

Clear microphone quality is essential for calls and voice commands.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 excel in microphone quality, featuring advanced beamforming microphones that focus on your voice while suppressing background noise. This results in clear and natural-sounding calls, even in noisy environments.

**airpods 4:** The AirPods 4 are anticipated to offer improved microphone quality compared to previous standard AirPods,but likely won't match the AirPods Pro 2's noise suppression capabilities. Expect decent call quality in most situations,but potentially struggling in very noisy environments.

**Verdict:** If crystal-clear call quality is a priority,especially in challenging environments,the AirPods Pro 2 are the better choice.

## Water Resistance: Staying Protected

Water resistance adds peace of mind during workouts and outdoor activities.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 are IPX4 rated for sweat and water resistance, meaning they can withstand splashes and sweat without damage. This makes them suitable for workouts and light rain.

**AirPods 4:** The AirPods 4 are also predicted to have IPX4 water resistance ensuring water resistance.

**Verdict:** Both the AirPods Pro 2 and the expected AirPods 4 offer similar levels of water resistance, providing adequate protection for workouts and everyday use. This makes them airpods suitable for the gym.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The AirPods Pro 2 are positioned as Apple's premium earbuds, commanding a higher price point, typically around $249. However, significant airpods pro 2 discount options are sometiems avaliable.
