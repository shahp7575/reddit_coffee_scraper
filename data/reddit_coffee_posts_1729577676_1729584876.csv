May be, this is partly my fault. I never knew how a start-up environment will feel like. On day 1, people tried to talk and even took me for coffee with them. It felt awkward because before this I've worked in proper corporate environment which was way different than this. However, I was looking forward to knowing my coworkers better and working towards something important.



However, it's my 4th day today and I've nothing to work on. The team is small (around 20 people) but everyone seems to have something going on while I sit around whiling away. 



I even asked the manager but she just handed me few videos to keep me occupied on the 2nd day. Now the videos are also completed and I have essentially nothing to do. Tried asking her again and she didn't answer me directly. Instead, one of the seniors asked her to get me into some stuff that I didn't understand.



On top of all this, she texted me at 9 pm yesterday on the app (the company has an internal app for communication). I didn't see it and responded to her this morning. She just replied she'll talk in the office and until now no talks and no work as well.



All my coworkers are at lunch rn. I go late because I feel too out-of-place and awkward. And all day, they all keep talking and sharing snacks and I just stay mum or smile because I don't know how to insert myself into this environment.



I've made such a huge mistake of moving to an entirely different place for this job. Maybe, I just don't belong in a startup. I might be one of those ""cog in the wheel"" kinda corporate people.",1,1729584768.0,TwoXIndia,0,1.0,False
1g9d1r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g9d1r7/does_minimal_texting_between_initial_dates/,"Does minimal texting between initial dates suggest a lack of interest, even if in-person it seems great?","I (31M) have been on 1.5 dates with a girl (25).  The first time we met was a very last minute thing to grab coffee for an hour before I had to go to a university class - so it wasn't really a ""full"" date. Before meeting we'd chatted briefly on Hinge and I didn't necessarily have huge expectations one way or the other - we'd talked so little that it really felt like going in blind. To my surprise the date seemed to go extremely well. I thought she was very attractive, funny and intelligent, and it felt like our conversation flowed really well, and that we'd grown up with similar sorts of backgrounds/values. 

I messaged her a while afterwards offering her my number and saying I'd like to see her again. She texted me about 4 or 5 hours later. I responded, thinking it would be the start of a text conversation, but she didn't reply that day. The next day I asked her out to dinner. She didn't reply until the evening - she apologised saying she'd been wrapped up in uni work, but said yes to dinner. Between then and the night of the dinner the texting was fairly minimal. She texted me once unprompted, we exchanged a few replies and then she stopped answering.  

The dinner date, again, seemed to go really well. We even (contrary to my expectations) went back to hers and were intimate for a while, until her roommate came home and she introduced me to her. She seemed to be very physically into me and when we said goodbye for the night I felt certain that she was interested.

It's now been two days. I texted her the following evening suggesting another date. She said her sister is visiting her for the next week so could we raincheck until the weekend following. I said yes and asked her some generic question, hoping again it would be the start of a text conversation, but she hasn't replied.

I guess my question is - is it possible she is interested in me, even if she doesn't seem to want to text much? Is that a thing? She's doing a PHD and has a very full life so I understand she isn't sitting around on her phone all the time, and equally that we've barely met, and I'm not expecting her to feel as I do, but I'm worried that maybe she was just after something quick and casual and doesn't particularly want to date me. Again - it felt like we had great chemistry in person, but now I'm second guessing and thinking what if she's just a good talker and can have those types of conversations with anyone.

1g9d19t,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g9d19t/my_philos_is_being_refunded/,My philos is being refunded,"Not sure if this is a wise decision, but seeing im leeching experiences from others these message's helped me a lot, i will also share my experience with the Philos.

And i want to clarify that Mazzer did everything right. I have been allowed to return it, after using it for more then the return period. Without me having to redo every step i already took when in contact with support.  
  
However, my Philos will be returned to mazzer.

  
The Mazzer Philos(189D) is an amazingly build grinder. it looks and feels good. I would still want the Philos, instead of the DF83V but its just to inconstent and i do not trust in its capability anylonger.   
  
Some context, i started i started with a niche zero, switched to Libra, and then to Philos. I have always owned the Oracle touch. and have been making espresso for 5 years now. Did a barrista cursus somewhere after 2 years, to get a solid grip on the process. Im not a total noob, but im defintly not a pro.  


there are 2,5 problems with the philos, i encountered in the 2 months i have been using it.

the biggest one in the room.  
1. Inconsistancy shot to shot. i have a kept notes for the last few days added down, but the shot times on the same puck prep and grind size. differ 6 seconds from shot 1 and 2. and 3-9 seconds from day to day, with purging in between.   
2. the machine clogs itself, not stall, but clog. It seems to be the stickyness with beans and the auger design, so RDT is not adviced. [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1espw3i/help\_issues\_with\_mazzer\_philos\_crushed\_grounds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1espw3i/help_issues_with_mazzer_philos_crushed_grounds/)  
3. 0,5. it creates a bit of mess from the hopper because of the flap design. the openeing allows for some coffee to come out while grinding.

I checked the factory alignment of the burrs, top burrs was perfectly wiped, back burr partially. good aligntment not perfectly.  
  
189D burrs touching on 0 setting.  
pre heated portafilter and cups, cooled down group head(oracle touch problem), tumbler, and wdt for distribution. paper filter and metal mesh for easy cleaning I switched normcore v4, to test with a normal tamper in case the normcore didnt compress al the way(which solved some of the extreme issues).  
  
Shot times for 18:36  
  
Grind size 19  
1th: 23 seconds   
2th: 26 seconds  
few hours later, purged 3 grams  
3th: 17 seconds  
4th: 19 seconds  
  
Changed grinde setting to 18  
Changed to grinding 36 grams at once and not for both cups to test if inconsistancy came from Philos or oracle.  
5th&6th: 40+ seconds.   
  
somehow 18 was clogging the thing, and 19 was to fast. switched back to 19, didnt help much. after that i was done.  


after that i noticed grinding 36 grams at once, stopped the inconsistancy between cups. but still no succes at getting a decent time.

Its been going on for a month now, on different coffee and freshness of the beans. and i was done, i stopped testing. Over the period i had good contact with mazzer and they offered a refund option which i gladly took.   


I hope, its just my grinder. and you all have a wonderfull experience. Im now back on my trusty old, Zespresso KUltra, and it has been delivering consistent shots. i will be getting the df83V with ssp sweet lab.

1g9d195,https://i.redd.it/qxcaqc96n9wd1.jpeg,"""Giddy up!""","Kramer had taken wrong turns before, but never like this.

One moment he was driving his rusty, brown Cadillac through the familiar streets of New York City, the next he found himself in a fog-drenched road that felt foreign and ancient. He squinted at a sign ahead, its lettering barely legible through the mist. Kurozu-cho.

""Ah, must be one of those out-of-the-way places,"" Kramer muttered to himself. ""Why not? Could be fun!"" He turned the wheel, taking the detour into this mysterious town. He always liked the thrill of the unknown, after all.

The streets of Kurozu-cho were unsettlingly quiet, the kind of silence that buzzed in your ears. Buildings sagged under the weight of decay, their shapes twisted and unnatural. Yet, Kramer, in his typical easy-going way, strolled through without a second thought.

""Looks like a good place to grab a sandwich,"" he chuckled, glancing at a rundown diner. As he stepped inside, the door creaked with a sound that made his spine tingle. The diner was empty, save for a woman behind the counter. Her eyes were wide and unblinking, fixed on something far beyond the room. Without a word, she slid a cup of tea across the counter toward him.

""Tea? I usually go for coffee, but hey, when in Rome, right?"" Kramer laughed, lifting the cup to his lips. He froze as he caught his reflection in the liquid.

The tea spiraled, not like steam or ripples, but in a way that bent reality itself, warping his face into grotesque, spiraling shapes. His eyes bulged, his mouth twisted—he dropped the cup, the tea spreading out in a spiraling pattern on the floor.

The woman behind the counter whispered, ""The spiral is everywhere. You can’t escape it.""

Kramer blinked. ""A spiral? Lady, I don’t know what you’re talkin' about. I just got lost!"" But as he glanced around, he noticed it—the spiral patterns in the walls, the floor, even the clouds outside.

Panic started to creep in, but Kramer shook it off. ""No, no, no. I’m Kramer! Spirals or not, I’ve been through worse. This is just one of those weird days!"" He spun on his heel, ready to leave the town and never look back.

But the further he walked, the tighter the streets seemed to coil, narrowing into strange, circular pathways. The fog thickened, swirling into vortexes around him. Every street led back to the same place.

The diner.

The woman stood in the doorway now, her figure elongating, her limbs spiraling in ways that defied logic.

Kramer gulped. ""Okay… maybe I’ll just take the subway next time.""

1g9cmhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9cmhe/city_lights/,City Lights,"I sat near the edge, watching the world passing by, contemplating whether or not it would make a difference. The world will keep spinning, the cars will keep driving. Nobody would be bothered, might as well just get it done. I close my eyes to feel the cold air whip against my face, I take one long, deep breath and prepare to throw myself off the edge.

“What brings you around here?” I hear a soft delicate voice say, I turn around to find a girl sitting next to me, her legs dangling off the edge of the building, a loose white dress flowing in the air around her. I had no idea where she'd come from, was I truly so tangled up in my sorrow that I failed to notice a whole other person next to me? 

“Same as you, I suppose” I say, I don't know why. I had no clue what brought her here, for all I know she was a passerby on the ground, that saw some crazy person hanging off the edge of a building, but I could tell, somehow, that we were one and the same. 


“That's an awful reason to be up here don't you think?” She replies kindly, a hint of self effacing humor in her voice.

“You're up here too aren't you?”

“Yes, I am, I guess.” 

We sit in silence for a few moments, just watching the cars whiz past us on the ground below.  A sense of understanding wafting through the air between us.

“It's a beautiful night, isn't it?” The girl speaks up after some time.

I look quizzically at her, why must she make conversation? I stay quiet.

“Not much for small talk?” She asks. I meet her with silence. 

I stay quiet, waiting for the girl to grow tired of me, hoping she'd leave me to my thoughts, But she doesn’t. Instead, she leans back on her hands, gazing up at the sky.

""You ever wonder about the stars?"" she asks softly, almost as if she’s talking to herself. ""They’re so far away, yet somehow they feel close. Almost like they’re watching.""

I follow her gaze, my eyes landing on the scattered pinpricks of light above. I hadn’t really thought about the stars in a long time. They were just there, part of the backdrop, like everything else in this world that I had tuned out. But now, with her question hanging in the air, I can’t help but stare at them.

""Watching what?"" I finally ask, surprising even myself with the sound of my own voice.

She smiles at that, a small, knowing smile. ""Us. This world. Our struggles, our pain, our little moments of joy. Maybe they're just there to remind us that there’s more to everything than what we see. More than just… this.""

I shake my head. ""That sounds stupid."" I let out a low, sarcastic chuckle.

""Does it?"" she asks, not offended, just curious. ""Maybe it is, but it’s something to think about. Something that distracts you from all of it."" She gestures vaguely at the edge, the street below, the city lights.

Her words settle between us, and for a second, I feel something stir inside me—something I’d buried deep, far away from the weight that had been pressing on me for so long, but just as quickly as it rises, I push it back down. I can’t afford to feel anything else.

""Why are you really up here?"" I ask her, shifting the focus. ""You don’t seem like me.""

She glances at me sideways, her expression hard to read. ""Maybe I’m not. But it doesn’t mean I don’t understand. You ever feel like there’s this heavy fog all around you, and no matter how much you try, you can’t see through it? Like you’re trapped inside it, and you’re not even sure what’s on the other side anymore?""

I nod, the weight of her words hitting too close to home.

""Yeah,"" I admit quietly. ""All the time.""

She looks back at the sky, her voice soft and distant. ""That’s why I’m here. Trying to see if there’s something beyond it. Or if it’s all just… fog.""

The silence stretches out again, but this time it’s not as heavy. There’s something different in the air now, something fragile but present, like a thin thread of connection between us.

We sit there for what feels like hours, just the two of us in this strange, quiet bubble above the noise of the city. I don’t know why I haven’t moved yet, why I haven’t done what I came here to do. Maybe it’s because of her. Maybe it’s the way she talks, like she understands things I’ve never let myself admit. Or maybe it’s because for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel so alone.

The girl sighs softly and stands, stretching out her arms. “Well, I think it’s time for me to go.”

I look up at her, confused. “Go? Where?”

She smiles again, that same sad, knowing smile. “Home, I guess.”

I feel a strange panic rise in my chest. I don’t want her to leave. Something about her makes everything seem... lighter. ""Wait,"" I blurt out. ""Why did you really come here? You never answered me.""

She hesitates for a moment, her gaze dropping to the edge of the building. “I told you. Same as you.”

Something in the way she says it makes my skin prickle. I stand up, facing her fully now. “But you’re still here. You didn’t… jump.”

Her smile falters slightly, and she looks away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “No. I didn’t.”

She throws a warm look my way, before dusting off her dress and heading towards the stairwell, and just like that, she's gone. Just as fast as she appeared, she's gone.

I sit for a little while longer, just looking down at the street. I cant help but wonder if these people, these strangers, feel the fog too. Do they ever go to sleep and pray to never wake up?  
Have they ever sat on rooftops with strange girls delaying the inevitable?

I don't know what exactly happened between the time I came up here and now, no clue what exactly changed, but I find myself dreading it. I take a moment to myself, to breathe in the crisp air, to feel it go into my lungs and out my nose, to listen to the bustling sounds of life below. I feel the concrete ledge beneath my fingers, the seams of my jeans against my skin. I am here, right now. I am a breathing, living person, taking up space in the world, and maybe that's not all that bad.

I step away from the ledge, the city stretching out before me in the stillness of the night. My heart is still racing, but it’s not from fear anymore. It’s from something else. Maybe hope.

I don’t even know why I’m walking back down the stairs. A part of me had been so sure I wouldn’t be coming down at all. But something about her—her presence, her words—had changed everything. The fog in my mind wasn’t gone, not completely, but it wasn’t all-consuming anymore.

By the time I reach the bottom of the building and step back onto the crowded streets, I feel lighter, like a weight has been lifted, even if just for now. The girl’s face stays with me. The way she appeared out of nowhere, the strange calm in her voice. I wonder where she went. Why she left so suddenly. I think about calling out for her but realize how ridiculous that would sound in the middle of the city. I don't even know her name.

As I walk through the streets, I pass by a small café. It’s quiet, almost empty, with just a few people inside. For some reason, I feel drawn to it. I step inside and order a coffee, needing to sit for a moment and gather my thoughts.

While waiting for my drink, I notice an older man sitting at the counter, chatting with the barista. His voice is low but carries enough for me to catch bits of the conversation. Something about the rooftop nearby catches my attention.

""That rooftop… gives me chills every time I pass it,"" the old man says, shaking his head. ""It’s the spot, you know? That girl—she jumped off it ten years ago today.""

My blood runs cold. I freeze in my seat, my mind scrambling to keep up with what I’ve just heard. The rooftop? Ten years ago?

""What girl?"" the barista asks, looking curious.

""Ah, you’re too young to remember,"" the man says, his voice growing quieter. ""She was young. Seventeen, maybe, beautiful girl. People said she was troubled, but no one really knew why. One night, she went up there and… well, she jumped. Poor thing didn’t stand a chance.""

My stomach drops, the edges of my vision blurring as the words sink in. Seventeen years old. The rooftop. My mind races back to the girl I’d just spoken to, the way her dress flowed, the way her eyes seemed to see straight through me.

The girl I had just met was dead.

I feel like the floor is tilting beneath me, and I grip the edge of the table to steady myself. How was that even possible? I’d spoken to her. She’d sat right next to me, talked to me, saved me.

My mind whirls with questions, but I can’t shake the truth. The girl on the rooftop—the one who’d convinced me to step away from the edge—wasn’t alive. She was a ghost. She had been gone for ten years.

The barista gives the old man a pitiful look. “The world can be so cruel at times, can't it?”

I push my coffee aside, suddenly feeling like I can’t breathe. The noise of the café seems to fade away as I process what I’ve heard. She had been real, in a way. She’d saved me, whether she was alive or not. And now I know why she disappeared so suddenly, why she seemed so familiar with the feelings I was drowning in.

She had been me, once. Lost, broken, standing on the same edge, looking for a way out. But she didn’t find it in time.

And now, somehow, she had given me that second chance.

I stand up and leave the café, my legs shaky but my resolve solidifying. As I step back onto the sidewalk, I look up at the rooftop, far above me. The wind rustles through the trees, and for a brief moment, I swear I see the hem of a white dress fluttering in the night air, a girl standing up there, staring down at me.

But when I blink, it's gone. The rooftop is empty.

And yet, I know she’s still there—watching, maybe even waiting for someone else. Someone like me.

1g9ceti,https://www.reddit.com/r/baguio/comments/1g9ceti/team_lakay_training_saved_me_from_attempted_rpe/,Team Lakay training saved me from attempted r@pe in Boracay,"Disclaimer:

I’m using my original account to prove legitimacy, but this is not an invitation to dox me. I’m sharing my story for the benefit of other people, especially women who travel alone. If this post doesn’t resonate to you, feel free to skip it. Keep your judgment and victim blaming to yourself-I’ve had enough of that already.

I'll attempt to tell the story as objectively and factually as possible.

Team Lakay did not pay me to do this lol.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

On August 31, I traveled to Boracay as a solo female traveler. I’ve been traveling solo on-and-off across the Philippines for the past 10 months but this is my first time in Boracay. A fellow solo female traveler I met during my travels had recommended it to me. She stayed in Boracay for more than a month earlier this year. I work remotely and study at night too. So I try to create a routine while traveling. I’m a budget traveler who enjoys socializing whenever I can.

I booked a hostel near Station 1 and planned to stay for two weeks. My daily routine involved working from morning until mid-afternoon, then heading to the beach by 3 or 4pm.  
  
Typhoon Enteng passed through PH, making the beach full of debris and unsuitable for swimming. So I spent those afternoons walking along the shore, watching the kite surfers. It was is too cloudy for sunset viewing, so I would usually return to my hostel before 6pm and prepare for my 7pm online class. This has been my routine for 4 days.

On September 4, I went to the beach as part of the routine. On my way back, I ran into my dorm mates who invited me to have coffee. They had become my friends during my stay in this trip so I joined them. We had coffee.

By 6:30pm I decided to head back to the hostel. One of my dorm mates offered to accompany me back to our hostel, but I insisted that I should be okay alone since they had other plans. I’ve assessed that it would take me 30 minutes to get back to the hostel for my 7pm class.

I always took the same shortcut - a narrow path from White Beach going to my hostel, and it’s usually full of tourists even late in the afternoon. Not this time tho. This time, there were no people, and there’s no sunset so it’s dark. I used my phone’s flashlight to see my way through. All I had in mind was to catch my 7pm class.

*At 6:52 I went past the cliffside - what I’d consider to be the most dangerous part of the shortcut. I would be 8 minutes away from my destination when I felt a sharp blow to the back of my head. I fell face-first into the sand, dizzy but I was still conscious. He flipped me so that I would lie on my back and face him. He was shirtless. He laid on top of me pressing his weight down on the lower half of my body. I started screaming. He was able to hold down my left arm and I felt him kiss my neck. Or more like he was biting my jaw while also trying to unbutton his pants. I vaguely remember it, but I think I was able to bite him back on the face. The details of the commotion was a blur to me.*

*Luckily I had trained jiu-jitsu with Team Lakay years ago. I instinctively crossed my legs, and locked them so he wouldn’t have access to my private parts. Even though I couldn’t kick him, my right hand was free so I threw punches and scratches. I was trying to grab his hair to pull his head away from me but couldn’t touch it. He might be bald or wearing a cap. I still threw punches and moved my body. I never stopped screaming. This lasted for maybe a minute or two until he got exhausted.*

*I think he eventually realized he could not rape me. He removed his body from me and started pulling my phone that I was holding on tightly. When I realized he’s now after my phone, I let it go. He ran off. I stood up and started running. I looked back and saw my phone on the sand a few steps away with its flashlight still on. He did not steal it after all. I quickly took it and continued running towards my hostel.*

About 30 meters away, I encountered tourists about to pass by the same shortcut. I asked for their help and they accompanied me back to my hostel where I asked the receptionist to help me file a report to the police.

**Common Questions:** 

* **Can I identify the man?** No. But I remember that he has a small build, Filipino. He could be a young guy. I couldn’t grab his hair so I’m assuming he didn’t have hair or was wearing a cap. He’s topless but his green shirt was hanging on his shoulders. 
* **What was I wearing?** I hated this question the most because it implied I was intentionally attracting this kind of attention. I wore a plain grey v-neck shirt and denim shorts just above the knees. At the police station, they asked if I was wearing anything provocative. I didn’t change my clothes, and they looked at me from head to toe as if to confirm that my clothes had nothing to do with the attack.

**Police procedures:** 

The police asked standard questions about my identity and why I was there. I recounted the story multiple times. They asked me to get medicolegal from the hospital. They then accompanied me back to the crime scene where I recreated what happened. The latest update I received was that there were no CCTVs in the area, so there are no strong leads. 

**Theories:** 

While waiting for the police to arrive, I saw some habal habal drove past us and their uniform is the same green color as the one I saw hanging on the attacker’s shoulder. The attacker also didn’t need flashlight in a pitch dark area so I’d assume he’s familiar with the place. But the locals were not happy at the idea that the attacker was among them. They were saying it could be a dayo from a different island. It’s possible, but I strongly believe he’s a local. 

**Lessons learned:** 

Obviously, being alone in the dark is dangerous. Please avoid it whenever possible. 

* **Maintain spatial awareness**. I was listening to music when this happened. I could’ve heard someone if I were not wearing my headset. 
* **Learn self-defense**. I was lucky I still remember Jiu-jitsu from Team Lakay 8 years ago. A pepper spray or taser can help, but evil people can attack you on your unguarded moments when you don’t have any of those. If you were stripped of all these things, would you still be able to fight back? The best self-defense is to run or walk away. 
* **Trust your gut.** I had a bad feeling about the shortcut when I saw it was dark. But my rational mind thought I had to head back before 7pm at all cost. So I risked it. 

**Moving Forward:** 

Judging by how the police handled the case, I don’t expect much. I’m only sharing my story to raise awareness because this attacker is still out there. 

I was traumatized, but the people around me and my friends from far away gave me the emotional first aid that I needed. I still have nightmares, anxiety when I see shirtless men, and I panic if I’m outside after dark. 

I felt like this incident could have been my death. I don’t know how to explain it but I’ve become more life-thirsty after this, so I’m still continuing my solo travels. I’m not done with life yet. 

I've come to terms with the fact that raising awareness about this incident is the closest thing to justice I will ever receive. So let it be known.

**TLDR:** A guy attacked and attempted to rape me when I was in Boracay. I was able to fight back, thanks to my training, and reported to the police.

# **SUPPLEMENTS**

**Most noticeable difference:**

**Antihistamines (Loratadine 10mg) -** 
This stuff does miracles for me for taking the edge off my MCAS symptoms like itchy and red skin, tingling sensations in the hands and feet and food reactions. It’s funny because they are the most unassuming and cheapest. 

I haven't had any adverse reactions; I take one in the morning and one in the evening on an empty stomach or a few hours after eating. From where I’m from in Australia I can buy 110 for $30. I have heard your body can become accustomed to them and they stop having the same effect after a while, that has not happened to me yet after about a month taking them.

**CoQ10 (ubidecarenone) -** 
From experience this is a very potent antioxidant. If you‘re going to try it start on a low dose like 50mg and work your way up. I only lasted 4 days because I was getting bad side effects like insomnia, the jitters and irritableness but I can’t deny the energy it gave me. 

It’s just a shame that energy was “anxiety energy” and wasn’t sustainable for me. I’ve read it really helps others though and might be worth a try.

**Meh and not sures:**

**Quercetin-** 
Very hard to tell if this does anything. It’s a anti-inflammatory so it “does it’s work in the background”, don’t think it does miracles. I think helps keep you at your “baseline”. Will continue to take daily.

**Bromelain**  -  
Same story as quercetin. Will continue to take daily.

**Curcumin -**
Same story as quercetin. Will continue to take daily.

**Vitamin D -**   
It’s hard to say if this does anything but my health specialist was persistent on increasing my levels. I think it can help with energy levels and have heard of people using it in higher doses for that. Will continue to take daily.

**Vitamin C -** 
Again no idea if this does anything. Taste nice though. Will continue to take daily.

**Reservatrol -** 
Again no idea if this does anything. It’s also an anti-inflammatory and I assume and hope it does help in that aspect. Will continue to take daily.

**NKCP (Natto Bacilli Culture) -** 
Same story here. Very hard to tell if these supplements do anything. Again I think they help you at “baseline” without any easily noticeable effects. Will continue to take daily even though it’s derived from soy and arguably isn’t MCAS friendly.

**Low dose aspirin -**
This might help with headaches and migraines but is hard to tell for me. I’ve only been taking it for about a week so I don’t have a large enough sample size. It’s cheap though and for me was worth the go. I cut a pill in half taking about 75mg a morning.

**Magnesium 300mg -** 
I take the magnesium energy ones that you dissolve in water more or less every second day. Again, hard to tell if they do anything but they do have caffeine in them which I like.

**Panadol forte (codeine) -** 
You need a prescription for this but it’s the only thing that kills my bad headaches and migraines. They aren’t to be taken everyday. They make you a bit constipated and can be addictive. I only use them if necessary (once or twice a fortnight depending how lucky I am with migraines).  


# **DIETS**

You are what you eat. I’m convinced this monster feeds off my gut and lives in my head behind my eyes.

**Low histamine diet -** 
This is the most effective thing I’ve tried so far. At first it seems bland and unenjoyable but if you can tolerate a decent variety of foods it becomes healthy and pleasant. I went through all the websites that list low and high histamine foods and put together a list of the foods I like and started meal prepping. To makes things easier these are the foods I eat and some meal ideas.

Fruits -  
Apples (the safest bet), blueberries, fresh peaches, raspberries, cherries, blackberries, passionfruit, watermelon, grapes and plums.

Vegetables -  
Broccoli and sweet potato are my go-tos. Carrot, beetroot, cucumber, asparagus, sprouts, cauliflower, potato’s, fresh corn, capsicum, celery and lettuce.

Proteins -  
Chicken and white fish. Occasionally salmon or turkey.

Spices -  
Basil, coriander, garlic granules, ginger, mint, oregano and rosemary.

Drinks -  
Chamomile tea, cranberry nectar, peppermint tea, sage tea, sparkling water.

Breakfast -  
Gluten free rice crispies, flax seeds, maple syrup, chai seeds, chestnuts, coconut milk, pumpkin seeds, goji berries and almonds (almonds are debatably low histamine).

Dinner -  
Olive oil, sea salt, coconut oil, rice noodles, dried beans (again arguable), rice, pumpkin tofu, garlic, zucchini and quinoa.

Snacks -  
Plain pure rice cakes, yeast free muffins (arguable), grain free pretzels (arguable), potato chips (ones that only include potato, sunflower oil and salt).

Smoothies -  
Macadamia nuts, filtered water, dates (arguable) and a pinch of salt.

Carrot, tumeric, ginger, blueberries, coconut milk with a tiny bit of black pepper (said to help with the anti-inflammatory benefits of ginger and tumeric).

Whole foods plain hemp protein powder, pumpkin or sunflower seed protein powder, collagen powder.

Main foods I avoid -  
Avacados, bananas, tomatoes, sugar, coffee, spicy foods, sauces, cured meats, anything in a can like beans and tuna, soy products, mushrooms, chocolate, seafood, anything fermented, alcohol, vinegar, spinach, pineapple, anything processed and dried fruits.

What those lists I can make a really nice breakfast bowl for the mornings and then usually a staple dinner like chicken, sweet potato and broccoli or fish, rice and pumpkin. During the day I snack on carrots, celery, chips and smoothies.

**Intermittent fasting -** 
This is the second thing that has helped me the most, mainly with evening flare ups and energy levels. It’s as simple as having a late breakfast and an early dinner. I eat breakfast at 11 and dinner around 4 – 5:30. The smaller the eating window the better in my opinion and that works well for me. You can obviously vary the times with what suits you. Would highly recommend.

**Water fasting -** 
This is much more contentious and should be advised with caution. I’m sure everyone has seen people saying this has alleviated symptoms for them and even cured them. It isn’t just bro science, it’s true that autophagy is your bodies cellular cycling system and tests have been done for long COVID with good effect. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10651743/](This study in particular was made me want to try it.)

Personal experience:  
I lasted 4 days. I planned for longer to get my body into autophagy but decided to pull the pin because I felt pretty lightheaded and weak. The two positives I found were my MCAS symptoms went (from not eating) and my skin went smooth and clear again. This changed after eating again.

For me it took me about a week to get back to my “baseline” and even took me back to square one with some neurological symptoms and anxiety. I don’t think stopping my supplements during the fast helped with that. Overall I don’t think I would risk doing it again and do think it made me worse. I did however not tough it out for long enough so the “what could have been” factor is still lingering inside of me.

Tips:
* Do intermittent fasting leading up to it. It’s an easing in process before your fast.

* Get proper electrolytes that have sodium, potassium and magnesium. You can get good information on the fasting wiki and subreddit.

* Make sure to break your fast with something light and recommended. Don’t do what I did and eat everything and anything.

* Drink a lot of water, you can add some pink himalayan salt as well.

* Listen to your body and your instincts, don’t be afraid to call it quits.

+ Consult your doctor first and do it under supervision.

**Elimination diet -**
This is my next escapade. The theory is you pick a few safe foods for you, eat only that for 5 or so days and then slowly start introducing foods one at a time, documenting your “safe” and “unsafe” foods. You don’t have to go the full nine yards and do the carnivore diet, me personally I will probably pick chicken, rice and sweet potato. I’ve read this can be effective for brainfog symptoms and effectively “cleaning” the LC out of you. Worth a try.

# **GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Drink a metric tonne of **water*+ (not literally) and electrolytes. I tend to drink between 4 – 6 litres per day and have electrolytes every second day.

* **Get your blood work done.** You might get lucky and just have a deficiency. I went through my bloodwork with my GP but then also took them to a chemist and spoke to a pharmacist. The pharmacist was way more productive and knowledgeable (shock?). She went though my results more meticulously and recommended me supplements. This way you can actually find what you’re low in and not just take supplements for the hell of it.

* **Rest.** Don’t exercise. The hardest part of this for me is not being able to fall back on the things I would normally do when things get tough which are go hard with my work and hard with my exercise. I’m starting to come to the conclusion that the only thing that cures this is time and not going into PEM. Rest is key and good things come to those who wait. This too shall pass.

* Consult with your doctor regarding a **SSRI**. It might really help you. Personally they are not for me because the side effects are too much and I don’t have the willpower to push through it. I’ve read online it has helped many people with mental health, fatigue and brainfog.

# **OTHER**

Things you could look into that I haven’t but have read have helped others.

Please, these are not recommendations and please do your research and consult with your doctor before trying it.

These are mostly found from hours of searching this subreddit for answers. I have not tried any of these.

**MCAS related:**

* Popular antihistamine or histamine blockers: Pepcid (famotidine), Zyrtec, Allegra. 

* Dymista nasal spray. 

* Cortisol test. Can help identify adrenal fatigue or insufficiency and could identify cortisol support supplements needed like ashwagandha.

* Ketotifen. Mass cell stabiliser. Reduces histamine release.

* DAO enzymes. Catayze the oxidation of histamine into imidazole acetaldehyde, which is then converted into harmless compounds.

* Cromolyn. Taken before eating to help tolerate more foods. A mast cell stabiliser. Prevents histamine release.

* Propranolol. A beta-blocker. Off-label uses for POTS and LC.

* Lactoferrin. Gut health and immune system support related. Has anti-inflammatory effects.

* OATS test. This is a urine test that measures mitochondrial function, energy production and gut health. Can test for many things and could help with recovery.

* Singulair. Prescription medication that blocks the action of leukotrienes which are chemicals that cause inflammation.

**Brainfog and fatigue:**

* LDN. Something I’m sure you’ve read before! Low Dose Naltrexone said to reduce inflammation and benefit mood and cognitive function, brainfog, fatigue. Many people have reported different side effects.

* NAC+. Has antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects.

* Niacin. Vitamin B3. Said to help energy production and maintaining health skin and hair. This is the flushing version and helps to start in a low dose.

* Gut microbiome test. Provides insights into your gut health usually done through a stool test, can find sites online that do it. Can help steps towards improving your gut health. Seems plausible to me and something I’m considering doing.

* NAD+ infusions. A type of intravenous therapy administering it into the bloodstream. Said to benefit energy metabolism, enhance ellular repair, improve cognitive function and memory. Not cheap apparently.

* NMN. A precursor to NAD+. Boosts levels, DNA Repair, energy metabolism and cellular stress response. Could be good for energy levels.",2,1729581616.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

I never got to interact with adults on a purely social level - they were teachers, doctors, occasional family members to impress... but always people to be vaguely nervous of and be on your best behaviour for.

It delights me to see my own children interacting happily with our grown up friends (as well as their children).

My parents would have someone over about once a year. I am not kidding. Our house was a bit cluttered but perfectly fine and definitely not a hoarder house or unsanitary or anything like that, but whoever was coming precipitated a frenzy of resentful, passive aggressive cleaning. 

They also eat next to nothing themselves (I pack ermegency snacks when I visit them because half a sandwich and a satsuma on the side is not lunch) but my mother would spend ages cooking a vast spread of food which would have loads of leftovers that they would then spend days fretting about (because they would eat about two bites at a time).

They made such a massive fuss about it I can see why they never wanted to have anyone over because they created such a massive lot of work for themselves! I have a small repertoire of low effort high taste meals that I do for guests - and tbh if we end up just having pasta and tomato sauce, who cares? I clean the bathrooms if I have time and they take us as we are. We're FRIENDS, they're not the house inspectors!

It was the same massive self-inflicted fuss the times I tried to invite my childhood friends over so I just stopped asking because it wasn't worth it. 

I was reminded of this because my mother is supposed to be making me a ""free from"" birthday cake. I have received a massive stream of texts about all the different ingredient substitutions she needs to make and the ones that are too hard to get hold of or don't work properly... I have stopped replying, but what I am really thinking is, ""Why are you making your made up problems my problem? Shall I just make the cake if it's such a massive hardship for you?"" 

My parents would also never go out and meet their friends. I remember reading chapter books about babysitters and being mildly confused. Because my parents just didn't have friends to meet. Since we have grown up and left home, my mother sometimes goes out for coffee with some former colleagues but my father never seems to have any social life.

The whole thing baffles and saddens me. My husband and I are pretty introverted so we're not super social, but we have friends over once a week or so and it took me a while to figure out adult friendship because I had no real life template. 

I also remember being really confused by my schoolfriends talking about ""family friends"". I get it now: one whole family is friends with another whole family outside the context of work or school. But at the time I did not understand at all how that was supposed to work. It makes me sad what I missed out on as a child, and sad-happy that my children are having a normal social life.

Im curious what was going on behind the scenes. Were potential friends rejecting my parents because they weren't very nice to hang out with? Or was my mother rejecting potential friends because she thinks everyone else is an idiot and can never find anything nice to say about anyone else? 

I guess it was a bit of both, but I also think that one of the reasons my parents went nuts over their occasional ""entertaining"" (like, having a couple over for what could have been a cup of tea and a biscuit) was that my mother felt that they would judge her just the way she always judges everyone else.",5,1729581600.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False
1g9cdnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/askAGP/comments/1g9cdnk/agpagamp_and_guilt/,AGP/AGAMP and Guilt,"The thought of full social transition makes me feel very guilty. 

I feel that if I don't pass 100% I'm going to be an obnoxious presence wherever I go, a feminized elephant in the room that's taking up a disproportionate amount of attention by being an abnormal (and probably autistic) uneffeminate, self-conscious man-woman.

Going out androgynous by day and crossdressed by night isn't a big deal to me. The former only draws a small amount of attention (but still enough to be annoying at times) and the latter only involves people occasionally looking at me as they quickly drive by in their cars. Being crossdressed indoors is barely worth mentioning since I feel like I'm in my own world and not bothering anyone.

However, the thought of being publicly visible during the day in a skirt and/or with breast, especially in close-proximity to others (like a coffee shop or something) makes me turbo-cringe. I would stand out like a sore thumb(s) and it would feel unbelievably awkward, especially if I felt like my presence was making others feel awkward as well.

To be clear, it's more about guilt and less about shame. With constant exposure shame seems to dissipate.

Has anyone overcome this mental obstacle (other than by being stealth)?

I'll probably end up doing it anyways since I'm a defiant and rebellious man-child, but still.

I can take it to an open field, pour myself some black coffee and grab nature sounds with my field recorder for a couple hours. I can mic a drum kit... oh crap I need to buy more microphones ...and a new interface. It has cable management, I can clip my XLR cables to it. It has disc clamps.

This sounds like the drama of a soap opera, I really wish it were false what happened, but it is not.

For context, I (45 F) have been married to my husband (47 F) for 5 years, I don't want to add too much context but I am in the military, in my country it is uncommon for a woman to go into the military, but I managed to get it (This is important as it explains the extent of my damage).

I was doing military service/work/guard duty for 2 years (I don't know how to describe it, I'm not an English speaker), then I returned home to my husband, he is my whole life and my motive (we don't have children, it's not something we have planned).

When I returned I found that my husband had become close to a couple, this girl (23F) is a very nice woman, I realize that now, but at the time I saw her as a typical “threat to a relationship” short, blue eyed, blonde, curvy and sometimes too nice for my taste (as opposed to me being big and not very aesthetic), she is married to a guy (25M) who is quite docile, extremely nice, now I understand that there is nothing wrong with that, but at that time I saw them as the typical “Ned Flanders” of the neighborhood.

I was quite uncomfortable with this girl's presence, I felt threatened, I love my husband and did not want this woman to take him away, however she never crossed any boundaries, she would not enter my house unless I allowed her to (I rarely allowed her to), she was not flirtatious, just overly friendly and this irritated me.

Moving on to the incident, a week before our fourth anniversary I noticed that my husband was very distant (not really, I thought) he was hiding his phone, At some point I sneaked through my husband's phone and really found something that made me explode.

Her: ""your wife must not find out to..."" (I didn't even finish reading the message, but I had to go to work)

(Quick context, in my country it is normal to retire from the military at 40 since it is not something that is taken too seriously, so at that time I started working at a part-time job) I realized that I had forgotten my work ID so I came back and the first thing I see is this girl, in her pajamas, in my kitchen, pouring coffee in my teapot, I thought the worst, i was enraged and without giving time to explanations, I pounced on her, accusing her of being a home destroyer and a husband stealer, calling her all the names in the dictionary.

A 45-year-old military woman against a 23-year-old woman, it is not difficult to imagine that many of her bones were not saved, legs, ribs, cheekbones, etc. (I don't even know how this woman managed to leave my house or if someone took her out of there, I don't know how she was able to stay conscious, to keep trying to mumble words without me wanting to listen. ) I just walked away and left her lying there sobbing in the floor.

Maybe I should have listened to her, maybe I should have stopped when, between screams and pleas, she tried to explain the situation to me, because I found out that she was trying to fix our tense (neighbor) relationship, she knew that I didn't like her, so together with my husband they were planning to decorate my house. for a surprise anniversary party, which she planned, yes, that was what I ""didn't have to know"" my husband wasn't there because he had gone to buy a couple of gifts for me, she was in her pajamas because my husband asked her to out at the last minute and it was very early, a time when she is not usually awake.

I knew this because this girl's husband sent me a very hateful message telling me what a horrible person I am and with the evidence of everything... clearly I was arrested for this, but because she was at my home (the house is in my name) I didn't have to go to jail (In my country it is considered trespassing), clearly there were other legal organizations that could help her lock me up, but she decided to forgive me, I don't know if because of the terror she had or because she is an absolute angel, I had to pay a large sum of money , but of course, that is not enough.

Now I feel like a monster, I want to run to her and kneel, ask for forgiveness, give flowers to that wonderful girl.

Now I understand, even if it had been a real infidelity (it wasn't), the biggest culprit is always the unfaithful husband, there is no reason to do such great damage to the mistress, although in this case she was not even a mistress, I it took months of therapy to learn that.

She had to move because at work, although her innocence was proven, they did not want to take the risk, I ruined her life, they have told me that she has panic attacks and today, months after what happened, she still does not walk completely well, she had to go to many psychological therapies to be able to live ""quietly"" as much as possible.

I just wanted to get rid of it, the guilt eats me up, I can't get close to her (court order) but I would like to tell her how strong she is for moving forward even with all this.

Guys, my lesson learned, it's not worth fighting for love, it's no use and sometimes infidelity is just in your head.

I know this sub doesn't allow insults, but feel free to DM me and tell me whatever you want.

And for those who say that the emotional damage exceeds the physical, in this case no... there are cases like this where the physical and emotional damage is incredibly immense.",0,1729581448.0,TrueOffMyChest,19,0.5,False

To the Leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,

As a child, I learned about the iron rod. An immovable guide, I trusted it to lead me to where the good fruit grew. I walked along adjacent to a river, peacefully watching the foolish drown in the currents below.

26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the otherside of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.

27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.

Ah yes, we, the martyrs. Depriving ourselves of the lusts of the world, vanities ranging in depravity from coffee to homosexuality. Let them all laugh, let them fire their arrows. We shall be saved in light and glory while one day they burn and rot in the fiery second baptism of the earth. We deepen the chasm between us and them because if we are to be lifted up, surely someone must be left to burn? And we are not cruel, so they choose this fate of their own accord. We give them every chance to do things our way, and when they reject it… great shall be their fall.

But we had it all wrong, didn’t we? Because as I wake up to the pounding hooves of reality, the only great and spacious buildings I see are sending white spires to the heavens, adorned with a golden prophet trumpeting to the east. The only foundation-less fortress I can detect is the organization that claims to be unchanged from the original organization of Christ’s following and yet changes with every fleeting whim of fifteen ancient homogenous men. The only ones pointing and laughing are the ones baptized by fire and by the Holy Ghost who claim Jesus to be their muse. 

Stepping into the world and out of the cave of dancing shadows was more of a birth than any eighth birthday immersion. Here, there is reality. Here, there is the present over the promise of an unverifiable future. Here, there is peace and purpose and love and laughter and color and joy. Here, there is freedom, acceptance, and togetherness. Here there are principles of purpose rather than prejudice.

I implore you, cease and desist robbing humans of their bodies, their families, and their souls and selling them back to them for their silence, obedience, and income. 

And as it all crumbles down, I do not change. The people I once knew and loved see me with fear in their eyes, clawing at the  door to an ever shrinking room of innocence and ignorance, knowing that the doom and rejection that first enveloped me awaits their awakening. But I will give them hope: it does not last long. The dawn will break and the sun will rise, and maybe someday, everyone will see that the good fruit does not grow here. You cannot grow fruit where there is no ground.

The great and spacious building will fall.

And great will be the fall of it.

1g9c6w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1g9c6w6/what_went_wrong_i_cancelled_a_plan_5_days_before/,"What went wrong? I cancelled a plan 5 days before due to pregnancy health issues, my friend didn’t reply. ","I had plans with a friend, we see each other every 3-4 months. She has a busy job as a teacher and I am a full time mother and now pregnant, so also busy. 

I make an effort to reply to every message she sends and check in but she doesn’t reply and only messages when she wants to meet up. I get the impression she deletes our conversation and just reaches out with ‘how are you?’ instead of replying to anything I previously said (in response to her). 

We recently made plans to have brunch however I’ve been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and I’m feeling so fatigued that I’m falling asleep sitting up at 8am, even with a full nights sleep and 2 cups of coffee! 

I didn’t think I could make it to have a whole morning (1 hour travel each way) to have brunch and not feel exhausted, be able to get back and care for myself and toddler. I also have pain walking for more than 10-20 minutes without a rest. So I haven’t been going very far from my house. 

My husband is a HUGE help but he was works 6 days a week, so there aren’t a lot of opportunities just to rest and recover from the pregnancy symptoms. 

Without going into detail, I let my friend know I was having a rough time with the second pregnancy. I said I wouldn’t be able to meet up this side of my pregnancy (I’m now 7.5 months) and that hopefully in the new year we could meet. She didn’t reply at all and ignored my message. 

She works with parents, and with children but doesn’t have her own children yet, so I do understand until you experience pregnancy and caring for a toddler, telling someone about it is a bit like describing what it’s like to swim without them ever actually having been in the water. Perhaps she thinks I’m just making excuses? 

Should I pursue the friendship or just accept she’s not that interested and she sees me as more of a distraction now and then?

1g9c105,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1g9c105/things_ive_learned_after_tracking_calories_for_a/,🎓 Things I've learned after tracking calories for a few years,"This isn't a full list, but wanted to share this with the community here and perhaps get some other insights from other people. Do share if you have any!

1. I can easily estimate the calorie content of a specific dish just by looking at it. Not precisely, but much better than someone who has never tracked calories before.
2. I tend to favor eating healthier foods simply because they are less calorie-dense and more filling. I also drink plain black coffee instead of sugar-heavy options like pumpkin-vanilla-caramel-lattes or whatever else Starbucks is serving these days.
3. I prefer eating whole foods because they are easier to track.
4. If I eat healthy for five days in a row, I stop craving things like pizza, chocolate, etc.
5. Often when I feel a craving, it's because I'm at home and bored. Being active distracts you from eating, which helps reduce calorie intake.
6. Drinking a lot of water helps, both with reducing hunger and supporting your kidneys, skin, etc. I have an RO filter next to my sink, so I essentially have free water all day long. I probably consume about 6 liters of plain water daily.
7. Meal prepping on Sundays works well. First, you have healthy, pre-tracked meals available for the entire week. Second, you're more likely to eat them since wasting food isn't an option.
8. Keeping the kitchen snack-free (or at least stocked with healthy snacks) helps. However, having a grocery store on the ground floor of my apartment building does not.
9. I track my weight daily, which means that minor fluctuations of 0.5 kg from day to day are irrelevant. The trend only becomes clear when I average my weight over a week and compare the weekly averages.
10. When transitioning from a bulking phase to a cutting phase (by dropping 500 calories per day or more), it's common to lose a few kilograms in the first week. This is mostly due to less food passing through the body, along with some reduced water retention.
11. Consistency is crucial. The fat loss I notice is the result of weeks of eating fewer calories. The body scale is useful, but it doesn't mean much if that's the only thing you're tracking. On the same note, eating a lot on a single day doesn't have a big impact—but doing so four days in a row probably will.
12. I carry a kitchen scale with me to restaurants. I've learned not to care what others think about it. Besides, it's harder to criticize the guy with the food scale when he looks fitter than the average person.
13. There are many strategies, tips, and tricks to help stick to a diet or calorie intake plan. A lot of them work, but not all will work for everyone since each person has a different lifestyle, age, etc. Try things out, see what works for you, and move on. For example, I don't do intermittent fasting or follow strict meal times, but I can see how skipping breakfast or not eating after 6 p.m. might help others.

For a little background, I (22F) and my friend (23M) have been friends for over 4 years, we met in collage and after 2 years of being in the same class I transfered to another school so we stopped seeing each other daily but still remaind in contact and he's one of my closest friends, when we started our friendship he had a gf, he always talked about how much he loved her and it's the woman of his life, I've seen her only like 2 times but she's super nice, during that time I had a bf, they knew each other but didn't get along, I broke up with him and my friend remainded in his relationship.
So now, onto the problem, 8 months ago my friend told me he was opening his relationship because his gf was insisting him to do it, and then asked me if he could practice hitting on girls with me (he's very introverted and shy), we talked about it and he said he was asking me because it was kind of embarrasing for him and wanted to do it with someone he trusted, I have an issue with saying no to people so I agreed but told him I would just accept a kiss, nothing else, so we had lunch and when he dropped me at my house he kissed me and I kissed him back, after that I tried to talk to him as I always do but he talked about the kiss a lot and said I was a great kisser, and started liking mi ig stories, and saying I looked hot, a month passed and I told him I was starting to date someone and he stopped texting me back as often, I saw him a couple times for coffe or lunch and I felt like he tried to be closer to me than usual, for example instead of sitting across the table he sit right next to me, also he kept replying to my ig stories and making jokes about the kiss.
Last month I broke up with the guy I was dating and my friend stopped with the jokes and I felt like he was replying to my texts as usual, like we were getting back to our normal friendship, so 3 days ago I saw my friend, we had lunch, then coffee and he asked me if I wanted to go to his house and smoke some weed, I said yes, so we where chilling in his bedroom, listening to music and he started getting closer to me, and touching my knee, so I told him I had to leave, he said he was gonna dropped me but to give him a few minutes cause he was dizzy from smoking, I started getting anxious cause he kept getting closer to me even when I moved places so  insisted on leaving, after like 10 minutes he got up and we left his house, the next day I texted him and he didn't answer, and the day after that I sent him a tik tok and he left me on seen, so it makes me think he's mad at me, like he was expecting something else would happen at his place, now I don't know what to do cause I don't wanna loose his friendship, he has helped me a lot over the years, and we used to had a great time together but I don't want to be in this situation, feeling uncomfortable and confused with his actions, how do I talk to him about this?

# Understanding High Risk Payment Processing

Before diving into the comparison, let’s briefly revisit what constitutes [**high risk payment processing**](https://webpays.com/high-risk-processing.html/). Businesses classified as high risk typically face greater challenges and risks, including:

● **Industry Type:** Sectors like online gambling, and adult entertainment, often encounter higher chargeback rates and regulatory scrutiny.

● **Business Model:** Subscription services, recurring billing, or high-ticket items can be riskier due to their potential for fraud.

● **Credit History:** Businesses with poor credit or a history of financial instability may also be categorized as high risk.

**High risk payment processors** are specifically designed to handle these challenges, providing tailored solutions and enhanced security features to manage risk effectively.

# WebPays: A Closer Look

3. Advanced Security: WebPays places a strong emphasis on security, which is crucial for high risk payment processing.

1. Global Reach: BlueSnap provides a wide range of payment processing solutions and supports multiple currencies, which can be advantageous for businesses with an international customer base. Their global reach and extensive network facilitate cross-border transactions efficiently.

4. Customer Support: BlueSnap provides customer support through various channels, including phone and email. While their support is generally reliable, it may not be as personalized or responsive as what you might experience with WebPays.

5. Pricing: BlueSnap’s pricing is competitive but can be complex, with various fees for different services. While they do offer robust solutions, understanding the full cost structure can require a bit of diligence.

# WebPays vs. BlueSnap: The Comparison

When comparing WebPays and BlueSnap, several key differences emerge:

1. **Personalization:** WebPays offers more tailored solutions for **high risk payment** processing, with a focus on understanding and addressing the specific needs of high risk industries. BlueSnap provides a comprehensive platform but may not offer the same level of customization.

2. **Pricing:** WebPays stands out with its competitive and transparent fee structure. While BlueSnap’s pricing is competitive, it can be more complex and may require careful analysis to fully understand the costs.

3. **Customer Support:** WebPays excels in providing exceptional and responsive customer support. Their personalized approach ensures that you receive timely assistance. BlueSnap offers solid support but may not match the level of responsiveness provided by WebPays.

4. **Integration and Flexibility:** Both WebPays and BlueSnap offer flexible integration options, but WebPays’ seamless integration with existing systems and dedication to personalized service give it a slight edge in this area.

5. **Security:** Both processors offer robust security features, including PCI DSS compliance and fraud prevention tools. However, WebPays’ emphasis on advanced security and its tailored approach to high risk industries provide an additional layer of reassurance.

# Final Words

Both WebPays and BlueSnap are solid choices for **high risk payment processing**, but WebPays has a slight edge with its tailored solutions, competitive pricing, and exceptional customer support.

Tonight is day 5 of sleeping alone after asking my husband that I wanted a divorce. He was a stay at home spouse, and pretty much took full care of my needs until 5 days ago. 

He set my alarms, programmed the coffee maker every night, set my clothes out for work, did laundry. Made sure I had water, coffee, and a protein shake on my desk before I started work. Put all my meds and vitamins in a cute little dish next to my keyboard so I wouldn't forget to take them. Set out a clean towel and washcloth every morning. Brought me food through the day, especially on busy meeting days, because he knew I wouldn't eat. And honestly, so much more. 

When I made this decision, after months of agonizing over it, I was instantly afraid that I would fall into deep depression and not be able to cope. I've been there recently and it's not pretty. 

I've actually surprised myself. I've been leaning into self-care. I'm showering regularly, exfoliating, brushing my teeth twice per day, FLOSSING, wearing make up every day for work. Also, even more surprisingly...I'm no longer a slob? Instead of a tornado that leaves the remains of my food/entertainment/boredom strewn around the house, I'm actually picking up after myself and it's consistent. 

I don't recognize this person I'm becoming and that's a little scary. I'm more assertive, confident at work, handling conflict instead of avoiding it. 

I'm hesitant to think this is anything but a coping mechanism to stay occupied so I don't think about it. Like that part of my thoughts are locked up right now. Almost like I'm building up mental armor so when I finally am able to grieve the loss of my marriage it won't destroy me. 

I have never lived alone before and while I've always been accountable and responsible to handle most things on my own, now I'm really alone. 

I don't know what to do now. ",2,1729579297.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

I’m in my freshman year of college, never dated before, and met a guy through a club. He always makes an effort to come over and talk to me even though we’re in different subgroups and once he got my number a few weeks ago he started texting me everyday asking about my interests and what I’m up to, etc. Fast forward to last week he asks me to go and get coffee and I say yes since I didn’t have a reason to say no and hadn’t made up my mind as to whether or not I saw him as more of a friend (I could tell he was interested in me so I was already considering if I was as well). It was a nice date and it turns out we have a lot in common but I didn’t feel any sort of “spark”. I’ve had crushes before (one that was a few years long) and I can’t help but compare how I felt then to how I feel now. I will also say I can’t tell if he knows me well enough to have decided he actually likes me as I am (there’s a lot of my personality, ex. dark humor, that I feel he would have to be okay with already) and tbh it almost feels to fast to be going on dates (most likely because every good relationship I can compare to they were best friends before dating). We’re going on a second date but I’m not sure if we know each other well enough to be dating and I’m worried that if it turns out I’m not into him that I’m leading him on. I also know that first dates are usually awkward but even when we text we don’t usually quite know what to talk about or how to talk to each other (he does put a lot of effort into coming up with things to ask me or talk about though). Do most people know instantly if someone is someone they want to date? Is it fair to date him when I don’t know if I like him in that way or not? And how many dates would be leading him on if I were to find that I’m not interested in him in that way? ",1,1729578183.0,dating_advice,2,0.66,False

I have always been a very studious kid, perfect grades, ""nerdy"". Way back in ninth grade, a bunch of my classmates dragged me over to the girl I liked and I confessed my feelings for her. It wasn't that big of a deal when she said ""I just want to be friends"". **I know you cannot get somebody to like you, it needs to be natural, so I let it go**. But a couple of days later on the ride back home, the guys who had dragged me to talk to her told me that they were teasing her about ""why she rejected me"", and they told me that she told them that ""it was because I was self conscious and that **she did not find me attractive**"".

I don't want to focus on whether the girl actually said this or not, but I started crying right after the boys left the bus, all the way back home.

Ever since then, I have had multiple rejections. In high school, it was ""**I don't want anything to change"", ""I don't see you that way""**,..., which I would still handle but with each rejection, I became increasingly worried about my appearance. During lockdown, I became more conscious of my appearance, after which, I got into a decent college in the US (in 2021).

Over here, I focused on maintaining perfect grades during first year. But every now and then, I would keep hearing people joke about me being ""nerdy"" and that because I am south asian, I am ugly and no girl would be interested in me. There exists some data on men of south asian descent being the least likely to succeed in online dating, but I did not really give heed to that.

At the start of my second year, I asked out a girl, who told me that she actually had a boyfriend she was doing long distance with. Once again, I took it pretty well (this time, she was in a relationship with someone else, so it wasn't my fault), but some of my friends planted in my head the idea **that the girl probably lied to me because she didn't want to go out with me. I did not take this idea seriously at first, but a couple of weeks later, I came back from dinner crying profusely, thinking that it may have been true (it was not as I learned months later)**. I sought therapy, and was diagnosed with moderate depression, for which I started and am taking medication. It was during this time that I put on about 8 kg of muscle - going from 57 to 65 kgs, and joined my college's track team.

I did ask out a girl for coffee (and she said ""she'd love to go out and grab a coffee""), but she ghosted me right after.

I am very lonely. Everything is changing, and I feel like I cannot trust people anymore. There has been a lot of overt and covert racism, and with the whole rumor thing, I have isolated myself. But I look around me and see couples holding hands and being affectionate, and feel like I deserve it too. I am in good physical shape due to track, which I had to quit due to my hard senior year workload. I sing very well, and play three instruments, and am well-read and spoken.

1g9bl78,https://www.reddit.com/r/glossopharyngeal/comments/1g9bl78/two_year_progression_i_told_them_it_was_gpn_but/,"Two year progression. I told them it was GPN, but they didn't believe me at first. ","Mine is from chronic lingual tonsillitis. First got it bad two years ago. Just started quickly shocking me while drinking the first couple days then one night I was drinking a soda and the shock turned into a pulsating electrical fire in my throat that lasted for minutes and left me writhing on my bed. Probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I didn't even know what was happening.

This happened three more times, the last one has spread from it's normal jabby spot near the left side my lingual tonsil, all the way up almost to my left ear.  It was only after I finished my second 14 day amoxicillin treatment that it calmed down. I spent that entire month drinking nothing but coffee, tea, and warm water. It sucked. 

Ended up having my tonsils removed along with a bunch of sinus work at the same time, but not my lingual tonsil, even though I told them that's where the nerve pain was coming from. I straight up had the surgeon later look me in the face and basically tell me he was confident that was not where the pain was coming from and that I was just confused. 

Well, about 6 months later it came back again with an infection in the lingual tonsil. Cleared with treatment only to come back 3 more times 6-8 months apart and now I'm on a second round of antibiotics after the first round only cleared it for about a week and it came back. I've got an appointment later this week where the doctor said they want to talk about scheduling a lingual tonsillectomy. They don't or can't actually remove the whole thing, they just reduce its size, so it's not guaranteed to solve the problem, but it might help. At this point I don't know what else to do. I'm tired of taking antibiotics and anti-fungals (Augmentin and diflucam for 10 days), but it's the only thing that helps once the shocks start back up. That's my cue now to make an appointment with the ENT doc. 

My surgeon was well known and respected, but was a bit older. I just found out he recently retired, so I don't have to see him again. I don't disagree my tonsils needed to go, but was a bit hurt by how what I was telling them was dismissed at first. At least now we can rule out the palatial tonsils anyways. Would have been nice to have already got it over with. I'm really not looking forward to another surgery and what I'm guessing will not be a fun recovery. I'm almost 44 now. Took me a full month to even start to feel recovered from the last one and still had to deal with percocet withdraws for longer than that. I hate those so much...

I have always been a very studious kid, perfect grades, ""nerdy"". Way back in ninth grade, a bunch of my classmates dragged me over to the girl I liked and I confessed my feelings for her. It wasn't that big of a deal when she said ""I just want to be friends"". **I know you cannot get somebody to like you, it needs to be natural, so I let it go**. But a couple of days later on the ride back home, the guys who had dragged me to talk to her told me that they were teasing her about ""why she rejected me"", and they told me that she told them that ""it was because I was self conscious and that **she did not find me attractive**"".

I don't want to focus on whether the girl actually said this or not, but I started crying right after the boys left the bus, all the way back home.

Ever since then, I have had multiple rejections. In high school, it was ""**I don't want anything to change"", ""I don't see you that way""**,..., which I would still handle but with each rejection, I became increasingly worried about my appearance. During lockdown, I became more conscious of my appearance, after which, I got into a decent college in the US (in 2021).

Over here, I focused on maintaining perfect grades during first year. But every now and then, I would keep hearing people joke about me being ""nerdy"" and that because I am south asian, I am ugly and no girl would be interested in me. There exists some data on men of south asian descent being the least likely to succeed in online dating, but I did not really give heed to that.

At the start of my second year, I asked out a girl, who told me that she actually had a boyfriend she was doing long distance with. Once again, I took it pretty well (this time, she was in a relationship with someone else, so it wasn't my fault), but some of my friends planted in my head the idea **that the girl probably lied to me because she didn't want to go out with me. I did not take this idea seriously at first, but a couple of weeks later, I came back from dinner crying profusely, thinking that it may have been true (it was not as I learned months later)**. I sought therapy, and was diagnosed with moderate depression, for which I started and am taking medication. It was during this time that I put on about 8 kg of muscle - going from 57 to 65 kgs, and joined my college's track team.

I did ask out a girl for coffee (and she said ""she'd love to go out and grab a coffee""), but she ghosted me right after.

I am very lonely. Everything is changing, and I feel like I cannot trust people anymore. There has been a lot of overt and covert racism, and with the whole rumor thing, I have isolated myself. But I look around me and see couples holding hands and being affectionate, and feel like I deserve it too. I am in good physical shape due to track, which I had to quit due to my hard senior year workload. I sing very well, and play three instruments, and am well-read and spoken. But I feel like I am ugly and no girl would ever want to be with me.

I know relationships are about looks, personality and values. But light travels faster than sound, and I don't feel good enough for any girl. Please talk to me",1,1729577770.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
