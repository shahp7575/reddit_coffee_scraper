Accidentally recycled a $200 piece of my medical equipment: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just call the company, they‚Äôll replace it.‚Äù Until I found it not-yet taken by the truck, and my legs turned into jelly. 

Left the stove on all day, until my housemate texted me and the other girl we lived with: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, thank God nothing happened, I will absolutely make extra sure to double-check from now on.‚Äù

My roommates (neither have ADHD) and I have communication issues, and I dug the stupid hole deeper with one of them when she didn‚Äôt come home at all last night and I sent her a joke text threatening to water her plants, a reference to watering them for her in the past (‚Äúproof of life or the plant gets it ü™¥üí¶üî´‚Äù).

I was worried (with decent reason to be, she has a history of mental and physical health things), and trying to cover it with smart-assery‚Ä¶.

Well she‚Äôs totally fine and during the ten seconds I saw her at work she didn‚Äôt make eye contact at all, nor did she answer the very, very stupid text. And I‚Äôm just now realizing that maybe I didn‚Äôt read the fucking writing on the wall: she‚Äôs pissed at me and needs space to cool off.

Except a few days ago when I made a pot of coffee in the morning it was making a loud popping sound when brewing, almost like it was too hot and sputtering in the pot or something. I didn't think much of it, until I went to make my morning espresso and I smelled burning and more popping coming from the coffee maker. I instantly unplugged the maker, but the smell of wires/plastic burning remained. 

After doing some looking the GFCI had NOT been triggered on the outlet BUT the breaker for the outlet HAD been tripped, I flipped it back on and it stayed on. 

I then moved the coffee maker to a different outlet in my kitchen and its been brewing coffee like normal, no popping, no burning smell. 

This makes me think the issue is with the outlet NOT the coffee maker, any idea what it could be? Bad GFCI, outlet, or something worse with the breakers?

1ftraou,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaydads/comments/1ftraou/surrogacy_experience_in_mexico_city/,Surrogacy experience in Mexico City,"Now that we're finally back in the US, I thought it'd be helpful to write a post not just about our experience, but focusing on the exit process.  To be honest, we found that our consultant was less than helpful about what exactly happens after birth, leaving us anxious and confused.  Not to be overly dramatic, but the whole reason we spent $6000 hiring a third-party consultant was so that we had some independent expertise and someone to call for help.  He ghosted us for over a week after birth, and after a single short phone call, never got back to us or checked in since.  Save your money, and deal directly with your surrogacy program.  Normal disclosures: YMMV.  This will be the process we experienced, but both Mexican and US government procedures can change at any time.

We had a great experience with our in-country surrogacy agency. They did everything they said they would.  We experienced great communication from our first visit, through the weeks after birth.  Once in-country, they set up a whatsapp group with the medical staff, our coordinator, and the surrogate's social worker.  During birth and until discharge, our coordinator was with us the whole time at the hospital, and best we could tell, our surrogate was also well taken care of by the social worker assigned to her.

Unfortunately, after that is where things went sideways.  We were told to expect it to take 1-2 weeks to get the Mexican birth certificate, and 3-4 weeks to get an approved CRBA + emergency passport from the US embassy.  This is not the reality.

**Getting the Birth Certificate**

There are two ways to get a birth certificate in Mexico City: with or without the surrogate.  

With the surrogate, it is a very fast process.  The bio dad simply goes to the civil registration office with the baby and surrogate, and you are registered.  The birth certificate will list the surrogate as the mother, bio dad as the father, and *there is no current legal process to change this*.  The surrogate will then have to go with you to the embassy and be part of the process, since she is legally the mother under Mexican law.  You will then have to go through a step-parent adoption in the US to remove her parental rights, which will also go most smoothly with the surrogate's continued cooperation.  This is risky, and some surrogates may simply decide they do not want to have any legal ties to the child; after pregnancy and birth, they will want to quickly get back to their normal lives.

Without the surrogate, the IPs must file an Amparo with the court.  They goal is to obtain what is essentially an injunction ordering the civil registration office to register the birth of the child in the IPs name(s).  The full process will take many months, but the injunction can usually be obtained in 3-7 weeks.  Why the variance? Like at home, when you file a case it is randomly assigned to a judge.  Some judges are favorable to surrogacy and will issue an injunction quite quickly.  Others are not, and will do everything possible to delay the process.

1. You will ask the civil registration office for an appointment to register your baby, born via advanced reproductive technology.  Your lawyer should provide the language to use.
2. In a few days, you will get an appointment, but will also be told that you will need a court order.
3. You will then need to verify and sign all the necessary documents for the Amparo, which will be filed as soon as the surrogate also signs.
4. In about a week, the case will be assigned to a court.
5. The court will ask the registration office why they have denied the rights of your child (to be registered).
6. The registration office will issue a standard response that they have no regulations to deal with ART.
7. At this point, ""good"" judges will issue the injunction, and off you go to the civil registration office.
8. You may be required to go to court (together with the surrogate) to ""prove"" your signatures so as to verify that the surrogacy contract is genuine and taken under the free will of everyone involved.
9. You may be required to undergo DNA testing to prove that the surrogate has no genetic relationship to the child, and instead the bio dad is the genetic father.
10. Rarely, this has required court appeals, so it's a risk to know about.
11. The courts will go on vacation twice a year for alternating 15-day periods in the summer and around Christmas.  Obviously, timing the birth is not a thing... it happens 9 months after successful implantation.  But, again, a potential source of delay to be aware of.  If you run into the vacation period, it may be beneficial to wait to file the Amparo until the ""bad"" judges are on vacation.

Bottom line: you are dealing with a process that may be as short as 3 weeks or as long as 2 months, so plan accordingly.  Thankfully, we got a ""good"" judge and had our birth certificate just 3 weeks after birth.  KNOW THAT THIS IS FAST!  To their credit, our lawyers understood that we had not come prepared to stay in Mexico as long as is really needed, and moved heaven and earth to speed things through as best they could. Once registered, you can get an online certified copy from the Mexican government's website for only MX$90.  Just print it out on card stock at a stationary store, and while you're at it, print some extras.

**Getting out of Mexico - the US Embassy**

Since surrogacy is not actually a well-regulated process in Mexico (in fact, it is not regulated at all), the US Embassy does not have easy procedures in place to deal with the many surrogacy cases they see.  For your own sanity, you should get your own DNA testing done.  If the surrogate is willing, you can do this before birth.  Otherwise, it is easy enough to use a mail-order testing kit.  Just as in the US, reputable agencies have thorough procedures in place to avoid mix-ups with IVF.  Just as in the US, there are rare cases where problems have happened.  If you are NOT the bio dad, you can exit the country... however, you MUST use the adoption process, as the US Embassy will only approve CRBA applications of children that have 13 American chromosomes.

As I write this, the Embassy's website still does not have clear procedures, so here's what we had to do:

Gather documents -- before you leave for Mexico!

1. If you are married, and both are US citizens, you must bring proof that both of you have been physically present at some point in your adult lives.  This should be either W2s, work contracts, school transcripts, or some other documentation that firmly establishes you have been in the country.  Rental agreements or property records don't count, because you could theoretically be abroad while renting a place in the US.  Social security statements are less preferred, because you may have earned money working abroad for a US employer.  Remember, the presumption for basically all US citizenship or immigration cases is that the applicant is not eligible; you must convince the officer that you are entitled to citizenship for your child.
2. Depending on other family situations (i.e., single, not married, or if both are not US citizens), you may need to provide documentation that you have been physically present in the US over the course of as many as five years.  DON'T CUT IT SHORT.  Did you go on an international vacation?  Then your W2 doesn't really mean you were present for a full year.  There is no such thing as bringing too much proof of physical presence.
3. Bring official/certified copies of any applicable documents.
4. Be sure to bring basic vital statistics stuff: you will have your passports, but it cannot hurt to also bring your birth certificate (if born in the US) or certificate of naturalization (if not).  If married, bring your marriage certificate (the official one from your state of residence).
5. Make copies of everything.  The embassy will want to see the original, but keep a copy.  Yes, you can make copies and print stuff in Mexico City.  Obviously.  But why not come prepared?
6. For the CRBA (Consular Report of Birth Abroad), you will need to fill out a form stating every period of time you were physically present in the United States since your birth.  If you are like us, you have traveled a LOT.  Come prepared with the dates.  Do your best to remember.  They aren't going to deny your application if you forgot exactly when you came back from vacation 10 years ago.  They will create problems if you claim that you have never left the country in your life.  I mean, if this is really you, be prepared to explain why you were comfortable living in Mexico for a few months having never before been outside the US.
7. While your Mexican lawyers should provide copies of all of the relevant contracts related to the surrogacy, bring copies yourself just in case.
8. You should buy a return ticket to avoid any issues with Mexican immigration.  Just buy a refundable (full-fare) ticket, so you can change it as may be needed.  It's unlikely you'll actually return on the date that you bought the ticket for.  But, bring copies of your itinerary anyway.
9. Oh, and bring some passport photos of yourself.  Or, at least, of the bio-dad.  You will need them for DNA testing.  Yes, you can get these in Mexico if you prefer.  I mean, you'll need to get photos of the baby.

Navigating the eCRBA

1. The embassy's website says that DNA testing is not required.  Let me say this quite clearly: Your CRBA will NOT be approved without DNA testing.  Period.  Also, and let me be clear on this as well: you MUST use the embassy's DNA testing process.  Get your own done so you are confident of the results, but understand that an important part of speeding your exit will be to expeditiously get the embassy's DNA test.
2. You can -- and should -- make your [travel.gov](http://travel.gov) account and start filling out your eCRBA as soon as you know when you'll be traveling for the birth.  Or earlier.  If you've traveled abroad a lot, it will be helpful to do this when you are at home and can look at old passports, etc., to get the dates when physically present in the US.
3. For the child's name, please know that if you will be using the surrogate to register the birth, the last name will follow standard latino names: FirstName MiddleName Patronym Matronym.  If you use the Amparo process, you can basically pick your own name, within reason.
4. While nothing online will tell you this, it's not actually critical to know the child's birth date before filing the eCRBA.  What **is** critical is that you file it early.  Why?
5. Contact your preferred AABB-accredited DNA testing lab, tell them you are doing surrogacy.  You can do this as far in advance as you'd like, but be sure that they **do not send the testing kit before you file your eCRBA**.  If you send it too early, the embassy will throw it out, and you will have to pay the lab additional fees to fedex another test kit.
6. So you have filed your eCRBA.  You've had the testing kit mailed.  The US Embassy in Mexico City usually has appointments roughly 4-6 weeks out.  Feel free to schedule your appointment based on expectations of when you will have your birth certificate.  On this point, the embassy's website is clear and correct: you cannot do anything without the Mexican birth certificate.
7. Your lawyer should know shortly after filing the Amparo if you have a ""good"" or ""bad"" judge, and you absolutely should curate your embassy appointment accordingly.  You do not want to wait until the last minute only to realize that you must reschedule because you don't have the birth certificate as soon as you hoped.  CRBA appointments cannot be expedited unless there is a life or death emergency (e.g., baby's grandfather is in hospital about to die and you can provide proof of this).
8. Once your DNA test kit has arrived in Mexico City you will get an email from the embassy inviting you to schedule your DNA test.  When we were there, they only took DNA samples on Wednesdays.  Also, do not schedule your DNA test until you have the Mexican birth certificate (notice a theme?).
9. It's ok if you have your embassy appointment before your DNA test, or before your DNA test results are back.  Just understand that you are not leaving Mexico until both happen.
10. What to do if you've been conservative in your scheduling and everything happens faster than you expected?  Well, just check 5-6 times a day, morning, afternoon, and night, for any earlier appointments.  Life happens, and sometimes people have to reschedule.  Or, the embassy has more staff than expected, so they open more appointments.  This is how we ended up getting a CRBA appointment just a week after we got the birth certificate.
11. While you wait, prepare the passport application.  Getting good baby passport photos is hard.  But, Mexicans love babies and will work with you at a photo shop to make it happen.  Just be clear that you need US passport size, as this is different than the Mexican passport size they will be used to.  Get extra photos, as you will need them for any DNA tests you may need (either for the Amparo or the US Embassy process).
12. Plan your exit.  DNA testing should only really take a week or so after the sample has been taken.  It is fedexed to the US, and you've paid extra for priority processing at your lab (right?). If have been able to get this done before your CRBA appointment, you can expect a same-day passport.  Theoretically, you could leave the day after your CRBA appointment!  Otherwise, know that it may take a day or two after the Embassy gets your results to actually issue your child's emergency passport.  Emergency passports are usually ready for pick up at 3pm every afternoon.  Most flights back to the US are in the morning.

Navigating the US Embassy

1. You should arrive early, but not too early.  Fifteen minutes before your appointment (either for DNA testing or the CRBA) is adequate -- and they may not let you in earlier.  There is a separate line for US citizens that is shorter and faster than Mexicans applying for Visas.  Just ask the guards where to go or look for the sign that says ""passports.""
2. For your CRBA appointment, a staff member will check all your documents outside.  Be sure you have ready:
   1. Your passport application, printed with a legible bar code, but not signed (remember to enter 000-00-0000 as the SSN).
   2. Passport photos for the baby.
   3. A copy of flight itineraries to prove that you are in need of an emergency passport -- this should include the actual ticket number so they know it isn't just a reservation you made and cancelled, but an actual purchased flight.
   4. Copies of the basic documents: Baby's birth certificate, your passports.
   5. A printed and signed statement (available from the embassy's website) that says your child has not been issued a social security number.
   6. They put things in the preferred order, paper clip it all together, and give you a ticket that you will give the guard to let you in.
3. For your DNA appointment, you may go right to the ""passports"" entrance.  Just make sure you have with you:
   1. Mexican birth certificate for the baby
   2. Passport of bio dad
   3. Passport-size photos of bio dad and baby (bring two)
   4. A bottle for the baby, because s/he will prolly be hungry by the time the test is done, and they are happy to let you feed him/her right after the DNA swab.
   5. For your convenience, there are several nearby starbucks (we liked the one right across Reforma from the embassy).  Enjoy your coffee post-test, and know that you are almost done!
4. By all means, bring your cell phones with you.  You will need to turn them off and leave them at Embassy security.  The admonishments to leave all electronics at home are really for non-citizens, as they don't have the space to store everyone's cell phone.  Embassy staff know that you need navigation/uber if you don't live in Mexico.  If you are coming during the rainy season, they'll also keep your umbrellas at security.
5. For the CRBA, your appointment time should be viewed as more of an admission ticket.  It will take several hours.  Understand that your officer will be reviewing all the documents and doing a background check before actually calling you up to the counter for the interview.  Be prepared to taste any water or formula you are bringing.  If you have other kids, you can bring food for them, but be prepared to taste it.  Adults are expected to just wait it out.
6. You will be going through TSA-like security.  Large bassinets won't fit, but smaller ones will.  Just know that everything will have to go through the x-ray machine.  The staff are a lot nicer than the TSA, and will guide you through what you need to do, so just listen to their instructions.
7. For the CRBA appointment, the officer will review the key documents you've brought, swear you in, and ask some basic questions about you and your life to try and make sure everything is genuine.  For example, she asks for your proof of physical presence and you hand her a W2. The officer might ask, ""what do you do for a living?""  You presented your marriage certificate: ""how did you meet?"" No need to overshare (the officer doesn't want to spend all day on this), but never lie. For example, if you've changed jobs since that particular W2, just say so.  Yes, they have heard of grindr, so if that's how you met, just say so.
8. If you have the CRBA appointment before DNA testing is done, tell the officer where you are in that process -- maybe you already have the DNA appointment scheduled, or maybe you are waiting for the results.  If you've already done the DNA testing, the officer will already have your results.
9. Either way, ask about paying the waybill to ship your CRBA.  Your CRBA will be printed in the US, mailed to Mexico, and then shipped to your address in the US (don't ask).  If you don't have a waybill paid for shipping, it will delay things.  There is a DHL office in the embassy you can use.  Don't worry if this is something you forget about -- the embassy will send you an email explaining how to buy DHL shipping (just make sure that if you are already in the US, you buy it using the US DHL website, not the Mexican one.  You'll have issues paying with a US credit card on the DHL MX website).

A side note about scheduling your CRBA appointment: you don't really have to do the process in Mexico City even if that's where your baby was born.  If you have friends in (wherever) and you prefer to wait it out somewhere else, you can absolutely schedule it elsewhere.  Certain consulates (usually the ones on the border) have shorter wait times for CRBA appointments.  Just know that you should arrange DNA testing at the same consulate that has your CRBA appointment.  We heard rumors that some consulates may not actually require DNA testing if you have other medical documents to demonstrate genetic affinity (e.g., IVF transfer declaration).  YMMV.  Personally, I don't think it's worth moving yourselves and a newborn baby across Mexico just in the hope of maybe not needing DNA testing.  Mexico City is not really a bad place to be trapped for a few months.  The same cannot be said of certain other cities that host US consulates.

**Welcome back to the US!**

1. You can and should apply for your child's social security number as soon as you get home.
2. The emergency passport will **NOT** be accepted by Social Security offices as proof of citizenship of your child.
3. Get NEW passport photos for your baby.  Use the state department's online form generator to make the special application form to exchange an emergency passport.
4. You'll need another copy of that ""we don't have an SSN"" statement.
5. You should also print out and sign a ""file search"" form (just google it).  It will take a while to actually get the physical CRBA, and you otherwise have no other proof of your baby's US citizenship.  There is no extra fee for this, as the record of the approved CRBA will be electronic.
6. Technically, there is no fee for the ""full validity"" passport, but you'll probably want to pay for expedited process to get the social security application started sooner rather than later.
7. Expect that the Social Security Administration will need to translate the Mexican birth certificate, so it won't be processed immediately.
8. Your baby is also a Mexican citizen.  You are entitled to a Mexican passport for your baby, and your local Mexican consulate has friendly staff who can help you with this.  In our global world, dual citizenship is an asset.",1,1727797558.0,gaydads,0,0.67,False

1ftr1ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1ftr1ny/how_to_handle_the_fact_that_most_of_my_coworkers/,How to handle the fact that most of my coworkers don't like me?,"I work at a fast food restaurant known for their original chicken sandwiches (I'm avoiding the name of said restaurant). It's my 5th month and I'm beginning to realize how most of the crew do not like me here. When I was hired, my boss did say that there will be people on the team I don't get along with (that's a given), but the issue is that these people are on the upper echelon of staff (so they are managers and shift leaders). 

They do NOT respect me at all. I don't why. I don't know what I did to them, but they have slowly given me the cold shoulder as of late. 

One of the biggest issues is when they place me on front counter. The bias is absolutely insane. I run out of coffee and I am literally tasked to go remake coffee when I run out. I only go back once I helped everyone, OR when several customers need coffee ASAP (they gotta go to work). Yet whenever I go back for coffee, the shift leaders get pissed off and tell me to stay in the front. Like dude, Y'ALL taught me to go get coffee DAY ONE OF WORK. Why all of the sudden get mad? Nobody is even at the register and NOBODY was getting me coffee when I asked multiple times! You expect me to just drift around in front of customers as they need drinks? I'm getting flamed for that, yet when I do my job I also get flamed. It's a lose lose. Either I do my job and get shunned by the staff, or I don't do much and customers act like I'm lazy.

Oh but wait, there's more! When I am on cleaning duty for the day, sometimes customers will tell me ""I have been waiting on X desert item for 10+ minutes and have not got it!"" I tell them I'll go get it. I go back to the desert section: NOBODY is there! I already cleaned up messes and everyone else wants to act oh too busy, so I go ahead and make the treats for the customers. Ohhhh but then all of the sudden that's when the shift leaders have free time and they get mad and boot me off deserts. They will act like I spilled ice cream everywhere or something, but then they will take another 5+ minutes to actually finish one damn milkshake! Of course the customers get mad AT ME for not having their shake, although *sometimes* they understand... sometimes... as in 1/10 of the time.

Now this last reason is going to make me sound like a jerk, but hear me out. For some darn reason, my hiring manager hired WAY too many workers and scheduled them all on the same days, so we had very high labor. Guess who had their hours cut and struggled to get anymore... ME! I need the money dude! I'm in college and I have to pay three huge bills every month. At least 1K is out the window every month, dawg. I can't be doing this inconsistent tango.

1ftr15z,https://www.reddit.com/r/waiting_to_try/comments/1ftr15z/alcohol_and_wtt/,Alcohol and WTT,"My husband and I plan to start TTC late April/early May, so I am counting January 1 as my starting line for getting (even more) serious about egg and sperm health. We'll be starting prenatals/vitamins, focusing extra on our diet, etc. - mostly things I am already doing now, but really ramping it up. One thing we really want to prioritize is reducing our alcohol consumption. I don't plan to go completely sober during the WTT/TTC phases (especially not knowing how long TTC will take!) but I want to drastically reduce my intake. Neither of us really drink on the weekdays, but our weekends are always jam-packed and always involving alcohol - going to breweries, sporting events/tailgates, meeting friends for drinks, etc.

Because we are so used to our weekend plans involving alcohol, we've been looking to expand our list of fun things to do that don't. I think this will be a good change for us so I've been eager and compiling a list of things we can do that don't center around bars/alcohol:

1. Joining the YMCA - we already have a gym membership, but we want to take up swimming. My husband also likes the opportunity for open gym basketball and other forms of exercise that are more fun.
2. Rock climbing
3. Training for a 5k/sprint triathlon 
4. Cooking/sushi making class
5. Bowling
6. Seeing a movie in the theater (extra points for picking one that serves dinner)
7. Working on our list of coffee shops and breakfast spots to try
8. Finding new bookstores
9. Planning day trips - there are a lot of small towns a short drive from us to explore, so checking out new shops and restaurants
10. Charcuterie board night
11. Pickleball
12. Couples massage
13. Hiking (once the weather improves, or finding cool winter hikes)
14. A-Z restaurant tour - you try new restaurants going from A to Z. Gets challenging for some letters!
15. Puzzle and mocktail night 

So my questions for you all- what is your plan for alcohol and WTT/TTC? What are your favorite weekend plans that DON'T involve alcohol? Looking for fun activities to add to the list. We'll also be cutting the alcohol on January 1 and live in Ohio, so bonus points for indoor ideas!

This might be a super common post but just in case there are new suggestions‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll be in TO in a few weeks from Friday-Sunday (flying out after supper Sunday). 

I am going to a concert Friday night and a hockey game Saturday night.

I‚Äôve already done the Riley‚Äôs aquarium, CN tower, Royal museum (which was awesome), the arcade place near CN tower. 

My hostel is near Kensington so I‚Äôll be going there already. And I‚Äôm planning on taking a walk to Queen‚Äôs Park. 

I‚Äôm looking for a few chill places to hangout. I don‚Äôt really want to go from one end of the city/back and forth too much as I‚Äôm not super familiar with the transit system (I can manage getting to a few places but last time I was looking for the entrance to union station I felt like fool because I couldn‚Äôt see it üòÇ, and I‚Äôm going to Vegas Sunday so don‚Äôt really want to have a tired back/legs from constant site-seeing).

Some thoughts - I like coffee/tea, plan to bring a current crochet project so if there are cute places that i could do that and/or read without looking COMPLETELY out of place it would be a bonus. 

Also - if there are any good restaurants downtown that are great for solos! I‚Äôll eat anything besides seafood/sushi. ",2,1727796868.0,askTO,0,1.0,False

So my (21f) husband (21m) and I live together and we both smoke. He likes glass pieces and a few months ago he bought a Rig that he‚Äôs been in love with for concentrate. Well since we‚Äôve owned that Rig, he‚Äôs been leaving it on corners of tables with half of it hanging off the corner nonstop. He never puts it in the middle of the table or behind something it‚Äôs always the corners, he‚Äôs broke his ‚Äúbanger‚Äù (the small piece you place the heated dab for those who don‚Äôt know) many times and I‚Äôve always let him get new ones, even if we were struggling with money. Well yesterday, he asked me to heat it for him and when I was finished, I was pushing stuff out of the way so I could put his torch down and some juice spilled. I panicked and stood up fast and that knocked the Rig to the ground and the banger broke. I poured water on it because it was catching fire and cleaned up the mess, but when he saw he got furious with me and was upset because ‚Äúhe got me food and everything tonight just to come home to that‚Äù. I was super upset with myself so I told him I was so sorry and that I‚Äôll get him a new one. So the next morning we go out to get him a banger and we end up getting him an ‚Äúash catcher‚Äù (a big attachment) as well. No big deal I guess, I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs happy again. When we got home I told him he needs to keep that rig in the center of the table or away from the corners especially now that it has an attachment that makes it twice its size. Well that same night i went to turn off the light and right next to our bed is a table that he put his rig on the corner of, and I got up and it fell on the floor and the attachment broke. He blew up and turned to the wall in our bed and I started crying because I again messed up. I cleaned it all up and apologized profusely and told him we will get another one for him and I was so sorry for breaking it. He went to bed and that was the first ever time in our 6 year relationship that he went to bed mad. This morning when we woke up he went to the bedroom while I got the kids ready and played a bunch of loud breakup music like we were in high school again. I let him be because I was getting the kids up and ready (two boys 3 and 1) and I went to check on him and he said nothing. Then after a while he comes out and says he‚Äôs mad that I didn‚Äôt go talk to him in the room. I was getting our kids up and changing diapers and getting them breakfast I‚Äôm sorry but was I supposed to wait to do all of that? So I tell him that I wasn‚Äôt able to leave them without taking care of them first, and that if he wanted to talk he could have came back out or helped me get them ready. I apologize again and start to tear up because again I broke his attachment and he says that it‚Äôs not about the attachment it‚Äôs about the fact that I can‚Äôt slow down, and that I‚Äôm always hurting myself around the house while he doesn‚Äôt. For context, we live in a trailer and there is almost no walkway space around anything except the living room, but even then our coffee table is quite large. As long as it‚Äôs pushed to the side, there‚Äôs plenty of space. So I tell him that I‚Äôm glad he can avoid it but I can‚Äôt, and I‚Äôve came to terms with not being able to go a day without stubbing my toe until we get a real house. Well he said that he doesn‚Äôt hurt himself on things because he knows how to slow down. I feel like I‚Äôm running all over the place constantly so I understand that, but it‚Äôs because I have to tend to EVERYTHING around me. The kids always need mommy, the feedings, the juice spilling, my job, and my husband especially. I don‚Äôt complain about it though and yes I do hurt myself walking through the house but I also try my hardest not to and to watch what I‚Äôm doing always. But I‚Äôm not the only one who bumps into his rig, he does too and then gets mad. But when I do it he will express that anger and tell me to be more careful. So now I‚Äôm lost, and sad, and I feel like I‚Äôm an AH because I can‚Äôt slow down? Idk guys, AITA? ",0,1727796745.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,8,0.5,False

Now it‚Äôs more like 38:10. Like manic, had no interest in food on my fasting days. Some black coffee, green tea and mineral water and I am happy. And to break my fast on the next day, I begin by planning my food for the day. This wakes up my appetite. 

I now understand the difference between a 24 hour versus 48 hour digestion/metabolize schedule. Yes, we are always digesting and always metabolizing. But on the 48 hour schedule we are spending a lot more energy metabolizing than we do on the 24 hour schedule. 

So when family was coming over for lunch on Sunday I agreed to eat on my off day.  Was not hungry but ate anyway and then got somewhat hungry and ate around 60% of a normal meal day. 

The next day fasting was blah. No energy.  Not the clearest either. 

Christmas, Thanksgiving, NewYears!!! Okay I get it. Not a problem. But weekends? No. 

I like the 48 hours. I think my body needs all of that time to eat, digest and metabolize properly. 

During this experience, I have done everything I could possibly do to make my wife happy and to conceal my unhappiness with eating that Sunday meal. 

Today, she told me that she could see that interrupting my alternate days was not going well for me. From that one Sunday, I learned from ADF. Stay true and give things time. ",4,1727796664.0,AlternateDayFasting,1,1.0,False

I found the perfect SD- generous, respectful, caring, attentive. We get along so well and I actually enjoy spending time with him and he genuinely enjoys taking care of me! We‚Äôve been together 2.5 months and it‚Äôs been great. 

I‚Äôve also been in a situationship with a guy my age since January and we finally admitted our feelings to each other and are seriously considering being in a relationship. 

I told him that if we start a relationship, then I‚Äôll end the sugar relationship because I don‚Äôt think it would be fair to him to have another person on the side. But I‚Äôm genuinely feeling really sad about having to let go of SD because I do like spending time with him and he‚Äôs been so supportive and encouraging while I‚Äôm going through really tricky work situations. I view him as a friend and mentor and it would be sad to let go. He‚Äôs also pretty old and is always saying how much joy I‚Äôve brought into his life and how he hasn‚Äôt felt this happy and alive in years

The other crazy part of this is that he‚Äôs currently in Jordan and promised to get me some gold jewelry and Arab perfumes. He‚Äôs coming back in three weeks but I‚Äôm planning to talk to my situationship more this weekend. I want to give him room to communicate his boundaries but I do want to present the option of either meeting with my SD every so often platonically just for coffee and catching up (ideal situation) or do I need to completely cut him off. I‚Äôm going to leave it up to my situationship to decide what makes him most comfortable in a real relationship. 

Either way, when my SD gets back from his trip, do I tell him that I‚Äôm ending things right away? Do I accept the gifts? Do I wait for him to decide what to do with the gifts? Do I meet with him once after the trip and then tell him the second time I see him? How do I navigate this?? Please help!!!

# Relationship Timeline and Breakup

I was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend from January to May. We took a break in June, and by July and August, we transitioned into an on-and-off Friends with Benefits (FwB) relationship. I agreed to the FwB arrangement only because I hoped it would give her time and space to process her emotions, and that we might eventually return to a serious, committed relationship.

However, by the end of August, I was emotionally drained from the uncertainty. I couldn‚Äôt focus at work, nor be mentally present in any other aspect of my life, as I was constantly thinking about the relationship. I realized that I couldn‚Äôt continue in such an undefined relationship without completely breaking down, and we decided to end things. Since the beginning of September, we‚Äôve been in a No Contact phase.

# The Intensity of the Emotional Pain

The emotional pain during the breakup was so intense that it often felt like a physical ache. I constantly felt tightness in my chest from the sadness and anxiety. It was overwhelming, and I struggled to focus on anything else. Fortunately, this physical sensation has now faded, and I don‚Äôt feel as distressed anymore. However, it took time to get to this point, and the process was extremely painful.

# The Power of No Contact

The No Contact phase has been absolutely pivotal for me. While I‚Äôve missed my ex tremendously, having this space has allowed me to truly process my emotions and begin healing. It‚Äôs been essential for my recovery and for coming to terms with the end of the relationship. Without this clear boundary, I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to move forward in the same way.

# Resources That Helped Me Heal

# Books

Two key books played a big role in my recovery. First, *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller helped me understand attachment styles and how my own fearful-avoidant attachment style affected the way I handled relationships and breakups. This book is practical, easy to read, and it gave me insights into why I reacted the way I did.

Second, I read *The Breakup Manual for Men* by Andrew Ferebee. This book provided a step-by-step guide for recovering from a serious breakup, and I followed many of its recommendations. One of the most powerful pieces of advice I took from the book was the question: ""Do I believe there are other women I could create a better connection with than my ex? If the answer is no, then you aren't ready."" This helped me recognize that I wasn‚Äôt viewing my ex or the relationship realistically.

# YouTube Videos

I also watched countless hours of YouTube videos, and I found channels like Coach Lee, Coach Ken, and Matthew Hussey particularly useful when dealing with the No Contact phase and breakup recovery in general.

# Therapy and ChatGPT

I‚Äôve had a few therapy sessions, but I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôve provided significant new insights or tools beyond what I‚Äôve gotten from talking to friends. The main benefit of therapy has been having an outside person to talk to about my emotions, so I don‚Äôt always have to lean on my friends. However, my therapist told me that I have good potential to develop secure attachment in future relationships, as I‚Äôm now aware of my attachment style and can empathize with both my own and my partner‚Äôs perspective.

Interestingly, I‚Äôve also relied heavily on ChatGPT as a therapeutic resource. It‚Äôs been surprisingly more helpful than my in-person therapy in terms of processing emotions and providing practical guidance. I found it invaluable for reflection and getting clearer on my feelings.

# Letting Myself Feel the Emotions

One of the most important things I‚Äôve done during this process is not suppressing my emotions. I cried every single day, often multiple times a day, from the end of August until last week. The sadness was constantly present, and it felt overwhelming. However, I allowed myself to cry whenever I needed to. I believe it‚Äôs crucial not to fight against the sadness and pain that come with a breakup. Letting those feelings out, even though it‚Äôs been incredibly painful, has been a key part of my healing.

# Staying Active with Friends and Hobbies

I‚Äôve kept myself active in various ways, which has been crucial in staying grounded. I go to the gym several times a week, spend time with friends doing things like going for coffee, riding motorcycles, hiking, and attending concerts. These activities have been a great way to stay connected to others and ease some of the emotional strain. On my own, I also take walks by the sea or in the forest. These walks, while often filled with thoughts about the relationship, have helped me process my feelings more deeply. Being in nature has provided a sense of calm and relief, even though I continue to think about the breakup during these moments.

# Healing Comes in Waves

One thing I‚Äôve realized throughout this process is that healing doesn‚Äôt happen all at once. Emotions come in waves, and the breakup requires me to reflect on the relationship from different perspectives over time. It takes time to address all aspects of the breakup, and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve learned to give myself time to understand and process everything.

# Where I Am Now

At the moment, I don‚Äôt feel like I miss my ex that much anymore. I think this is because I‚Äôve come to terms with the disappointment that she didn‚Äôt love me or care for me enough to want to work on our relationship. Instead, she was willing to downgrade our friendship and love into a Friends with Benefits situation. No offense to anyone who engages in FwB relationships, but I personally don‚Äôt have much respect for those anymore. I‚Äôve engaged in those kinds of relationships before, and my experience has led me to feel like there‚Äôs always a hint of exploitation‚Äîwhere one partner is good enough to satisfy sexual needs, but not for anything deeper. Moving forward, I want a relationship where we connect on an intellectual, emotional, and physical level. Sex is much better with someone you truly care about and with whom you want to build a lasting relationship.

Right now, I don‚Äôt feel ready to meet anyone new. I still feel like I would compare other women to my ex, and they would seem so much less interesting in comparison. I know this isn‚Äôt realistic and that these feelings are part of the grieving process I‚Äôm still going through. I‚Äôm sure this will change in time, and eventually, I‚Äôll start to feel interested in other people, but that time isn‚Äôt now.

At the moment, my main emotion is disappointment‚Äînot just that the relationship didn‚Äôt succeed, but also that my ex-girlfriend didn‚Äôt love me as much as I loved her, enough to work on the relationship. That disappointment is what I‚Äôm living with most strongly at the moment, but I‚Äôm hopeful that in time, I‚Äôll fully move on.

# Conclusion

The healing process hasn‚Äôt been easy, but looking back at the steps I‚Äôve taken‚ÄîNo Contact, allowing myself to feel emotions, staying active, and using resources like books, YouTube, and ChatGPT‚Äîit has been key to getting to where I am now. I‚Äôve learned to give myself time and recognize that healing comes in waves. I‚Äôm not fully healed yet, but I‚Äôm proud of the progress I‚Äôve made and hope that sharing this can help others going through a similar experience.",3,1727796345.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve also been in a situationship with a guy my age since January and we finally admitted our feelings to each other and are seriously considering being in a relationship. 

I told him that if we start a relationship, then I‚Äôll end the sugar relationship because I don‚Äôt think it would be fair to him to have another person on the side. But I‚Äôm genuinely feeling really sad about having to let go of SD because I do like spending time with him and he‚Äôs been so supportive and encouraging while I‚Äôm going through really tricky work situations. I view him as a friend and mentor and it would be sad to let go. He‚Äôs also pretty old and is always saying how much joy I‚Äôve brought into his life and how he hasn‚Äôt felt this happy and alive in years

The other crazy part of this is that he‚Äôs currently in Jordan and promised to get me some gold jewelry and Arab perfumes. He‚Äôs coming back in three weeks but I‚Äôm planning to talk to my situationship more this weekend. I want to give him room to communicate his boundaries but I do want to present the option of either meeting with my SD every so often platonically just for coffee and catching up (ideal situation) or do I need to completely cut him off. I‚Äôm going to leave it up to my situationship to decide what makes him most comfortable in a real relationship. 

Either way, when my SD gets back from his trip, do I tell him that I‚Äôm ending things right away? Do I accept the gifts? Do I wait for him to decide what to do with the gifts? Do I meet with him once after the trip and then tell him the second time I see him? How do I navigate this?? Please help!!!

My partner and I have been in a relationship for a year. In that time, I‚Äôve visited him once and he‚Äôs come here four times. Each time he stays between two and three weeks. I know I am very lucky that we can see each other so often. 

The issue is that I‚Äôm in debt. My partner spends all his money on plane tickets and doesn‚Äôt have much when he‚Äôs here. So that I means I end up covering all the dates. We split groceries 50/50 but usually he‚Äôs buying more items and spending more of that money (he is addicted to soda and processed snacks whereas I try to balance frugality and health).

We went for a mini break for a couple days and was meant to split the hotel evenly. However when I brought up that I would like the money he owes me so I can pay my debt, he plays it off like he already paid me back via train tickets or a single coffee. I make more money (I have an office job, he‚Äôs self employed mainly living off government assistance) and I know that that means I can contribute more but I can be paying for both of us so often. 

I don‚Äôt know how to bring up that it‚Äôs such a big issue for me without it turning into a full-blown argument. We seem to fight a lot lately over his attitude and inability to clean up after himself in a timely manner.

Was it the seed oils?,"Hello, I‚Äôm kinda new to this and just started reading into seed oils and all. So for the longest time I was trying to pinpoint what I was eating / drinking everyday to cause my breakouts . Never even thought about my coffee choices maybe affecting my skin until now . So I have been drinking oat milk, dairy free creamers like silk, oatly , planet oat etc. I used to drink coffee at starbucks with 1-2 pumps of mocha in it as well ( my skin was fine during that time unless i got sugar free vanilla or any really sweet flavor ) I was doing a food/ skin diary during that time . 

Anyways i stopped going to Starbucks a long time ago and started making coffee at home with the non dairy creamers . I was having consistent breakouts on my neck and jawline for months almost like cystic deep bumps all over my neck . Then I went on vacation out of the country and couldn‚Äôt find any non dairy options and didnt want to be difficult lol . So I drank coffee with regular cream and half a sugar packet each day . I came back and the cystic bumps were fading . I noticed this and decided to try regular cream longer . I also looked at the creamers I was using and they all have seed oils or processed ingredients compared to the 4 ingredient natural milk creamer . Bumps on my neck are basically non existent now. No new breakouts. 

sorry for such a long rant and if this sounds stupid, but would it be the seed oils or the oat milk itself that was causing this ? Is there tests that can see if allergic to seed oils ? I also heard seed oils can affect hormones ? ",2,1727795878.0,StopEatingSeedOils,3,1.0,False

It started of super quiet and only on one ear
No idea what started it 

I had my first concert a couple of months prior but idk if that's the reason.

It's been consistent for the first 6 months and since then it gets worse every 2 months I think...
I avoid loud noises, I wear ear protection whenever it gets louder or at a concert (which I haven't before but whenever it gets worse now it's for no reason)

And I cut off alcohol, I still drink coffee but I tried cutting it and noticed no difference, so I'm still drinking my beloved coffee lol.


Tried cutting dairy and just eating healthy overall but it didn't help either.


Now i don't know why it gets worse constantly, I have a spike for around two weeks now and it's so incredibly bad like never before...
Idk what to do I feel so incredibly helpless and frustrated.

Why does it get worse constantly??

If this spike doesn't go away again idk what to do, I've already had trouble sleeping, I do got around 10 years no but no doctor found the root.

And since I got my tinnitus it got obviously worse it got REALLY bad at every spike ( rarely it did got better again tho) where I woke up several times a night with panic attacks.

And this is the case again rn.. it got worse two weeks ago and I think even worse one week ago, because for like a week I'm having these panic attacks again and i feel like if this spike doesn't settle the only solution would be death.


No doctor will prescribe me smth to sleep, I only take Baldrian pills cus I don't have anything else.

I just wanna be able to sleep again without hearing this...

I listen to audiobooks but I'm someone who need full silence to sleep.. so this troubles me a little aswell, but it's still better than nothing.

Pls can anyone tell me why it just constantly seems to get worse?? I'm only in my late twenties, and at this rate I don't see myself hitting 30.

I wasn't sure if I should hit venting or adobe support cus I'm the end it's both. I just don't know what to do anymore :(",4,1727795711.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

1. Since the population of the whole country is 380,000, it was nice to be at a Costco that's not crowded.
2. If you're road tripping in Iceland, this is the place to get snacks and gas since its the cheapest option.
3. For the most part the layout is the same as any other Costco.
4. Saw some neat stuff I've never seen back in the States. Starlink satellites, Boxes of Dunkin Donuts dozens, Lego sets, lamb in bulk and KIRKLAND SUSHI!.
5. There was an attendant scanning everyone's ID. Funny enough, he didn't scan mine. I used my Costco Visa Card to get in. Not sure why I was the exception.
6. They do have an alcohol section but it is walled off. Only people with a valid restaurant license can buy alcohol at Costco.
7. Food court is the biggest difference. When I was there, the menu was: coffee, froyo, Kirkland gelato, hot dog, Mexican Bake (No chicken bake), Pizza (Also had BBQ chicken pizza as an option). Cheapest place to get lunch in Iceland too FYI.

Oreo milkshake (not pictured, tried before) 4/10 - I personally just hate this one, it‚Äôs not Oreo to me. The only thing I like is the base because of the big Oreo chunks, but overall it just tastes like sugar with the frosting. 

Oatmeal chocolate chip ü•£ 7/10 - simple cookie but that doesn‚Äôt make it bad! In fact, it‚Äôs very homey, if that makes sense. Like a fall morning at home, a cup of coffee and a bowl of oats‚Ä¶ with chocolate! It has a nice blend of spices, good texture with the oats and I actually like the milk chocolate chunks even though I bet semi sweet would be better. 

Ultimate peanut butter ü•ú 8/10 - simple cookie, but I loooove peanut butter so this is getting a higher rating. I slathered a layer of peanut butter on mine (and most of the customer‚Äôs cookies hehe) because I can‚Äôt have enough peanut butter. It does fall apart easily though which is annoying

Pumpkin cake üéÉ 7.9/10 - ohhhh I love these cakey pumpkin cookies soooo much!!!! It‚Äôs not as good as the caramel pumpkin cake, but I love the crunch of mini chocolate chips. I don‚Äôt have much to say about this one!

It helped perfectly until I began experiencing withdrawal symptoms out of the blue. I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was making emergency room visits for high blood pressure, tremors and no sleep. My Psyche diagnosed it as Xanax withdrawal and she was correct, however, I was not able to safely taper off from home and had to spend 11 days in a medical detox facility. I am now 6 weeks post facility stay - and can only sleep with a sleeping pill. I would love to hear a success story from anyone whose natural sleep has been restored. Right now i am very down, as i feel i have traded one dependence to another. If i take a sleeping pill, but do not sleep, the affect is pretty horrible and no amount of coffee helps.

From the back deck, we listen as the birds begin their song, a distant rooster crows, and the cicadas hum their tune. The morning air is cool, but the warmth of your coffee rises in delicate swirls. I cradle my hot chocolate, feeling its comforting heat seep into my hands.

Sitting beside me, my husband gently places a hand on my thigh, his gaze soft as it meets mine. ""Are you warm enough?"" he asks, his voice tender, laced with quiet concern. I smile, reassured by the thoughtfulness that always seems to accompany his every word and action.

""I'm quite warm,"" I reply, the corners of my lips curling as I lean in to press a kiss to his cheek. His hand moves gently, brushing a loose strand of hair from my face, and in that simple gesture, I feel utterly cherished.

""Good,"" he says, his eyes lingering on mine for just a moment longer, before he turns back to the peaceful morning.

""Will we have time to ride today?"" I ask, the thought of our shared love for the outdoors stirs much excitement within me.

""I'll make time for you,"" he says, his voice a quiet promise.

In that moment, beneath the wide expanse of sky and the hum of life around us, I feel deeply seen and loved.

As I grow as a person my desires in life become less complicated. I desire simplicity. I desire a man who knows what he wants and who has more traditional values. Simplicity doesn‚Äôt mean low value or low quality to me. I'll choose the higher quality option, so it lasts longer and retains its value. 

I desire a man who values my peace, who wants children, and who will love my children as his own. I prefer a man who thinks about legacy. I desire a man who likes being a man. 
He should be 35 or older.


I‚Äôm petite. I love being a woman. I have more conservative values. Find out the rest.

We had a toxic relationship and it ended with me being unfaithful. I feel awful about it and will forever hold that guilt in my heart. We used to live in my small apartment and had planned to move to a nicer place right before it ended. After we broke up, he moved to the new apartment while I stayed in mine, we still talked here and there but he never wanted to get back together with me. A year after we broke up I met this amazing guy (28M) that was very different from anyone I had ever met in my life. He was a true gentle man, always opened the car door for me, made sure I was safe in any situation, brought me coffee unexpectedly and during my period bought me a heating pad and made sure I was always ok. We had instant chemistry and he was giving all green flags. There was a couple of small problems however, he had gotten cheated on by his ex of 6 years and I was also still in contact with my ex. We tried to still make it work even with his hesitancy, but I needed to stop talking to my ex. Before we were official I had already plans to go on a skii trip with a group of people and my ex. I had told the new guy about it and he wasn't happy with it but we were not official and could not tell me to not go. When I went on the skii trip it got complicated because now my ex wanted to get back together and told me I was only there because this was his attempt at us rekindling things. I told my ex I was seeing someone new and that I wanted to see it through but things just kept getting complicated. I was sleeping in the same room as my ex and did not tell the new guy. Nothing happened but when my ex threatened to tell the new guy that we were sleeping in the same bed, I decided to tell him instead. We were able to get through this but trust was definitely becoming an issue. Eventually he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed. 

A couple of months later, my now boyfriend and I went on a trip. We had some issues before the trip that had us both on edge. I confided in one of my guy friends who had asked me how the trip was going and I was brutally honest about it and didnt say very nice things. Apparently, I got really drunk during the trip and said some things that prompted my boyfriend to look through my phone while I was asleep and he found the conversation. He did not say anything during the trip, just was really mean and distant. It wasn't until a week later after we got back that he woke me up in the middle of the night and confronted me about it. Saying It was emotional cheating. We still decided to move forward and work on our trust after this.

A couple months later, I had been talking to my ex, nothing sexual just checking how he was. Obviously after 7 years it is hard to let go of someone that was you whole world and I clearly had this issue of not letting go. My boyfriend sensed that something was off and this prompted him to look through my phone again and find deleted messages of conversations I had with my ex. I had no idea they were even still on my phone and I was furious but I was clearly at fault. By now he has no trust in me and things Im an emotional cheater through and through. 

I have been going through therapy and trying to work on gaining his trust back, but obviously it is a lot harder than I thought it would be. I quit drinking, Ive been going to the gym regularly, I have a second job and am in the process of moving so cheating is the last thing on my mind. My ex has been blocked on everything and I haven't had any contact with him.

Now to the actual question I have. My friend invited me to her wedding. Ive known the groom since I was 16 years old and I met his fianc√© when they first started dating. Her and I clicked immediately and have been friends for over 5 years. Their wedding had been in the works for 2 years now. Unfortunately, my ex is also friends with the groom and will be attending the wedding. My now boyfriend does not want me to attend because he does not feel comfortable with me drinking at a wedding with my ex there. I really want to go because I care about my friends and this is the first wedding Ive ever been invited to just me. I know I wouldn't do anything with my ex and would avoid conversations at all cost. 

I want to get some external advise on whether I should go or not and if I should, how I can approach the situation to reassure him nothing would happen between us and that this event is important to me. 

BTW we have only been dating for 7 months now.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Celso, Job-deficient Yotul***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 22nd, 2136*

Waking up was typically far less exciting. Also, I didn‚Äôt expect to be jumping out of a window today.

I opened my eyes to the sound of someone knocking on my door. I rolled myself upright and yawned, stretching my aching legs.

The knocking didn‚Äôt come again, and for a moment I thought that would be that. Instead, a familiar loud creaking emanated from the door.

I rushed over to answer it for it to instead burst open, revealing a familiar old, shaggy Venlil in all his grumpy glory. The ends of his dark gray ears were several shades lighter than the rest of him. I did not envy his age. ‚ÄúGah, old door!‚Äù he grumbled, apparently not noticing me.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I started. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting visitors.‚Äù

‚ÄúWah!‚Äù My landlord focused one of his crusty eyes on me. Probably his good one. ‚ÄúYou! You‚Äôre supposed to be gone!‚Äù

I nervously laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, funny story, I wanted to check when I was supposed to be out, but my holopad had a very unfortunate accident and the screen cracked, so‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem! You get out! Out!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be a squatter! Just give me a few minutes to gather my things and I‚Äôll be out of your fur.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no! I‚Äôm not letting this start! I gave you a more-than-lawful twelve paws notice, and you‚Äôre still here!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a rough herd of paws. Can you give me a *little* slack? A quarter claw is all I need.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last person I gave a quarter claw to ended up living in my walls for‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how long! I‚Äôm not getting burned again!‚Äù

‚ÄúI only need‚Äî‚Äù My voice faltered as I realized what he said. I couldn‚Äôt help but twist my ears in confusion. ‚ÄúWas it a Dossur?‚Äù

He squinted angrily. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs besides the point!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I have no intention of living in your walls!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs besides the point, too! This is my first and last time ever taking a Yotul into these apartments! You primitives have no respect for modern housing practice!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou call this place modern housing?‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt have said that, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself.

He glared at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the exterminators.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, okay! An *eighth* of a claw! That‚Äôs all I need!‚Äù

‚ÄúEight is bigger than four!‚Äù he said after a painfully wrong mental calculation. Before I could correct him, he pulled out his holopad and after a mere two taps it started ringing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on the line now.‚Äù

I stared wide-eyed. ‚ÄúDo you have them on speed dial?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I do! You think you‚Äôre the first person to try and skirt an eviction around this place?‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven your attitude, that doesn‚Äôt surprise me. And I‚Äôm not trying to skirt around it!‚Äù

His glare persisted a while longer before it suddenly vanished. His whole expression lit up and he spoke into the holopad, ‚ÄúYes, hello, I have‚Äî Yes, it‚Äôs me again‚Äî Yes, I‚Äî No, it‚Äôs not about the Dossur!‚Äù

Realizing I had mere minutes before I was escorted out, or worse, *detained*, I whirled around.

I rushed into my sleeping room to grab my satchel. It was proudly made on Leirn out of fine textile, designed to carry a scholar‚Äôs many books for a lifetime, and had been prematurely passed down a generation. Now, it bore the high honor of carrying whatever I could cram into it.

I grabbed a few loose pieces of paper which had some of my notes about possible jobs and places to live (all of which were even worse than *this* place, somehow) scribbled on them, along with my favorite pens (I only had two pens, but they were definitely my favorites). I grabbed a few loose things which were better off kept, and almost made my way out of the room without grabbing one of my most prized possessions.

It was sitting isolated in the corner wrapped in its protective film. With measured movements, I carefully folded up the decades old paper and slid it gently into my satchel. To think I‚Äôd almost left without it.

With it safely and securely tucked away, I thought about what would be most useful to have if I had to take a nap on a park bench or under a bridge. A pillow didn‚Äôt easily fit into my satchel. The next best option was food.

I grabbed my fruit with old eyes still glaring at me before I eventually got to my holopad. I accidentally nudged a button in my hurry, and the larger monitor came to life. A small notification caught my eye. It was an email.

I had no faith it was good news but something compelled me to check it regardless. I scrambled for the external keyboard and smacked a few keys. It was from Doctor Scheele.

>Hello Celso,

>I enjoyed our conversation yesterday, however brief it was. I believe you‚Äôre well qualified for the position, and I‚Äôd like to have another talk with you about possible projects that you might be able to undertake. It would help me determine if you‚Äôd be a good fit here.

>If you wish to proceed, I‚Äôd like to meet at your earliest convenience. My working hours are between‚Ä¶

My reading was interrupted by the gravelly voice of my landlord. ‚ÄúFinally you‚Äôre here! He‚Äôs just inside.‚Äù

I ripped the cord out of my holopad and stuffed it inside my satchel along with my external keyboard. As much as I wanted to take my prized dumpster monitor, I had to leave it along with the rest of my belongings. A quick glance at the door told me I was out of time.

The blue feathers and pointy yellow beak of a Krakotl had emerged, ruffled and ready for a round of forcing a Yotul into compliance.

‚ÄúAre you the former tenant?‚Äù she asked, the scraggly old Venlil hiding behind her.

‚ÄúNot even going to give me a ‚Äòhello‚Äô?‚Äù I responded, buckling my satchel.

‚ÄúHello. Please come with us peacefully,‚Äù she demanded.

I picked my fruit up off the floor. ‚ÄúUh, look, I‚Äôd love to, but I‚Äôve got a‚Ä¶ thing‚Ä¶ later. No hard feelings?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ What?‚Äù

My eyes darted left and right, and landed on my zifla. My poor withered zifla, right next to the single window. ‚ÄúSay, I don‚Äôt suppose there‚Äôs any chance you‚Äôll just let me go freely?‚Äù

The Krakotl crept further inside. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just have to answer a few questions. Based on that, we may have to screen you for predator disease.‚Äù

I winced. ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an unfortunate trend that those who try to dodge an eviction tend to have underlying issues for why they‚Äôre evicted in the first place.‚Äù

Behind her, I spotted a decidedly chunky Gojid, which doubly affirmed my judgment that I wasn‚Äôt making it out through the door. Again my eyes landed on the window. For once, I was thankful that I couldn't afford a proper apartment with a balcony. My half-buried abode would finally serve me well.

I was sad to leave my monitor and everything else that I‚Äôd paid so much for, but I wasn‚Äôt risking a predator disease screening. With a burst of speed I yanked its stool out from underneath causing it to clatter to the floor, and I slid the stool against the wall. I jumped onto it and reached high for the window.

The thing was almost as stubborn as my door (and my former landlord, for that matter). Behind me, the bird squawked, ‚ÄúStop what you‚Äôre doing!‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, you seem like a nice lady, but I‚Äôm not really looking for something serious right now!‚Äù Finally the window gave, and I threw my satchel through it, then my fruit.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare!‚Äù the Gojid rumbled.

I used all my might to leap upwards and grab onto the edges of the window, trying to pull myself through the deceptively slim opening. ‚ÄúYou also seem nice, but a group of three isn‚Äôt really something I see myself‚Äî‚Äù

I yelped as something grabbed onto my leg. I tugged with some success, but it was soon accompanied by a second, more feathery something. My poor zifla got knocked off the sill and fell to the floor with the sound of shattered ceramic. I had one option left. I flexed my muscles.

An ear-cracking *SQUAWK* pierced the air and I was freed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù I called out as I shimmied the rest of myself through the window. ‚ÄúI *really* didn‚Äôt mean to do that! I have this leg condition, and it‚Äî Well, it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but I‚Äôm sorry, and I hope you two can find the right person to complete your triangle!‚Äù

A tiny, guilty part of me was not sorry in the slightest. I heard the Gojid shouting from the window, but I was already off. I was saddened to leave my zifla behind. It was yet another irreplaceable item in my life that had been taken from me too suddenly. They would understand. Yuili would understand. I‚Äôd just have to find the courage to tell her‚Ä¶

*At your earliest convenience*, the email said. I bit into my fruit and dashed in the direction I‚Äôd come home last paw.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 22nd, 2136*

I arrived at work a little later than I usually did. I usually had Bemlin to keep me on time, but he left early so we couldn‚Äôt walk together. One thing that wasn‚Äôt unusual was the endless emails I had to respond to or archive.

I tinkered with the Gojid genome assembly for a while. The UN had made some file conversion software publicly available, but I couldn‚Äôt figure it out for the life of me, and was beginning to doubt if it even worked. How hard could it be to convert a few billion letters from one file format to another? I didn‚Äôt even need the annotations.

To make matters worse, the dumb KeiVei-Lay software was incredibly stubborn. The name of the Kolshian brand was apparently a play on words that, very loosely, translated to something like ‚ÄúEZ-Gene‚Äù. Though apparently less cute sounding and more stern in the native language.

By both the translation and the fact that it was hundreds of years old, a sane person could‚Äôve reasoned all that time would‚Äôve allowed for easy-to-use and intuitive features. The Federation was not sane, unfortunately.

I took a break (gave up) trying to get the exact sequence into a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù file on my own computer, which put me at about an hour or two of work. An hour or two of work before I succumbed to temptation.

Currently, my screen showed me an enticing image. Stainless steel. Minimalist design. Top-notch instrumentation and diagnostics. It could get me results in a matter of minutes.

I was no stranger to extracting chemicals, but this device made things so much simpler. Through a controlled process of temperature, pressure, and filtration, I could achieve solvation of various aromatic compounds. The mechanisms and sensors within ensured said compounds would be extracted swiftly and without burning them.

The filters it used were dirt-cheap, though I imagined shipping from Earth would tack on an extra few bucks. I could find sucrose or some artificial alternatives on this planet easy enough. Lactose, however, might be a bit trickier; I‚Äôd have to pay shipping for that, too.

But it would be more than worth it. I‚Äôd gone far too long without one on this morningless planet. I did some quick math in my head and concluded that this was the correct choice going forward. An early Christmas gift to myself.

*Would Bemlin like coffee? I wonder what alien caffeine tolerance is like. I‚Äôm pretty sure adenosine receptors are ubiquitous, though I should double check some toxicology databases. In that case, I wonder if theobromine is toxic‚Ä¶*

I made a mental note to order some chocolate later and placed the order. Four-to-five business days was pretty quick, considering everything.

A rap on my office door shook me from my early-morning delirium. Bemlin invited himself in, and I sensed a habit forming.

‚ÄúHey. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù I greeted.

‚ÄúI am doing well. Would you like to see something?‚Äù

‚ÄúIntriguing. Before I get up, would *you* like to see something?‚Äù I gestured to my screen.

He squinted, possibly annoyed at my switcheroo. ‚ÄúI may as well‚Ä¶ What is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúA coffee machine. Though not a business expense, unfortunately.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is its purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt makes coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is unhelpful.‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúIt takes mental stimulants out of a plant and puts it into a beverage for me to enjoy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, I see. I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôm not sure what I expected of human drug intake methods.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call it‚Äî‚Äù I started, before realizing that he was exactly right. ‚ÄúOkay, it *is* a drug. But a fun drug. Er, not a *fun* drug, more of a normal drug. Er, that‚Äôs not a very good word either. Uh‚Ä¶ I dunno. It makes me marginally more alert.‚Äù

The Gojid blinked.

‚ÄúYou wanna try some?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou seem like a black coffee kind of guy, Bemlin.‚Äù

‚ÄúI assume that is a compliment. I would be willing to sample it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Five business days, whenever that is. Anyways, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Bemlin gave me a pointed look. ‚ÄúI wanted to show you something.‚Äù

I stood. ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

I was glad to be out of my office. I grabbed my holopad and followed him into the work room. He pointed at something on the screen.

‚ÄúI found this.‚Äù He was pointing at a useless jumble of alien symbols by what I assumed was a noteworthy DNA sequence.

‚ÄúOkay. Is‚Ä¶ Is that the actual letter sequence on KeiVei-Lay? How did you get that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot quite the same software, but it was surprisingly stubborn. It would not give me access directly, I had to import the file and open it as two separate file types before putting it into a text document. From there I have made manual annotations.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that pain, I‚Äôm dealing with‚Äî Wait, you opened up the *entire genome* on a text document?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. ‚ÄúMore power to you, I suppose. I didn‚Äôt take you for a computer savvy guy. Is it‚Ä¶ workable?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorkable enough. Have a look.‚Äù

I looked at his other monitor, where he highlighted an empty region on the genome assembly. ‚ÄúIs it worth translating the text?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs just some notes. This region on the genome is, with some room for doubt, a gene. But it doesn‚Äôt exist in any assemblies I‚Äôve looked at.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you find it, then?‚Äù

His eyes lit up, something I rarely saw from him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you asked! I searched for the consensus promoter sequence, and picked the first one that was not marked in the assembly. Then I checked that it was followed by a start codon and a stop codon later,‚Äù he proudly summarized.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should‚Äôve been impressed or not. His process seemed fairly standard to me, but he acted like this was a novel feat. What did the Federation typically include in their curriculum for this sort of stuff? Regardless, I found it easy to match Bemlin‚Äôs burst of energy. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great! How do you know it‚Äôs an actual gene?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe start and stop codons are separated by the average length of a gene, give or take a few thousand base pairs.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúAny plans to sort out the introns?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to work out next.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long did this take you?‚Äù

He checked the time. ‚ÄúAbout‚Ä¶ uh, half a claw? I believe that‚Äôs correct. And some initial digging around in the text document last paw.‚Äù

*Two hours?* ‚ÄúFor this one gene?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù he proudly stated. ‚ÄúAlthough I admit that most of that time was trying to find a promoter that wasn‚Äôt already marked. I‚Äôd begun to worry that I was doing this for nothing.‚Äù

I winced, knowing how painful it must have been to *manually* search through thousands of genes. I could‚Äôve asked an AI to do the same thing for most, if not all hidden genes, and return it in a neatly ordered list in half that time. Though I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would like the Gojid genetic code. If I could even manage to convert the files.

‚ÄúAlright. This is great work and I love it, but I think I could do this much quicker with one of my methods. Er, eventually.‚Äù

He tapped his claws in a frown. ‚ÄúDoes it involve this coveted human AI that I‚Äôve heard so much about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. I‚Äôm telling you, Bemlin, come to the dark side.‚Äù

He took on a puzzled expression. ‚ÄúOf‚Ä¶ Venlil Prime?‚Äù

I shook my head, smiling. ‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù

Just then, my holopad buzzed with a call. It was from reception. I answered on speaker, ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

*‚ÄúGood paw, Doctor Scheele. I have a, uhm, Yotul here who wants to see you.‚Äù*

Bemlin looked just as surprised as I was. I replied, ‚ÄúIs it Celso?‚Äù

A brief pause. *‚ÄúYes. Would you like me to send him away?‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat? No! Send him to my office. Why‚Äôs he here?‚Äù

*‚ÄúHe says‚Äî‚Äù*

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. Just send him up.‚Äù I ended the call.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre moving forward with him?‚Äù Bemlin asked.

I recalled the email I sent to the Yotul. A few minutes of talking didn‚Äôt exactly constitute a job position, and I wanted to better feel for him. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it so soon, however. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know. Probably.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you weren‚Äôt expecting him here?‚Äù

I checked my email, confirming I‚Äôd heard nothing from Celso. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a good reason.‚Äù I got up from my seat.

As I made my way out, Bemlin said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs good you‚Äôre taking him in. He could learn a lot from you.‚Äù

I frowned, wondering what he meant by that. ‚ÄúThanks, Bemlin. Oh, and if you do get the introns sorted out, let me know! I‚Äôve got a trick that‚Äôs gonna blow your mind.‚Äù

I'm trying to make sense of my test-results and according to what i'm reading on here and elsewhere the many heterozygous SNPs point to problems with methylation?

My sister is a neurologist and she knows a lot about genetics in general but i have the impression that she overestimates her knowledge in this exact area. I asked her to  take a look at my methylation-panel but in her opinion everything is perfectly fine.

About me:  
I'm struggling with life long mental problems (ADHD, Stress, Depression, Anxiety) and have been trying to tackle potential route-causes lately. Obviously there are many factors in mental-health (i recently found out about dysbiosis of my microbiome and am working on that as my current main priority) but certain experiences with supplements lead me to think that something with methylation is causing problems and should be adressed:

* B-Vitamin-Complex supplements reliably caused anxiety/stress/depression for me.
* A juice with added folate and B12 (i don't know in what form) recently did the same.
* 5-MTHF was terrible as well as Choline and TMG
* Coffee and stimulants make me super anxious

Does this point to me being an overmethylator?

My current approach is to follow the guidelines pointed out here:

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana.

Did Zeus say OR me? So he pretty much knows Athena has a better shot at convincing 5 other completely different gods then ONLY himself? 

And Athena takes the challenge of 5 gods over Zeus alone without even answering because its just a known thing. 

  
I get Zeus is hard to convince being once he makes a decision as king of the gods that decision is pretty much  final. But.. Im missing exactly why Ody was being ""punished"" by Zeus with being trapped by Calypso. I thought his punishment was actually the choice of his life or the crew. Not to mention Ody tried to save the cows and at since this was after mutiny, technically he was no longer the ""captain"". 

  
AND....Zeus acknowledges ""King of Ithaca"" so he knows as king his life is considered more important and the a king must live with the choices he makes, including the death of his subjects.

1ftpsjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ftpsjl/is_this_connection_worth_pursuing/,Is this connection worth pursuing?,"Hi ActualLesbians,

I met this amazing girl on my travels and we clicked almost instantly. She has everything a lot that I'm looking for: She's beautiful, smart, really, really sweet and she wants kids. Though I'm not necessarily looking for my ""forever"" person right now, she comes pretty damn close to what I'm looking for on paper.

We met the first time on a Sunday night and had a great time, the next day we met was a Monday evening where we spent time getting dinner and chatting. I can tell she's been through a lot, has a lot of pain and damage, but I remember feeling like she was someone I could really trust when I told her I was feeling cold and she rubbed my legs to make sure I was warm. It was really, really cute. I did notice that her ex came up in conversations a little bit more than I've experienced on other dates, which made me feel a little uneasy. We ended up spending that night together (no sex), cuddling and holding hands. She's not the biggest kisser (which tbh, is something that does stick out for me because I really love kissing), but there was a lot of loving, caring touch. We were having a hard time falling asleep and her ex called her at 4am, apparently she had told her ex about how good our date was after our date the previous night, which left me wondering and a little skeptical as to why her ex would need to know this information at all. And the fact that this woman was calling at 4am and she was affected by it also made me feel like she needs to just cut this woman out of her life forever.

Two days later, we were supposed to meet for coffee but her ex showed up unannounced at her house before we were scheduled to meet. Pretty manipulative of her ex, tbh, but I also was just really confused and hurt by this. Of course, I felt bad for her, but it was confusing to me as the outside person to really grasp what was going on in their dynamic. I feel like maybe they weren't as ""over"" as I thought, although she explicitly has told me they are but idk something about their dynamic just isn't sitting right with me. It could also be a classic abusive relationship?

There are things about her that I don't love too much: She's pretty emotionally avoidant, smokes a ton of cigarettes, isn't out to her parents (they've actively been trying to get her to marry a man), detaches quite often emotionally when conversation becomes to ""intense"" (which I think her threshold for is a little low because of the built up trauma, etc). And idk I'm just so torn. We've only known each other three weeks, but I really feel a strong connection to her in a lot of ways. I just really, really can't cope with another heartbreak like this. I asked her to talk about things over the phone regarding where we are (we'd also be doing long-distance from Asia to the USA), and she was like ""Is this going to be a heavy conversation?"" which is making me think I'm way TOO invested 3 weeks in and she's like... ""What does this girl even wanna talk about?""

Anyways, I'm not sure what to do. I do want to have a conversation with her about all of my feelings about why I'm skeptical to continue flirting and that maybe it's best we just be ""friends."" But do you think I'm giving up too soon?",0,1727793782.0,actuallesbians,1,0.5,False

1ftpp56,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ftpp56/immature_roommate_and_threats_of_violence/,Immature roommate and threats of violence,"I live in a house with people and we've had dishes issues for a while in Ontario and its been addressed but nothings changed. So I spoke up and here's what happened:

1. One time someone left a dirty bowl and I said ""also can we agree on our dishes. Like someones not even rinsing come on"" My housemate took a photo and sent it to the group chat and said ""Is this all you're talking about. I think whoever left it there was rinsing it and then he added he whoever did it and kicks my teeth in and I bite their fingers and said he believes violence is the best way to resolve tension with roommates....over dishes
2. Another time the sink was full and I took a photo of to the group chat and said ""come on guys"". I had a tray in there but most of it wasn't mine which the guy brought up. Another roommate said I stand to reason and we both agreed to clean it up and wash some parts as I'll do the utensils. Then the other housemate said I won't find housemates as chill as this and was sure another housemate would have beaten me up by now before saying in all seriousness, he's surprised no one's suggested violence.
3. Another time after people brought up the dirty counter, I said ""also can we agree on our dishes"". Then the other housemate tagged another housemate in a comment saying a ""fight is loving"" when I asked about dishes
4. People kept leaving food in the sink and I texted ""can people stop leaving food in the sink? we have a trash for a reason"" and he pointed out i've left nugget crumbs/flower or put cardboard in the plastic bin and said my comment was condescending. I admitted that was my bad and i'll be better and he said this after our convo that he said seriously recommends violence with my housemates cuz he's ""worried"" I'll say the wrong thing to the wrong person and when I said his comments make me uncomfortable and he was also being condescending himself, his response was ""Fair enough. Just a suggestion in case your comments might drive someone over the edge""

After this another housemate talked to him and told him his language is problematic and he needs to take what he says seriously as it doesn't sound like a joke.

1. Claims we could have used his coffee maker but he doesn't value any of our lives worth more than a bill and if we break it, we'll have problems
2. And this was his ""apology"":""I'm sorry if I made you feel like someone was going to fight you. I was just highlighting that your comments provoke.""
3. Recently he got upset as ketchup was put on his shelf and it spilled and he said not to do it. My brother recently moved in and did not know about the ruling and put ketchup there and he found out and was like "" F\*ck me with me one more time"" and said he was on the edge and just asking for respect. I explained why it happened and he said its understandable but he is still on the edge regardless. Keep in mind he previously recommended violence in case my comments about dishes ""drove someone over the edge""\*

These made me uncomfy so I screenshoted and his comments and made a seperate group chat with the other 3 housemates and told them I believe we should tell the landlord we want him to leave.

And before someone says I'm to blame and while I could have been nicer/better, those don't warrant threats as I have 3 other housemates and not one of them has threatened violence.

Further he's done the following condescending and passive aggressive texts and no one has threatened him::

1. He had mushrooms in the fridge and one time someone put one bag of milk on top of them. He got annoyed and sent this text to the group chat

""Who the fuck put their milk bag on top of my mushrooms""

1. One time in person he confronted one of my roommates over dishes and told him ""Why don't you try getting a life instead of pissing off your housemates
2. We have two bins for recycling, one for cardboard and one for plastic and it gets mixed. One time there was a cardboard box of gushers in the plastic bin so he took a photo and sent it to our groupchat and said ""somethings off about this photo. Can't put my finger on it but maybe y'all can""

1ftpiet,https://i.redd.it/qxxsc35tn5sd1.jpeg,OCTOBER SHIFT-SCHEDULE,"I‚Äôd like to tell you an interesting story.
A story beginning with the very first Shift-window forecast I made last April. I forecasted the window, which I later named the Omega Window, to take place on the 8th/9th of May. The forecast proved to be accurate and it received a lot of attention.

One of the many people who realized their Shift was LaurainTheRedRoom (Laura in the Red Room). From that time on, Laura and I would occasionally CHAT over the course of the following 3-months.

On my CHAT, dated July 2nd, I was talking to Laura about an issue I was having uploading my July Shift-Forecast post into Retconned.  At the time, the Omega window was to open on July 6th/7th.

On July 9th, one week after chatting with Laura on July 2nd, I received a chat message from her and she began to tell me the Omega window proved to be accurate once again and then proceeded to tell me the most incredible thing I‚Äôve heard, since becoming Mandela affected.

She said, that for the past 6-months ( beginning 3-months before the first time I ever chatted with her ) she was on an Earth, in which South America was directly under Texas. 

Now I‚Äôll briefly digress regarding the South American ME and then return to this story.

Thus far, since my becoming Mandela affected, every world I‚Äôve been to had South America far out Eastward, in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. On my Home-world, it was centered under Texas which means it‚Äôs about 2000 miles East of where I remember it being. Central America is so bent to the East, the Panama Canal waters run North to South instead of East West.

Based on my Mandela Effect learnings; there are 3-ME versions of South America‚Äôs physical position.

- [ ] Center-aligned under Texas 
- [ ] Center-aligned under Florida
- [ ] Florida aligned to its West Coast

Returning to the story;  Laura explained there were Posts in Retconned about the South America ME.  Posts discussing South America‚Äôs position being aligned under Texas. In these Posts, most of the comments were saying the same thing, that South America should be MUCH MORE EAST ( from where it is now ), rather than being centered under the United States.

In other words, saying the **exact opposite** of what most of us would describe in our Posts about South America. Laura also said, South America being that far Eastward, was consistent with her teachings from gradeschool.

[  she described this experience in the July Shift Schedule Post, uploaded to my profile.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/s/UI15i2ZqmD  ]

Laura was on a world, in which most of the Mandela affected people, remembered a South America the way it is right now. After our CHAT that day, I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of her for 2-weeks. When I finally did, she told me she needed to stay away from Retconned for some time because she was so rattled by the massive geographic ME-change she experienced. The experience of seeing South America transitioning from being under Texas one day to being out in the Atlantic ocean the next.

She was Shifting to Worlds in which South America remained ‚Äúcentered under Texas,‚Äùfor about 6-months. YET at the SAME TIME, I was chatting with her, on and off for 3-months. Chatting with her on Worlds in which South America was way-out Eastward. How can this happen and WHO WAS I TALKING TO until July 2nd? And who among us remembers Posts in Retconned describing South America being way too WEST!

How can two such **opposing Realities** exist simultaneously? I say, bring me the most devoted believers in Simulation Theory and have them make rational sense of this scenario. Two Lauras and two Retconneds on one Earth? 

Could they really answer it or just repeat the same old Glitch explanations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Simulation Programmer‚Äôs GLITCH from bad memory-update chip.‚Äù

Exactly what constitute a Glitch and why are there so many of them?  Are clumsy Programmers repeatedly spilling coffee on their keyboards?  ‚ÄúD@mn it! That‚Äôs gonna leave a Glitch!‚Äù

On the day Laura described her experience to me, not for one minute, not for one second, did it confuse me. I had no confusion because her experience **fit** like a glove with the Mandela Effect Theory I‚Äôve been describing since I came to Retconned.

**The theory being**; Multiple Parallel Earths, existing in ONE Universe. NOT infinite Parallel Universes, ONE Universe and specifically in our Milky Way Galaxy. A single Universe, Created by NONE OTHER than the ALMIGHTY Himself. 

The ALMIGHTY?  For many, this sounds old-fashioned, pass√©, outdated. Its more trendy these days is to replace our Creator with new progressive-style explanations; ‚ÄúWe exist because aliens seeded the Earth with their DNA‚Äù **and more recently**, ‚ÄúWe exist as a Simulation, created by human programmers living in the future.‚Äù

When I ask, ‚ÄúHow did the aliens come about?‚Äù They say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

When I ask, ‚ÄúHow did these future humans come about?‚Äù They say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Of course they don‚Äôt know because all they‚Äôre doing is kicking the can down the road. 

I remember when debating evolutionists, listening to their ‚ÄúBig bangs‚Äù and ‚ÄúBillions of years of evolution‚Äù explanations. Essentially claiming, both World and Life itself, created itself! üòù

In this context; When I‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúHow did the World come about?‚Äù Answer: ‚ÄúThe world created itself!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did Life come about?‚Äù Answer: ‚ÄúLife created itself!‚Äù

What an amazing self-automated operation this is. Everything creates itself, all by itself!

When I‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúExactly how did the vacuum of space create all of this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat induced the start of it?‚Äù Answer: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù they‚Äôve always answered and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù they always will.

They MUST answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù because any Theory endeavoring to **replace** our CREATOR with something else. no matter how intriguing it may sound, no matter how alluring it may feel, will **never ever** explain its ‚Äúpoint of inception,‚Äù how existence began.  My point is; A Theory which CAN NOT explain its own beginning, has no business being a Theory in the first place.

**Every time we SHIFT**, we‚Äôre literally World-Shifting. Our conscious minds transitioning (Shifting) from one Parallel version of ourselves, on one Parallel Earth, to another Parallel version of ourselves, on another Parallel Earth. These Earths are located in the Orion Arm of the Galaxy, ( 80,000 Light Years away from our own Parallel Home-Earths, in the Sagittarius Arm of the Galaxy ), with all Earths being heavily Quantum Entangled together as a single-unit.

This is exactly the way our Creator Created it from the Beginning, yet very few will envision this explanation because it‚Äôs completely outside the boundaries of the Laws of Physics.

The very idea of the planet Earth and its surrounding solar system, creating and re-creating ITSELF over and over again throughout the galaxy, is clearly a physical impossibility, it cannot exist within the Laws of Physics. Therefore, for many it‚Äôs hard to accept because they‚Äôll have to accept the Creator HIMSELF as the only possible explanation for all these Earths.  
The Multi-Earth Theory, Reveals the Almighty, it Proves the Almighty.

On July 2nd, I was chatting with a certain Parallel version of Laura, chatting on an Earth, in which South American was far Eastward in the Atlantic.  By July 9th, I was speaking with a **different** Parallel version of Laura.  A version who just SHIFTED from a **different Earth**, in which South America was centrally aligned under Texas.

What other rational explanation explains how **two** Opposing-Realities can coexist?  If anyone feels they have an alternate explanation for Laura‚Äôs experience, you‚Äôre welcome to describe it.

1ftpg31,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia_Over25/comments/1ftpg31/business_learnings_with_lemons_part_1/,Business Learnings with Lemons!  [Part 1] ,"Hey you guys!

I keep seeing a bunch of posts here by entrepreneurs. I've been introspecting lately on my entrepreneurial journey. I still have lots to learn but I'm making this series to share what I've picked up so far on this strange, stressful and fun ride.

Part 1 because I'm sure I won't be remembering everything at once. I'm no genius. Let's GO!

**Quick background** -  I run a B2B business where I deal with MNCs. I didn't start this but the company fell into my hands due to an unexpected demise. We do some services as well as supply passive products. 

**Growth in 3 years** - Failed hard the first 2 years. We've more than doubled our turnover and definitely more than doubled our profits in the past 1 year. We have ventured into new areas and are looking to expand SUPER HARD (mostly because this is the fun part for me).

**My ultimate business goal** - Creating a 1000 cr company in the next 8-10 years. Will change as I learn more.

**Big Learnings From My First 3 Years:**

* **Connecting with the right people is EVERYTHING:**
   * Connecting with the right clients , the right employees, the right industry experts, the right financial advisers is everything. This is the most powerful force in business.
   * If you want to get 1 cr of business, you need to be talking to people who can give you 3-5 cr of work and not waste your time on someone who can't give you work more than 5 lacs. If you need experts, hiring ten amateurs won't get your job done.
   * You don't just meet people and start asking. Think what you have to offer.
   * *Build close relationships with the people who can disproportionately benefit you.*
* **20% of the work does bring in 80% of the result:** This one is self-explanatory.
   * A lot of the work that we do isn't productively contributing to the firm in terms of bringing you revenue or meeting your annual goals. Best to delegate or reduce time spent on these activities.
   * Identify what brings you actual sales, actual new ideas and other output you want. Do more of that.
   * I like to take a 2 hours a week to identify how I've spent my time and strategise around what will bring me closer to our goals vs. what I spent an idiotic amount of time doing. Reminds me of the week I spent making a stupid catalogue look extra good that ultimately I'm paying a firm to redesign for me.
* **Fucking up is necessary for growth as long as it doesn't kill/cripple you:**
   * Just don't waste time trying to be perfect when you're getting started cuz honey, you don't even know what perfect is at the time.
   * What's a thing in your opinion that you could try and will bring you closer to your goals? Why aren't you doing it? What's the worse that could happen ? As long as you can survive the crash and learn from it, it's good.
   * *DO get good at doing your risk analysis.*
   * Failure gives you more fodder to talk to your clients about and show them your growth over time. You need content, don't you, when it comes to talking to your customers? Makes you more interesting.
   * The more you fail, the more you experience. Connecting dots gets easier. Avoiding bad bets gets easier.
* **Spend money to earn money:**
   * Spend money on marketing. Spend money on gifts. Spend money on samples.
   * Spend money on getting good at what you and your team do.
   * It takes money to explore the markets. Spend this money. Don't stay in your stupid office. Go out, explore the markets and your clients problems.
* **Planning then tracking helps with getting shit done:**
   * My least favourite part about being an entrepreneur is that I have to be my own boss and tell myself what needs to be done. I can run off-track so easily.
   * Here's what I do. I shut off my stupid overthinking brain. I can waste too much time trying to find the perfect goals to set.
   * Set your annual, quarterly and monthly goals. Set these based on your current status, the industry you're in and what you want for yourself as well as what's good for the company. Set your weekly milestones, monthly milestone and a tracking mechanism.
   * List all the ways you can get off track and get rid of them. Track every day and every week.
   * What gets measured gets managed.
* **Financial tracking helps with figuring out what you can do:**
   * If you know your numbers, you know what will come in and go out at each point in time
   * I personally want a profitable company. So that's one thing I track for.
   * This allows me to know how much we can spend on different activities, how much we can invest in a new project and how we can price our shares at a point in time.
   * Can you set up a stall in a trade exhibition? Can you get a new coffee machine? Can you buy an office building in 2 years?  Knowing your numbers answers all of it.
   * Remove financial ambiguity. Business survival depends on your finances. You need to know how you're doing. Track different projects. Shut down the loss making ones. Net profit makes a huge dent.
* **It's not easy but it isn't half as hard as people make it out to be:**
   * Keep pushing. Give yourself time in the market.
   * Time in the market beats being a genius. A genius thinks of new ideas from the get go. But time in the market makes you connections and leads that help you connect the dots that bring you business.
   * Time in the market really helps in compounding your gains - people come seeking you and focus finds you along the way. Keep finances okay and keep working. You will be surprised by how soon you'll start to make it.
   * So keep pushing. It is not that hard if you keep putting in effort.
* **The good ideas don't need to come from you BUT you should desperately seek them:**
   * Your job as an entrepreneur is to figure it out. It being any problem or situation you're facing whether it is creating a new product line or sorting out a GST notice. You don't need to know how to do it all. BUT YOUR JOB AS AN ENTREPRENEUR IS TO FIGURE SHIT OUT.
   * You will need new ideas, new information, new systems and new knowledge. *None of this must necessarily come from your brain.* You don't need to know everything but you need to talk to different people so that you expand your horizons and thinking capabilities. This helps you figure it out.
   * Additionally, do not get comfortable. Keep seeking better ideas and better businesses to expand into and growing segments of markets and better ways of doing things. DO NOT GET COMFORTABLE.
   * Meet people who are doing WAYYYY better than you in everything. The entrepreneur growing faster than you. The project managers doing better than yours. Go talk to them. You will find pieces of information that will form into a new idea that changes everything.

So, that's all I've got so far. This post is already long enough.

This is what I'm working on now. I'm creating strategies and doing my own work towards accomplishing these things I am mentioning below.

1. Industry Roadmap
2. Aggressive planning, execution & analysis
3. Learning to negotiate hard
4. Creating a disciplined organisation
5. Taking bigger risks
6. Exploring China
7. Creating a 'To Give' Plan for the clients
8. SWOT, Porter's 5 forces and what they can do for me

Maybe we can get into this stuff in part 2.

**REMEMBER:**

* If you are new entrant in the industry, don't bother about being knowledgeable in the industry. Find knowledgeable people instead. Don't ever look down on yourself if you want to make it in business. My experiences with entrepreneurship have taught me that building a company requires you have a solid belief in your ability to get shit done. Do look upto yourself.

* **SUCCESS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP TAKES A STUPID AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE.**

* Additionally, make mistakes. Try stuff. Learn and reinvent. The first shitty attempt at doing something is the right of passage. You get good the more time you put into it. This post is my first draft into sharing what I'm learning.

That's all about me. I want to hear what has worked for you guys. This is all for us to discuss. There are no objectively right and wrong answers here.

Love,

This is my first time posting here and I'm looking for a bit of advice. To give a bit of background, I met a man that was probably late 40s and his service dog Nova this morning while grabbing a coffee (she was unleashed with a pink jacket just watching everyone, she was so sweet). He looked like he was homeless but I couldn't tell for sure, after contemplating for a bit I rolled down my windows and struck up a conversation. I said that I don't mean to be rude but wondered if he needed any help with anything, I don't have much on me but I can help.

He had a bicycle with some supplies and said he's going to the dock to do a job to get some money. I said I can't offer him a drive since im on my way yo school but I have 25 dollars he could have. He was very grateful and told me more about his life. He has epilepsy and  been homeless for 4 years with his dog, stays at the shelter in the evenings where he must put a muzzle on her and in a kennel. He puts the kennel on his bed with the door open and lays his head inside with her. He was honest with me and said he was removed from his family due to some allegations, however charges were dropped and he was never convicted. I never asked for details, maybe he's a horrible person but I'm not one to judge his character and I don't need to know. I told him to meet me in the same spot tomorrow and I'll have some more stuff for him. I plan on picking up a bag of groceries and a couple hundred dollars for him.

I told my wife the story and how this man and his dog really resonated within me. My wife recently purchased a used Nissan Xterra and we plan on getting rid of or selling her old 2003 Ford Escape. We usually had to put a few hundred dollars or more into the Escape each year to keep it running. I asked her if she would be willing to give the Ford Escape to this man, the inspection is expired this month, but I'd be willing to pay for the inspection if it's not going to cost too much. I had just replaced some parts on it myself so I think it would be okay for another year.

My question to everyone is, would it be worth giving someone a car like that if they don't have a steady job? With insurance and gas, I'm not sure he'd be able to keep up. Sorry I know this was a bit of a ramble but I wanted to express this story.

TLDR, would a homeless person benefit from being given a vehicle if they may not be able to afford the gas/insurance?",0,1727792870.0,homeless,6,0.5,False

1ftpbpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ftpbpj/heshes_just_not_that_into_you/,He/She's Just Not That Into You,"I was watching an episode of Sex and the City where Miranda was sharing how he met this guy and he hasn't called but they were planning this and that and he hasn't pushed through and the girls were comforting her. Telling her he must be busy or whatever, and then Carrie's boyfriend just said, ""He's just not that into you"" and it was a light bulb moment for her. So light bulb that when she overheard a stranger yapping about the same thing, she interfered in the conversation and said the same thing.

Interestingly, that is still true to date. The show may have been filmed in early 2000s but lo and behold, 20 years after that same dating language holds. Remember when ""life happens"", when we got too busy with work, with life, with sht. Btch please, he's just not that into you.

Somewhere along the course of your conversation, whether you've exchanged photos or you've been talking for two weeks (which btw is a fcking record) it must have hit him/her that nah, this isn't it.

So it's not really ghosting, but also not ""life happens"", it really is the fact that HE OR SHE IS NOT INTERESTED ENOUGH! Simple.

Do not extend yourself, but rather give the same energy they give you. Easier said than done but in the world where something casual and long-term is used in one sentence, I don't know if we're screwed up or not sure either how patient and hopeful we have to be for the right one to come along.
