Well today I realized that the pants I wore yesterday and today (2 different ones) that are size 14 actually fit, I have been a size 16 for a good while and I was just in a rush yesterday and today that I didn't put much thought i just dressed myself and had to be out the door.  Also today was running late and went to the grocery store and essentially I was going to get a bagel and energy drink but as soon as I walked in and smelled the bread (I love the smell of yeast hobby baker) I naturally wanted to just grab a bagel or crossiant but my stomach and like the back of my throat just felt ugghh like disgusted and gagged a bit eventhough I internally wanted it.

I‚Äôve struggled with losing weight my whole life due to hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. I started semaglutide compound through HERS and have lost 3.8 pounds so far. I started on Feb. 15th on 8 units (.2 mg) for the first 4 weeks. Will go up to .16 units (.4 mg) in two weeks. I started at 260 pounds, am 5 foot 7, and have a pretty sedentary job. Goal weight is honestly just getting under 200 pounds at this point (160 the real goal). 

My diet is ok but could be less carby. Don‚Äôt drink anything but black coffee, water, and almond milk occasionally. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is: am I losing at a good pace!? I don‚Äôt wanna give up early but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing this right haha. Any eating tips welcome.

1iz35la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iz35la/i_need_advice_for_my_relationship/,I need advice for my relationship,"Okay so I, 22 M, and my girlfriend, 22 F have been in a relationship for a couple of months and have known each others for 5 years and we share our common friend group. I am her firt ‚Äúreal‚Äù boyfriend and I‚Äôve done everything I could to make her feel happy and loved. I am dating to marry and she know that, so in this optic it would be her first and only time being asked out, so I made sure to make her a handmade ring and make this moment soecial. We have been in love for at least a yeah and a half but non of his dares to so anything until I did a couple months ago. She is honestly the sweetest soul even but recently I‚Äôve started to feel bad in this relationship. Basically, last year, a school trip to London and Paris was announced for the senior students, and my whole friend group wanted to go (we live in Canada). The thing is that I just didn‚Äôt have $6,000 to waste on a trip that‚Äôs worth at most $2,000, and I don‚Äôt have parents to pay for it (because, yeah, it was their parents who paid for their trip). Then, my girlfriend found out that she probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to go, and she was really upset and hurt. So I started planning a similar trip with her, but for $1,500 instead of $6,000 (every-thing included (food, activities tickets, hotel, plane tickets, vaccine and everything) and for two weeks instead of only one as the school one. I also selected many places she would like to go and made sure to prepare a budget, and she seemed really happy about it. But I told her: If we plan this trip together, don‚Äôt ditch me to go with the school one if you end up getting accepted. And she told me that no, she would go with me. But the moment she got accepted, she ditched me and went with the others. And for over a year now, she‚Äôs known that this hurts me and pisses me off, but never did anything to change her decision. I also asked my friend group not to talk about it in front of me out of respect. which no one respected. And now, well, she just left for Europe today with all our friends, but without me, her boyfriend. I explained to her that this whole situation makes me feel like absolute shit because no one respects me, no one tried to find a solution to help me go with them, no one did anything, and she know this for over a year. Meanwhile, when she thought she couldn‚Äôt go, I did everything I could to make sure she could go. I told her I‚Äôm tired of being treated like this, like garbage, like a backup plan, like I don‚Äôt matter, and that this trip is undeniable proof of that. But, you know, it‚Äôs not like she was going to do anything about it. So I told her I‚Äôm done accepting this kind of treatment in my relationships, that I know my worth, and that from now on, people will have to treat me well and actually deserve to have me in their lives instead of just taking me for granted, as I think I should and she think I‚Äôm right about it. But she keeps saying it was too late to cancel her place in the trip but that she absolutely regret everything and feel bad. On top of that, she‚Äôs rarely there for me when I need her most. Then I‚Äôm talking to her about it and im ending up comforting her because she feels bad for treating me like shit. I know I‚Äôm not perfect, but I do my best to make her the happiest and to make her feel like a princess. I bought her an expensive flower bouquet for Valentine‚Äôs Day to make it special for her, and crafted her a huge handmade book I‚Äôve spent months on and baked her brioche, even though I don‚Äôt have that kind of money right now because im unemployed due to extra school classes I take on my spare time, to be able to afford a good future for us. And I recently found out that she planned an other trip to Washington DC with school, even when she told me we couldn‚Äôt go to New York together because her mom didnt wanted her to go to 2 trip in the same year. And yeah, I put my everything into my relationships and social life and do my best to make sure everyone feels accepted and welcomed, but no one does the same for me, and I‚Äôm tired of it. And, you know, she still went on this trip and betrayed me, even after knowing for a whole year how this made me feel. I‚Äôm starting to question if she‚Äôs really the right person for me because I don‚Äôt deserve to be treated so toxically. And she keep complaining about how she is over exhausted from work and that she broke down during her shift, when she only work for way less than 10h a week (outside of school) and have really chill bosses and coworkers. Then she keeps saying how hard she worked on this trip when her mom paid for it and that she only did sold coffee and soap to teachers to finance it. Knowing I‚Äôve been in a foster family and a shelter for quite some time in the past and having to excessively work crazy shifts in a stressful environment for me to live. Plus, one of our friend in our friend group, let‚Äôs call her jelly, is super toxic and abusive in our friendship, yet my girlfriend keeps spending time with her like nothing‚Äôs wrong. This friend keeps being toxic and hypocritical towards me and many people. Jelly keeps her toxic behaviour towards many people and is bullying a lot of people. The thing is, my girlfriend is her dream target and this friend makes many degrading body shaming comments that can easily apply to my girl. My girlfriend is aware of what she does to me but still be friend with her, which feels like a betrayal. And yet, she tells me that‚Äôs she love me and wanna spend her life with me, but dosent actually prove it to me through her actions. She tells me she is gonna improve some of her actions and reactions, but never does it. Then, when I‚Äôm feeling a little bit bad and more distant (due to traumatic events from my past relationship) she just ignores me, run to jelly and our other friends and isn‚Äôt there for me. But when it‚Äôs not about those things, she does show me love and affection. All of this to say‚ÄîI‚Äôm really not feeling great right now because of all this, and I‚Äôm just so tired of being mistreated and surrounded by toxicity in my relationships. What should I do? Because except of those things, she is an amazing person and I truly love her. I tried to communicate with her about it but I feel like it goes nowhere and that she really dosent care. I already told her everything about this, but she still went and didn‚Äôt really changed. Im planning on showing her this post later on so tell me what to do, give us advices and try to explain some things to her from your personal experiences to help us grow stronger together. I know i probably pintes her as a bad person in this post, but I swear she is not, its just some thighs that are problematic and that I feel I can‚Äôt express to her the way she need me to. I truly love her and want us to work out. Im am not a fake person and I really need advice ",1,1740616964.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

A detailed review for coffee enthusiasts,"Testing the atatix EM3111 espresso machine has been a delightful journey for me as a coffee lover. This compact, fully automatic espresso machine with a milk frother is designed to deliver caf√©-quality coffee in the comfort of your home, and it certainly lives up to its promise. After using it daily for weeks, I've discovered that while it has impressive strengths, there are also a few things to keep in mind.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The sleek stainless steel finish of this espresso machine caught my eye immediately when I set it up in my kitchen. It's compact, measuring just 12.24""D x 5.5""W x 11.17""H, making it perfect for smaller countertops. Despite its lightweight 7.5 pounds, it feels sturdy and well-constructed. I especially appreciate the four silicone suction cups on the base, which keep the machine stable during operation. The brushed stainless steel top also doubles as a cup warmer, an unexpected but highly practical feature that I use daily.

[Ready to snag atatix EM3111 espresso machine? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dp1wxvk8/)

**Features**  
The atatix EM3111 is packed with features that make it stand out in the crowded world of espresso machines. With its professional 20-bar pressure system and a 1350W motor, the machine ensures optimal espresso extraction, resulting in a rich aroma and full-bodied flavor. The NTC temperature control system ensures precise water temperature, which I found to be essential for consistent brewing results. Whether I wanted a single or double shot, the automatic or manual extraction options allowed me to customize my coffee experience effortlessly.

**Brewing Performance**  
From the first shot I brewed, I could tell this machine was a game-changer. The professional-grade 20-bar pressure pump truly brings out the best in the coffee grounds, creating a rich and aromatic espresso with a perfect crema. With the automatic preheating feature, I never have to wait long to start brewing, and the manual extraction option lets me play around with different coffee concentrations. I‚Äôve even experimented with varying brewing times and found that I could easily create coffee tailored to my preferences.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
The powerful steam wand is perhaps my favorite feature. It creates a rich, creamy microfoam that enhances the texture and flavor of lattes and cappuccinos. My attempts at latte art have been surprisingly successful, thanks to the consistent frothing this machine delivers. My kids now beg for ‚Äúfancy coffee‚Äù (aka hot chocolate with steamed milk), and this machine makes it so easy to whip up something special for them.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The 45 oz removable water tank is a fantastic addition. I find it‚Äôs large enough for several cups of coffee before needing a refill, which is a blessing during busy mornings. The tank is easy to detach and clean, and its transparent design lets me keep an eye on the water levels at a glance.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning this machine has been hassle-free, which is a huge plus in my book. The detachable water tank and drip tray make it easy to rinse and wipe down after use. I also appreciate that the stainless steel exterior doesn‚Äôt show smudges or fingerprints easily, keeping my kitchen looking neat and tidy.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
While brewing, the machine operates fairly quietly compared to other espresso makers I‚Äôve tried. Its energy efficiency is another bonus, as it doesn‚Äôt consume excess power even with its high-performance motor.

**Warranty & Support**  
The atatix EM3111 comes with excellent customer support, and the instruction manual is clear and concise, making it simple for even a beginner to get started. Although I haven‚Äôt faced any issues requiring warranty support, the company‚Äôs reputation for quick responses is reassuring.

**Advantages**

* Exceptional 20-bar pressure delivers rich and aromatic espresso.
* Compact design fits easily into small kitchens.
* Powerful steam wand creates creamy, rich microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.
* Hassle-free cleaning with detachable components.

**Shortcomings**

* The steam wand requires regular cleaning to maintain performance.
* Slightly limited capacity for heavier coffee drinkers.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the atatix EM3111 to other semi-automatic espresso machines like the Breville Bambino Plus or the De'Longhi Dedica, I noticed a few key differences. While the Breville offers faster heat-up times, the atatix stands out for its robust milk frothing system and compact design. De'Longhi's machines might have a slightly larger water tank, but they lack the intuitive manual extraction feature that makes the atatix more customizable. For its price range, the atatix EM3111 provides a fantastic balance of performance and value.

**True Value**  
While this espresso machine might not be the cheapest option on the market, the quality it delivers justifies the investment. The combination of professional-grade features, user-friendly design, and an affordable price point makes it a worthwhile choice. If you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast looking for a reliable machine that doesn‚Äôt break the bank, this one‚Äôs worth considering.

I am at a loss, came home after a long day of working hard, flicked on my (now 3 years old) coffee machine, no issues whatsoever. Put the cup under and hit the coffee button.

Coffee was being dispensed, but when I came back I found the cup half full, and the machine's warning light is on, plus the start button is flashing.

Philips manual says there's air trapped, says to just replace water, remove filter & start it back up, dispense some hot water...

As soon as I start it up it makes the usual noise, but immediately turns to the same warning light (solid on) and the flashing start button.. 

Hitting the play button it will try, make slight clicky noises and return back to the warning again. Leaving me unable to actually do anything to resolve the issue...


So basically, after a ton of googling I am unfortunately left having to ask for help, as I have somewhat ran out of ideas here..

TL;DR: Philips 2200, warning light solid on, start/play button flashes. Turning off&on goes almost straight back to above issue, hitting start doesn't dispense anything and returns to warning light within a few seconds of 'warming up'

In line at the coffee shop  I recognize the guy from the lot and he still isn‚Äôt acknowledging me. So I order my coffee and he waits till I‚Äôm done ordering to say ‚Äúoh hey! It‚Äôs you!‚Äù 

We sit down and he is not my cup of tea. He then admits he saw me in the parking lot but he got nervous and pretended not to see me.

For the 5 years I took the medication I didn‚Äôt have any weight gain (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 female) but starting Jan of last year I‚Äôve gained about 12 pounds which is a lot for me because I workout daily and eat pretty well. I also noticed an increase in my appetite for me to want to always eat and crave Junk food.

In Aerroccino add 125mg milk (I use fairlife for extra protein) - to first line. Froth without wisk attachment.

Brew double pod (been using Bianco Doppio) over honey, start Aerroccino. Stir espresso/honey/salt mixture, pour in hot milk, stir everything, put lid on and run out the door :)

Stays warm in preheated Yeti for plenty of time. 

I don't love sweet drinks, this is a great balance for me. More milk than a cortado, but less than a latte. It's also great over lots of ice with cold milk.

So, my ex has been reaching out more than usual lately. We were together for three years and broke up in 2019. Then, in late 2020, we started hooking up again here and there. In early 2021, he suddenly went radio silent on me. A few months later, I found out through social media that he had become a dad‚Äîjust a couple of days before we last saw each other.

Fast forward to 2022, I started dating and eventually got into a relationship. That didn‚Äôt work out, partly because my ex kept adding me on every social media platform, and my then-partner thought I had something going on with him (which I didn‚Äôt, by the way).

I‚Äôve been single for a year now, and recently, my ex‚Äîthe same guy from 2019 who has a kid‚Äîhas been reaching out again. He‚Äôs been sending me love songs, and honestly, every time I see his name pop up, I feel excited and sad at the same time. I saw a future with this person, and it still hurts that things didn‚Äôt work out‚Äîespecially since I later found out he had constantly cheated on me while we were together.

After a lot of back and forth, I finally agreed to meet him for coffee. I was nervous, and honestly, I felt guilty because I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in his baby mama‚Äôs position. But when I saw him, it felt so familiar and easy, like no time had passed. All I wanted in that moment was for him to hold me.

He was flirty, bringing up our past‚Äîmostly the good times, especially in the bedroom. He also told me how miserable he was at home, saying the only thing keeping him there was his kids and that he and his kids‚Äô mom were just too different. Maybe he was lying.

When he walked me to my car, he hugged my waist, and in that moment, it felt right. But as I was about to get in, my eyes got teary, and he noticed. His eyes got watery too, and he said he hated seeing me like that. Then he tried to kiss me, but I didn‚Äôt let him. He just held me, and I could feel how much he still wanted me. Before I left, he asked if he would see me again, and all I could say was, we‚Äôll see.

At one opening they approached me for a hug, which I (internally reluctantly) returned, but sort of emotionally brushed off. I live in the midwest. Some people are touchy, and it was a one time thing, it's whatever. 

Now they are not contacting me for work, but they have invited me to coffee. They say they want to see my new work, but when I send them direct links to my social media and online portfolio of new work, my web analytics say that there hasn't been any views/clicks/activity. 

When I explained that with my current workload and career activity I didn't have the free time to get a beverage with them, and they are welcome to view my social media pages and online portfolio, they stated that they wanted to ""see how I was doing and catch up over a cup of coffee""

I don't drink coffee, I also only know this person through providing them a service. How I am doing should be irrelevant to them if I can provide the service they request. I have gone a similar route with a different client in the past and lost two months of Saturdays listening to them drone on outside of a coffee shop about every detail of their childhood.

1iz27yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iz27yq/nobody_is_here_with_me/,nobody is here with me,"it had been nearly six hours since i started writing code when i first noticed it. before i get into what happened, you should know: i am a cs major. i fit the stereotype: high-powered specs, mostly unshaven face, occasional gym visits at odd hours, and always a diet coke or coffee in hand. none of that really matters except that i had been working on a paper and showed up at my desk at 9 am, as usual. the usual morning rush was there: undergrads running to class, professors heading to lectures, and some sleep-deprived seniors scrambling to meet deadlines. as i said, everything was: just usual. another morning in an engineering building.

i took the elevator to my floor, sat down with my coffee, wired in my headphones, and got to work. by 1 pm, hunger kicked in. josh, my lab mate, who sat opposite to me, hadn‚Äôt shown up. maybe he was working from home, i really didn't care. i brushed it off and kept going. at 3 pm, i couldn‚Äôt ignore my hunger anymore. i unplugged my headphones from my laptop and connected them to my phone. i don‚Äôt like walking without music. it leaves me alone with my thoughts and my thoughts aren‚Äôt exactly the most encouraging ones out there. sometimes, it fuels random grand scenarios in my head where i do stuff i possibly can't do in real life. if research doesn‚Äôt work out, maybe i should consider film-making. but hey that is not what i am here for. i am here because i am stuck. let me walk you through what exactly has happened to me.

i got up from my desk, and the hall seemed empty, i figured people had either gone out for classes, or perhaps they were just out for their lab meetings or whatever. took the elevator to the 10th floor for the cafeteria. oddly, it went down first, then straight up. no one boarded at the ground floor. i got off the elevator, and walked into the cafeteria. here is when i started noticing it.

the cafeteria was completely empty. I scurried across to the study hall on the other end of the 10th floor. empty. every corner of the 10th floor was dead silent. an eerie feeling started to creep in. i was no longer wearing my headphones, i had removed them and put them on my head to return to reality. i hurried back down. my workspace was deserted, but had it always been? the emptiness felt too complete, like it had been this way for hours. where the hell did everyone go? i rushed to the ground floor. nothing. no security, no students. i stepped outside. the sky was‚Ä¶wrong. a deep red-orange hue, unnatural for 3:15 pm. the street which is usually packed with students and outsiders alike, was abandoned.

panic set in. i called josh. no service. the wifi still showed as connected, but nothing loaded. messages didn‚Äôt get sent. phone calls failed. it was as if the world had shut me out. i turned back to the building. the other elevator was still running, moving between floors, stopping randomly. but no matter how many times i pressed the button, it never came for me.

maybe this was a dream. maybe if i go back and try to sleep, i can just wake up to normalcy. i returned to my desk. leaving the building felt worse. if this was something out of *coherence*, then waiting it out seemed like my best option. my head ached. i tried to sleep.

when i woke up, my phone read 15:29. weird. i was sure I had slept longer. my analog watch, however, showed 7:27. am? pm? if it was pm, why was it still bright outside? i turned back to my screen, mind racing. then, something small caught my eye. i got distracted for just a second. that‚Äôs when i saw that stupid github copilot was still working and suggesting an auto-completion for a line in my code. i figured that it might be my only connection to something beyond this void. i started typing, trying to trick it into giving me a way out. i asked for steps to access an external site. instead of real steps, it generated a bizarre, randomized link.

i hesitated. then clicked. and it led me here. so here i am. confused as hell. starving. scared‚Äîbut keeping it together. someone here must have seen something like this before.

i low-key wish i had not seen what i saw right outside my window. but it was only after i finished completing a draft of this post when i noticed it: a cross taped to the window, from the outside. and then i suddenly [remembered. you can come and save me. will you?](https://theghostinmymachine.com/2014/06/25/the-most-dangerous-games-elevator-to-another-world/)",5,1740614326.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

First time posting on Reddit so here it goes. The parties involved are:

1. Employee 1: Chris - guy that helped with our first U-Haul rental
2. Employee 2: Mark - guy that helped with our 2nd rental
3. Employee 3: Paul - guy that we spoke to briefly when talking about the problem
4. Employee 4: Noah - guy that was there for his afternoon shift
5. Assistant Manager: Emily - helped us with the issue
6. Boss or Manager: Jack - approved Emily's actions

All names are fake since I don't want them to get in trouble. The issue is currently still ongoing, but I am hopeful that it will be resolved. It is a bit long so bear with me.

My mother (F54) and I (F28) rented a U-Haul to transport some pallets of flooring to a house that needed renovation. The first time we went to this location was back in January for the same reason above. The trip in January went well even though it was our first time ever renting a truck because the employee (Chris) was very helpful and nice. Chris helped us with all of the paperwork and also showed us how to start the truck and where the emergency brake was. My mother was very happy and proudly told some of her friends and coworkers that she had successfully driven a big moving truck like this for the first time ever.

The issue occurred the second time we went to rent a truck. A different employee (Mark) had helped us with the paperwork and we estimated the trip to take about 18 miles but since we were not completely sure, he put it down for 20 miles instead which we were fine with. We also got the higher rate to have the deadline changed to the day after as we were not sure if we could finish moving the items in time. We managed to get the goods and unload the items at the house in a timely fashion so we ended up returning the truck later that same day around 7 PM. We had signed the contract around 1:30 PM. The original contract's estimated amount to be paid was about $86. I had also read reviews on the place previously and remembered to take before and after photos of the dashboard that had the mileage and fuel gauge which turned out to be very much needed. I did this for both trips.

A few days passed and my mother noticed that the charge to her credit card was for much higher than expected ($145) and when we called to check, they informed us that they charged her for the amount of fuel missing from the fuel gauge shown on the contract. The problem was the fuel gauge on the contract was wrong--we had received the keys for the truck with a fuel gauge around 1/4 and returned the truck with a similar fuel gauge around 1/4. The contract we had signed showed that the initial fuel gauge was supposed to be 5/8. Since I had the photos of before and after the trip, they told me that I could go in and show them the pictures and they would give me a refund of the extra amount charged.

I drove there with my original contract and showed the assistant manager (Emily) the photos, and she saw that it was indeed an error and attempted to fix the issue. She first questioned me and told me that apparently there was supposed to be a link that should have been sent to the phone on file and that we were supposed to confirm that the mileage and fuel gauge were correct since there was a way to fix it on there. I told her that it was our second time ever renting a truck and that Mark had never told us about this link, which was true. (I think maybe we got lucky the first time that it was correct or Chris had checked it himself when he came out to help us with starting the truck.)

Emily then asked which employee handled our documents and Paul answered ""it was Mark"". She did not seem surprised. Anyways, she proceeded to redo the return and also got the authorization from the boss or actual manager (Jack) there to confirm. She input all of the new info with the photos I provided to her showing the mileage and fuel gauge. This is where I slightly fucked up. I did not realize at the time, but she had messed up the refund process somewhere as we somehow got charged an extra $0.83 instead of getting a refund. I had seen all of the interactions between the staff and had also approved the refund of $145 (original charge) on the credit card machine. I very clearly saw a -$145 on the machine and tapped ""Approve"" on the machine. She gave me a new receipt and told me that the additional $0.83 was to offset what I still owed after she fixed the issues. The new receipt showed that we only traveled 16 miles out of the original estimated 20 miles, and the fuel gauge was around 1/4. I was very polite and thanked her for helping me out. I wanted to get my original documents back but Emily saw that she had already thrown my copy in the trash can and it was covered in coffee stains. I ended up getting her to print a new copy of the original incorrect contract as the email on file was wrong and I had not received the original contract via email. She helped correct that as well and I left.

I gave the copy of the original and the new receipt to my mother. My mother does taxes and she looked at the receipt and saw that something was not right as she should not be getting charged more if they already owe her money. It should have been subtracted from the amount that was already charged and she should get a refund of the excess amount paid or the entire charge should have been refunded with the new corrected charge sent after. I called them the next morning and was transferred to talk with Emily as she had handled the return. She remembered me and tried to explain away the trivial extra charge, but did not listen to our side clearly. We tried to tell her that the fuel gauge diagram and the mileage was indeed corrected, but there was still an additional charge of $63 for fuel (14 gallons). The conversation did get a bit heated and Emily ended up putting us on hold and then the call dropped. I think she did not want to hear us out as we had talked over each other a bit and she had told us the refund would take a few days. She also tried to insinuate that we were trying to get out of paying for the truck at all which was not the case.

My mother and I drove to the U-Haul place and explained the situation to the employee there, Noah. He told us that there was a manager or assistant manager (probably Emily since I had spoken to her earlier), but they had already left since their shift was done. I suspect Emily never wanted to continue the call. I was still holding out originally waiting for her to talk again before the call dropped. Noah then had to call his boss and put him on speaker phone so that I could talk to him and explain things clearly.

So, TIFU for wanting a partial refund of the $63 that U-Haul incorrectly charged me for fuel.

Well today a customer got a coffee around 1pm and asked me if I could ring him up for a hash brown and bacon bagel and I‚Äôm sure why not, we‚Äôve done this before. Gave him a receipt and he went to ask my coworker in sizzli. Well my mod team and other register associate was surprised that I had done that and indirectly scolded me over that. They said I wasn‚Äôt allowed to give them the deal, and when I asked is so a customer is not allowed to ask for a sizzli after hours they said yes but not during a promotion. They said I should have rung it up separately from the coffee. I‚Äôm kinda baffled because like I said at least seven FBMs I had have done similar stuff in the past. I haven‚Äôt checked the loop but from what my GM said in the huddle it seems perfectly fine what I did. He did end up saying they‚Äôll play it by ear. I will say that not all Wawas are operating the same and they keep saying this is policy etc but then another store says another thing but contact center can‚Äôt give you a direct answer either. It‚Äôs getting kind of frustrating because my customers like what I do and I try to do the right thing and how I was trained at a previous store. Thoughts?",2,1740613877.0,Wawa,4,0.75,False

1iz1zg9,https://i.redd.it/k76i6ok0mkle1.jpeg,I got my perfume oils order! Here are my first impressions,"So I've been adding things to my cart on Africa Imports for weeks now, telling other ppl about them, and I finally went ahead & ordered. I got four 4oz bottles, eight ‚Öìoz roll-ons, and eleven 1oz bottles. I also got a 12 pack of empty roll-on bottles to fill myself. All of this, with a $10off discount code, & (unfortunately) $16 shipping bc I chose UPS, USPS was like $14 but it would've taken longer, for a total of about $110. You HAVE to spend $99 in order to get wholesale prices. If you spend less than $99 you pay retail prices, which are about 2x as much but still suuuper cheap compared to other sites. So far I've only ordered from fragrantbodyoilz & loved it. Here are the ones I ordered & my first impressions. 

*Alien Goddess - smells like alien goddess but when wet it has some other note that makes it smell like alien goddess *lotion*? Idk how to describe it. I prefer the one from fragrantbodyoilz but I got a 4oz bottle so I'm gonna make it work lol.
*Mango milk - creamy mango, very wearable.
*Tropical Mango - initially veryyyyy strong & off-putting like mango scented nail polish. After dry down it's better but still üò¨ like a mango vape lol
*DBiR OG - smells like the FBO one I got, smells like the perfume (granted I've only tested it in stores, I own the intense tho)
*DBiR coral fantasy - have only tested it in stores but I think it smells like it. Smells REALLY good regardless. 
*Dylan purple - smells like the Dylan purple oil I got from FBO. Super close to the perfume, smells really good & one of my faves to mix with.
*Bombshell - doesn't smell like bombshell lol smells like a bombshell flanker maybe.
*Island Coconut - when wet, that nail polish note is there again but only lightly. When dry it's okay, I've never been into coconut before alien goddess so I wanted to try. Mehhhh. Idk maybe if you're a die hard coconut lover you'll like it! But I think it's just meh
*Black coffee - smells just like freshly brewed coffee lol but also a sliiiiight something that makes it smell like a black coffee *candle* or black coffee lipgloss or something. VERY strong. I bought it for layering experiments but this is very strong lol. If you want to enhance any coffee notes, go for it, use sparingly.
*Vanilla - sweet vanilla kinda like cake batter or vanilla lipgloss or something. Weird when wet but immediately calms down into a sorta vanilla frosted cupcakes smell. 
*Sensual vanilla musk - I'm a somewhat beginner, not like the wine sommeliers of perfume, so I can't really identify musk that well? But it smells like a more adult version of the vanilla one above.
*Flowerbomb - smells pretty close! Bought for my mom, might keep lol.
*Flowerbomb midnight - never smelled this perfume but it smells like Flowerbombs cuter sexier sister. I really like it and it lines up with the notes listed for the perfume 
*Brambleberry's cocoa butter cashmere - I don't even remember adding this one lol but it smells good! Like cashmere, kinda warm, but I can smell fruit or a floral note somewhere in there which makes it super wearable & layer-able
*Eden Sparkling lychee - smells like the one I got from fragrantbodyoilz as a tester. Initially I didn't like it but it's grown on me so I got a roll-on size. Very crisp, sweet, refreshing.
*Victoria's Secret coconut passion - pleasantly surprised. It's been years since I smelled the body mist but it smells how i remember. Def wearing this in the spring/summer. 
*French vanilla - very light, sweeter vanilla. Reminds me of French vanilla coffee creamer lol.
*French vanilla coffee-  French vanilla + black coffee lol. Literally smells like my mom's morning coffee.
*Victoria's Secret very sexy - if I'm being honest, it's like 88% very sexy. If I didn't have the perfume right here to compare it with I'd probably think it's really close, but still not quite spot on. Still smells good. If you like very sexy you'll like this & can layer with it.
*VS pear glac√©- I've never smelled this perfume, supposedly it's an old discontinued Victoria's secret perfume, but I LOVE a pear note so I had to try. The prices are so good anyway that even if I don't love it, an oz is like $3 lol.  Anyways it matches up with the notes of the perfume, it smells like pear + green notes to me. Smells good. Prob wouldn't have bought it if I smelled it first, but still smells good nonetheless. 
*Vanilla orchid - smells sliiiightly more masculine than what I prefer, but doesn't smell like a men's cologne. Has a soapy almost unisex body wash scent to it. Overall I think it matches up with the notes listed on the site: (vanilla flower cassis citruses bamboo mixed flowers jasmine vanilla bean sandalwood orchid  patchouli)

Overall I definitely recommend Africa imports for perfume oils. Some of them I prefer from fragrantbodyoilz but FBO is like 4x more expensive. Still, I can only get DBiR INTENSE & vanilla 28 from FBO & prefer their alien goddess, so I'll continue to shop from both.

I grew up in nj (I understand if you stop reading now, it's ok), studied & worked in nyc, then moved to tokyo, and am looking for somewhere to move next within the US, so I thought I would visit.

- Pittsburgh has a very fun topography, it made everything very fun to look at. Like being in dark souls 1 at firelink shrine and being able to see something in the distance, but not knowing how to get there yet. The steps are really cool.

- Everyone is seriously so nice, or so unabashed that it feels genuine. I don't think I've ever just been approached to have a wholesome conversation at a bar just for conversations sake before in the US. I often got a free coffee or free treat snuck into an order, you guys are so sweet this would never happen in nyc lmao.

- You guys have some actual dive bars (i really loved lucky's)

- I didn't go to too many, but I think the music events you have definitely are outstanding given the size of the city! There's a bit of a pretentious electronic music event scene going on, a DIY scene, and people seem to really care about it. Sure, it's not every single night like maybe someplace like NYC, but it's a lot more accessible, digestible, and imo seemed like a lot more fun and not clout chase-y. People seemed very creative in a genuine way. Loved playing silly bingo at the tiki bar on carson while two-step is playing lol.
Places like hotmass existing in Pittsburgh was really cool to see

- There's a sense of identity for Pittsburgh, I don't think I've ever seen a city with such a strong typographical, color scheme, and history assigned to it. A lot of people seem to like pittsburgh for what it is.

- There's something really cool going on with pgh kind of being crowned a furry capital.

- Some neighborhoods are worse than others, but I think Pittsburgh was actually really clean... I was really surprised since I had read people saying the opposite on here beforehand.

- There's not many visibly homeless people, wayyyy less than what I'm used to.

- Your library system is kind of crazy... I can check out a synthesizer?? Is this finland??

- Pgh seem very handy, Construction Junction and what theyre doing with Repair cafe is so cool. I could learn a thing or two from you guys

Not really sure why I wrote this, anyways thanks! Think i'll be back soon

Issues in the store have been completely ignored, and when I or my assistant manager (ASM) have gone to them asking for help, we‚Äôve been brushed off. The biggest issue has been a supervisor with a history of difficult behaviour towards management, which recently escalated when they stormed off shift, shouted and swore at my ASM, and caused a huge scene in front of customers. The RM saw this, rolled their eyes, and went back to their computer. Instead of addressing it, my RM basically blamed me without outright saying it‚Äîlisting other employees by name and saying, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the issue,‚Äù leaving just me unmentioned.

Regarding this supervisor, this has been an ongoing issue, where they were initially being heard while I wasn‚Äôt. Instead of escalating, I tried to get back on side with the AM & RM. After the recent outburst, the RM chased after the supervisor (who was verbally abusive, aggressive, and body-shaming towards my ASM) to check on them. But when the RM came back into the store, they didn‚Äôt check on my ASM at all‚Äîinstead, they waited 20 minutes before calling them into the office and saying, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened there?‚Äù with zero concern for their wellbeing.

On top of that, my AM advised me to document everything and send it via email to both them and the RM. I did exactly that‚Äîdetailing dates, times, and incidents‚Äîbut got no response. When my ASM later spoke to the RM about the emails, the RM admitted they only read the first line before dismissing them as ‚Äòbullshit‚Äô that didn‚Äôt make sense. They never even read the details, yet gave no feedback to me or my ASM.

Now, I‚Äôm being made to work six days a week, regularly going over my 44-hour contract while pregnant, which is physically draining. Other pregnant employees in the company have had support, reduced hours, or accommodations, but I feel like I‚Äôm just being expected to push through it.

HR has also apparently told my ASM that ‚Äúeverything has been handled correctly,‚Äù which is insane because I‚Äôve had zero support from senior management. I‚Äôve got emails, call logs, and WhatsApp messages proving how many times I‚Äôve asked for help and been ignored, and multiple employees saw the supervisor‚Äôs meltdown and could back me up if it came to it.

To top it all off, my company did a salary review, and I was told no pay increase, despite the fact they‚Äôre offering my temporary cover (a trainee ASM with no previous experience) ¬£31k‚Äîwhich is my salary and will also increase which is signed in contract. The reasoning was ‚Äúthe economic climate,‚Äù but the company made record profits last year. I wanted to raise concerns over this in an email to HR, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll take it seriously.

At this point, I feel like my RM and AM are trying to push me out. I‚Äôm still on probation, and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôre going to fail me to cover their own backs, since they‚Äôre both also on probation. I haven‚Äôt raised a formal grievance yet because I don‚Äôt want to make things worse, but I feel completely helpless and stuck.

I guess my question is: What should I do next? Can they actually fail my probation when I have all this evidence of being treated unfairly? Would going to HR even help, or is it just going to put a target on my back? I‚Äôm considering speaking to my midwife about reducing my hours, but I don‚Äôt know how that would go down either.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated! Thanks for reading.",2,1740613065.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a movement, a force that refuses to be contained, expanding beyond charts and market speculation into something real, something tangible. This past week, the community witnessed yet another milestone as the artist Looby, known on X as @LoobyonSol, brought his vision to life in a live drawing session dedicated to Kendu. (https://x.com/LoobyonSol/status/1894829490200813949 ) The lines he sketched weren‚Äôt just art; they were a reminder that Kendu isn‚Äôt just about tokens or trades but about culture, expression, and belonging.

The takeover isn‚Äôt stopping. Kendu‚Äôs presence in the art world continues to grow, with more creators joining in, their work flooding social media and pushing the project‚Äôs influence further. The Kendu Street Team travels the world making installations at major art events. The Kendu Army spreads stickers and flyers all over the cities of the world. The Kendu Nights Crew takes over nightclubs in India, and makes Kendu-themed cocktails and experiences. Every new piece of Kendu-inspired art adds to the story, reinforcing the idea that this isn‚Äôt just an investment‚Äîit‚Äôs a statement.

Beyond the world of art and culture, Kendu is reaching into everyday life in ways no one saw coming. The energy drink and coffee line aren‚Äôt just gimmicks. They‚Äôre a declaration that Kendu belongs in the real world, that it‚Äôs more than just numbers on a screen. As more people outside the crypto space start recognizing the brand, the momentum only builds. Kendu isn‚Äôt waiting for adoption. It‚Äôs creating it.

On the technical side, the signals are impossible to ignore. The number of holders keeps climbing, social engagement is surging, and behind the scenes, whales are accumulating. These are the moments that precede something big. Kendu has already touched hundreds of millions in market cap before, and with everything lining up, there‚Äôs a feeling in the air that this time, it could go even further.

Looby‚Äôs art session was just another reminder of what‚Äôs happening here. This isn‚Äôt just another token. It‚Äôs a movement that‚Äôs building something unstoppable. The charts will follow, but for those who understand what‚Äôs really going on, the future is already here.

That said for the past 20 years or so I have kept an espresso machine in my master bath. Most of that time I have used a super automatic for espresso only, most recently a gaggia brera that finally gave up. I initially replaced this with a Akita A1 that unfortunately arrived damaged. While I was impressed with the build quality of the Jura while small for a super automatic it was still big. While looking for a smaller alternative I came across the Illy Easy. Designed for the European market it is small, attractive and easy to use. While I don‚Äôt know this for a fact I suspect the US version is just a rewired version. It is only limited availability in the 120v variant. There are YouTube videos showing the setup, calibration and use. Couldn‚Äôt be simpler. After two shots I have the thing dialed in for espresso. I may play with the lungo settings later. The clearance for cups is amazing. Warm up and brew times are fast and it has auto shut off. I have illy intenso pods on hand but there is a wide variety of other brands available on Amazon. It‚Äôs fast and easy to use and the pods are a very clean way to produce espresso. (Been using them in my travels for years with my Handpresso). It is coffee only and you are limited to Italian purveyors of pods vs. any coffee bean you can find. I personally do not find this limiting. If you really had to have a latte or cappuccino I suppose a stand alone frother could work. Cheers. ",1,1740612998.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

2. volcanic grab: you grab your opponent and if it hits you grab their head burning them but if you miss it just fires a short range burst of fire that will ragdoll them if they were just out of range (he did this against Gojo in their first fight as well)
 
3. volcano beam (I don‚Äôt have a good name): you create two volcanoes on the 2 nearest walls facing your opponent (this must be two separate walls) and they fire a beam of lava, if they get hit by both beams it will deal 10% extra damage (this move was used in the shibuya incident. I believe this is the one that was used to take out nanami and maki‚Äôs group)
 
4. spontaneous combustion: this move is like blood rain, anyone who gets near you will take damage but it has a lot less range with the trade off for the range being it sets anyone who gets to close on fire dealing a good chunk of hp, this move is easy to notice as it will make your head burst with flames from the sides and/ or top of your head. A good move to counter teamers but the fire won‚Äôt stun and you are only able to dash and m1 while the skill is active (jogoat did this in season one with kenjaku at the coffee shop) 
 
5. R/special, a counter that will do a very similar effect to Move 4 but with a shorter duration and lower damage and it will ragdoll/ knock them away. This will not prevent you from using skills unlike move 4
 
Awakening:
1. Insect hoard: and improved version of the unawakened version with more insects and better auto tracking, the explosion of the bugs can be blocked but they will still apply a fire tick damage so the only way to completely avoid this is to dodge. 
 
2. explosive grab: you jump forward a little bit and put your hand out with fire, if you miss the animation the move still continues but it works like the locust guy move: crushing jaws, your not guaranteed to hit every punch. If you hit it they are rag dolled just infront of you long enough to hit them with the next punch, this move will have 3-4 punches 
 
3. maximum meteor: after a long charge up with I-frames you release your meteor (there will be an animation of the meteor pulling buildings into it, destroying the map and making it bigger and putting an orange tint on the screens of everyone within the radius (this serves as a warning your about to get hit giving people a little bit of reaction time) your screen will get more orange as the charge up starts (user is unaffected on their screen) (this is the meteor he uses against sukuna in the shibuya arc)
 
4. coffin of the iron mountain: this domain gives sure hit like Gojo‚Äôs/sukuna‚Äôs/mahito‚Äôs domain but your m1s set people on fire and your awakening moves are buffed and the domain is small enough to prevent the meteor from being dodged (so there‚Äôs kind of a sure hit effect) the barrier of this domain from the outside should be black or a dark red (jogo‚Äôs domain as seen in season one)
 
Along with the character there will be a few emotes: 
1. Hot-headed: your head bursts out with flames, this move will be kinda like the recent lightning emote (reference to jogo‚Äôs head bursting with flames when he is mad
 
2. Cool-headed: you pull out a tobacco pipe and hold it in your mouth and sit down (this emote might need some kind of censoring given Roblox probably won‚Äôt like smoking in a game) (reference to jogo smoking from one of these pipes)
 
3. Ball head: your head comes off and you can kick it around like a ball (reference to when jogos head is ripped off and in the juju stroll the other disaster cursed play with it instead of a ball)",2,1740612801.0,JujutsuShenanigans,0,1.0,False

Before conceiving I was using 140mg aimovig monthly and sumatriptan(imatrex) with ibuprofen for breakthrough migraine. I was given permission to continue those until conceiving because of the severity of my migraines. Well I am now about 10 weeks along and I have had a migraine for 3 weeks strait with one random day of reprieve  because my o.b gave me permission to take one 800mg dose of ibuprofen with coffee. I have also been to the e.r once and they did nothing for me. Gave me a tylenol, reglan and benadryl combo that did nothing. My neuro prescribed hydro 5's which make me violently ill so i didnt even fill the script. Yesterday I talked to my o.b again and he prescribed fioricet. Even after having reservations about it I filled the script because I had gotten to a point of desperation. I've even had to quit my job!! I took one pill last night after dinner and after being up and down all night, because my sleep schedule is screwed from lack of sleep due to pain, I woke up with actual relief. It was my first time ever trying this pill and I want to know if other people have tried it and if it had any affect on the baby.

Hopefully everyone here already knows that the rewards Sheetz offers are at best a joke, at worse  a scam.

If you don't know, for every $1 spent, you get 5 points added to your reward card.

But what you get for your points are terrible deals.

A whole sub cost you 1250pts + an extra $0.99.
This is a regular sub, no upcharges either.
Want cheese, pay extra. You have to spend $250.99 to get a free WHOLE sub. 
( 1250 / 5 + .99) = $250.99

A car wash cost 1500pts. You have to spend $300 for a $10 wash...
( 1500 / 5) = $300

Listen, I get it. If your shopping there, it's better to get something over nothing. But it's just way to much to say: hey you spent $40, here's a free PBJ  sandwich.

Here's a break down of some of the items offered.

$20 - free fountain drink.

$70 - free coffee / donut / hotdogs.

$80 - free nuggs.

$140 - free pizza.

$150 - free mozz / 6 inch sub.

$200.99 salad.

By the way I do know that it only cost Sheetz about $1.67 for just the lettuce and chicken at 2022 prices. So yea, think about that when you ""buy"" the salad for $8

If you saw my unsent letter you might be piecing together that I am going through ANOTHER friendship breakup. The reason why, in this case, is truly not clear to me. First he texts me ""Hi love I hope all is well, I am just setting some boundaries but I wish for your continued success."" Now that might sound fine, but contextually he said that **after** refusing to visit me in person for like two years. In spite of calling me his best friend and like twin and all this stuff in the past. Empty words are par for the course with humans tho, so as disappointed as I am, I can't say I am surprised. I wish I could tho. So after he sent me that I pressed him and he hit me back with ""it is my wish that this will pass and we will restore our friendship.... but for right now this is a lot for me."" Nothing burger, word salad of a text. Pretty fucking stupid and nonsensical. You either like someone or you don't clearly he stopped liking me but he doesn't have the balls to try helping me understand why so I can improve myself? Yeah ok buddy. Typical. So I told him off and blocked him and soft blocked him from my mom's socials too. When I am done I am so done it's not even funny. Like I truly, I am checking out from the liberals. 

Because here's something I am now putting together as a dumb fucking pattern in my life. I, a gay women, trust a fellow gay to be my friend, I get close with them, we call ourselves best friends.... and then for one reason or another they get tired of me. They leave. We stop talking. And I end up alone. Different stories, always the same ending. No more. No. Because the conservatives at my parents church? Night and day opposite of that. Fully aware of my flaws and still unwilling to give up on me or anyone else. It's the way I am, that's authentic kindness is what that is. It's becoming rarer and rarer. 

I said to my dad ""the gays have crossed me for the last time, like I swear to fucking God."" But it was tongue and cheek, like I was laughing when I said that and he was like ""you make me laugh, you're such a character, like your uncle."" He was laughing too. Idk if I mean it tho. I do know that my old high school teacher ghosted me, and my former best friend from high school abandoned me and now he abandoned me and all these people identify as liberals. I am not a political person but I am a petty person. So I am starting to consider a political lobbying career for myself. And you can imagine what specific causes I would be most drawn to as a result of like... my anger? (Cough cough, overturn proposition eight.) But I mean, I myself am a bisexual woman who occasionally enjoys homosexual sex and I was always open about that. So idk. Idk if conservatives would have any interest in me or my skillset. And idk if positioning myself as a conservative political activist as a result of pure revenge and spite is the move for myself. But like ????? Fuck this. Oi. Because like I am not going to be a door mat any longer. I didn't deserve to be abandoned by the friends I was counting on when I was going through other shit like grief and joblessness and PTSD symptoms. And actions have consequences. My ex friends will reap what they have sown someday. Not a doubt in my mind. Because I act so Alexander Hamilton in my personal life in the sense that I am first and foremost a grudge holder and secondly weirdly politically motivated and effective. It's my skill set. 

I know part of my reaction to this is my reaction to other shit compounding. My aunt is dead and I am so fucking mad about that. And my uncle is dead and I am so mad about that too. And my phone and earpod case was stolen and that infuriated me. So when it rains it pours but things will turn around for me and I will survive because they always do and I always do. I am disappointed tho. Another lifelong friendship down the drain. I told my parents I pray my life becomes easier because I don't know how long I can survive all of this, they were furiously nodding. Like yeah, of all the people to steal from.... a jobless twenty five year old grieving her dead aunt, trying to heal her ptsd and eating disorder who also frequently tips generously and would have literally just gifted it to you and replaced it if you had bothered to ask? Thanks universe. Hopefully things get easier for me eventually. I have reached my limit and I will either experience kindness or I will kill myself. Either is fine with me but I am sure my family is desperately praying fate pans out in favor of the latter. Which I understand. 

And like my therapists can get me through this rough patch, I know they can. I feel very grateful to have access to the medical treatment which I currently have. (Probs won't last tho, I get kicked off parent insurance in one year and no job in sight LOL). Anyways. I want to end things on a lighter note so I will say, today wasn't a total wash for me. I did have a pretty unpleasant conversation with the manager of the store my items went missing at, because she didn't want to issue any kind of sincere apology or plausible explanation for all this so I will be taking my business elsewhere. As will my supporters. Sad! Live and learn tho I guess!!!! But as for that lighter note. I got nacho cheese fries! 

Not just any nacho fries either, really good ones. I got them at a local comic book store that I love. It's kinda awesome as fuck because a family created it as a small business to give their autistic son a career opportunity so it always has community centered events and super cool, unique product selections. I told the cashier when I was there today ""I am glad you are here, this town has way too many banks and real estate offices."" And they laughed and had to agree. The fries were awesome, I'd been meaning to check out the comic shop's cafe for ages. Now I will absolutely be back. 

And also when I was in the cafe, funnily enough I accidentally saw one of my church pastors meeting with two of the guys from my church. So I allowed myself to be bold and not shy for once and I sat down to talk to them. It was fun! They are very kind, very easy to talk to. And we are all excited for the church's open mic coffee house on Friday. I will be ok. Things are hard for now. But for now is never forever. ",1,1740612482.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

I love candy. Therefore I desperately love flavoured syrups in my coffee. Pumpkin spice, caramel, rapberry, almond, chocolate, hazelnut, you name it and I‚Äôll want it. 

However, I keep accidentally buying sugar free syrups, which let me down. I scrutinize the bottles now to make sure it has that unhealthy dose of unadulterated sugar that I need to wake up and feed my sugar cravings. My love of sugar includes candies like jellybeans, especially a particular name brand that is good quality and actually tastes like the flavours listed.

Imagine my joy when I spotted a bottle of this jellybean brand Toasted Marshmallow Coffee Syrup. I immediately scooped it up after confirming that there was sugar in it, and carried it off home. It was a corn syrup based sugar, but that seemed normal to me.

Opening the bottle I immediately realized it did not smell like marshmallows. It smelled like corn.

I dismissed this and made myself a cup anyways.

I nearly hurled. It was disgusting. It tasted like old corn tortilla chips from the dollar store that had been left to moulder in a basement for a week.

I threw it out, and still resent the loss of potentially delicious marshmallow flavoured coffee

Would love to get some feedback on my ideas :),"I'm currently in the process of building Isibricks' Monumental Natural History museum. As mentioned in a previous post there are things about it I would like to change and as I've worked on the 1st floor more have come to mind. So before I go further with the build I'd like to hear your thoughts on what I'm considering:

1. Replace the mansard style roofs on the sides of 3rd story with terraces.
2. Move the cafe/coffee shop to the 3rd story (with an exit to the terrace).
3. Move space exhibit to where the cafe/coffee shop was on the 1st story (would like to move the 2nd Dino skeleton there, but I think it's too big).
4. Move curators office to the 3rd story (with exit to the 2nd terrace).
5. Move Lego history exhibits to where the curators office was located or the 2nd story.
6. Leave portico at original height.

1iz1725,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1iz1725/why_doesnt_my_nervous_system_relax_until_im/,Why doesn‚Äôt my nervous system relax until I‚Äôm around my husband?,"He seems to be the only one that can make me feel safe. 

A little bit about my childhood.. my parents had a bad marriage. They both shouted a lot but neither listened to the other. It was scary growing up like that because I could never prepare for what type of mood they would be in. My mother especially. If she was happy, all was good. If she was angry or bitter then I would just sit in my room until it safe to come out. Throw in financial issues and physical abuse, multiple suicide attempts by both parents and constantly relocating all over the US to run away from issues that would start all over again as soon as we got ‚Äúsettled in‚Äù.

My entire life lived out in fear. Along came my husband and I didn‚Äôt know what to do with all the respect he showed me. He listened to me. He would look at me and really SEE me as a person. He cared about what I liked and me. He cared about me. 

My parents questioned his intentions when they first met him. My mom even refused to sit at the table with him when I brought him home for the first time. As soon as he left she started yelling ‚Äúwhat do you even see in him? He‚Äôs ugly. Everyone will laugh at you.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs been 10 years of being happily married  and obviously the best decision for myself. However, I‚Äôm very aware and concerned that he‚Äôs the only one that can make me relax. When I‚Äôm at work, then I stay tense until I‚Äôm home with him. If I‚Äôm off from work then I hide and sulk in my bed (the way I did as a child) until he gets home. His presence gives me energy that even 10 cups of coffee couldn‚Äôt. I breathe better. He makes the fear go away. 

It‚Äôs rare, but if anything is off about him then all my childhood fears come back. If he‚Äôs stressed at work or feeling sick then I feel awful until things get better for him. I understand that it‚Äôs not healthy to be so deeply in tune with someone else‚Äôs situation. It‚Äôs times when he feels down that I wish I could be stronger so that MY positive energy could help HIM, but it‚Äôs vice versa. His sadness or illness drains me completely. Thankfully it doesn‚Äôt happen often because he tends to bounce back fast and always looks on the bright side. 

When I‚Äôm alone I always tell myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay you‚Äôre safe now, relax your muscles‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt actually *feel* safe until he‚Äôs around. I do mediation, take walks, salt scrubs and I pray regularly to help relax my nervous system. I want to repair my energy so I‚Äôm not ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù from his positive energy.",10,1740611464.0,energy_work,12,0.92,False
1iz16u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1iz16u8/what_do_you_guys_do_for_hydration_im_so_frustrated/,what do you guys do for hydration? i'm so frustrated,"i was diagnosed about a month ago at this point, and prescribed reglan, which is helping some of the post-eating symptoms but the nausea, lack of appetite, lack of thirst, etc remains.

when i drink, i feel like i've swallowed a bunch of pool water. it comes up into my mouth, and i swallow it down, and it comes up, and down, and up, and down... because i know i can't afford to throw it all up. but i feel like i can only fit so much water in before i feel so nauseous that drinking triggers my gag reflex.

the other issue is that i'm autistic and very sensitive to tastes, and i can taste the electrolytes in every electrolyte drink and i hate it. even the flavorless ones i can taste. i have a huge water bottle, i mix pedialyte with juices, i rarely have soda or coffee or alcohol and i drink as much gatorade and powerade as i can without gagging. i also don't often feel thirst signals, caused by poor interoception in autistics and other neurodivergent people.

i can get in roughly 30-40oz of water a day. sometimes less, sometimes more. the thing is that i don't often puke, i just feel so full of liquid and i can feel it in my throat. i truly do feel like i've swallowed a ton of chlorinated water. occasionally if i really overdo it with the water i'll throw up, but it's rare.

i know i have no option but to drink the stupid electrolytes but i have some small hope that someone has another option.

i was in the er last night for iv fluids, but i know that's not sustainable, and having been newly diagnosed of course they'll want me to exhaust all the other options first. they discharged me with urinary ketones ""over 80"" after two bags of fluids, and i do feel better today, but i know i wont be able to sustain the hydration. i was in urgent care 2-3 weeks ago for the same thing, minus the urine test.

plus, i saw a ""deinfluencing"" tiktok the other day talking about the dangers of scar tissue build-up in veins. i have friends with ports and central lines who are constantly in the hospital with repeated sepsis and infections. i can't do that.

i don't know what to do.

food wise, i don't know. i eat small meals, i take my stupid meds. sometimes i'm so ""not hungry"" that i can't even force myself to eat regardless of the meds, and then i spend so long convincing myself to be hungry enough to eat that i don't even know if it would work anymore. sometimes i give up. i've lost about 10 pounds this month, which i don't think is much, but i haven't been ""trying"" and my diet is abysmally unhealthy.

SIX YEARS LATER




ALAN RUSSELL


The house felt different now.

Not just emptier, but wrong, like the walls had absorbed too much silence, like something vital had been pulled from the bones of it and left a space behind. The air still smelled like my father‚Äîcigarettes, motor oil, aftershave‚Äîbut it was starting to fade, thinning out the way a campfire does after burning all night.

I sat on the edge of my parents‚Äô bed, the weight of the wooden chest heavy in my lap.

The brass latches were stiff with age, but they popped open with a satisfying click, and inside was everything my father had saved from the war. Old photographs, creased and curling at the edges, a deck of playing cards still rubber-banded together, a pocket-sized Bible with the cover nearly worn through. I picked up the dog tags first, rubbing my thumb over the engraved letters, over the ridges and indentations that had pressed into my father‚Äôs skin for years.

Beneath them, nestled in the folds of an olive-green scarf, was the pistol.

A pristine Tokarev TT-33, wrestled from the grasp of a dead Viet Cong soldier. Eight rounds of 7.62x25mm per magazine. As far as Vietnam war trophies go, it was relatively tame, no shrunken heads or human ears.

It was heavier than it looked, heavier than I expected, the cold metal pressing into the warmth of my palm. The engravings on the barrel had faded, dulled by time and use, but they were still there. My father‚Äôs fingers had worn the grip smooth, pressed into the leather with years of use, of maintenance, of knowing exactly what it was for.

The weight of it settled into my hands like something that belonged there.

Downstairs, the front door creaked open. My mother had been in and out of the house all day, accepting casseroles from women who spoke in soft, syrupy voices, pouring cups of coffee she never finished. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she had slept. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had.

Then I closed the chest and took the gun with me.






There was a quiet sort of dignity in how people mourned my father.

They spoke about him plainly, like they were talking about a man who had worked hard and died working hard, and that was all there was to say. No grand speeches. No softening the truth. Just that he had been here, and now he wasn‚Äôt.

It was a closed-casket service.

I hadn‚Äôt asked why. I didn‚Äôt need to.

The service was crowded. My father had known almost everyone in town, built half their houses, poured their driveways, patched their roofs. The men from the fracking sites came in pressed shirts and stiff ties, faces solemn, hands calloused, their grief carried in heavy shoulders and firm handshakes.

I didn‚Äôt cry, I couldn‚Äôt.

My mother didn‚Äôt either. She looked composed, hands folded in her lap, her black dress pressed and neat. But I saw the way her knuckles tensed every few minutes, the way her fingers clenched and unclenched, like she was holding onto something only she could see.

After the burial, people shook my hand, clapped my shoulder, told me how much my father had meant to them. I nodded along, accepted their words, let their hands squeeze around mine like they were passing something onto me, like this was how responsibility was given.

I wasn‚Äôt sure when my father‚Äôs life had become mine to carry, but somehow, it had.




The others were waiting outside the church after the service.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, elbows on his knees, his suit jacket crumpled beside him. Don stood nearby, hands in his pockets, scanning the crowd like he was watching for something. Mac was leaning against a tree, cigarette burning low between his fingers, smoke curling around him like something permanent.

Mac was the first to say something.

‚ÄúYou look like shit.‚Äù

I rolled a cigarette between my fingers, watching the cherry glow in the dimming light. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Mac smirked, but it was softer than usual.

Heather was standing a little apart from them, arms crossed, the hem of her dress brushing against her knees. She looked good. Not in a way I let myself think about too much, but good. Trevor Holloway hadn‚Äôt come. Maybe that meant something. Maybe it didn‚Äôt. But it didn‚Äôt matter, because I still saw her getting out of his car in the mornings, still saw his arm around her in the hallways. The feeling never left my stomach. It curled there, sharp and unspoken, somewhere between nausea and hunger.

Heather caught me looking.

I looked away first.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, suit jacket crumpled beside him, his tie loosened. Don stood next to him, hands in his pockets, looking at me like he was waiting for me to say something first.

I took another drag and let the smoke unfurl between us. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

Don shrugged. ‚ÄúWherever.‚Äù

So we walked.

The town hummed beneath our feet, a low, steady vibration that had once made us wonder, once kept us up at night, whispering theories under the treehouse beams. Now it was just there, constant, familiar, unnoticed‚Äîlike cicadas in the summer, like a ceiling fan spinning above your bed. Something you only really hear when it stops.

Heather used to be the first to notice things. She had been the one dragging us through the woods, writing in notebooks, poking at the edges of the town like she could peel them back and find what was underneath. Now she had new obsessions‚Äîplans, schedules, an entire future mapped out with the kind of precision that made my chest ache if I thought about it too hard. It wasn‚Äôt that she had stopped looking for answers. She had just stopped looking here.

Mac never stopped looking.

Not for answers‚Äîjust for something.

He moved from girl to girl like a man searching for a song he couldn‚Äôt quite remember, all easy grins and restless hands, all charm and detachment. He had kissed half the girls in our school, maybe more, but it never lasted long, never turned into something real. I caught him watching them sometimes, his gaze a little too focused, like he was waiting for something familiar to surface.

Don had changed the least, or maybe he had just solidified‚Äîgrown into the role we had always needed him to play. He was steady, solid, dependable in a way that made the rest of us feel like it was okay to be the messes we were. His jaw had squared, his shoulders broadened, but his eyes were the same. Observant. Quiet. He was steady in a way the rest of us weren‚Äôt, and that was enough.

And Kevin‚ÄîKevin had gone quieter over the years‚Äîstill quick-witted, still laughing, but it didn‚Äôt come as easily as before. He had grown into himself in a way that suited him, though. He had filled out, lost the scrawny, sharp edges of childhood, but he still had the same quick grin, the same spark behind his eyes.

The sun was setting, the sky burning orange and pink, the air cooling into the first real breath of autumn. The street was empty except for us, our footsteps even, the occasional sound of gravel crunching under our shoes.

Mac exhaled smoke through his nose. ‚ÄúYou should get one of those trench coats.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúFor the whole grizzled detective thing,‚Äù Mac clarified, flicking ash off the end of his cigarette.

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd need a fedora, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù Mac said. ‚ÄúOtherwise it‚Äôs just sad.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.

The conversation faded in and out, the occasional jab, the easy rhythm of five people who had known each other too long. But I felt the gun against my ribs, heavy in the pocket of my dad‚Äôs jacket and I thought about the last time I had hidden under a desk, waiting for someone with a gun to decide whether or not I would live. 

That would never happen again, not if I could stop it.






HEATHER ROBINSON

The air was crisp and carried the scent of burning leaves and something fried from a block over‚Äîprobably someone‚Äôs pre-game dinner. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the kind of dusky, bruised sky that made the streetlights flicker to life one by one. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself and stepped up onto Alan‚Äôs driveway, my boots crunching over loose gravel.

Mac was the first one I spotted, leaning against Alan‚Äôs fence, hands stuffed into his pockets, his eyes tracking something down the road. He‚Äôd been the first to show up, which meant he was in one of his moods. Mac never liked being alone unless he was choosing to be alone.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Alan?‚Äù I asked, coming up beside him.

He shrugged without looking at me. ‚ÄúInside. Finishing something.‚Äù

A voice called out from down the street, and I turned to see Kevin and Don making their way toward us. Kevin was still in his work uniform from the auto shop, the top button undone and the sleeves rolled up, grease stains smudged along his wrist. Don had changed, but his hair still had that faintly disheveled look it always got when he had to wrangle his brothers for dinner before heading out.

‚ÄúDid we pick the worst possible night to go?‚Äù Kevin asked, hopping up onto the curb. ‚ÄúI swear, half the town is at this game already. Parking‚Äôs a nightmare.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou drove?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he admitted, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúBut if I had, it would‚Äôve been a nightmare.‚Äù

Don shook his head, giving me a look that said you see what I have to deal with?

The screen door creaked, and Alan stepped out onto the porch.

Alan finally came outside, walking slowly, carefully, like he had just stepped off a battlefield and wasn‚Äôt sure the war was over. His father‚Äôs jacket was zipped up against the wind, but I could see the pack of cigarettes in his pocket, the lighter in his hand, the way his fingers twitched like they wanted something to do.

He looked older.

Not in the way that time ages a person, but in the way that life does. In the way that grief does.

Alan had grown over the last few years, broadening out, filling the space he had once been afraid to take up. He carried himself differently now, more sure of himself, but heavier somehow. His jaw was sharp, his hair cut longer, a few strands falling over his forehead in the wind. His dad‚Äôs jacket was pulled snug over his shoulders, the collar popped up slightly against the wind. He wasn‚Äôt smoking, but I could see the pack shifting in his pocket when he moved, an unlit cigarette already curled between his fingers. I looked at Alan, the way he held the cigarette between his fingers and the way he kept his free hand curled around his father‚Äôs jacket like it could hold him together. He scanned us all once, his eyes resting on me for the briefest of moments, then jerked his chin toward the road.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù




The town pulsed beneath our feet as we made our way down the street, the game was already in full swing by the time we neared the stadium. The distant echo of a whistle, the rhythmic chant of the cheerleaders, the roar of the crowd swelling and dipping in waves‚Äîit was a Friday night in Ashwood, and that meant football.

The warm glow of the stadium lights cast long shadows over the parking lot as we cut across the grass behind the bleachers. I caught a glimpse of Trevor‚Äôs car near the front, parked in the same spot it always was, the paint glinting under the floodlights. My stomach twisted for half a second before I smoothed it over, shoving my hands into my pockets.

Mac must have noticed because his smirk was almost immediate. ‚ÄúGonna go say hi to your boyfriend?‚Äù

I gave him a look. ‚ÄúShut up, Mac.‚Äù

He chuckled, shoving his shoulder into mine as we climbed the steps to the bleachers.

The stands were packed, full of students wrapped in blankets, parents waving down their kids from below, little siblings stuffing their faces with concession stand nachos. The energy in the air was alive, electric in the way that only hometown football could make it.

Alan took the aisle seat, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, eyes scanning the field like he actually cared about the score. Kevin and Don had already started arguing about the last play, and Mac‚Äîwell, Mac was scanning the crowd.

I knew what he was looking for.

The game itself was a blur of movement‚Äîpads colliding, bodies twisting, the snap of the ball echoing under the lights. The home team was ahead, but barely. The Panthers had fumbled once, and the other team had nearly capitalized on it, but their quarterback had crumbled under the pressure at the last second.

I wasn‚Äôt watching the game, though.

I was watching Alan.

He hadn‚Äôt moved much since we sat down, hadn‚Äôt said a word about anything, just sat there, his thumb running absently along the stitching of his dad‚Äôs jacket.

‚ÄúAlan,‚Äù I murmured, nudging him.

He turned to me slowly, like he had to pull himself out of something deep. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

His gaze flickered over my face, something unreadable passing through his expression before he turned back to the field. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him, but I let it go.


The marching band took the field at halftime, their movements precise, the brass section cutting through the cool night air with perfect synchronicity. I had always liked watching them‚Äînot for the music, but for the way they moved together, the way they made something bigger than themselves.

Mac had lost interest in the game entirely. His eyes had locked onto a group of girls near the front of the bleachers, all laughing at something one of them had said. His smirk curled at the edge, easy, practiced.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, feigning innocence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called appreciating beauty, Heather.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt appreciate anything.‚Äù

His smirk faltered‚Äîjust barely‚Äîbut it was there, a flicker of something real before he leaned back, stretching his arms behind his head. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I sure as hell know how to have fun.‚Äù

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way to put it.‚Äù

Mac ignored him, turning his gaze back to the girls.


The game picked up after halftime, the crowd getting louder, the air shifting into something more frantic as the score evened out. People stood up, shouting, fists pumping, bodies moving with every near-miss, every intercepted pass.

At some point, I felt Alan‚Äôs arm brush against mine. It was small, almost nothing, but I felt it. He didn‚Äôt move away and neither did I, even as our team scored the winning touchdown with seconds left on the clock. The crowd erupted as the final whistle blew, students spilling onto the field, players throwing their helmets in the air. It was the kind of victory that mattered here, the kind that people would talk about for weeks.

Alan stood up first, stretching his arms over his head. ‚ÄúYou guys sticking around?‚Äù

Kevin shrugged. ‚ÄúMight hit up the diner.‚Äù

Don nodded. ‚ÄúI could eat.‚Äù

Mac was already halfway down the bleachers, making his way toward the girls from earlier. Alan turned to me, his eyes full of hope, as if to say you coming?
I hesitated, my eyes flicking toward the parking lot. Trevor‚Äôs car was still there, waiting.

Alan saw it, his jaw tensing up, but he didn‚Äôt say anything.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI should‚Äî‚Äù

He nodded once, the hope fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The others started making their way down, their voices blending into the background noise of the crowd. Alan lingered for half a second longer, then he turned and walked away quickly, catching up to Kevin and Don. For half a second, I could have sworn I wasn‚Äôt the only one watching him go.

For half a second, I saw a man in a tweed suit, eyes locked onto Alan‚Äôs body like it belonged to him.

Then he was gone.

I shook my head half-heartedly, clearing my mind, and got in Trevor‚Äôs car.



MAC PETERSON

Alan‚Äôs house looked the same as it always did‚Äîporch light flickering, the scent of cigarettes and something fried lingering in the air, the old truck sitting lopsided in the driveway like it had been there forever. It was a house that had seen a lot of years, a lot of storms, a lot of things it probably wouldn‚Äôt talk about even if houses could.

I kicked a rock as I walked up the steps, feeling the weight of my overnight bag slap against my hip. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I even bothered bringing one. It wasn‚Äôt like we were actually going to sleep.

Kevin and Don were already inside when I got there. Kevin was sprawled on the couch, flipping through channels on the wood-paneled TV like he wasn‚Äôt going to settle on anything. Don had made himself comfortable on the floor, sorting through the pile of junk food we had pooled together, cracking open a can of Coke.

Heather was sitting cross-legged beside him, one of her socks half-off her foot, like she had started pulling it off and forgotten about it.

Alan was in the kitchen, pouring drinks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Kevin called, not looking up.

I dropped my bag by the door, shrugging off my jacket. ‚ÄúTraffic was terrible.‚Äù

Don snorted. ‚ÄúYou walked here.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Heather smirked but didn‚Äôt say anything.

Alan came back into the room, tossing me a beer. ‚ÄúTry not to embarrass yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

The first few hours were easy.

We didn‚Äôt talk about anything serious. We never did when we drank‚Äînot at first. It was just the usual: throwing popcorn at Kevin when he got too into a movie, arguing over who could shotgun a beer the fastest (Don, obviously), mocking Heather when she tried to say she didn‚Äôt care about football but still got pissed when someone insulted her team.

Alan didn‚Äôt drink much. He never really did. But he sat there with us, listening, smirking when Kevin got particularly animated, rolling his eyes when I started talking about girls. He only spoke when spoken to, but that wasn‚Äôt new.

Heather looked at him sometimes, quick furtive glances that she thought no one noticed.

She still noticed him.

Alan sure as hell noticed her.

And I noticed the way it made his jaw tense every time she reached up and played with the necklace she always wore‚Äîthe one Trevor Holloway had given her.

I took a long sip of my beer, leaning back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys remember the last time we did this?‚Äù

Don wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúWhat, got drunk in Alan‚Äôs living room?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, stretching my legs out. ‚ÄúSlept over like this.‚Äù

Heather‚Äôs expression shifted.

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThe treehouse?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could feel him stiffen next to me.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was, what‚Äîfive years ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúLonger,‚Äù Heather murmured.

We all knew what she meant.

Before the shooting.

Before everything.

See, the thing about growing up is that you don‚Äôt always notice it happening.

One day, you‚Äôre stuffing sleeping bags into the treehouse, arguing over who gets the best spot, stuffing your face with candy until you pass out. The next, you‚Äôre sitting in a dimly lit living room, beer in hand, the air too thick with unspoken things.

We weren‚Äôt kids anymore but we didn‚Äôt feel like adults, either. 
Some nebulous thing in between.

Heather tucked her legs up onto the couch, pulling her sleeves over her hands. ‚ÄúWe told stories that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúScary ones.‚Äù

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúYou cried.‚Äù

I pointed my beer at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs slander.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou made Alan walk you back to the house to pee because you thought the Grinning Man was outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was ten,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou were twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound right.‚Äù

Alan finally spoke. ‚ÄúYou also screamed when Don made coyote noises.‚Äù

Don grinned. ‚ÄúOne of my finest moments.‚Äù

I scowled, but the weight in the room had lifted just a little.

We were remembering.

And for a second, it felt good.

We kept drinking.

Not too much. Just enough to feel warm, to let the sharp edges of reality soften, to let the past slip in without it hurting too much.

It wasn‚Äôt long before Kevin and Don got restless.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go night-spotting,‚Äù Kevin said, stretching his arms over his head.

Alan shot him a look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Kevin insisted.

Don finished his beer. ‚ÄúI could go for a drive.‚Äù

I tilted my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys are idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Kevin said.

Alan sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get yourselves killed.‚Äù

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

Heather looked at them like they were insane. ‚ÄúYou seriously want to go wandering around the woods right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Don stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually the worst.‚Äù

Kevin slung an arm around her shoulders. ‚ÄúYou love us.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately.‚Äù

Alan sighed. ‚ÄúFine. But don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù

Kevin clutched his chest. ‚ÄúAlan. Buddy. Brother. Have I ever been stupid?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt bother answering that.

They left a few minutes later, laughing as they stumbled out the door, Don already arguing with Kevin about which backroad they should take. The house was quiet without them, the hum of the fridge the only sound in the kitchen as Alan leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes.

Heather sat on the couch, knees drawn up, the old rotary phone beside her. I watched her for a second, then looked at Alan. His eyes weren‚Äôt on me, but they were locked on her. The weight of it settled between them, thick and quiet and old. I raised my eyebrows and took another sip of my beer. Heather glanced at the phone, which had rung earlier, just once, but she hadn‚Äôt answered it.

I stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúWell, this is deeply uncomfortable, so I‚Äôm gonna take a piss.‚Äù

Heather threw a pillow at me, which I caught easily. But when I glanced back, Alan was still glancing at her and this time, Heather was looking back.




KEVIN SHERMAN

The truck doors groaned as we stepped out, the kind of sound that disappeared into the vast, open dark. The night air hit us immediately‚Äîcold and damp, thick with the scent of leaves and turned earth. The road behind us was long gone, swallowed by the trees, the headlights just a faint glow against the trunks.

Absolutely perfect.

Don slammed the door shut behind him and adjusted his jacket. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, voice low, steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I flicked my eagle-engraved Zippo open and closed in my pocket, the tiny metal click sharp against the quiet.

The first few steps into the woods were easy. The moon was out, slipping between the bare branches, casting silver streaks across the forest floor. The air was still, but not silent‚Äîcrickets chirped somewhere in the distance, and every so often, the wind nudged the trees, shifting them in place.

‚ÄúFeels different tonight,‚Äù Don murmured.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice light. ‚ÄúSpooky.‚Äù

He huffed a quiet laugh but didn‚Äôt argue. We kept walking further into the brush. The deeper we went, the quieter everything became. 

The wind faded first, like it had gotten bored and moved on. Then the crickets, their calls thinning out until there was only one or two, then none at all, until our footsteps were the only thing left‚Äîboots scuffing against the dirt, the occasional snap of a twig underfoot.

I had been coming out here long enough to know what normal sounded like and this definitely wasn‚Äôt it. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself, glancing at Don, who‚Äôd clearly noticed it too. His jaw was tense, his hand gripping the flashlight a little tighter than before. But he didn‚Äôt say anything and so neither did I.

It came from somewhere up ahead.

A low, dragging sound‚Äîlike something heavy shifting through the brush. Don stopped walking. The noise stretched out, just long enough to feel wrong, then it stopped.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúDeer?‚Äù

Don shook his head. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

We listened for a moment, the trees tall and motionless, branches twisted up toward the sky.

Nothing, then‚Äîanother sound.

Closer.

We moved without speaking, our feet careful, quiet, picking through the leaves and brambles as we followed the sound.

It wasn‚Äôt running or even walking.

Just shifting‚Äîwaiting.

The woods thickened, the trees pressing closer together, the ground sloping downward. I could feel the weight of the dark now, the kind that settled deep in your ribs, that made you want to move slower, breathe quieter.

Don lifted the flashlight but didn‚Äôt turn it on. We didn‚Äôt need it yet, the moonlight was just enough to see the shape of things‚Äîthe uneven ground, the jagged rocks, the bushes barely concealing whatever it was that lied ahead.

We kept going, just a few more steps.



MAC PETERSON

The thing about drinking at Alan‚Äôs house is that it doesn‚Äôt really feel like drinking.

There‚Äôs no music blaring, no rowdy gambling, no crowd of people shouting over each other. It‚Äôs just the three of us‚Äîme, Alan, and Heather‚Äîsitting in his dimly lit living room. The place never changed. The couch was the same couch we used to sit on when we were kids, watching movies and eating frozen pizza off paper plates. The kitchen still smelled like cigarette smoke, grease, and the faintest trace of his mom‚Äôs perfume. The fridge still rattled sometimes, like it was struggling to keep up.  

So it was easy to forget that we weren‚Äôt kids anymore.  

Heather was sitting cross-legged on the floor, twirling an empty bottle between her fingers, the sleeves of her sweater pulled halfway over her hands. Alan was slumped back in the recliner, the sleeves of his dad‚Äôs jacket pushed up, one leg hooked over the armrest,  nursing his drink. I was stretched out on the couch, one foot resting on the coffee table, the other planted against the floor to keep the room from tilting too much.

Alan had broken into his dad‚Äôs stash, which meant we weren‚Äôt just drinking beer anymore. He told us not to worry about it, that his mother was out late again and he figured she was probably seeing someone new.

Heather had been slowly sipping her whiskey, but Alan and I had both lost track of how many shots we‚Äôd taken. I could feel the warmth crawling up the back of my neck, settling into my chest, making my limbs feel loose and heavy.

Heather rolled the bottle between her hands. ‚ÄúYou think Kevin and Don got anything?‚Äù

Alan shrugged. ‚ÄúThey better not come back empty-handed. They won‚Äôt shut up about tradition, but they haven‚Äôt actually shot anything in, what, three years?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù I said, smirking. ‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs counting?‚Äù

Alan huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt know why they bother.‚Äù

Heather tilted her head back against the couch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun, I guess. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think they actually care about hunting anymore.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThen why go?‚Äù

Heather took a sip of her drink, then shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I saw the way his fingers tensed slightly around the glass before he set it down on the side table.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy is Alan the only one with a comfortable chair?‚Äù  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúBecause he lives here.‚Äù  

‚ÄúUnacceptable.‚Äù I pointed at Alan. ‚ÄúShare.‚Äù  

Alan rolled his head to the side and gave me a deadpan look. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  

I groaned dramatically and let my arm flop off the couch. ‚ÄúHeather, back me up.‚Äù  

Heather took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúMac, shut up.‚Äù  

‚ÄúTraitor.‚Äù  

She just shrugged.  

Alan exhaled, flicking a cigarette against the table, watching the ash tumble onto an old coaster. ‚ÄúYou guys ever think about how stupid we were?‚Äù  

I snorted. ‚ÄúBuddy, I think about it constantly.‚Äù  

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alan said. ‚ÄúI mean, like‚Äîback then. When we were kids.‚Äù  

Heather raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù  

Alan rolled his cigarette between his fingers, his eyes distant. ‚ÄúThe treehouse. The stories. All that crap we used to think was real.‚Äù  

Heather tilted her head back, humming thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWe were kids. Kids believe dumb stuff.‚Äù  

Alan exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  

I stretched, rolling onto my side. ‚ÄúI mean, we could‚Äôve been right about some things.‚Äù  

Alan scoffed.  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúMac, if you‚Äôre about to bring up the Grinning Man again, I swear to God‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúI am just saying,‚Äù I said, lifting my hands in mock surrender, ‚Äúwe never really proved any of it wasn‚Äôt real, either.‚Äù  

Alan shot me a look. ‚ÄúYou wanna go back out there and check?‚Äù  

I laughed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù  


I don‚Äôt know how long we sat there, the warmth of the alcohol making the room feel smaller, hazier, like the walls were pressing in just slightly. At some point, Alan had started flipping a pocket knife open and closed, the small metal snick breaking the quiet every few seconds.

It was Heather who noticed first.

She frowned, sitting up a little straighter. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

I pulled my sleeve up and squinted at my watch. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù I blinked. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

Alan glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost three.‚Äù

Heather stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still not back?‚Äù

Alan frowned.

The thing about Kevin and Don was that they never stayed out this late‚Äînot for spotting. Even when they got really into it, they were always back by one, maybe two if they had to hike back from a good clearing.

We all sat there for a moment, letting that realization settle in.

Then Alan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù He pushed himself up, a little unsteady. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Heather blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find them.‚Äù

I groaned, throwing my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just assume they passed out in the truck or something?‚Äù

Alan shot me a look.

I sighed. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Heather was already grabbing her jacket.

And just like that, we were out the door.

The short walk to the truck in the driveway was easy.

Driving was not.

Alan had sobered up just enough to keep the truck from careening into a ditch, but we were still sloppy‚ÄîHeather kept adjusting the radio like the right song would make us less drunk, I had my head against the window, the glass cold against my temple, and Alan was gripping the wheel a little too tight.

The road was empty, nothing but miles of trees and dark sky stretching out ahead of us.

When we finally reached the pull-off where Kevin and Don had parked earlier, the truck was still there, untouched.

The cab was empty.

Heather‚Äôs fingers curled into her sleeves. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, exhaling. ‚ÄúThey probably just hiked in deep.‚Äù

Alan killed the engine. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

The moment we stepped out, the cold hit.

Not just temperature-wise‚Äîthough that was bad enough‚Äîbut the kind of quiet that settled over you like a weight, pressing into your chest.

We were drunk.

We were so drunk.

And this was a very bad idea.

Heather pulled out the flashlight and flicked it on. ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù she said.

We followed her.

Walking in a straight line was impossible.  

The deeper we went, the worse it got.

The trees were too tall, their branches curling overhead, blocking out what little moonlight there was, and the ground felt too soft under my boots. I could still hear the wind, but it was distant‚Äîlike it was moving around this part of the woods, avoiding it entirely. The cold had settled in deep, slipping under our jackets, sinking into our skin. 

Heather had the flashlight.  

Alan had his gun.  

I had nothing, except for a growing sense of unease.  

‚ÄúKevin!‚Äù Heather called.  

Silence. 

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äî‚Äù

A voice.

Not Kevin‚Äôs.

Not Don‚Äôs.

Up ahead, low and sharp, a voice that did not belong to us barked something in the distance.

Heather‚Äôs breath hitched.

Then‚Äî  

A flashlight beam cut through the trees.  

Alan grabbed my arm and yanked me down.  

The three of us dropped into the underbrush just as the flashlight swept overhead. Heather was pressed against my side, Alan crouched low next to me, his fingers tight around my sleeve.  

The three of us dropped low, pressing into the underbrush as the flashlight swept overhead. My breath burned in my throat, my heartbeat slamming in my ears. Alan‚Äôs grip on my sleeve was tight enough to cut off circulation.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù a voice muttered.

Another voice‚Äîgruffer, older‚Äîgrumbled something back.

Heather‚Äôs fingers dug into my jacket.

Two voices, one gruff, one younger.  

‚ÄúThought I heard something,‚Äù one of them muttered.  

‚ÄúYou hear a lot of things in these woods,‚Äù the other said, unimpressed.  

I didn‚Äôt dare to breathe as the light swept past us again.  

Then‚Äîa rustle.  

Heather had shifted, barely, but it was enough. The flashlight snapped back towards us, indignant in the fury of the beam.

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt hesitate.  

He grabbed my arm‚Äîgrabbed Heather‚Äôs‚Äîand hissed, ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù  

And we ran. Running drunk is not fun. My legs didn‚Äôt move right, my lungs burned immediately, and I barely missed slamming into a tree twice.  

Alan was ahead of us, moving fast, Heather keeping close behind him. The voices behind us were yelling, but they weren‚Äôt chasing us, just shouting, their beams of light cutting through the trees like searchlights.  

We burst out of the woods like we‚Äôd been spat out, lungs burning, hearts slamming.

The moment we broke out onto the road, we didn‚Äôt stop running.  

Not until Alan‚Äôs house was in sight.  

Not until my knees nearly buckled.  

Not until we stumbled into the living room, out of breath, shaking, and still very, very drunk.  

Nobody spoke.  

Heather dropped onto the couch, burying her face in her hands.  

Alan stood near the door, hands on his knees, catching his breath.  

I flopped onto the recliner, my heart still hammering.  

Eventually, Heather groaned.  

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat was terrible.‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt answer.  

I rubbed my face. ‚ÄúKevin and Don probably just‚Ä¶ finally got a kill and it‚Äôs taking them a while to drag it back.‚Äù  

Heather sighed. 

Alan ran a hand through his hair.  

Then he grabbed a beer from the counter, popped the top, and said‚Äî  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, but we‚Äôll get the truck in the morning.‚Äù

Old San Juan /San Juan: stayed at 352 Guesthouse and it was a great location (not too loud). They offered free breakfast and had a rooftop jacuzzi to use. Fave foods: cafeteria Mallorca, cafe el punto, marmalade, cocina al fondo, bistro cafe. We walked to el morro and Castillo San Cristobal, which was great to learn about the history!

We did the Airbnb experience of el Yunque tour with transportation from SJ. It was amazing and they took us to a local place with great smoothies and local food. https://www.airbnb.com/l/kVLsXkKR 

Next two days, we got a car rental from Enterprise at Condado plaza hotel. It was quick and easy to get our car. We drove 35 mins to Hacienda Mu√±oz to do their English coffee tour at 10am. It was very informative and we bought some coffee beans. We stayed at Luquillo Sunrise beach inn for the next 2 nights to visit the NE coast. It‚Äôs right next to the beach which is nice but very no-frills place. Fave foods: La Fonda gourmet (go early since there‚Äôs a wait), el Terru√±o at the Luquillo kioskos (park behind the kiosks). Got a rly nice massage at Chispa massage but kinda pricey ($150/hr for deep tissue) 

Next day, we drove about an hr to Guavate / pork highway at 10am before the lunch crowds. The drive was relatively easy and we went to lechonera el mojito, which is one of the first stops. Their lechon was super flavorful and tender. We also got a bunch of food at el rancho original. Their lechon skin was more crunchy and their sides were also delicious, especially the yuca marinated in garlic oil. Afterwards, we went to hangout at seven seas beach in Farjardo. They had alot of shade, public bathrooms, and $5 parking. We wanted to go to La Estacion for dinner but their system was down unfortunately. We had good chicken tacos at Los changuitos cantina instead. 

The last part of our trip was in Vieques! We took a 30 min VAL flight from SIG. The plane was tiny so I was scared a bit üòÖ but the views were amazing. We rented a car from Maritzas car rental and we stayed at Malecon House in Esperanza. It was a great location with a beautiful ocean view room. We did a morning shore snorkeling tour with Black Beard Sports. We got to see sea turtles, barracuda, and so many diff fish! We also did the bio bay tour with them and they were super informative and seamless with the logistics. The bio bay was so surreal and it looked like glowing glitter in the water. 

We also had a fantastic beach day at Media Luna beach which is was recommended to us. It‚Äôs def more of a bumpy drive to get there but the beach was more secluded. The water is pretty shallow as well. It was nice for the hotel to give us beach chairs, beach umbrella, and a cooler for our drinks and snacks! Our fave foods: rancho choli, restaurants bili, Al sarten, vieques food park. Lastly, we wanted to do a special spa day at Beatriz beauty boutique. We got the couples island bliss retreat package that included foot soak, coffee body scrub, full body massage, and a light lunch! Def a splurge for a special occasion üòä

If you love coffee, one of my husbands highlight was visiting Vieques Coffee Roasters. He was in search of a good dark roast coffee and Gary was so friendly and educated us about his farm to cup coffee beans (high quality and smooth).

Flew back to SJ and had early dinner at La Cueva Del Mar, which was recommended to us from a local friend. Their fried red snapper and yucafongo were delicious! If you need to store your luggage, Palm skys in San Juan was great and affordable! We didn‚Äôt rly enjoy Distrito t-mobile since we didn‚Äôt want to eat overpriced food or play arcade games üòÖ

Overall, we loved our first-time trip to PR and would love to come back to visit the west side! ",6,1740611361.0,PuertoRicoTravel,2,1.0,False

I went over to his place tonight to drop off some stuff he left at my place (some hoodies,etc.) and to pick up some things I left at his. He answered when I knocked and very awkwardly asked why I was there. I gave him the bag with his stuff and asked for my things, he said sure but wasn't sure where it was so I could come in to grab it. As I gathered my clothes and stuff he went to his room and shut the door (very mature). 

Before I left I knocked on his door and went in, he looked super uncomfortable so I just said ""Hey, I'm gonna head out, just wanted to say that I'm sorry for ruining the moment and in case you didn't know it was totally an accident. But either way I didn't appreciate being shut out and ghosted and would have appreciated an honest response even if it was just a quick text.""

He did apologise and mentioned that he'd built up the moment of our first time in his head and just got really disappointed over the moment being wrecked like that. He admitted he overreacted but that he didn't want to continue seeing me. I apologised again for spoiling the moment and reiterated that it wasn't on purpose, I thanked him for the months we had together and wished him well. 

I'm home now snuggling with my dog and watching Smosh videos, as people said in the original post, I'm sure I'll find this funny in the future\*\*

I (24F) have been seeing ""Tom""(27) for a few months. We met on Hinge and got along so I asked him out for coffee.¬†

I was super nervous as I've only really dated women, but it went really well. Tom was sweet and funny and we found a mutual love of video games and our dogs. There was literally no awkwardness besides the initial ""omg how do I act like a person"" phase.

4ish months later and things are going really well. Things have felt fairly serious, we've met each others friend groups and spend a lot of time at each others places. We have a really open dialogue with each other that I've never really experienced before, which has made me feel very comfortable with him (which I think is where I messed up).

On Friday night I went over to his place to watch a film. He had cooked a lasagna, which we ate at the table and then settled down on the sofa and cuddled while we watched. After a while we were making out and I could see that things were headed towards sex.¬†Now, we've not actually had sex at this point as I take a while to be comfortable with someone enough for it (which he has been aware of since day 1), so I was nervous as hell but I was feeling ready. The other thing to know about me is I have IBS and get insanely gassy when I'm nervous, especially when I've had dairy.¬†

So we move to his room and things are going well but he goes to lift my leg over his hip which pushed out the loudest fart. Like it sounded like an engine had backfired. I was mortified. Not only that, but it definitely wasn't odourless. All was silent for a second and I just lost it, I started giggling a little which devolved into tears streaming down my face and stomach cramps. I think it was half a nervous reaction to the silence and half me having the humour of a 5 year old. Also, when I've been with women in the past and one of us has passed gas we laughed at it and moved on so I thought it was a pretty normal reaction.

When I got myself under control I realised Tom was gone. Like he had fully left his bedroom. I got up and found him in the living room sat with his arms crossed and a face like a slapped arse. I won't lie, my initial thought was that he'd left because of the smell because it defintely wasn't roses and vanilla. However, when I asked him what was wrong he said that I was ""disgusting"" and he couldn't believe that I was this immature to laugh at something so gross when we were about to have sex and that I ""killed his boner"".

I was completely floored and couldn't think of anything to say other than ""I'm sorry?"" to which he looked away and told me he wanted to be alone for a bit and he thought I should leave. I asked him if he was dumping me ""over a fucking fart"" and he said he wasn't sure so I just got dressed, got my stuff, and left. I haven't heard anything from him since, despite me messaging and calling.

I've left voicemails asking for him to just call because I genuinely have no idea what happened and I'm just spiraling because there's no way I've just been dumped over a fart. I have no idea how to move forward with this or how to get him to talk to me. Ive never been in a situation like this and I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone in real life (I also feel like my friends will just take the piss out of the situation). How do I approach this and get him to talk with me as I feel like we've been together long enough that I deserve an actual explanation? Sorry this is so long.

TLDR; I accidentally farted during sexy times and my bf called me disgusting and immature for laughing and asked me to leave. Now I haven't heard from him in like 4 days and I don't know what to do. Please help.",1,1740611252.0,u_OlivineKeiki,0,1.0,False

SIX YEARS LATER




ALAN RUSSELL


The house felt different now.

Not just emptier, but wrong, like the walls had absorbed too much silence, like something vital had been pulled from the bones of it and left a space behind. The air still smelled like my father‚Äîcigarettes, motor oil, aftershave‚Äîbut it was starting to fade, thinning out the way a campfire does after burning all night.

I sat on the edge of my parents‚Äô bed, the weight of the wooden chest heavy in my lap.

The brass latches were stiff with age, but they popped open with a satisfying click, and inside was everything my father had saved from the war. Old photographs, creased and curling at the edges, a deck of playing cards still rubber-banded together, a pocket-sized Bible with the cover nearly worn through. I picked up the dog tags first, rubbing my thumb over the engraved letters, over the ridges and indentations that had pressed into my father‚Äôs skin for years.

Beneath them, nestled in the folds of an olive-green scarf, was the pistol.

A pristine Tokarev TT-33, wrestled from the grasp of a dead Viet Cong soldier. Eight rounds of 7.62x25mm per magazine. As far as Vietnam war trophies go, it was relatively tame, no shrunken heads or human ears.

It was heavier than it looked, heavier than I expected, the cold metal pressing into the warmth of my palm. The engravings on the barrel had faded, dulled by time and use, but they were still there. My father‚Äôs fingers had worn the grip smooth, pressed into the leather with years of use, of maintenance, of knowing exactly what it was for.

The weight of it settled into my hands like something that belonged there.

Downstairs, the front door creaked open. My mother had been in and out of the house all day, accepting casseroles from women who spoke in soft, syrupy voices, pouring cups of coffee she never finished. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she had slept. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had.

Then I closed the chest and took the gun with me.






There was a quiet sort of dignity in how people mourned my father.

They spoke about him plainly, like they were talking about a man who had worked hard and died working hard, and that was all there was to say. No grand speeches. No softening the truth. Just that he had been here, and now he wasn‚Äôt.

It was a closed-casket service.

I hadn‚Äôt asked why. I didn‚Äôt need to.

The service was crowded. My father had known almost everyone in town, built half their houses, poured their driveways, patched their roofs. The men from the fracking sites came in pressed shirts and stiff ties, faces solemn, hands calloused, their grief carried in heavy shoulders and firm handshakes.

I didn‚Äôt cry, I couldn‚Äôt.

My mother didn‚Äôt either. She looked composed, hands folded in her lap, her black dress pressed and neat. But I saw the way her knuckles tensed every few minutes, the way her fingers clenched and unclenched, like she was holding onto something only she could see.

After the burial, people shook my hand, clapped my shoulder, told me how much my father had meant to them. I nodded along, accepted their words, let their hands squeeze around mine like they were passing something onto me, like this was how responsibility was given.

I wasn‚Äôt sure when my father‚Äôs life had become mine to carry, but somehow, it had.




The others were waiting outside the church after the service.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, elbows on his knees, his suit jacket crumpled beside him. Don stood nearby, hands in his pockets, scanning the crowd like he was watching for something. Mac was leaning against a tree, cigarette burning low between his fingers, smoke curling around him like something permanent.

Mac was the first to say something.

‚ÄúYou look like shit.‚Äù

I rolled a cigarette between my fingers, watching the cherry glow in the dimming light. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Mac smirked, but it was softer than usual.

Heather was standing a little apart from them, arms crossed, the hem of her dress brushing against her knees. She looked good. Not in a way I let myself think about too much, but good. Trevor Holloway hadn‚Äôt come. Maybe that meant something. Maybe it didn‚Äôt. But it didn‚Äôt matter, because I still saw her getting out of his car in the mornings, still saw his arm around her in the hallways. The feeling never left my stomach. It curled there, sharp and unspoken, somewhere between nausea and hunger.

Heather caught me looking.

I looked away first.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, suit jacket crumpled beside him, his tie loosened. Don stood next to him, hands in his pockets, looking at me like he was waiting for me to say something first.

I took another drag and let the smoke unfurl between us. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

Don shrugged. ‚ÄúWherever.‚Äù

So we walked.

The town hummed beneath our feet, a low, steady vibration that had once made us wonder, once kept us up at night, whispering theories under the treehouse beams. Now it was just there, constant, familiar, unnoticed‚Äîlike cicadas in the summer, like a ceiling fan spinning above your bed. Something you only really hear when it stops.

Heather used to be the first to notice things. She had been the one dragging us through the woods, writing in notebooks, poking at the edges of the town like she could peel them back and find what was underneath. Now she had new obsessions‚Äîplans, schedules, an entire future mapped out with the kind of precision that made my chest ache if I thought about it too hard. It wasn‚Äôt that she had stopped looking for answers. She had just stopped looking here.

Mac never stopped looking.

Not for answers‚Äîjust for something.

He moved from girl to girl like a man searching for a song he couldn‚Äôt quite remember, all easy grins and restless hands, all charm and detachment. He had kissed half the girls in our school, maybe more, but it never lasted long, never turned into something real. I caught him watching them sometimes, his gaze a little too focused, like he was waiting for something familiar to surface.

Don had changed the least, or maybe he had just solidified‚Äîgrown into the role we had always needed him to play. He was steady, solid, dependable in a way that made the rest of us feel like it was okay to be the messes we were. His jaw had squared, his shoulders broadened, but his eyes were the same. Observant. Quiet. He was steady in a way the rest of us weren‚Äôt, and that was enough.

And Kevin‚ÄîKevin had gone quieter over the years‚Äîstill quick-witted, still laughing, but it didn‚Äôt come as easily as before. He had grown into himself in a way that suited him, though. He had filled out, lost the scrawny, sharp edges of childhood, but he still had the same quick grin, the same spark behind his eyes.

The sun was setting, the sky burning orange and pink, the air cooling into the first real breath of autumn. The street was empty except for us, our footsteps even, the occasional sound of gravel crunching under our shoes.

Mac exhaled smoke through his nose. ‚ÄúYou should get one of those trench coats.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúFor the whole grizzled detective thing,‚Äù Mac clarified, flicking ash off the end of his cigarette.

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd need a fedora, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù Mac said. ‚ÄúOtherwise it‚Äôs just sad.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.

The conversation faded in and out, the occasional jab, the easy rhythm of five people who had known each other too long. But I felt the gun against my ribs, heavy in the pocket of my dad‚Äôs jacket and I thought about the last time I had hidden under a desk, waiting for someone with a gun to decide whether or not I would live. 

That would never happen again, not if I could stop it.






HEATHER ROBINSON

The air was crisp and carried the scent of burning leaves and something fried from a block over‚Äîprobably someone‚Äôs pre-game dinner. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the kind of dusky, bruised sky that made the streetlights flicker to life one by one. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself and stepped up onto Alan‚Äôs driveway, my boots crunching over loose gravel.

Mac was the first one I spotted, leaning against Alan‚Äôs fence, hands stuffed into his pockets, his eyes tracking something down the road. He‚Äôd been the first to show up, which meant he was in one of his moods. Mac never liked being alone unless he was choosing to be alone.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Alan?‚Äù I asked, coming up beside him.

He shrugged without looking at me. ‚ÄúInside. Finishing something.‚Äù

A voice called out from down the street, and I turned to see Kevin and Don making their way toward us. Kevin was still in his work uniform from the auto shop, the top button undone and the sleeves rolled up, grease stains smudged along his wrist. Don had changed, but his hair still had that faintly disheveled look it always got when he had to wrangle his brothers for dinner before heading out.

‚ÄúDid we pick the worst possible night to go?‚Äù Kevin asked, hopping up onto the curb. ‚ÄúI swear, half the town is at this game already. Parking‚Äôs a nightmare.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou drove?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he admitted, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúBut if I had, it would‚Äôve been a nightmare.‚Äù

Don shook his head, giving me a look that said you see what I have to deal with?

The screen door creaked, and Alan stepped out onto the porch.

Alan finally came outside, walking slowly, carefully, like he had just stepped off a battlefield and wasn‚Äôt sure the war was over. His father‚Äôs jacket was zipped up against the wind, but I could see the pack of cigarettes in his pocket, the lighter in his hand, the way his fingers twitched like they wanted something to do.

He looked older.

Not in the way that time ages a person, but in the way that life does. In the way that grief does.

Alan had grown over the last few years, broadening out, filling the space he had once been afraid to take up. He carried himself differently now, more sure of himself, but heavier somehow. His jaw was sharp, his hair cut longer, a few strands falling over his forehead in the wind. His dad‚Äôs jacket was pulled snug over his shoulders, the collar popped up slightly against the wind. He wasn‚Äôt smoking, but I could see the pack shifting in his pocket when he moved, an unlit cigarette already curled between his fingers. I looked at Alan, the way he held the cigarette between his fingers and the way he kept his free hand curled around his father‚Äôs jacket like it could hold him together. He scanned us all once, his eyes resting on me for the briefest of moments, then jerked his chin toward the road.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù




The town pulsed beneath our feet as we made our way down the street, the game was already in full swing by the time we neared the stadium. The distant echo of a whistle, the rhythmic chant of the cheerleaders, the roar of the crowd swelling and dipping in waves‚Äîit was a Friday night in Ashwood, and that meant football.

The warm glow of the stadium lights cast long shadows over the parking lot as we cut across the grass behind the bleachers. I caught a glimpse of Trevor‚Äôs car near the front, parked in the same spot it always was, the paint glinting under the floodlights. My stomach twisted for half a second before I smoothed it over, shoving my hands into my pockets.

Mac must have noticed because his smirk was almost immediate. ‚ÄúGonna go say hi to your boyfriend?‚Äù

I gave him a look. ‚ÄúShut up, Mac.‚Äù

He chuckled, shoving his shoulder into mine as we climbed the steps to the bleachers.

The stands were packed, full of students wrapped in blankets, parents waving down their kids from below, little siblings stuffing their faces with concession stand nachos. The energy in the air was alive, electric in the way that only hometown football could make it.

Alan took the aisle seat, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, eyes scanning the field like he actually cared about the score. Kevin and Don had already started arguing about the last play, and Mac‚Äîwell, Mac was scanning the crowd.

I knew what he was looking for.

The game itself was a blur of movement‚Äîpads colliding, bodies twisting, the snap of the ball echoing under the lights. The home team was ahead, but barely. The Panthers had fumbled once, and the other team had nearly capitalized on it, but their quarterback had crumbled under the pressure at the last second.

I wasn‚Äôt watching the game, though.

I was watching Alan.

He hadn‚Äôt moved much since we sat down, hadn‚Äôt said a word about anything, just sat there, his thumb running absently along the stitching of his dad‚Äôs jacket.

‚ÄúAlan,‚Äù I murmured, nudging him.

He turned to me slowly, like he had to pull himself out of something deep. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

His gaze flickered over my face, something unreadable passing through his expression before he turned back to the field. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him, but I let it go.


The marching band took the field at halftime, their movements precise, the brass section cutting through the cool night air with perfect synchronicity. I had always liked watching them‚Äînot for the music, but for the way they moved together, the way they made something bigger than themselves.

Mac had lost interest in the game entirely. His eyes had locked onto a group of girls near the front of the bleachers, all laughing at something one of them had said. His smirk curled at the edge, easy, practiced.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, feigning innocence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called appreciating beauty, Heather.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt appreciate anything.‚Äù

His smirk faltered‚Äîjust barely‚Äîbut it was there, a flicker of something real before he leaned back, stretching his arms behind his head. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I sure as hell know how to have fun.‚Äù

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way to put it.‚Äù

Mac ignored him, turning his gaze back to the girls.


The game picked up after halftime, the crowd getting louder, the air shifting into something more frantic as the score evened out. People stood up, shouting, fists pumping, bodies moving with every near-miss, every intercepted pass.

At some point, I felt Alan‚Äôs arm brush against mine. It was small, almost nothing, but I felt it. He didn‚Äôt move away and neither did I, even as our team scored the winning touchdown with seconds left on the clock. The crowd erupted as the final whistle blew, students spilling onto the field, players throwing their helmets in the air. It was the kind of victory that mattered here, the kind that people would talk about for weeks.

Alan stood up first, stretching his arms over his head. ‚ÄúYou guys sticking around?‚Äù

Kevin shrugged. ‚ÄúMight hit up the diner.‚Äù

Don nodded. ‚ÄúI could eat.‚Äù

Mac was already halfway down the bleachers, making his way toward the girls from earlier. Alan turned to me, his eyes full of hope, as if to say you coming?
I hesitated, my eyes flicking toward the parking lot. Trevor‚Äôs car was still there, waiting.

Alan saw it, his jaw tensing up, but he didn‚Äôt say anything.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI should‚Äî‚Äù

He nodded once, the hope fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The others started making their way down, their voices blending into the background noise of the crowd. Alan lingered for half a second longer, then he turned and walked away quickly, catching up to Kevin and Don. For half a second, I could have sworn I wasn‚Äôt the only one watching him go.

For half a second, I saw a man in a tweed suit, eyes locked onto Alan‚Äôs body like it belonged to him.

Then he was gone.

I shook my head half-heartedly, clearing my mind, and got in Trevor‚Äôs car.



MAC PETERSON

Alan‚Äôs house looked the same as it always did‚Äîporch light flickering, the scent of cigarettes and something fried lingering in the air, the old truck sitting lopsided in the driveway like it had been there forever. It was a house that had seen a lot of years, a lot of storms, a lot of things it probably wouldn‚Äôt talk about even if houses could.

I kicked a rock as I walked up the steps, feeling the weight of my overnight bag slap against my hip. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I even bothered bringing one. It wasn‚Äôt like we were actually going to sleep.

Kevin and Don were already inside when I got there. Kevin was sprawled on the couch, flipping through channels on the wood-paneled TV like he wasn‚Äôt going to settle on anything. Don had made himself comfortable on the floor, sorting through the pile of junk food we had pooled together, cracking open a can of Coke.

Heather was sitting cross-legged beside him, one of her socks half-off her foot, like she had started pulling it off and forgotten about it.

Alan was in the kitchen, pouring drinks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Kevin called, not looking up.

I dropped my bag by the door, shrugging off my jacket. ‚ÄúTraffic was terrible.‚Äù

Don snorted. ‚ÄúYou walked here.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Heather smirked but didn‚Äôt say anything.

Alan came back into the room, tossing me a beer. ‚ÄúTry not to embarrass yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

The first few hours were easy.

We didn‚Äôt talk about anything serious. We never did when we drank‚Äînot at first. It was just the usual: throwing popcorn at Kevin when he got too into a movie, arguing over who could shotgun a beer the fastest (Don, obviously), mocking Heather when she tried to say she didn‚Äôt care about football but still got pissed when someone insulted her team.

Alan didn‚Äôt drink much. He never really did. But he sat there with us, listening, smirking when Kevin got particularly animated, rolling his eyes when I started talking about girls. He only spoke when spoken to, but that wasn‚Äôt new.

Heather looked at him sometimes, quick furtive glances that she thought no one noticed.

She still noticed him.

Alan sure as hell noticed her.

And I noticed the way it made his jaw tense every time she reached up and played with the necklace she always wore‚Äîthe one Trevor Holloway had given her.

I took a long sip of my beer, leaning back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys remember the last time we did this?‚Äù

Don wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúWhat, got drunk in Alan‚Äôs living room?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, stretching my legs out. ‚ÄúSlept over like this.‚Äù

Heather‚Äôs expression shifted.

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThe treehouse?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could feel him stiffen next to me.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was, what‚Äîfive years ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúLonger,‚Äù Heather murmured.

We all knew what she meant.

Before the shooting.

Before everything.

See, the thing about growing up is that you don‚Äôt always notice it happening.

One day, you‚Äôre stuffing sleeping bags into the treehouse, arguing over who gets the best spot, stuffing your face with candy until you pass out. The next, you‚Äôre sitting in a dimly lit living room, beer in hand, the air too thick with unspoken things.

We weren‚Äôt kids anymore but we didn‚Äôt feel like adults, either. 
Some nebulous thing in between.

Heather tucked her legs up onto the couch, pulling her sleeves over her hands. ‚ÄúWe told stories that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúScary ones.‚Äù

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúYou cried.‚Äù

I pointed my beer at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs slander.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou made Alan walk you back to the house to pee because you thought the Grinning Man was outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was ten,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou were twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound right.‚Äù

Alan finally spoke. ‚ÄúYou also screamed when Don made coyote noises.‚Äù

Don grinned. ‚ÄúOne of my finest moments.‚Äù

I scowled, but the weight in the room had lifted just a little.

We were remembering.

And for a second, it felt good.

We kept drinking.

Not too much. Just enough to feel warm, to let the sharp edges of reality soften, to let the past slip in without it hurting too much.

It wasn‚Äôt long before Kevin and Don got restless.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go night-spotting,‚Äù Kevin said, stretching his arms over his head.

Alan shot him a look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Kevin insisted.

Don finished his beer. ‚ÄúI could go for a drive.‚Äù

I tilted my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys are idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Kevin said.

Alan sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get yourselves killed.‚Äù

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

Heather looked at them like they were insane. ‚ÄúYou seriously want to go wandering around the woods right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Don stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually the worst.‚Äù

Kevin slung an arm around her shoulders. ‚ÄúYou love us.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately.‚Äù

Alan sighed. ‚ÄúFine. But don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù

Kevin clutched his chest. ‚ÄúAlan. Buddy. Brother. Have I ever been stupid?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt bother answering that.

They left a few minutes later, laughing as they stumbled out the door, Don already arguing with Kevin about which backroad they should take. The house was quiet without them, the hum of the fridge the only sound in the kitchen as Alan leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes.

Heather sat on the couch, knees drawn up, the old rotary phone beside her. I watched her for a second, then looked at Alan. His eyes weren‚Äôt on me, but they were locked on her. The weight of it settled between them, thick and quiet and old. I raised my eyebrows and took another sip of my beer. Heather glanced at the phone, which had rung earlier, just once, but she hadn‚Äôt answered it.

I stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúWell, this is deeply uncomfortable, so I‚Äôm gonna take a piss.‚Äù

Heather threw a pillow at me, which I caught easily. But when I glanced back, Alan was still glancing at her and this time, Heather was looking back.




KEVIN SHERMAN

The truck doors groaned as we stepped out, the kind of sound that disappeared into the vast, open dark. The night air hit us immediately‚Äîcold and damp, thick with the scent of leaves and turned earth. The road behind us was long gone, swallowed by the trees, the headlights just a faint glow against the trunks.

Absolutely perfect.

Don slammed the door shut behind him and adjusted his jacket. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, voice low, steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I flicked my eagle-engraved Zippo open and closed in my pocket, the tiny metal click sharp against the quiet.

The first few steps into the woods were easy. The moon was out, slipping between the bare branches, casting silver streaks across the forest floor. The air was still, but not silent‚Äîcrickets chirped somewhere in the distance, and every so often, the wind nudged the trees, shifting them in place.

‚ÄúFeels different tonight,‚Äù Don murmured.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice light. ‚ÄúSpooky.‚Äù

He huffed a quiet laugh but didn‚Äôt argue. We kept walking further into the brush. The deeper we went, the quieter everything became. 

The wind faded first, like it had gotten bored and moved on. Then the crickets, their calls thinning out until there was only one or two, then none at all, until our footsteps were the only thing left‚Äîboots scuffing against the dirt, the occasional snap of a twig underfoot.

I had been coming out here long enough to know what normal sounded like and this definitely wasn‚Äôt it. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself, glancing at Don, who‚Äôd clearly noticed it too. His jaw was tense, his hand gripping the flashlight a little tighter than before. But he didn‚Äôt say anything and so neither did I.

It came from somewhere up ahead.

A low, dragging sound‚Äîlike something heavy shifting through the brush. Don stopped walking. The noise stretched out, just long enough to feel wrong, then it stopped.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúDeer?‚Äù

Don shook his head. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

We listened for a moment, the trees tall and motionless, branches twisted up toward the sky.

Nothing, then‚Äîanother sound.

Closer.

We moved without speaking, our feet careful, quiet, picking through the leaves and brambles as we followed the sound.

It wasn‚Äôt running or even walking.

Just shifting‚Äîwaiting.

The woods thickened, the trees pressing closer together, the ground sloping downward. I could feel the weight of the dark now, the kind that settled deep in your ribs, that made you want to move slower, breathe quieter.

Don lifted the flashlight but didn‚Äôt turn it on. We didn‚Äôt need it yet, the moonlight was just enough to see the shape of things‚Äîthe uneven ground, the jagged rocks, the bushes barely concealing whatever it was that lied ahead.

We kept going, just a few more steps.



MAC PETERSON

The thing about drinking at Alan‚Äôs house is that it doesn‚Äôt really feel like drinking.

There‚Äôs no music blaring, no rowdy gambling, no crowd of people shouting over each other. It‚Äôs just the three of us‚Äîme, Alan, and Heather‚Äîsitting in his dimly lit living room. The place never changed. The couch was the same couch we used to sit on when we were kids, watching movies and eating frozen pizza off paper plates. The kitchen still smelled like cigarette smoke, grease, and the faintest trace of his mom‚Äôs perfume. The fridge still rattled sometimes, like it was struggling to keep up.  

So it was easy to forget that we weren‚Äôt kids anymore.  

Heather was sitting cross-legged on the floor, twirling an empty bottle between her fingers, the sleeves of her sweater pulled halfway over her hands. Alan was slumped back in the recliner, the sleeves of his dad‚Äôs jacket pushed up, one leg hooked over the armrest,  nursing his drink. I was stretched out on the couch, one foot resting on the coffee table, the other planted against the floor to keep the room from tilting too much.

Alan had broken into his dad‚Äôs stash, which meant we weren‚Äôt just drinking beer anymore. He told us not to worry about it, that his mother was out late again and he figured she was probably seeing someone new.

Heather had been slowly sipping her whiskey, but Alan and I had both lost track of how many shots we‚Äôd taken. I could feel the warmth crawling up the back of my neck, settling into my chest, making my limbs feel loose and heavy.

Heather rolled the bottle between her hands. ‚ÄúYou think Kevin and Don got anything?‚Äù

Alan shrugged. ‚ÄúThey better not come back empty-handed. They won‚Äôt shut up about tradition, but they haven‚Äôt actually shot anything in, what, three years?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù I said, smirking. ‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs counting?‚Äù

Alan huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt know why they bother.‚Äù

Heather tilted her head back against the couch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun, I guess. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think they actually care about hunting anymore.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThen why go?‚Äù

Heather took a sip of her drink, then shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I saw the way his fingers tensed slightly around the glass before he set it down on the side table.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy is Alan the only one with a comfortable chair?‚Äù  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúBecause he lives here.‚Äù  

‚ÄúUnacceptable.‚Äù I pointed at Alan. ‚ÄúShare.‚Äù  

Alan rolled his head to the side and gave me a deadpan look. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  

I groaned dramatically and let my arm flop off the couch. ‚ÄúHeather, back me up.‚Äù  

Heather took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúMac, shut up.‚Äù  

‚ÄúTraitor.‚Äù  

She just shrugged.  

Alan exhaled, flicking a cigarette against the table, watching the ash tumble onto an old coaster. ‚ÄúYou guys ever think about how stupid we were?‚Äù  

I snorted. ‚ÄúBuddy, I think about it constantly.‚Äù  

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alan said. ‚ÄúI mean, like‚Äîback then. When we were kids.‚Äù  

Heather raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù  

Alan rolled his cigarette between his fingers, his eyes distant. ‚ÄúThe treehouse. The stories. All that crap we used to think was real.‚Äù  

Heather tilted her head back, humming thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWe were kids. Kids believe dumb stuff.‚Äù  

Alan exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  

I stretched, rolling onto my side. ‚ÄúI mean, we could‚Äôve been right about some things.‚Äù  

Alan scoffed.  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúMac, if you‚Äôre about to bring up the Grinning Man again, I swear to God‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúI am just saying,‚Äù I said, lifting my hands in mock surrender, ‚Äúwe never really proved any of it wasn‚Äôt real, either.‚Äù  

Alan shot me a look. ‚ÄúYou wanna go back out there and check?‚Äù  

I laughed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù  


I don‚Äôt know how long we sat there, the warmth of the alcohol making the room feel smaller, hazier, like the walls were pressing in just slightly. At some point, Alan had started flipping a pocket knife open and closed, the small metal snick breaking the quiet every few seconds.

It was Heather who noticed first.

She frowned, sitting up a little straighter. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

I pulled my sleeve up and squinted at my watch. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù I blinked. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

Alan glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost three.‚Äù

Heather stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still not back?‚Äù

Alan frowned.

The thing about Kevin and Don was that they never stayed out this late‚Äînot for spotting. Even when they got really into it, they were always back by one, maybe two if they had to hike back from a good clearing.

We all sat there for a moment, letting that realization settle in.

Then Alan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù He pushed himself up, a little unsteady. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Heather blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find them.‚Äù

I groaned, throwing my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just assume they passed out in the truck or something?‚Äù

Alan shot me a look.

I sighed. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Heather was already grabbing her jacket.

And just like that, we were out the door.

The short walk to the truck in the driveway was easy.

Driving was not.

Alan had sobered up just enough to keep the truck from careening into a ditch, but we were still sloppy‚ÄîHeather kept adjusting the radio like the right song would make us less drunk, I had my head against the window, the glass cold against my temple, and Alan was gripping the wheel a little too tight.

The road was empty, nothing but miles of trees and dark sky stretching out ahead of us.

When we finally reached the pull-off where Kevin and Don had parked earlier, the truck was still there, untouched.

The cab was empty.

Heather‚Äôs fingers curled into her sleeves. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, exhaling. ‚ÄúThey probably just hiked in deep.‚Äù

Alan killed the engine. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

The moment we stepped out, the cold hit.

Not just temperature-wise‚Äîthough that was bad enough‚Äîbut the kind of quiet that settled over you like a weight, pressing into your chest.

We were drunk.

We were so drunk.

And this was a very bad idea.

Heather pulled out the flashlight and flicked it on. ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù she said.

We followed her.

Walking in a straight line was impossible.  

The deeper we went, the worse it got.

The trees were too tall, their branches curling overhead, blocking out what little moonlight there was, and the ground felt too soft under my boots. I could still hear the wind, but it was distant‚Äîlike it was moving around this part of the woods, avoiding it entirely. The cold had settled in deep, slipping under our jackets, sinking into our skin. 

Heather had the flashlight.  

Alan had his gun.  

I had nothing, except for a growing sense of unease.  

‚ÄúKevin!‚Äù Heather called.  

Silence. 

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äî‚Äù

A voice.

Not Kevin‚Äôs.

Not Don‚Äôs.

Up ahead, low and sharp, a voice that did not belong to us barked something in the distance.

Heather‚Äôs breath hitched.

Then‚Äî  

A flashlight beam cut through the trees.  

Alan grabbed my arm and yanked me down.  

The three of us dropped into the underbrush just as the flashlight swept overhead. Heather was pressed against my side, Alan crouched low next to me, his fingers tight around my sleeve.  

The three of us dropped low, pressing into the underbrush as the flashlight swept overhead. My breath burned in my throat, my heartbeat slamming in my ears. Alan‚Äôs grip on my sleeve was tight enough to cut off circulation.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù a voice muttered.

Another voice‚Äîgruffer, older‚Äîgrumbled something back.

Heather‚Äôs fingers dug into my jacket.

Two voices, one gruff, one younger.  

‚ÄúThought I heard something,‚Äù one of them muttered.  

‚ÄúYou hear a lot of things in these woods,‚Äù the other said, unimpressed.  

I didn‚Äôt dare to breathe as the light swept past us again.  

Then‚Äîa rustle.  

Heather had shifted, barely, but it was enough. The flashlight snapped back towards us, indignant in the fury of the beam.

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt hesitate.  

He grabbed my arm‚Äîgrabbed Heather‚Äôs‚Äîand hissed, ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù  

And we ran. Running drunk is not fun. My legs didn‚Äôt move right, my lungs burned immediately, and I barely missed slamming into a tree twice.  

Alan was ahead of us, moving fast, Heather keeping close behind him. The voices behind us were yelling, but they weren‚Äôt chasing us, just shouting, their beams of light cutting through the trees like searchlights.  

We burst out of the woods like we‚Äôd been spat out, lungs burning, hearts slamming.

The moment we broke out onto the road, we didn‚Äôt stop running.  

Not until Alan‚Äôs house was in sight.  

Not until my knees nearly buckled.  

Not until we stumbled into the living room, out of breath, shaking, and still very, very drunk.  

Nobody spoke.  

Heather dropped onto the couch, burying her face in her hands.  

Alan stood near the door, hands on his knees, catching his breath.  

I flopped onto the recliner, my heart still hammering.  

Eventually, Heather groaned.  

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat was terrible.‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt answer.  

I rubbed my face. ‚ÄúKevin and Don probably just‚Ä¶ finally got a kill and it‚Äôs taking them a while to drag it back.‚Äù  

Heather sighed. 

Alan ran a hand through his hair.  

Then he grabbed a beer from the counter, popped the top, and said‚Äî  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, but we‚Äôll get the truck in the morning.‚Äù

SIX YEARS LATER




ALAN RUSSELL


The house felt different now.

Not just emptier, but wrong, like the walls had absorbed too much silence, like something vital had been pulled from the bones of it and left a space behind. The air still smelled like my father‚Äîcigarettes, motor oil, aftershave‚Äîbut it was starting to fade, thinning out the way a campfire does after burning all night.

I sat on the edge of my parents‚Äô bed, the weight of the wooden chest heavy in my lap.

The brass latches were stiff with age, but they popped open with a satisfying click, and inside was everything my father had saved from the war. Old photographs, creased and curling at the edges, a deck of playing cards still rubber-banded together, a pocket-sized Bible with the cover nearly worn through. I picked up the dog tags first, rubbing my thumb over the engraved letters, over the ridges and indentations that had pressed into my father‚Äôs skin for years.

Beneath them, nestled in the folds of an olive-green scarf, was the pistol.

A pristine Tokarev TT-33, wrestled from the grasp of a dead Viet Cong soldier. Eight rounds of 7.62x25mm per magazine. As far as Vietnam war trophies go, it was relatively tame, no shrunken heads or human ears.

It was heavier than it looked, heavier than I expected, the cold metal pressing into the warmth of my palm. The engravings on the barrel had faded, dulled by time and use, but they were still there. My father‚Äôs fingers had worn the grip smooth, pressed into the leather with years of use, of maintenance, of knowing exactly what it was for.

The weight of it settled into my hands like something that belonged there.

Downstairs, the front door creaked open. My mother had been in and out of the house all day, accepting casseroles from women who spoke in soft, syrupy voices, pouring cups of coffee she never finished. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she had slept. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had.

Then I closed the chest and took the gun with me.






There was a quiet sort of dignity in how people mourned my father.

They spoke about him plainly, like they were talking about a man who had worked hard and died working hard, and that was all there was to say. No grand speeches. No softening the truth. Just that he had been here, and now he wasn‚Äôt.

It was a closed-casket service.

I hadn‚Äôt asked why. I didn‚Äôt need to.

The service was crowded. My father had known almost everyone in town, built half their houses, poured their driveways, patched their roofs. The men from the fracking sites came in pressed shirts and stiff ties, faces solemn, hands calloused, their grief carried in heavy shoulders and firm handshakes.

I didn‚Äôt cry, I couldn‚Äôt.

My mother didn‚Äôt either. She looked composed, hands folded in her lap, her black dress pressed and neat. But I saw the way her knuckles tensed every few minutes, the way her fingers clenched and unclenched, like she was holding onto something only she could see.

After the burial, people shook my hand, clapped my shoulder, told me how much my father had meant to them. I nodded along, accepted their words, let their hands squeeze around mine like they were passing something onto me, like this was how responsibility was given.

I wasn‚Äôt sure when my father‚Äôs life had become mine to carry, but somehow, it had.




The others were waiting outside the church after the service.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, elbows on his knees, his suit jacket crumpled beside him. Don stood nearby, hands in his pockets, scanning the crowd like he was watching for something. Mac was leaning against a tree, cigarette burning low between his fingers, smoke curling around him like something permanent.

Mac was the first to say something.

‚ÄúYou look like shit.‚Äù

I rolled a cigarette between my fingers, watching the cherry glow in the dimming light. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Mac smirked, but it was softer than usual.

Heather was standing a little apart from them, arms crossed, the hem of her dress brushing against her knees. She looked good. Not in a way I let myself think about too much, but good. Trevor Holloway hadn‚Äôt come. Maybe that meant something. Maybe it didn‚Äôt. But it didn‚Äôt matter, because I still saw her getting out of his car in the mornings, still saw his arm around her in the hallways. The feeling never left my stomach. It curled there, sharp and unspoken, somewhere between nausea and hunger.

Heather caught me looking.

I looked away first.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, suit jacket crumpled beside him, his tie loosened. Don stood next to him, hands in his pockets, looking at me like he was waiting for me to say something first.

I took another drag and let the smoke unfurl between us. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

Don shrugged. ‚ÄúWherever.‚Äù

So we walked.

The town hummed beneath our feet, a low, steady vibration that had once made us wonder, once kept us up at night, whispering theories under the treehouse beams. Now it was just there, constant, familiar, unnoticed‚Äîlike cicadas in the summer, like a ceiling fan spinning above your bed. Something you only really hear when it stops.

Heather used to be the first to notice things. She had been the one dragging us through the woods, writing in notebooks, poking at the edges of the town like she could peel them back and find what was underneath. Now she had new obsessions‚Äîplans, schedules, an entire future mapped out with the kind of precision that made my chest ache if I thought about it too hard. It wasn‚Äôt that she had stopped looking for answers. She had just stopped looking here.

Mac never stopped looking.

Not for answers‚Äîjust for something.

He moved from girl to girl like a man searching for a song he couldn‚Äôt quite remember, all easy grins and restless hands, all charm and detachment. He had kissed half the girls in our school, maybe more, but it never lasted long, never turned into something real. I caught him watching them sometimes, his gaze a little too focused, like he was waiting for something familiar to surface.

Don had changed the least, or maybe he had just solidified‚Äîgrown into the role we had always needed him to play. He was steady, solid, dependable in a way that made the rest of us feel like it was okay to be the messes we were. His jaw had squared, his shoulders broadened, but his eyes were the same. Observant. Quiet. He was steady in a way the rest of us weren‚Äôt, and that was enough.

And Kevin‚ÄîKevin had gone quieter over the years‚Äîstill quick-witted, still laughing, but it didn‚Äôt come as easily as before. He had grown into himself in a way that suited him, though. He had filled out, lost the scrawny, sharp edges of childhood, but he still had the same quick grin, the same spark behind his eyes.

The sun was setting, the sky burning orange and pink, the air cooling into the first real breath of autumn. The street was empty except for us, our footsteps even, the occasional sound of gravel crunching under our shoes.

Mac exhaled smoke through his nose. ‚ÄúYou should get one of those trench coats.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúFor the whole grizzled detective thing,‚Äù Mac clarified, flicking ash off the end of his cigarette.

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd need a fedora, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù Mac said. ‚ÄúOtherwise it‚Äôs just sad.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.

The conversation faded in and out, the occasional jab, the easy rhythm of five people who had known each other too long. But I felt the gun against my ribs, heavy in the pocket of my dad‚Äôs jacket and I thought about the last time I had hidden under a desk, waiting for someone with a gun to decide whether or not I would live. 

That would never happen again, not if I could stop it.






HEATHER ROBINSON

The air was crisp and carried the scent of burning leaves and something fried from a block over‚Äîprobably someone‚Äôs pre-game dinner. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the kind of dusky, bruised sky that made the streetlights flicker to life one by one. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself and stepped up onto Alan‚Äôs driveway, my boots crunching over loose gravel.

Mac was the first one I spotted, leaning against Alan‚Äôs fence, hands stuffed into his pockets, his eyes tracking something down the road. He‚Äôd been the first to show up, which meant he was in one of his moods. Mac never liked being alone unless he was choosing to be alone.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Alan?‚Äù I asked, coming up beside him.

He shrugged without looking at me. ‚ÄúInside. Finishing something.‚Äù

A voice called out from down the street, and I turned to see Kevin and Don making their way toward us. Kevin was still in his work uniform from the auto shop, the top button undone and the sleeves rolled up, grease stains smudged along his wrist. Don had changed, but his hair still had that faintly disheveled look it always got when he had to wrangle his brothers for dinner before heading out.

‚ÄúDid we pick the worst possible night to go?‚Äù Kevin asked, hopping up onto the curb. ‚ÄúI swear, half the town is at this game already. Parking‚Äôs a nightmare.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou drove?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he admitted, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúBut if I had, it would‚Äôve been a nightmare.‚Äù

Don shook his head, giving me a look that said you see what I have to deal with?

The screen door creaked, and Alan stepped out onto the porch.

Alan finally came outside, walking slowly, carefully, like he had just stepped off a battlefield and wasn‚Äôt sure the war was over. His father‚Äôs jacket was zipped up against the wind, but I could see the pack of cigarettes in his pocket, the lighter in his hand, the way his fingers twitched like they wanted something to do.

He looked older.

Not in the way that time ages a person, but in the way that life does. In the way that grief does.

Alan had grown over the last few years, broadening out, filling the space he had once been afraid to take up. He carried himself differently now, more sure of himself, but heavier somehow. His jaw was sharp, his hair cut longer, a few strands falling over his forehead in the wind. His dad‚Äôs jacket was pulled snug over his shoulders, the collar popped up slightly against the wind. He wasn‚Äôt smoking, but I could see the pack shifting in his pocket when he moved, an unlit cigarette already curled between his fingers. I looked at Alan, the way he held the cigarette between his fingers and the way he kept his free hand curled around his father‚Äôs jacket like it could hold him together. He scanned us all once, his eyes resting on me for the briefest of moments, then jerked his chin toward the road.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù




The town pulsed beneath our feet as we made our way down the street, the game was already in full swing by the time we neared the stadium. The distant echo of a whistle, the rhythmic chant of the cheerleaders, the roar of the crowd swelling and dipping in waves‚Äîit was a Friday night in Ashwood, and that meant football.

The warm glow of the stadium lights cast long shadows over the parking lot as we cut across the grass behind the bleachers. I caught a glimpse of Trevor‚Äôs car near the front, parked in the same spot it always was, the paint glinting under the floodlights. My stomach twisted for half a second before I smoothed it over, shoving my hands into my pockets.

Mac must have noticed because his smirk was almost immediate. ‚ÄúGonna go say hi to your boyfriend?‚Äù

I gave him a look. ‚ÄúShut up, Mac.‚Äù

He chuckled, shoving his shoulder into mine as we climbed the steps to the bleachers.

The stands were packed, full of students wrapped in blankets, parents waving down their kids from below, little siblings stuffing their faces with concession stand nachos. The energy in the air was alive, electric in the way that only hometown football could make it.

Alan took the aisle seat, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, eyes scanning the field like he actually cared about the score. Kevin and Don had already started arguing about the last play, and Mac‚Äîwell, Mac was scanning the crowd.

I knew what he was looking for.

The game itself was a blur of movement‚Äîpads colliding, bodies twisting, the snap of the ball echoing under the lights. The home team was ahead, but barely. The Panthers had fumbled once, and the other team had nearly capitalized on it, but their quarterback had crumbled under the pressure at the last second.

I wasn‚Äôt watching the game, though.

I was watching Alan.

He hadn‚Äôt moved much since we sat down, hadn‚Äôt said a word about anything, just sat there, his thumb running absently along the stitching of his dad‚Äôs jacket.

‚ÄúAlan,‚Äù I murmured, nudging him.

He turned to me slowly, like he had to pull himself out of something deep. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

His gaze flickered over my face, something unreadable passing through his expression before he turned back to the field. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him, but I let it go.


The marching band took the field at halftime, their movements precise, the brass section cutting through the cool night air with perfect synchronicity. I had always liked watching them‚Äînot for the music, but for the way they moved together, the way they made something bigger than themselves.

Mac had lost interest in the game entirely. His eyes had locked onto a group of girls near the front of the bleachers, all laughing at something one of them had said. His smirk curled at the edge, easy, practiced.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, feigning innocence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called appreciating beauty, Heather.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt appreciate anything.‚Äù

His smirk faltered‚Äîjust barely‚Äîbut it was there, a flicker of something real before he leaned back, stretching his arms behind his head. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I sure as hell know how to have fun.‚Äù

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way to put it.‚Äù

Mac ignored him, turning his gaze back to the girls.


The game picked up after halftime, the crowd getting louder, the air shifting into something more frantic as the score evened out. People stood up, shouting, fists pumping, bodies moving with every near-miss, every intercepted pass.

At some point, I felt Alan‚Äôs arm brush against mine. It was small, almost nothing, but I felt it. He didn‚Äôt move away and neither did I, even as our team scored the winning touchdown with seconds left on the clock. The crowd erupted as the final whistle blew, students spilling onto the field, players throwing their helmets in the air. It was the kind of victory that mattered here, the kind that people would talk about for weeks.

Alan stood up first, stretching his arms over his head. ‚ÄúYou guys sticking around?‚Äù

Kevin shrugged. ‚ÄúMight hit up the diner.‚Äù

Don nodded. ‚ÄúI could eat.‚Äù

Mac was already halfway down the bleachers, making his way toward the girls from earlier. Alan turned to me, his eyes full of hope, as if to say you coming?
I hesitated, my eyes flicking toward the parking lot. Trevor‚Äôs car was still there, waiting.

Alan saw it, his jaw tensing up, but he didn‚Äôt say anything.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI should‚Äî‚Äù

He nodded once, the hope fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The others started making their way down, their voices blending into the background noise of the crowd. Alan lingered for half a second longer, then he turned and walked away quickly, catching up to Kevin and Don. For half a second, I could have sworn I wasn‚Äôt the only one watching him go.

For half a second, I saw a man in a tweed suit, eyes locked onto Alan‚Äôs body like it belonged to him.

Then he was gone.

I shook my head half-heartedly, clearing my mind, and got in Trevor‚Äôs car.



MAC PETERSON

Alan‚Äôs house looked the same as it always did‚Äîporch light flickering, the scent of cigarettes and something fried lingering in the air, the old truck sitting lopsided in the driveway like it had been there forever. It was a house that had seen a lot of years, a lot of storms, a lot of things it probably wouldn‚Äôt talk about even if houses could.

I kicked a rock as I walked up the steps, feeling the weight of my overnight bag slap against my hip. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I even bothered bringing one. It wasn‚Äôt like we were actually going to sleep.

Kevin and Don were already inside when I got there. Kevin was sprawled on the couch, flipping through channels on the wood-paneled TV like he wasn‚Äôt going to settle on anything. Don had made himself comfortable on the floor, sorting through the pile of junk food we had pooled together, cracking open a can of Coke.

Heather was sitting cross-legged beside him, one of her socks half-off her foot, like she had started pulling it off and forgotten about it.

Alan was in the kitchen, pouring drinks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Kevin called, not looking up.

I dropped my bag by the door, shrugging off my jacket. ‚ÄúTraffic was terrible.‚Äù

Don snorted. ‚ÄúYou walked here.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Heather smirked but didn‚Äôt say anything.

Alan came back into the room, tossing me a beer. ‚ÄúTry not to embarrass yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

The first few hours were easy.

We didn‚Äôt talk about anything serious. We never did when we drank‚Äînot at first. It was just the usual: throwing popcorn at Kevin when he got too into a movie, arguing over who could shotgun a beer the fastest (Don, obviously), mocking Heather when she tried to say she didn‚Äôt care about football but still got pissed when someone insulted her team.

Alan didn‚Äôt drink much. He never really did. But he sat there with us, listening, smirking when Kevin got particularly animated, rolling his eyes when I started talking about girls. He only spoke when spoken to, but that wasn‚Äôt new.

Heather looked at him sometimes, quick furtive glances that she thought no one noticed.

She still noticed him.

Alan sure as hell noticed her.

And I noticed the way it made his jaw tense every time she reached up and played with the necklace she always wore‚Äîthe one Trevor Holloway had given her.

I took a long sip of my beer, leaning back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys remember the last time we did this?‚Äù

Don wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúWhat, got drunk in Alan‚Äôs living room?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, stretching my legs out. ‚ÄúSlept over like this.‚Äù

Heather‚Äôs expression shifted.

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThe treehouse?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could feel him stiffen next to me.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was, what‚Äîfive years ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúLonger,‚Äù Heather murmured.

We all knew what she meant.

Before the shooting.

Before everything.

See, the thing about growing up is that you don‚Äôt always notice it happening.

One day, you‚Äôre stuffing sleeping bags into the treehouse, arguing over who gets the best spot, stuffing your face with candy until you pass out. The next, you‚Äôre sitting in a dimly lit living room, beer in hand, the air too thick with unspoken things.

We weren‚Äôt kids anymore but we didn‚Äôt feel like adults, either. 
Some nebulous thing in between.

Heather tucked her legs up onto the couch, pulling her sleeves over her hands. ‚ÄúWe told stories that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúScary ones.‚Äù

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúYou cried.‚Äù

I pointed my beer at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs slander.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou made Alan walk you back to the house to pee because you thought the Grinning Man was outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was ten,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou were twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound right.‚Äù

Alan finally spoke. ‚ÄúYou also screamed when Don made coyote noises.‚Äù

Don grinned. ‚ÄúOne of my finest moments.‚Äù

I scowled, but the weight in the room had lifted just a little.

We were remembering.

And for a second, it felt good.

We kept drinking.

Not too much. Just enough to feel warm, to let the sharp edges of reality soften, to let the past slip in without it hurting too much.

It wasn‚Äôt long before Kevin and Don got restless.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go night-spotting,‚Äù Kevin said, stretching his arms over his head.

Alan shot him a look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Kevin insisted.

Don finished his beer. ‚ÄúI could go for a drive.‚Äù

I tilted my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys are idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Kevin said.

Alan sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get yourselves killed.‚Äù

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

Heather looked at them like they were insane. ‚ÄúYou seriously want to go wandering around the woods right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Don stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually the worst.‚Äù

Kevin slung an arm around her shoulders. ‚ÄúYou love us.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately.‚Äù

Alan sighed. ‚ÄúFine. But don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù

Kevin clutched his chest. ‚ÄúAlan. Buddy. Brother. Have I ever been stupid?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt bother answering that.

They left a few minutes later, laughing as they stumbled out the door, Don already arguing with Kevin about which backroad they should take. The house was quiet without them, the hum of the fridge the only sound in the kitchen as Alan leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes.

Heather sat on the couch, knees drawn up, the old rotary phone beside her. I watched her for a second, then looked at Alan. His eyes weren‚Äôt on me, but they were locked on her. The weight of it settled between them, thick and quiet and old. I raised my eyebrows and took another sip of my beer. Heather glanced at the phone, which had rung earlier, just once, but she hadn‚Äôt answered it.

I stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúWell, this is deeply uncomfortable, so I‚Äôm gonna take a piss.‚Äù

Heather threw a pillow at me, which I caught easily. But when I glanced back, Alan was still glancing at her and this time, Heather was looking back.




KEVIN SHERMAN

The truck doors groaned as we stepped out, the kind of sound that disappeared into the vast, open dark. The night air hit us immediately‚Äîcold and damp, thick with the scent of leaves and turned earth. The road behind us was long gone, swallowed by the trees, the headlights just a faint glow against the trunks.

Absolutely perfect.

Don slammed the door shut behind him and adjusted his jacket. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, voice low, steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I flicked my eagle-engraved Zippo open and closed in my pocket, the tiny metal click sharp against the quiet.

The first few steps into the woods were easy. The moon was out, slipping between the bare branches, casting silver streaks across the forest floor. The air was still, but not silent‚Äîcrickets chirped somewhere in the distance, and every so often, the wind nudged the trees, shifting them in place.

‚ÄúFeels different tonight,‚Äù Don murmured.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice light. ‚ÄúSpooky.‚Äù

He huffed a quiet laugh but didn‚Äôt argue. We kept walking further into the brush. The deeper we went, the quieter everything became. 

The wind faded first, like it had gotten bored and moved on. Then the crickets, their calls thinning out until there was only one or two, then none at all, until our footsteps were the only thing left‚Äîboots scuffing against the dirt, the occasional snap of a twig underfoot.

I had been coming out here long enough to know what normal sounded like and this definitely wasn‚Äôt it. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself, glancing at Don, who‚Äôd clearly noticed it too. His jaw was tense, his hand gripping the flashlight a little tighter than before. But he didn‚Äôt say anything and so neither did I.

It came from somewhere up ahead.

A low, dragging sound‚Äîlike something heavy shifting through the brush. Don stopped walking. The noise stretched out, just long enough to feel wrong, then it stopped.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúDeer?‚Äù

Don shook his head. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

We listened for a moment, the trees tall and motionless, branches twisted up toward the sky.

Nothing, then‚Äîanother sound.

Closer.

We moved without speaking, our feet careful, quiet, picking through the leaves and brambles as we followed the sound.

It wasn‚Äôt running or even walking.

Just shifting‚Äîwaiting.

The woods thickened, the trees pressing closer together, the ground sloping downward. I could feel the weight of the dark now, the kind that settled deep in your ribs, that made you want to move slower, breathe quieter.

Don lifted the flashlight but didn‚Äôt turn it on. We didn‚Äôt need it yet, the moonlight was just enough to see the shape of things‚Äîthe uneven ground, the jagged rocks, the bushes barely concealing whatever it was that lied ahead.

We kept going, just a few more steps.



MAC PETERSON

The thing about drinking at Alan‚Äôs house is that it doesn‚Äôt really feel like drinking.

There‚Äôs no music blaring, no rowdy gambling, no crowd of people shouting over each other. It‚Äôs just the three of us‚Äîme, Alan, and Heather‚Äîsitting in his dimly lit living room. The place never changed. The couch was the same couch we used to sit on when we were kids, watching movies and eating frozen pizza off paper plates. The kitchen still smelled like cigarette smoke, grease, and the faintest trace of his mom‚Äôs perfume. The fridge still rattled sometimes, like it was struggling to keep up.  

So it was easy to forget that we weren‚Äôt kids anymore.  

Heather was sitting cross-legged on the floor, twirling an empty bottle between her fingers, the sleeves of her sweater pulled halfway over her hands. Alan was slumped back in the recliner, the sleeves of his dad‚Äôs jacket pushed up, one leg hooked over the armrest,  nursing his drink. I was stretched out on the couch, one foot resting on the coffee table, the other planted against the floor to keep the room from tilting too much.

Alan had broken into his dad‚Äôs stash, which meant we weren‚Äôt just drinking beer anymore. He told us not to worry about it, that his mother was out late again and he figured she was probably seeing someone new.

Heather had been slowly sipping her whiskey, but Alan and I had both lost track of how many shots we‚Äôd taken. I could feel the warmth crawling up the back of my neck, settling into my chest, making my limbs feel loose and heavy.

Heather rolled the bottle between her hands. ‚ÄúYou think Kevin and Don got anything?‚Äù

Alan shrugged. ‚ÄúThey better not come back empty-handed. They won‚Äôt shut up about tradition, but they haven‚Äôt actually shot anything in, what, three years?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù I said, smirking. ‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs counting?‚Äù

Alan huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt know why they bother.‚Äù

Heather tilted her head back against the couch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun, I guess. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think they actually care about hunting anymore.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThen why go?‚Äù

Heather took a sip of her drink, then shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I saw the way his fingers tensed slightly around the glass before he set it down on the side table.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy is Alan the only one with a comfortable chair?‚Äù  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúBecause he lives here.‚Äù  

‚ÄúUnacceptable.‚Äù I pointed at Alan. ‚ÄúShare.‚Äù  

Alan rolled his head to the side and gave me a deadpan look. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  

I groaned dramatically and let my arm flop off the couch. ‚ÄúHeather, back me up.‚Äù  

Heather took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúMac, shut up.‚Äù  

‚ÄúTraitor.‚Äù  

She just shrugged.  

Alan exhaled, flicking a cigarette against the table, watching the ash tumble onto an old coaster. ‚ÄúYou guys ever think about how stupid we were?‚Äù  

I snorted. ‚ÄúBuddy, I think about it constantly.‚Äù  

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alan said. ‚ÄúI mean, like‚Äîback then. When we were kids.‚Äù  

Heather raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù  

Alan rolled his cigarette between his fingers, his eyes distant. ‚ÄúThe treehouse. The stories. All that crap we used to think was real.‚Äù  

Heather tilted her head back, humming thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWe were kids. Kids believe dumb stuff.‚Äù  

Alan exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  

I stretched, rolling onto my side. ‚ÄúI mean, we could‚Äôve been right about some things.‚Äù  

Alan scoffed.  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúMac, if you‚Äôre about to bring up the Grinning Man again, I swear to God‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúI am just saying,‚Äù I said, lifting my hands in mock surrender, ‚Äúwe never really proved any of it wasn‚Äôt real, either.‚Äù  

Alan shot me a look. ‚ÄúYou wanna go back out there and check?‚Äù  

I laughed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù  


I don‚Äôt know how long we sat there, the warmth of the alcohol making the room feel smaller, hazier, like the walls were pressing in just slightly. At some point, Alan had started flipping a pocket knife open and closed, the small metal snick breaking the quiet every few seconds.

It was Heather who noticed first.

She frowned, sitting up a little straighter. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

I pulled my sleeve up and squinted at my watch. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù I blinked. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

Alan glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost three.‚Äù

Heather stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still not back?‚Äù

Alan frowned.

The thing about Kevin and Don was that they never stayed out this late‚Äînot for spotting. Even when they got really into it, they were always back by one, maybe two if they had to hike back from a good clearing.

We all sat there for a moment, letting that realization settle in.

Then Alan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù He pushed himself up, a little unsteady. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Heather blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find them.‚Äù

I groaned, throwing my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just assume they passed out in the truck or something?‚Äù

Alan shot me a look.

I sighed. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Heather was already grabbing her jacket.

And just like that, we were out the door.

The short walk to the truck in the driveway was easy.

Driving was not.

Alan had sobered up just enough to keep the truck from careening into a ditch, but we were still sloppy‚ÄîHeather kept adjusting the radio like the right song would make us less drunk, I had my head against the window, the glass cold against my temple, and Alan was gripping the wheel a little too tight.

The road was empty, nothing but miles of trees and dark sky stretching out ahead of us.

When we finally reached the pull-off where Kevin and Don had parked earlier, the truck was still there, untouched.

The cab was empty.

Heather‚Äôs fingers curled into her sleeves. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, exhaling. ‚ÄúThey probably just hiked in deep.‚Äù

Alan killed the engine. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

The moment we stepped out, the cold hit.

Not just temperature-wise‚Äîthough that was bad enough‚Äîbut the kind of quiet that settled over you like a weight, pressing into your chest.

We were drunk.

We were so drunk.

And this was a very bad idea.

Heather pulled out the flashlight and flicked it on. ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù she said.

We followed her.

Walking in a straight line was impossible.  

The deeper we went, the worse it got.

The trees were too tall, their branches curling overhead, blocking out what little moonlight there was, and the ground felt too soft under my boots. I could still hear the wind, but it was distant‚Äîlike it was moving around this part of the woods, avoiding it entirely. The cold had settled in deep, slipping under our jackets, sinking into our skin. 

Heather had the flashlight.  

Alan had his gun.  

I had nothing, except for a growing sense of unease.  

‚ÄúKevin!‚Äù Heather called.  

Silence. 

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äî‚Äù

A voice.

Not Kevin‚Äôs.

Not Don‚Äôs.

Up ahead, low and sharp, a voice that did not belong to us barked something in the distance.

Heather‚Äôs breath hitched.

Then‚Äî  

A flashlight beam cut through the trees.  

Alan grabbed my arm and yanked me down.  

The three of us dropped into the underbrush just as the flashlight swept overhead. Heather was pressed against my side, Alan crouched low next to me, his fingers tight around my sleeve.  

The three of us dropped low, pressing into the underbrush as the flashlight swept overhead. My breath burned in my throat, my heartbeat slamming in my ears. Alan‚Äôs grip on my sleeve was tight enough to cut off circulation.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù a voice muttered.

Another voice‚Äîgruffer, older‚Äîgrumbled something back.

Heather‚Äôs fingers dug into my jacket.

Two voices, one gruff, one younger.  

‚ÄúThought I heard something,‚Äù one of them muttered.  

‚ÄúYou hear a lot of things in these woods,‚Äù the other said, unimpressed.  

I didn‚Äôt dare to breathe as the light swept past us again.  

Then‚Äîa rustle.  

Heather had shifted, barely, but it was enough. The flashlight snapped back towards us, indignant in the fury of the beam.

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt hesitate.  

He grabbed my arm‚Äîgrabbed Heather‚Äôs‚Äîand hissed, ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù  

And we ran. Running drunk is not fun. My legs didn‚Äôt move right, my lungs burned immediately, and I barely missed slamming into a tree twice.  

Alan was ahead of us, moving fast, Heather keeping close behind him. The voices behind us were yelling, but they weren‚Äôt chasing us, just shouting, their beams of light cutting through the trees like searchlights.  

We burst out of the woods like we‚Äôd been spat out, lungs burning, hearts slamming.

The moment we broke out onto the road, we didn‚Äôt stop running.  

Not until Alan‚Äôs house was in sight.  

Not until my knees nearly buckled.  

Not until we stumbled into the living room, out of breath, shaking, and still very, very drunk.  

Nobody spoke.  

Heather dropped onto the couch, burying her face in her hands.  

Alan stood near the door, hands on his knees, catching his breath.  

I flopped onto the recliner, my heart still hammering.  

Eventually, Heather groaned.  

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat was terrible.‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt answer.  

I rubbed my face. ‚ÄúKevin and Don probably just‚Ä¶ finally got a kill and it‚Äôs taking them a while to drag it back.‚Äù  

Heather sighed. 

Alan ran a hand through his hair.  

Then he grabbed a beer from the counter, popped the top, and said‚Äî  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, but we‚Äôll get the truck in the morning.‚Äù

Please excuse the wall of text lol. 

So I've been single for a ridiculously long time, tho me being on Reddit probably made it obvious haha, and there's this really cute girl who works at a convenience shop near me. We've had a few small talk conversations, nothing major cause I had no idea if she was 18+ or not. I go to that store all the time, cause it's convenient to go to, so we've seen each other there a few times, last 2 times I went she was really talkative for someone who works in retail and doesn't have to give the super great customer service which I've been getting. I figured out she was at least 18 since here in the UK you gotta be 17 to do a driving theory exam, which is valid for 2 years, and she said hers expires soon. 

Last time we spoke she was super smiley towards me. Like I know customer service, smile the whole time etc, but no one smiles like that when telling someone about the bother they went through with shitty driving instructors, you know what I mean? She mentioned that she had a male instructor that was creepy, made some inappropriate comments and such. Figured that that was definitely not the time to shoot my shot. 

Let me make this clear; I am not trying to just get in her pants. I wanna ask her out for a coffee and talk type of date and see where it goes. I'm not into hookups or FWB or anything like that. If I get some success with a girl I hope that becomes an actual relationship with feelings and stuff involved. If it doesn't, it doesn't. If it does? I just hope I can muster up the balls to actually ask her out in the first place. 

Feels pretty weird that I feel absolutely no fear cutting up traffic at 110+ on my motorcycle but I'm shitting myself just thinking about asking a girl out. 

So, how do I ask her out? I wanna be as respectful as possible and not seem like a creep. ",1,1740611043.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I (29M) have been with my partner (28F) for 7 years and we have a son together (2M). The relationship has been great and whilst we‚Äôve had challenges we have always overcome them together. At the end of 2023 I had bought a ring and was preparing to propose.

Last year was an incredibly tough year for us, we had a miscarriage early in the year and almost immediately afterwards before having time to grieve I was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma and had to start treatment, 6 months of chemotherapy. The treatment hit me extremely hard but she was extremely supportive. 

Fast forward to November and I was just about to finish my treatment, she came to me and said that she felt we had grown apart with no clear way for us to get back how we were, she also admitted that on her Christmas Work celebration she had cheated on me with a colleague (they no longer work together or see each other). She said she was unsure of her feelings and needed time to think but given my weakened state from the treatment I was insistent that she made a decision about how she felt and we seperated. 

The break up has hit me extremely hard, I‚Äôm upset for me and for my son living with seperated parents. I‚Äôve finished treatment and am in remission slowly starting to feel physically better. I‚Äôve been on a couple of coffee dates but nobody compares to her and I just feel empty.

We‚Äôve spoken today and both tried to put our cards on the table, she has said she still isn‚Äôt sure how she feels and doesn‚Äôt want to give me any false hope, but we have decided we will go out, as friends with no child to talk and establish exactly where we‚Äôre at. I feel like I don‚Äôt want to look back with any regrets. 

My question is, if we go out and things go well should we try to rekindle, or is it a bad idea? 

TL;DR! My ex and I separated whilst I was ill with cancer, now I‚Äôve recovered and decided I want to fight for the relationship, but should I?

1iz0zye,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iz0zye,Trip Report: too short of a time for shopping and eating,"Deleted this yesterday as I realised I couldn‚Äôt edit my original post to include some details of the trip.

I arrived via a KUL-JAI AirAsia night flight and as a person from the tropics, I was unprepared for the cold. I prepared winter wear but they were in my suitcase and I only had a jacket to warm me up while we got off the plane and traveled via bus to immigration.

It took me a few days before I settled into the chaos in Jaipur. My main beef was the endless honking. Not sure what the drivers wanted to achieve with all that noise, but well, I guess that‚Äôs how it works. Second, the absence of sidewalks. I come from a city where sidewalks are an afterthought but at least we have sidewalks. Many parts of Jaipur is not walkable ‚Äî at least in the areas where tourists are mostly concentrated. Third, but expected but still unprepared for, was the crush of people.

I loved my visit, despite all that. I like architecture in general, so I had a grand time in Jaipur. I think the Gyan Museum was a good preface to the City Palace Museum visit as it gave me good insights about the artworks housed in the Palace. The Kishan Bagh was also an informative precursor to Amber Palace, I understood the immediate Aravalli environment.

Food was outstanding, the sweets more so. The rasmalai was a fave, and the kachori came second. We gorged on Rajasthani thali for three days straight, and then went on a coffee exploration spree. I stumbled upon Carbon and fell in love with it. Arguably the best coffee shop I visited in Jaipur, all because of the Carbon Toddy.

Also, a shoutout to Adhbhut Hotel in Amer ‚Äî had the best chai in my experience, and a stone‚Äôs throw away to many of the popular Jaipur stops. Plus point for its people, the food and the very comfortable and picturesque rooms with equally amazing views. I‚Äôd definitely go back. Amer Town has quite very few good food choices, and the food they serve in the hotel was so much better than the ones around town.

Anyway, I enjoyed the trip immensely and will definitely go back.",12,1740610922.0,jaipur,0,1.0,False

For that, I just want to say: THANK YOU!
Rundt om S√∏erne will continue for the next six months, and the plan remains the same:
üìç We meet every Sunday at 1 PM at the entrance to the Planetarium for coffee and cake.
üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A one-hour walk around the lakes.
‚òï At 2 PM, we return to the Planetarium, where you‚Äôre welcome to stay, enjoy the sun, and have another cup of coffee and some cake.

SIX YEARS LATER




ALAN RUSSELL


The house felt different now.

Not just emptier, but wrong, like the walls had absorbed too much silence, like something vital had been pulled from the bones of it and left a space behind. The air still smelled like my father‚Äîcigarettes, motor oil, aftershave‚Äîbut it was starting to fade, thinning out the way a campfire does after burning all night.

I sat on the edge of my parents‚Äô bed, the weight of the wooden chest heavy in my lap.

The brass latches were stiff with age, but they popped open with a satisfying click, and inside was everything my father had saved from the war. Old photographs, creased and curling at the edges, a deck of playing cards still rubber-banded together, a pocket-sized Bible with the cover nearly worn through. I picked up the dog tags first, rubbing my thumb over the engraved letters, over the ridges and indentations that had pressed into my father‚Äôs skin for years.

Beneath them, nestled in the folds of an olive-green scarf, was the pistol.

A pristine Tokarev TT-33, wrestled from the grasp of a dead Viet Cong soldier. Eight rounds of 7.62x25mm per magazine. As far as Vietnam war trophies go, it was relatively tame, no shrunken heads or human ears.

It was heavier than it looked, heavier than I expected, the cold metal pressing into the warmth of my palm. The engravings on the barrel had faded, dulled by time and use, but they were still there. My father‚Äôs fingers had worn the grip smooth, pressed into the leather with years of use, of maintenance, of knowing exactly what it was for.

The weight of it settled into my hands like something that belonged there.

Downstairs, the front door creaked open. My mother had been in and out of the house all day, accepting casseroles from women who spoke in soft, syrupy voices, pouring cups of coffee she never finished. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she had slept. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had.

Then I closed the chest and took the gun with me.






There was a quiet sort of dignity in how people mourned my father.

They spoke about him plainly, like they were talking about a man who had worked hard and died working hard, and that was all there was to say. No grand speeches. No softening the truth. Just that he had been here, and now he wasn‚Äôt.

It was a closed-casket service.

I hadn‚Äôt asked why. I didn‚Äôt need to.

The service was crowded. My father had known almost everyone in town, built half their houses, poured their driveways, patched their roofs. The men from the fracking sites came in pressed shirts and stiff ties, faces solemn, hands calloused, their grief carried in heavy shoulders and firm handshakes.

I didn‚Äôt cry, I couldn‚Äôt.

My mother didn‚Äôt either. She looked composed, hands folded in her lap, her black dress pressed and neat. But I saw the way her knuckles tensed every few minutes, the way her fingers clenched and unclenched, like she was holding onto something only she could see.

After the burial, people shook my hand, clapped my shoulder, told me how much my father had meant to them. I nodded along, accepted their words, let their hands squeeze around mine like they were passing something onto me, like this was how responsibility was given.

I wasn‚Äôt sure when my father‚Äôs life had become mine to carry, but somehow, it had.




The others were waiting outside the church after the service.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, elbows on his knees, his suit jacket crumpled beside him. Don stood nearby, hands in his pockets, scanning the crowd like he was watching for something. Mac was leaning against a tree, cigarette burning low between his fingers, smoke curling around him like something permanent.

Mac was the first to say something.

‚ÄúYou look like shit.‚Äù

I rolled a cigarette between my fingers, watching the cherry glow in the dimming light. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Mac smirked, but it was softer than usual.

Heather was standing a little apart from them, arms crossed, the hem of her dress brushing against her knees. She looked good. Not in a way I let myself think about too much, but good. Trevor Holloway hadn‚Äôt come. Maybe that meant something. Maybe it didn‚Äôt. But it didn‚Äôt matter, because I still saw her getting out of his car in the mornings, still saw his arm around her in the hallways. The feeling never left my stomach. It curled there, sharp and unspoken, somewhere between nausea and hunger.

Heather caught me looking.

I looked away first.

Kevin was sitting on the curb, suit jacket crumpled beside him, his tie loosened. Don stood next to him, hands in his pockets, looking at me like he was waiting for me to say something first.

I took another drag and let the smoke unfurl between us. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

Don shrugged. ‚ÄúWherever.‚Äù

So we walked.

The town hummed beneath our feet, a low, steady vibration that had once made us wonder, once kept us up at night, whispering theories under the treehouse beams. Now it was just there, constant, familiar, unnoticed‚Äîlike cicadas in the summer, like a ceiling fan spinning above your bed. Something you only really hear when it stops.

Heather used to be the first to notice things. She had been the one dragging us through the woods, writing in notebooks, poking at the edges of the town like she could peel them back and find what was underneath. Now she had new obsessions‚Äîplans, schedules, an entire future mapped out with the kind of precision that made my chest ache if I thought about it too hard. It wasn‚Äôt that she had stopped looking for answers. She had just stopped looking here.

Mac never stopped looking.

Not for answers‚Äîjust for something.

He moved from girl to girl like a man searching for a song he couldn‚Äôt quite remember, all easy grins and restless hands, all charm and detachment. He had kissed half the girls in our school, maybe more, but it never lasted long, never turned into something real. I caught him watching them sometimes, his gaze a little too focused, like he was waiting for something familiar to surface.

Don had changed the least, or maybe he had just solidified‚Äîgrown into the role we had always needed him to play. He was steady, solid, dependable in a way that made the rest of us feel like it was okay to be the messes we were. His jaw had squared, his shoulders broadened, but his eyes were the same. Observant. Quiet. He was steady in a way the rest of us weren‚Äôt, and that was enough.

And Kevin‚ÄîKevin had gone quieter over the years‚Äîstill quick-witted, still laughing, but it didn‚Äôt come as easily as before. He had grown into himself in a way that suited him, though. He had filled out, lost the scrawny, sharp edges of childhood, but he still had the same quick grin, the same spark behind his eyes.

The sun was setting, the sky burning orange and pink, the air cooling into the first real breath of autumn. The street was empty except for us, our footsteps even, the occasional sound of gravel crunching under our shoes.

Mac exhaled smoke through his nose. ‚ÄúYou should get one of those trench coats.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúFor the whole grizzled detective thing,‚Äù Mac clarified, flicking ash off the end of his cigarette.

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd need a fedora, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù Mac said. ‚ÄúOtherwise it‚Äôs just sad.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.

The conversation faded in and out, the occasional jab, the easy rhythm of five people who had known each other too long. But I felt the gun against my ribs, heavy in the pocket of my dad‚Äôs jacket and I thought about the last time I had hidden under a desk, waiting for someone with a gun to decide whether or not I would live. 

That would never happen again, not if I could stop it.






HEATHER ROBINSON

The air was crisp and carried the scent of burning leaves and something fried from a block over‚Äîprobably someone‚Äôs pre-game dinner. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving behind the kind of dusky, bruised sky that made the streetlights flicker to life one by one. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself and stepped up onto Alan‚Äôs driveway, my boots crunching over loose gravel.

Mac was the first one I spotted, leaning against Alan‚Äôs fence, hands stuffed into his pockets, his eyes tracking something down the road. He‚Äôd been the first to show up, which meant he was in one of his moods. Mac never liked being alone unless he was choosing to be alone.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Alan?‚Äù I asked, coming up beside him.

He shrugged without looking at me. ‚ÄúInside. Finishing something.‚Äù

A voice called out from down the street, and I turned to see Kevin and Don making their way toward us. Kevin was still in his work uniform from the auto shop, the top button undone and the sleeves rolled up, grease stains smudged along his wrist. Don had changed, but his hair still had that faintly disheveled look it always got when he had to wrangle his brothers for dinner before heading out.

‚ÄúDid we pick the worst possible night to go?‚Äù Kevin asked, hopping up onto the curb. ‚ÄúI swear, half the town is at this game already. Parking‚Äôs a nightmare.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou drove?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he admitted, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúBut if I had, it would‚Äôve been a nightmare.‚Äù

Don shook his head, giving me a look that said you see what I have to deal with?

The screen door creaked, and Alan stepped out onto the porch.

Alan finally came outside, walking slowly, carefully, like he had just stepped off a battlefield and wasn‚Äôt sure the war was over. His father‚Äôs jacket was zipped up against the wind, but I could see the pack of cigarettes in his pocket, the lighter in his hand, the way his fingers twitched like they wanted something to do.

He looked older.

Not in the way that time ages a person, but in the way that life does. In the way that grief does.

Alan had grown over the last few years, broadening out, filling the space he had once been afraid to take up. He carried himself differently now, more sure of himself, but heavier somehow. His jaw was sharp, his hair cut longer, a few strands falling over his forehead in the wind. His dad‚Äôs jacket was pulled snug over his shoulders, the collar popped up slightly against the wind. He wasn‚Äôt smoking, but I could see the pack shifting in his pocket when he moved, an unlit cigarette already curled between his fingers. I looked at Alan, the way he held the cigarette between his fingers and the way he kept his free hand curled around his father‚Äôs jacket like it could hold him together. He scanned us all once, his eyes resting on me for the briefest of moments, then jerked his chin toward the road.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù




The town pulsed beneath our feet as we made our way down the street, the game was already in full swing by the time we neared the stadium. The distant echo of a whistle, the rhythmic chant of the cheerleaders, the roar of the crowd swelling and dipping in waves‚Äîit was a Friday night in Ashwood, and that meant football.

The warm glow of the stadium lights cast long shadows over the parking lot as we cut across the grass behind the bleachers. I caught a glimpse of Trevor‚Äôs car near the front, parked in the same spot it always was, the paint glinting under the floodlights. My stomach twisted for half a second before I smoothed it over, shoving my hands into my pockets.

Mac must have noticed because his smirk was almost immediate. ‚ÄúGonna go say hi to your boyfriend?‚Äù

I gave him a look. ‚ÄúShut up, Mac.‚Äù

He chuckled, shoving his shoulder into mine as we climbed the steps to the bleachers.

The stands were packed, full of students wrapped in blankets, parents waving down their kids from below, little siblings stuffing their faces with concession stand nachos. The energy in the air was alive, electric in the way that only hometown football could make it.

Alan took the aisle seat, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, eyes scanning the field like he actually cared about the score. Kevin and Don had already started arguing about the last play, and Mac‚Äîwell, Mac was scanning the crowd.

I knew what he was looking for.

The game itself was a blur of movement‚Äîpads colliding, bodies twisting, the snap of the ball echoing under the lights. The home team was ahead, but barely. The Panthers had fumbled once, and the other team had nearly capitalized on it, but their quarterback had crumbled under the pressure at the last second.

I wasn‚Äôt watching the game, though.

I was watching Alan.

He hadn‚Äôt moved much since we sat down, hadn‚Äôt said a word about anything, just sat there, his thumb running absently along the stitching of his dad‚Äôs jacket.

‚ÄúAlan,‚Äù I murmured, nudging him.

He turned to me slowly, like he had to pull himself out of something deep. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

His gaze flickered over my face, something unreadable passing through his expression before he turned back to the field. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him, but I let it go.


The marching band took the field at halftime, their movements precise, the brass section cutting through the cool night air with perfect synchronicity. I had always liked watching them‚Äînot for the music, but for the way they moved together, the way they made something bigger than themselves.

Mac had lost interest in the game entirely. His eyes had locked onto a group of girls near the front of the bleachers, all laughing at something one of them had said. His smirk curled at the edge, easy, practiced.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, feigning innocence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called appreciating beauty, Heather.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt appreciate anything.‚Äù

His smirk faltered‚Äîjust barely‚Äîbut it was there, a flicker of something real before he leaned back, stretching his arms behind his head. ‚ÄúMaybe not. But I sure as hell know how to have fun.‚Äù

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way to put it.‚Äù

Mac ignored him, turning his gaze back to the girls.


The game picked up after halftime, the crowd getting louder, the air shifting into something more frantic as the score evened out. People stood up, shouting, fists pumping, bodies moving with every near-miss, every intercepted pass.

At some point, I felt Alan‚Äôs arm brush against mine. It was small, almost nothing, but I felt it. He didn‚Äôt move away and neither did I, even as our team scored the winning touchdown with seconds left on the clock. The crowd erupted as the final whistle blew, students spilling onto the field, players throwing their helmets in the air. It was the kind of victory that mattered here, the kind that people would talk about for weeks.

Alan stood up first, stretching his arms over his head. ‚ÄúYou guys sticking around?‚Äù

Kevin shrugged. ‚ÄúMight hit up the diner.‚Äù

Don nodded. ‚ÄúI could eat.‚Äù

Mac was already halfway down the bleachers, making his way toward the girls from earlier. Alan turned to me, his eyes full of hope, as if to say you coming?
I hesitated, my eyes flicking toward the parking lot. Trevor‚Äôs car was still there, waiting.

Alan saw it, his jaw tensing up, but he didn‚Äôt say anything.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI should‚Äî‚Äù

He nodded once, the hope fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The others started making their way down, their voices blending into the background noise of the crowd. Alan lingered for half a second longer, then he turned and walked away quickly, catching up to Kevin and Don. For half a second, I could have sworn I wasn‚Äôt the only one watching him go.

For half a second, I saw a man in a tweed suit, eyes locked onto Alan‚Äôs body like it belonged to him.

Then he was gone.

I shook my head half-heartedly, clearing my mind, and got in Trevor‚Äôs car.



MAC PETERSON

Alan‚Äôs house looked the same as it always did‚Äîporch light flickering, the scent of cigarettes and something fried lingering in the air, the old truck sitting lopsided in the driveway like it had been there forever. It was a house that had seen a lot of years, a lot of storms, a lot of things it probably wouldn‚Äôt talk about even if houses could.

I kicked a rock as I walked up the steps, feeling the weight of my overnight bag slap against my hip. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I even bothered bringing one. It wasn‚Äôt like we were actually going to sleep.

Kevin and Don were already inside when I got there. Kevin was sprawled on the couch, flipping through channels on the wood-paneled TV like he wasn‚Äôt going to settle on anything. Don had made himself comfortable on the floor, sorting through the pile of junk food we had pooled together, cracking open a can of Coke.

Heather was sitting cross-legged beside him, one of her socks half-off her foot, like she had started pulling it off and forgotten about it.

Alan was in the kitchen, pouring drinks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Kevin called, not looking up.

I dropped my bag by the door, shrugging off my jacket. ‚ÄúTraffic was terrible.‚Äù

Don snorted. ‚ÄúYou walked here.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Heather smirked but didn‚Äôt say anything.

Alan came back into the room, tossing me a beer. ‚ÄúTry not to embarrass yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

The first few hours were easy.

We didn‚Äôt talk about anything serious. We never did when we drank‚Äînot at first. It was just the usual: throwing popcorn at Kevin when he got too into a movie, arguing over who could shotgun a beer the fastest (Don, obviously), mocking Heather when she tried to say she didn‚Äôt care about football but still got pissed when someone insulted her team.

Alan didn‚Äôt drink much. He never really did. But he sat there with us, listening, smirking when Kevin got particularly animated, rolling his eyes when I started talking about girls. He only spoke when spoken to, but that wasn‚Äôt new.

Heather looked at him sometimes, quick furtive glances that she thought no one noticed.

She still noticed him.

Alan sure as hell noticed her.

And I noticed the way it made his jaw tense every time she reached up and played with the necklace she always wore‚Äîthe one Trevor Holloway had given her.

I took a long sip of my beer, leaning back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys remember the last time we did this?‚Äù

Don wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúWhat, got drunk in Alan‚Äôs living room?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, stretching my legs out. ‚ÄúSlept over like this.‚Äù

Heather‚Äôs expression shifted.

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúThe treehouse?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could feel him stiffen next to me.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was, what‚Äîfive years ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúLonger,‚Äù Heather murmured.

We all knew what she meant.

Before the shooting.

Before everything.

See, the thing about growing up is that you don‚Äôt always notice it happening.

One day, you‚Äôre stuffing sleeping bags into the treehouse, arguing over who gets the best spot, stuffing your face with candy until you pass out. The next, you‚Äôre sitting in a dimly lit living room, beer in hand, the air too thick with unspoken things.

We weren‚Äôt kids anymore but we didn‚Äôt feel like adults, either. 
Some nebulous thing in between.

Heather tucked her legs up onto the couch, pulling her sleeves over her hands. ‚ÄúWe told stories that night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúScary ones.‚Äù

Kevin smirked. ‚ÄúYou cried.‚Äù

I pointed my beer at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs slander.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou made Alan walk you back to the house to pee because you thought the Grinning Man was outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was ten,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou were twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound right.‚Äù

Alan finally spoke. ‚ÄúYou also screamed when Don made coyote noises.‚Äù

Don grinned. ‚ÄúOne of my finest moments.‚Äù

I scowled, but the weight in the room had lifted just a little.

We were remembering.

And for a second, it felt good.

We kept drinking.

Not too much. Just enough to feel warm, to let the sharp edges of reality soften, to let the past slip in without it hurting too much.

It wasn‚Äôt long before Kevin and Don got restless.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go night-spotting,‚Äù Kevin said, stretching his arms over his head.

Alan shot him a look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Kevin insisted.

Don finished his beer. ‚ÄúI could go for a drive.‚Äù

I tilted my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúYou guys are idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Kevin said.

Alan sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get yourselves killed.‚Äù

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

Heather looked at them like they were insane. ‚ÄúYou seriously want to go wandering around the woods right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Don stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually the worst.‚Äù

Kevin slung an arm around her shoulders. ‚ÄúYou love us.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately.‚Äù

Alan sighed. ‚ÄúFine. But don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù

Kevin clutched his chest. ‚ÄúAlan. Buddy. Brother. Have I ever been stupid?‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt bother answering that.

They left a few minutes later, laughing as they stumbled out the door, Don already arguing with Kevin about which backroad they should take. The house was quiet without them, the hum of the fridge the only sound in the kitchen as Alan leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes.

Heather sat on the couch, knees drawn up, the old rotary phone beside her. I watched her for a second, then looked at Alan. His eyes weren‚Äôt on me, but they were locked on her. The weight of it settled between them, thick and quiet and old. I raised my eyebrows and took another sip of my beer. Heather glanced at the phone, which had rung earlier, just once, but she hadn‚Äôt answered it.

I stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúWell, this is deeply uncomfortable, so I‚Äôm gonna take a piss.‚Äù

Heather threw a pillow at me, which I caught easily. But when I glanced back, Alan was still glancing at her and this time, Heather was looking back.




KEVIN SHERMAN

The truck doors groaned as we stepped out, the kind of sound that disappeared into the vast, open dark. The night air hit us immediately‚Äîcold and damp, thick with the scent of leaves and turned earth. The road behind us was long gone, swallowed by the trees, the headlights just a faint glow against the trunks.

Absolutely perfect.

Don slammed the door shut behind him and adjusted his jacket. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, voice low, steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I flicked my eagle-engraved Zippo open and closed in my pocket, the tiny metal click sharp against the quiet.

The first few steps into the woods were easy. The moon was out, slipping between the bare branches, casting silver streaks across the forest floor. The air was still, but not silent‚Äîcrickets chirped somewhere in the distance, and every so often, the wind nudged the trees, shifting them in place.

‚ÄúFeels different tonight,‚Äù Don murmured.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice light. ‚ÄúSpooky.‚Äù

He huffed a quiet laugh but didn‚Äôt argue. We kept walking further into the brush. The deeper we went, the quieter everything became. 

The wind faded first, like it had gotten bored and moved on. Then the crickets, their calls thinning out until there was only one or two, then none at all, until our footsteps were the only thing left‚Äîboots scuffing against the dirt, the occasional snap of a twig underfoot.

I had been coming out here long enough to know what normal sounded like and this definitely wasn‚Äôt it. I pulled my jacket tighter around myself, glancing at Don, who‚Äôd clearly noticed it too. His jaw was tense, his hand gripping the flashlight a little tighter than before. But he didn‚Äôt say anything and so neither did I.

It came from somewhere up ahead.

A low, dragging sound‚Äîlike something heavy shifting through the brush. Don stopped walking. The noise stretched out, just long enough to feel wrong, then it stopped.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúDeer?‚Äù

Don shook his head. ‚ÄúToo big.‚Äù

We listened for a moment, the trees tall and motionless, branches twisted up toward the sky.

Nothing, then‚Äîanother sound.

Closer.

We moved without speaking, our feet careful, quiet, picking through the leaves and brambles as we followed the sound.

It wasn‚Äôt running or even walking.

Just shifting‚Äîwaiting.

The woods thickened, the trees pressing closer together, the ground sloping downward. I could feel the weight of the dark now, the kind that settled deep in your ribs, that made you want to move slower, breathe quieter.

Don lifted the flashlight but didn‚Äôt turn it on. We didn‚Äôt need it yet, the moonlight was just enough to see the shape of things‚Äîthe uneven ground, the jagged rocks, the bushes barely concealing whatever it was that lied ahead.

We kept going, just a few more steps.



MAC PETERSON

The thing about drinking at Alan‚Äôs house is that it doesn‚Äôt really feel like drinking.

There‚Äôs no music blaring, no rowdy gambling, no crowd of people shouting over each other. It‚Äôs just the three of us‚Äîme, Alan, and Heather‚Äîsitting in his dimly lit living room. The place never changed. The couch was the same couch we used to sit on when we were kids, watching movies and eating frozen pizza off paper plates. The kitchen still smelled like cigarette smoke, grease, and the faintest trace of his mom‚Äôs perfume. The fridge still rattled sometimes, like it was struggling to keep up.  

So it was easy to forget that we weren‚Äôt kids anymore.  

Heather was sitting cross-legged on the floor, twirling an empty bottle between her fingers, the sleeves of her sweater pulled halfway over her hands. Alan was slumped back in the recliner, the sleeves of his dad‚Äôs jacket pushed up, one leg hooked over the armrest,  nursing his drink. I was stretched out on the couch, one foot resting on the coffee table, the other planted against the floor to keep the room from tilting too much.

Alan had broken into his dad‚Äôs stash, which meant we weren‚Äôt just drinking beer anymore. He told us not to worry about it, that his mother was out late again and he figured she was probably seeing someone new.

Heather had been slowly sipping her whiskey, but Alan and I had both lost track of how many shots we‚Äôd taken. I could feel the warmth crawling up the back of my neck, settling into my chest, making my limbs feel loose and heavy.

Heather rolled the bottle between her hands. ‚ÄúYou think Kevin and Don got anything?‚Äù

Alan shrugged. ‚ÄúThey better not come back empty-handed. They won‚Äôt shut up about tradition, but they haven‚Äôt actually shot anything in, what, three years?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù I said, smirking. ‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs counting?‚Äù

Alan huffed a laugh. ‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt know why they bother.‚Äù

Heather tilted her head back against the couch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun, I guess. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think they actually care about hunting anymore.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThen why go?‚Äù

Heather took a sip of her drink, then shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù

Alan didn‚Äôt say anything, but I saw the way his fingers tensed slightly around the glass before he set it down on the side table.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy is Alan the only one with a comfortable chair?‚Äù  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúBecause he lives here.‚Äù  

‚ÄúUnacceptable.‚Äù I pointed at Alan. ‚ÄúShare.‚Äù  

Alan rolled his head to the side and gave me a deadpan look. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  

I groaned dramatically and let my arm flop off the couch. ‚ÄúHeather, back me up.‚Äù  

Heather took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúMac, shut up.‚Äù  

‚ÄúTraitor.‚Äù  

She just shrugged.  

Alan exhaled, flicking a cigarette against the table, watching the ash tumble onto an old coaster. ‚ÄúYou guys ever think about how stupid we were?‚Äù  

I snorted. ‚ÄúBuddy, I think about it constantly.‚Äù  

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alan said. ‚ÄúI mean, like‚Äîback then. When we were kids.‚Äù  

Heather raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù  

Alan rolled his cigarette between his fingers, his eyes distant. ‚ÄúThe treehouse. The stories. All that crap we used to think was real.‚Äù  

Heather tilted her head back, humming thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWe were kids. Kids believe dumb stuff.‚Äù  

Alan exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  

I stretched, rolling onto my side. ‚ÄúI mean, we could‚Äôve been right about some things.‚Äù  

Alan scoffed.  

Heather smirked. ‚ÄúMac, if you‚Äôre about to bring up the Grinning Man again, I swear to God‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúI am just saying,‚Äù I said, lifting my hands in mock surrender, ‚Äúwe never really proved any of it wasn‚Äôt real, either.‚Äù  

Alan shot me a look. ‚ÄúYou wanna go back out there and check?‚Äù  

I laughed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù  


I don‚Äôt know how long we sat there, the warmth of the alcohol making the room feel smaller, hazier, like the walls were pressing in just slightly. At some point, Alan had started flipping a pocket knife open and closed, the small metal snick breaking the quiet every few seconds.

It was Heather who noticed first.

She frowned, sitting up a little straighter. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

I pulled my sleeve up and squinted at my watch. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù I blinked. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

Alan glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost three.‚Äù

Heather stiffened. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still not back?‚Äù

Alan frowned.

The thing about Kevin and Don was that they never stayed out this late‚Äînot for spotting. Even when they got really into it, they were always back by one, maybe two if they had to hike back from a good clearing.

We all sat there for a moment, letting that realization settle in.

Then Alan exhaled, rubbing a hand over his face. ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù He pushed himself up, a little unsteady. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Heather blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find them.‚Äù

I groaned, throwing my head back against the couch. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just assume they passed out in the truck or something?‚Äù

Alan shot me a look.

I sighed. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Heather was already grabbing her jacket.

And just like that, we were out the door.

The short walk to the truck in the driveway was easy.

Driving was not.

Alan had sobered up just enough to keep the truck from careening into a ditch, but we were still sloppy‚ÄîHeather kept adjusting the radio like the right song would make us less drunk, I had my head against the window, the glass cold against my temple, and Alan was gripping the wheel a little too tight.

The road was empty, nothing but miles of trees and dark sky stretching out ahead of us.

When we finally reached the pull-off where Kevin and Don had parked earlier, the truck was still there, untouched.

The cab was empty.

Heather‚Äôs fingers curled into her sleeves. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, exhaling. ‚ÄúThey probably just hiked in deep.‚Äù

Alan killed the engine. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

The moment we stepped out, the cold hit.

Not just temperature-wise‚Äîthough that was bad enough‚Äîbut the kind of quiet that settled over you like a weight, pressing into your chest.

We were drunk.

We were so drunk.

And this was a very bad idea.

Heather pulled out the flashlight and flicked it on. ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù she said.

We followed her.

Walking in a straight line was impossible.  

The deeper we went, the worse it got.

The trees were too tall, their branches curling overhead, blocking out what little moonlight there was, and the ground felt too soft under my boots. I could still hear the wind, but it was distant‚Äîlike it was moving around this part of the woods, avoiding it entirely. The cold had settled in deep, slipping under our jackets, sinking into our skin. 

Heather had the flashlight.  

Alan had his gun.  

I had nothing, except for a growing sense of unease.  

‚ÄúKevin!‚Äù Heather called.  

Silence. 

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äî‚Äù

A voice.

Not Kevin‚Äôs.

Not Don‚Äôs.

Up ahead, low and sharp, a voice that did not belong to us barked something in the distance.

Heather‚Äôs breath hitched.

Then‚Äî  

A flashlight beam cut through the trees.  

Alan grabbed my arm and yanked me down.  

The three of us dropped into the underbrush just as the flashlight swept overhead. Heather was pressed against my side, Alan crouched low next to me, his fingers tight around my sleeve.  

The three of us dropped low, pressing into the underbrush as the flashlight swept overhead. My breath burned in my throat, my heartbeat slamming in my ears. Alan‚Äôs grip on my sleeve was tight enough to cut off circulation.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù a voice muttered.

Another voice‚Äîgruffer, older‚Äîgrumbled something back.

Heather‚Äôs fingers dug into my jacket.

Two voices, one gruff, one younger.  

‚ÄúThought I heard something,‚Äù one of them muttered.  

‚ÄúYou hear a lot of things in these woods,‚Äù the other said, unimpressed.  

I didn‚Äôt dare to breathe as the light swept past us again.  

Then‚Äîa rustle.  

Heather had shifted, barely, but it was enough. The flashlight snapped back towards us, indignant in the fury of the beam.

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt hesitate.  

He grabbed my arm‚Äîgrabbed Heather‚Äôs‚Äîand hissed, ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù  

And we ran. Running drunk is not fun. My legs didn‚Äôt move right, my lungs burned immediately, and I barely missed slamming into a tree twice.  

Alan was ahead of us, moving fast, Heather keeping close behind him. The voices behind us were yelling, but they weren‚Äôt chasing us, just shouting, their beams of light cutting through the trees like searchlights.  

We burst out of the woods like we‚Äôd been spat out, lungs burning, hearts slamming.

The moment we broke out onto the road, we didn‚Äôt stop running.  

Not until Alan‚Äôs house was in sight.  

Not until my knees nearly buckled.  

Not until we stumbled into the living room, out of breath, shaking, and still very, very drunk.  

Nobody spoke.  

Heather dropped onto the couch, burying her face in her hands.  

Alan stood near the door, hands on his knees, catching his breath.  

I flopped onto the recliner, my heart still hammering.  

Eventually, Heather groaned.  

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat was terrible.‚Äù  

Alan didn‚Äôt answer.  

I rubbed my face. ‚ÄúKevin and Don probably just‚Ä¶ finally got a kill and it‚Äôs taking them a while to drag it back.‚Äù  

Heather sighed. 

Alan ran a hand through his hair.  

Then he grabbed a beer from the counter, popped the top, and said‚Äî  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, but we‚Äôll get the truck in the morning.‚Äù

It starts with Lorenzo‚Äôs demo‚Äîa product designed to set meetings on autopilot. Simple enough. I was just sitting there, watching the tool work, when suddenly‚ÄîBOOM. My phone exploded with activity. This was like Ryan's Wolf from the office. With no stop button. 

A flood of calls.  
Emails piling up like an avalanche.  
Live agents beeping in‚Äînonstop.

And then, right in the middle of it? Another agent call‚Äîor so I thought.

I was drowning in inbound, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of results. I mistook the caller for just another agent and shut it down:

(ME)- ""Turn it off. Just email me the results my brain will work better that way.""

Then, realizing I wasn‚Äôt exactly radiating empathy, I tried to make up for it‚Äîwhich somehow made it worse. Meanwhile, she was just listening, probably trying to figure out what on earth I was talking about. We wrapped up the brief exchange so I could take another incoming call from a live agent.

This next agent immediately said, ""Sorry, that‚Äôs weird‚Äîthat usually doesn‚Äôt happen unless you respond to the text.""

I told my partners‚Äîthey laughed. It wasn't our first mistake that day. 

  
Maybe this was just a weird simulation brought on by too much coffee and too many screens.

Either way, it‚Äôs fun to think about how we handle chaos.

She closed her eyes with her bambi-lashes and - 

‚ÄúWhat's with the staring? Are you Hot For Boss, Ritchie?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, not taking my gaze off her. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù 

‚ÄúReally? I am.‚Äù Giovanni slumped in the chair beside me, and my world became a haze of mid-range cologne and stale coffee. ‚ÄúShe is *one hot mama*.‚Äù  

‚ÄúGio,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou misunderstood me.‚Äù I shifted my body but not my focus. The guy reeked of sandalwood and Kenco. ‚ÄúMe saying ‚Äòno‚Äô and ‚Äòshut up‚Äô wasn't an invitation to sit with me or talk to me or goad me into sexually harassing the boss. I don't want you here.‚Äù 

I felt him stretch out beside me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free country, Ricardo.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd my name isn't Ritchie, or Ricardo, or Rico, or -‚Äù my fingers became air quotes ‚Äú- har-har-har, Dick.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRichard, then.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's fucking *Spencer.*""   

‚ÄúShit name.‚Äù 

There was a scream of linoleum as he scraped back his chair. Suddenly, his warm, milk-and-two-sugars-sour breath was tickling at my earlobe. ‚ÄúMight want to make yourself more memorable around here, Spencado,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúOr you'll miss out on more than one promotion.‚Äù 

My head *did* whip around then. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I suddenly felt very hot all over, enough to melt my 80% polyester suit. ‚ÄúNot you, though... right?‚Äù 

My voice was pleading and pathetic. ‚ÄúIt wasn't you?‚Äù

Giovanni's eyes glittered green. ‚ÄúWe shall see, won't we?‚Äù 

My shoulders began to relax - 

‚ÄúActually, we can see right now. Yes, yup, it *is* me... as of eleven ay-em this morning.‚Äù 

My bowels became the consistency of McDonald's Apple Pie filling. I turned back to staring at Sharon Anderson, my tears somewhat obscuring my view. 

She smacked her lips, dabbing *my* roast beef sandwich crumbs off her pansticked gobhole. 

My boss was hot, but I wasn't Hot For Boss. I despised her. 

I had no wife, no children, no pets. All I had was a reasonably well-stocked fridge and a flair for a packed lunch. And every day for the last six weeks, that *harpy* had stolen it. The whole thing. The sandwich. The crisps. The foil-wrapped chocolate biscuits. Even the fucking apple, which usually went in the bin. 

And I'd let her. With the promise of a fat payrise and a Daddy-will-finally-love-me promotion, I thought letting her snaffle MY lunch, along with other stupid stuff like working really hard, would get it in the bag. 

But no. Giovanni, who used his fingers whenever he lost his calculator, *Giovanni*, who'd arrived at InsureCar *two years later than me*, got the big prize. 

Boy, did that boil my spuds. 

With trembling hands, I tore open my notebook and rummaged for a working pen. 

HOT SAUCE 

I scrawled, then paused. 

LAXATIVES

Slightly illegal. And more than slightly sus. 

PEANUTS

Maybe. Everyone has a nut allergy nowadays. 

I sidled up to Sharon Anderson's table. 

‚ÄúI'm doing a survey,‚Äù I said, clicking my pen. ‚ÄúDo you have a peanut allergy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she looked surprised. Maybe even mildly guilty. ‚ÄúEr, no. I don't.‚Äù 

**Note:** *Sharon Anderson did, in fact, have a horrible peanut allergy. But she loved Spencer's sandwiches, and figured, correctly, that the guy wasn't smart enough to lace his Bacon ‚ÄòN‚Äô Brie with them if she lied her bitchin‚Äô face off.* **End Note** 

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, crossing off PEANUTS. I turned away and started make my exit from the canteen. 

‚ÄúSpencer?‚Äù she trilled after me like an insidious nightingale. ‚ÄúWhat have peanuts got to do with car insurance?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's a new tagline for Marketing,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúFor how much customers will pay per month.‚Äù 

*Bet you regret not promoting me now,* I sneered inside. *But anger baguettes anger, and tomorrow's baguette comes with hot sauce!* 

As I trundled back to my desk, I noticed the middle drawer was open. 

About thirty calculators sat inside, almost untouched. They didn't worry me. What worried me was the note perched on top. 

*Bitch, I knew you‚Äôd been stealing my calculators, BITCH. My office tomorrow, nine AM. G.* 

I went home early. You know, to get ready. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 

At lunch the next day, I watched Sharon Anderson as she pulled the clingfilm off my sandwich. 

I watched as her perfect lips peeled back from her pearly teeth. 

And, uninterrupted this time, as Giovanni was taking his promotion *so seriously* that he hadn't turned up to work, I watched as she bit into my delicious baguette stuffed with another homemade meaty filling. 

‚ÄúMmm!‚Äù she sighed and closed her eyes in ecstasy.

1iz0tp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1iz0tp9/extended_stay_pricing/,Extended stay pricing,"Hey everyone, hotelier here. I run an economy hotel with extended stay amenities. We mainly  get nightly/weekly guests, but do have a few months out of the year where monthly guests are extremely common. I'd be interested in hearing what other properties charge for a month because I think we may be under charging. 

*hotel details:*
* 44 rooms
* economy so not a ton of amenities but we do have a continental breakfast, wifi, HEATED outdoor pool and hot tub
* 450 sqft room with kitchenette, living room with sofa sleeper,, king bedroom, bathroom. Like if you were to knock down the wall in between 2 rooms, you'd literally have almost as much room as the house I grew up in (1,008 sqft). 
* kitchenettes include microwave, minifridge/freezer, hot plate, pots/pans/dishes/utensils, keurig and coffee supplies, kitchen sink and cleaning supplies. Bathroom amenities are stocked in bulk and are HIGH END compared to what most hotels provide. I love our bar soap and lotion when most hotels have shit products. 
* NO guest laundry on site though. 
* fantastic location. Walking distance to parks with beach access, historic landmarks, grocery stores, and restaurants. No restaurants or bars on site though. 
* NO elevator. 
* exceptional reviews: 4.3/5 on Google, 9/10 on Expedia, and 8.3 on Booking. Most other economy hotels are hovering around 3.4/5, 7.6/10, and 7.2/10. Give are take. Some are even 2/5 or 5/10. 

*30 day stay pricing and inclusions*
* $65/nt tax exempt
* $100 cleaning fee includes weekly housekeeping service, unlimited amenity refills (including tp, soaps, etc). 
* $500 refundable security deposit 
* $2,550 to check in, but $500 goes back on check out as long as there's no damages or excessive cleaning beyond what we expect a normal deep clean to be. 

Jan, Feb, and March are the most popular months for monthlies given the fantastic weather and abundant events. They're also peak for transient travel as well. In 2024 (a slow year for us) our rev par for those months was $80.70, $93.56, and $100.07. Our historic best revpar in thale last 5 years for those months were $85.92, 98.48, and 102.05, and that's INCLUDING ~25% of our occupancy being at this super low rate. Imagine if we raised the rate a little for that 25% of the hotel. Especially during events that are $200+ per night, and my monthlies only pay $65. 

For the most part, I love our returning monthlies. But it's become tiresome. They think they're part owners or something. They think that because they're here for so long, they should have a say in purchases and upgrades. They keep complaining we need new couches. I agree, and I've begun to replace couches. But they want to be the first ones with a new couch since they're here so long. But they're only paying $65/nt when my nightly guests pay $85-200/nt. They get first dibs on couches. The 800 watt microwaves aren't good enough, we need to install 1200 watt ones ($200 more per unit). The toaster in the breakfast room takes too long to toast. AND they share their rates among the other travelers,  not maliciously, but I recently had to ask them to stop telling people because a weekly guest got butthurt he was paying the same amount for 2 weeks as they did for 30 days. 

Recently, we tested out a higher monthly rate once we've reached 10 at our regular rate. We did 70/wkday and 130/wknd. This came out to $2,500-2,700 depending on the breakdown between weekends and weekdays. I thought and people are paying it. So I figured maybe any new monthlies we get, we charge $87/nt + $100 cleaning for a monthly total of $2,710. It's higher than January's revpar while accounting for 10 rooms at $65. But I know if those 10 rooms were being sold BAR every night instead of $65, our revpar would be higher. We do not NEED monthlies this time of year. We average 94% occupancy these months and often turn people away for being sold out. There will be some weekdays we do not sell out ($85-115) but weekends we usually turn people away ($120-180) and events make me wish I could build more rooms ($160-280).
