Join me? (IRL),"Hi ! So you clicked on me! We both are thinking sigh, here we go again - trying to find what we want in this messy, online world! Dont be discouraged. Ill lay it all out from my end now so you might want to put your reading glasses on! What im seeking (for now) is not a hookup/ONS but a similar mindset/wants (high libido, love deep convos, dishing sarcasm, exploring kink, sexually open/flirty etc) Youre tired of the “you up?” Texts & empty encounters. You want more. Me too so lets just chat , vibe, flirt and go from there?

Who i am: Single, solid 6/7 (im realistic, not delusional), Tall (6’0”), DDF, thick, BWC (pics/vids on profile for proof), bearded Italian/white male who will be able to toss ya around in the bedroom. I work in nuclear safety 🤓and travel all over IL for it so distance doesnt mean much to me (prefer city/nw/s burbs)

I pride myself on being a raw, respectful, blunt individual who is in tune with their emotions & is able to communicate in a descriptive manner. Firm believer that communication & effort needs to be prioritized. Team work makes the dream work!! Dom tendencies but very social, spontaneous and playful. If you cant dish sarcasm, banter and wittiness like we are playing ping pong - i dont want it!

Hobbies: reading, writing, art, cooking, watching sports/docs/thriller movies, lifting, holistic/wellness practices, stealing memes, random road trips, spontaneous acts, trying new coffee spots/restaurants.

Kinks (never limited/always expanding): im not a fan of titles/specifics but i identify with being a pleasure dom the most which leads us to >>> D/S, CNC, TPE. Oral enthusiast. Anal/ass play - none of these are “must haves”. The most important thing to me is fun, flexibility and an open mind. Honestly, ill be more intrigued by what YOU enjoy.. im all ears…

Also, please consider that this is less about kink (for now) and more so about really wanting to find that connection that can translate to IRL. It would be great to come across someone who is actively trying to see and going after their wants. First dates shouldnt be scary!

Shoot me a DM if this intrigues you, are local and please provide some info about yourself when you reach out. Exchanging pics/verification is a must. Very open to meeting prior (coffee/dinner etc)",1,1766700651.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

1pvnz6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1pvnz6t/i_finally_found_a_job_after_7_months_here_are_the/,I finally found a job after 7 months. Here are the details of the bitter story.,"The grind is finally over. 7 months of searching for a senior-level (VP/SVP) job.

For context, I've been working for 26 years since I graduated and have never been unemployed. My career was always on an upward trajectory - more responsibilities, bigger titles, better salaries. I reached the director level about 12 years ago, and I've been a VP/SVP for the last ten years, with long tenures of about 6 years at each of my last two companies. I was laid off last February from a job I chose myself.

Here are the raw numbers from my job search journey in a high-cost-of-living city:

520 applications (about 450 online, and 70 through recruiters)

25 first-round / HR screening interviews

23 second-round interviews (with the hiring manager or C-suite, about 80% video calls and 20% in person)

15 final rounds (where I'd meet the hiring mgr/execs/peers and/or the team I would work with) - usually, there were 2 to 4 candidates left. (13 of them in person, and 2 video)

I received only one offer - and I accepted it. The title is one level below my previous position, at 80% of my old salary, and about 30% of the value of the bonus I could have received.

A few notes: Of the 15 jobs where I reached the final round, 11 required full-time in-office presence, 2 were remote, and 2 were hybrid (e.g., two days in the office).

For the first 4 months, I only applied for VP+ roles in my specific field. After many rejections in the final rounds, I had to swallow my pride a bit. I discovered that the job market for senior positions is smaller and much tougher than I thought. So, I started applying for director/manager positions (one or two levels lower) with salaries in the range of 70% to 100% of what I used to make.

I also learned that many job postings aren't even real. There's something called 'forever open positions' that companies keep advertising automatically, and 'ghost positions' that don't seem to be tied to any real hiring need. It's honestly absurd.

To deal with this situation, I had 8 different versions of my CV tailored for different jobs, and 9 ready-made cover letter templates.

I met for coffee or lunch with 20 former colleagues and bosses, and spoke with about 15 different recruiters. Honestly, none of this yielded tangible results - most responses were that there was a hiring freeze or no available positions at my level.

Note: For everyone still struggling, my heart goes out to you. I know some of you have been at this for over a year. Seriously, if anyone needs a fake reference for a past job, send me a DM. Screw these companies and their HR games!

After all this, I will never take the blessing of a job for granted again, which is something I unfortunately used to do. I'm going to give this new company my all for giving me a chance.

Another note: I went through some very difficult months where I doubted my self-worth and my entire life. If you're feeling this way, please keep going and keep trying. Things really can get better. I'm still in shock that I'm working again.",1,1766700042.0,UAE,0,1.0,False

Since about 2 weeks I've had some growth, mainly geo which I just dry brushed away. But then today had a bunch of blue mold and decided it was time. Rubbed each wheel with oil that had a different spice in it (prepared 2 weeks ago). First thing to note was that the oil really absorbs quickly into the rind and it made the mixture become grainy very quick and hader to spread. This was more obvious with the coarser smoked paprika and cumin than white pepper and turmeric.

I’ve spent this past year focusing on myself, growing, healing, and learning. But lately, the idea of a real partner keeps coming up. I miss making a woman feel deeply loved  and everything that comes with a meaningful relationship.

I’m incredibly affectionate, thrive on words of affirmation, and express all love languages. I want someone I can hold and be held by. Someone who loves a deep talk one minute and turns into a complete goof the next. I’m a consistent texter and value clear, kind, and honest communication when things get tough.

A little about me:
I’ve lived coast to coast and always have a bag ready for the next road trip (but let me drive, please).  I’m a behavior therapist for children with disabilities. I’m 5’10, tattooed, creative, and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours thanks to the power of ADHD. I love working with my hands, taking care of people I love, and noticing the little things most people miss.

I’m attracted to femme and chapstick cis lesbians. Y’all really make my heart race. ✨ I value a partner who takes care of herself (not asking for a gym rat, just some self-love and if I can throw you around that’s a plus 😉. Ideally looking for someone who’s a switch, but I’m happy taking the lead if that’s your comfort zone. Definitely kink-friendly - I’m done with vanilla and ready for something more aligned and expressive. 

I’m down for horror films, documentaries, or a nostalgic Disney night. Music is a constant in my life - I’m rarely without headphones. I propagate plants and give them to people I care about, and my self-care routine is sacred (morning coffee + evening tea = non-negotiable). Being outdoors is my happy place… just not in Arizona heat (lived there, barely survived 😅). 

Last but not least I am a mom to one amazing girl. 

If you’re kind, communicative, flirty, and ready to build something - I’d love to hear from you. Bonus points if you can match my banter. Let’s see where this goes.

1pvnxjg,https://i.redd.it/i68qqj3v9f9g1.png,"The Quarry Over Innsmuth-- Side A, Track 1","Our town is dead; there’s no better word for it. From the history books I’ve read through in our dusty, half-rotting library, we were once a fishing village. From when the pilgrims first made landfall up until the 1980s, we were the “Home of Fishermen”, according to our welcome sign. The population was small at first, only a few hundred, but the sheer amount of fish available brought more and more people into the town. However, as more people came in, less fish were pulled out. Year after year, the fish population decreased further and further until one day in 1980. A rotten smell proliferated throughout the town, a smell like death and putrid meat combined. They found the source lying on the shore baking under the summer sun. There were mounds of fish, all of them rotting and dead, piled up as far as the eye could see. 

It took the townspeople months to remove and burn all the corpses, but the smell never left. On hot days you can still smell the rotting fish, especially near the coast. People blamed the dead fish on hundreds of different things, overfishing, climate change,  some even blamed demons and witches. Despite their investigations, they never found a cause for what happened. As the police chief of the time said, “It’s like they were tired of living.”

The fish never really came back, there just wasn’t enough of them to support a new generation let alone an entire town. After a while, people moved towards better things, leaving the town in the dust. However, as they moved away, we moved in. The houses were dirt cheap thanks to the mass exodus and my dad quickly bought up two small pieces of property. Enough land for a home and for his hardware business, one of his many business ventures. Innsmuth became our home and it’s where I grew up.

My dad is a quiet person. He doesn’t speak much; instead he’s the type to let his actions speak for him. Through those actions, you’d see a hard-working businessman who spends too much time at work, instead of being with the family he loves so much.

My mom is the opposite. She talks a lot, likes to say whatever comes to mind. She’s always been protective, like a hug where the other person squeezed you too hard for too long. Regardless, my sister and I could tell she cared and loved us more than anything.

Red was my best friend growing up, though I always called her Sis. Even though I was 4 years younger than her, we spent every moment together, running and playing in the forest behind our house. However, as she grew up and started going to school, she changed. By the end of middle school, little things tired her more than usual. She stopped wanting to run through the woods, instead wanting to play in the backyard. Eventually she stopped wanting to play altogether; choosing to sleep in her room for hours on end. She was clearly depressed but I didn’t know the meaning of the word and neither did my parents, least of all how to deal with it. They tried pushing her to do things, punishing her when she didn’t do anything, but it didn’t work. She just spent less time at home, getting into fights with whoever angered her the most, usually the bullies who targeted me. Eventually, they just threw their hands up and stopped trying. She barely graduated high school, her eyes empty and sullen. Then one day, out of the blue, she came home with a military pamphlet. In a few weeks she was gone, she never even said goodbye. When she left, Mom and Dad fought a lot. They hated that she left for the military but at the same time they didn’t try to stop her. I think they were glad that she chose to do something, even something as dangerous as the military. Through their anger, I heard them hoping for her, hoping that she would come back safe.

I blamed myself for a lot of it, the whole time she was struggling I felt like I should have done more. I thought if I was a little stronger and a little bit older I’d have the chance to save her, pull her from the darkness surrounding her, and make us a family again. But she was gone before I even had a chance. 

My parents changed when she left, the whole house did. Everything was more uncomfortable, more strained. My dad somehow got quieter, choosing to speak through hard glances or longing stares. He disappeared almost entirely, choosing to spend his time at the store. My mom got more protective, more focused on me and what I was doing. She pestered me about grades and who I was talking to, lectured at me about the future and my plans for it. She never said it but I could tell what she wanted to say, don’t end up like your sister.

The only reprieve from all of this was a friend I had made during my first year of high school.

We met randomly on the first day of school during our lunch period. I was new and had no place to sit, so I took the first open seat I saw. I sat across a girl, around my age, who had her head buried in a book. Black, curly, hair fell from her shoulders into the piles of books around her. “The Fascinating World Of Computers”, “Chips And You”, “Programming For Dummies”, etc. I knew nothing about these books except for one at the very bottom of the pile, “Creatures and Cryptids: Worldwide Stories.” I had read this book thousands of times at the library, the creepy stories and pictures keeping me entertained when my sister or parents couldn’t.

“Do you like cryptids?” I said, trying to make sure she heard me.

She looked up, staring at me as if I had spoken another language.

“Yea- yeah. You like them too?”

“Yeah, my favorite’s the Loch Ness monster. What’s yours?”

“Oh, my favorite’s the.. let me find it” She trailed off, picking the book out of the pile, sifting through it until she found a page.

 “The Thunderbird.” She said, showing me the picture of the cloud covered bird, “I think it’s really cool”

“Yeah totally.”

We stared at each other in the awkward silence that followed before her eyes lit up and her hand shot out in a clumsy attempt at a handshake.

“My name’s Gina, Gina Chen.”

I shook her hand, “Ken Katsuragi, nice to meet you.”

“Same here”

We spent the rest of the lunch period talking about monsters and strange creatures from the book. Soon enough it became a daily thing for us, spending whatever free time we had between classes sharing things we were interested in or creepy finds we found online. Eventually, we started hanging out outside of school, riding our bikes to each other’s house; Reading beat to shit comic books in my room or playing video games on her dad’s old PS1. Other times we’d explore the woods surrounding the town, searching for a monster to call our own.

I think a lot of guys in my position would develop a crush on her. I knew why, she had curly black hair that fell down her back, deep blue eyes like the ocean, and a jackal-like laugh that lit up a room. She’s pretty and she knows it too. Her confidence was infectious in that way, it rubbed off on you a lot more than you’d expect. I always appreciated that about her, without her I’d have never become the person I am now.

Due to her confident nature, a lot of guys tried to ask her out but no matter who they were she always rejected them. I never made that mistake though, because I knew something they didn’t. Gina was into girls. I don’t want to describe the things she talked about since she swore me to secrecy, but I know she’ll always have my back, just like I have hers.

I’ll come back to what happened when I’m ready but for now I think I’ll write a little more about the past. It feels nice to do it, like the scattered puzzle pieces inside my head are finally coming back together again. 

Our vacation was coming to a close fast, the last embers of summer starting to give way to fall. The weather was warm but with a pulse of cool air that reminded you to wear a jacket. I woke up to something all too familiar, a taping at my window. I opened it, the cool burst of air removing any sleepiness I had left. I saw Gina waiting for me, a bike at her side and her usual red flannel draped across her.

“Come on dummy, breakfast is getting cold.” She whispered up to me, before jumping on her bike and heading down the road to the diner.

I changed and headed down the stairs as quietly as I could, thankfully avoiding another lecture from my mom or a disapproving sigh from my dad. The morning air was fresh and crisp, the early morning sun cresting the mountains behind me. I met up with Gina at an empty intersection, where she was waiting for me.

“Took you long enough.”  
“You say that like I’m the one making you wake up at six in the morning.” I said, wiping the crust from my eyes.

“As if I wanna be up right now! My damn parents can’t sleep for shit” She said, the two of us pushing off towards the diner.

I had only met Gina’s parents twice in the past. The easiest way to describe them would be that they’re workaholics. Her mom’s a secretary for a big construction company. Her dad is a geological surveyor for a company nearby. They’re rarely home and when they are, it’s “Like trying to talk to a walking corpse” Gina’s words, not mine. 

“How’s your mom and dad?” She asked, breaking me out of my thoughts.

“Good. I’ve been helping Dad out at the store. Mom’s been going to church a lot lately.” I said.

“The usual shit with them?”

“Yeah..” I trailed off.

I must have looked down because she put a hand on my shoulder when we were stopped at a red light.

“Forget I mentioned all that.” She said, a slight smile on her lips, “Besides, no one wants to see you crying anyway”

I groaned and pushed her hand away, “Shut up, annoying ass”, a smile appearing on my face.

She laughed and pulled into the diner, myself close behind.

The diner was ancient, opened long before I was born. Rusted metal walls surrounded the small building, foggy muddied windows on every side. The faded red glow of the neon barely illuminating the name on the sign, “Frankie’s”.

The door swung open with a whine, revealing the old interior inside. The chairs and booths were covered in green vinyl, some of it starting to peel and chip. The walls were a dull red, a horrible clash compared to the tile checkerboard floor beneath us. Behind the large counter was a familiar young woman, idly reading the paper as an unseen chef cooked something in the kitchen. Despite its obvious age, the entire diner smelled like fresh pancakes, warm bacon, and tasty eggs. The diner was alive in ways most of the town wasn’t.

We took a seat in one of the less aged green booths and Gina yelled out to the woman behind the counter, “Hey Trisha!”

Trisha, seeing Gina, rolled her eyes and sauntered over. She placed down two menus in front of us, clearly tired and annoyed. 

“I thought I told you not to bother me on my shift.” She said eyeing Gina particularly.

“Who else am I supposed to talk to?” Gina said playfully.

“Sorry about her, she’s extra annoying today.” I said.

“Yeah, clearly” Trisha said, tying her hair back and pulling a notepad from her pocket. “What do you weirdos want?”

“I’ll have the chocolate pancakes”

“I’ll have a double skimpy on the coals please.” Gina said with a smile.

From what she told me, that’s waitress code for two eggs with bacon, why they say that I don’t know. 

Trisha rolled her eyes and walked towards the kitchen, leaving the two of us alone in the empty diner.

“How’s the waitress job treating you so far?” Pointing to a cream colored apron behind the counter with her name on it.

“It’s decent.” Gine said, kicking up dust from the floor. “The pay’s bad but you really don’t have to do much of anything around here.” 

“And that asshole?”

She sighed, staring at the place Chad usually sat. Chad was Trisha’s boyfriend from high school. They were dating at the time but they broke up after graduation. Trisha said he’s been trying to “win her back” ever since. He hated Gina since she’d never let him see Trisha and he hated me because I kicked him in the balls after he tried to force Gina to let him see Trisha.

“He hasn’t been here in a while,” Gina said. “But I doubt he’ll stay away forever.”

Trisha exited the kitchen then, two plates in her hands. The pancakes were warm and freshly made, small tufts of whipped cream covered in chocolate sauce. The eggs were over easy, yolk pouring into the mess of bacon underneath it. As she handed Gina the food, Trisha placed two pieces of toast on the side of the plate.

“I didn’t order that.” Gina said.

“I know.” Trisha said, heading back to the newspaper. “You always ask for it anyway, might as well give it to you now. Oh, and those pancakes have extra chocolate in them.”

I smiled, “Thanks Trish, you’re great.”

Gina smiled, “I knew you cared, you big softie!”

“Shut up, you weirdos.” Trisha said, hiding a smirk.

Trisha was always a kind person even if she hid that kindness underneath layers of sarcasm. In the warmth of the diner, the two of us feasted on our breakfast until we were both full and happy. As we paid our bill and started to leave, a blue pickup truck rolled into the parking lot. Chad entered the diner, his hair greased back like usual, an ancient letterman jacket hanging over his shoulders

He stared at the two of us, a mean look coming over his unkempt face. His eyes snapped up to Trisha and he gave her his best smile, sitting down at his usual spot. 

“A cup of Joe, Trishy?” he asked, placing a crumpled bill on the counter.

She sighed and poured him a cup of coffee, staring daggers into him all the while.

“It’s Patricia to you.”

“Aw come on” he complained. “After we’ve been through? I could call you pumpkin if you’d like.”

“Back off dude” Gina said. “She’s not into you.”

He glared at us, “The adults are talkin’ here. Stay out of it.”

“You’re an adult? Could’ve surprised me.” I said.

Chad rose from his seat and glared at us. Despite his unshaven beard and greasy hair, he was clearly built. He was a football player and even I could see that he hadn’t lost his muscles despite the time that’s passed. He tried to stomp over to us, but Trisha blocked his way.

“Do anything and I call the cops.”

“You really care for these pieces of shit?” He yelled at her, his fists clenched.

“They’re fucking children Chad.” She yelled at him, “You always do this! Why do you have to fight everything-”

She could barely get the word out before Chad backhanded her across the face, sending her stumbling to the ground.

Gina and I jumped back, the hit so fast we barely saw it coming. Chad stomped closer to us, a wave of rage cascading down his face. For a moment, I felt like I was frozen in place, too shocked by the sheer suddenness of everything to even react. But just as quickly, an adrenaline soaked fear shot through me and told me to fight back. Despite his size and strength, I felt like I had to do something, because if I didn't, who knows what could’ve happened.  I pulled back and threw a punch at his face but it felt like hitting a stone. Something hard slammed into my side and I got thrown onto the ground, a flurry of pain throbbing through my head and back. I threw out my leg widely and hit him square in the crotch, a low groan emanating from the man. In a rage, he tried to grab me but Gina stepped in front of me, pulling something out from her back pocket.

The arcing electricity crackled against the air, a harsh buzzing echoing from it. She held the taser towards him, electricity still buzzing, her face a mixture of fear and anger. He backed up, the weapon bringing him to his senses. I got up from the floor and reached for the payphone against the wall, dialing 911. I told the operator about everything he had done, a loud police siren signaling their response.

His eyes shifted to the outside and back towards me. 

“You’ll regret that you little shit”, He spoke through clenched teeth.

Just as quickly as he entered, he left and climbed into his car, racing out from the diner as fast as he could.

Gina dropped the taser and ran to check on Trisha. She was dazed and had an awful black and purple bruise on her face but thankfully she was okay. Sirens blared in the distance as Trisha slowly got back on her feet.

Trisha looked at the two of us, still shaken from what happened.

“Thank you, but never do that again, okay?” She asked. “You two should go, I’ll cover you.”

“No way we-” Gina began but Trisha cut her off.

“Go.” She said, waving us off. “I can deal with this, it’s not the first time.”

I could tell Gina wanted to say something else but I whispered to her that we should leave. As we set off, the blue and red lights of the police flashing, I saw Trisha pull a cigarette from her pocket, lighting the end with her shaking hands.

That look of anger on Gina’s face, Trisha’s cigarette, the lights of the police, it’s like a lighthouse inside my mind. No matter how many things get scrambled or shifted around, these moments are clear as day. I think it’s because it was the last time our town was normal, the last time before everything was swallowed up by something I still don’t have the words to describe.

I don’t remember exactly when work on the quarry started, but I think it was around January of the new year. It started slow at first, new faces seen around town, new cars rushing in and out of town, posters and ads about new job opportunities. I asked Gina if she had seen them and she looked at me surprised.

“You haven’t heard?”

“No?”

She pointed away from town towards an old dead end road that led to the base of a mountain.

“My dad says they plan to build a quarry there, says the entire mountain is loaded with copper and granite. Mom said it’s gonna revitalize the town.”

Revitalization was an all too correct word. A few months after she told me, swarms of people seemed to invade our town, rushing in from anywhere they could. They brought in their families, bought up old houses, and drove massive drills and machines through our small streets. We even had a parade filled with paper mache fish and pilgrims celebrating our town history. By the end of the month we had hundreds of new families living in our town, a new beating heart that brought everything to life in a way I hadn’t seen for 18 years.

Due to this transplant, I saw a lot less of Gina. I was stuck working at my dad’s shop, helping him sell hammers, nails, and other tools to our new customer base. Gina was busy too, having to take over Trisha’s shift as she “Ran off with her new boyfriend”, a miner who recently moved into town.

Everything was going well, so well people ignored any possible consequences of a quarry that large, just like the people who couldn’t keep the fish off their hooks.

It was Sunday when the accident happened. It started off normal enough, a regular trip to the movies with Gina. However, my mom caught me before I could leave. She dragged me into a lecture, her gaze more focused on cutting vegetables than me. 

“You spend a lot of time with your friend.” It was less of a question and more of an accusation.

“Yeah, she’s my best friend.”

“You get into a lot of fights with her.” She said, her eyes still not on me.

“I’m not gonna let her get hurt.”

“So you just fight?” She asked, staring at me for the first time. “Is that what you do now? God, Ken, I raised you better than that.”

“What do you want me to do?” I asked, raising my voice. “Just let someone beat me up, or- or beat Gina up? Is that what you want?”

“Ken-I” She stopped, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “I just want you to have a good future, honey. One where you stay out of trouble and don’t go running off trying to get yourself hurt like-”

“Like Red?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“You meant it.”

She stayed quiet, turning her attention back to the vegetables.

I turned around, heading for the door, “I’m leaving with Gina.”

“Ken, get back here.” She commanded. “Honey-”

But I was gone before her words reached me. Already biking down the road, towards Gina’s house.I was blind back then, too wrapped up in my own pain to see she was hurting too. I think that was always the problem, I was so focused on myself that I couldn’t see anyone else. My thoughts stopped as I saw Gina walk out of her house in a huff, slamming the front door so hard the house seemed to shake. We rode in silence, small tears falling from Gina’s face as we rode. We stopped at a random location, a rusted playground that hadn’t been used for decades. We sat silently on the swing for what seemed like hours before Gina finally spoke. She starts talking about something that happened with her parents but everything goes foggy. I’m trying to remember, trying to hold on to what she said but I just can’t. Her words and mine blur together, the scene shifts and folds like a book submerged underwater. I hugged her and the two of us cried, I remember how her body racked with sobs, I remember the weight coming off my chest as I told her things I don’t even remember saying. 

The only thing that’s clear are the sirens.

I remember how loudly the first set of ambulances screeched as they flew by us. After them came police cars and fire trucks, their lights and sirens blaring. Gina and I saw them converge at the dead end road, a black, noxious plume of smoke rising from the quarry. Something about it pulled us in. I think we just needed an escape, anything to get our minds off of our lives for just one minute. 

We raced up an old trail path that led us to a small hill overlooking the quarry below. 

The black smoke still billowed out from a large spiraling hole in the back of the quarry, the smell of smoke and burnt fuel polluting any air around it. Teams of masked firefighters poured water onto whatever was on fire but they quickly drew back as a sudden burst of flame rocketed upwards. Nearby paramedics were attending to a group of injured workers, their faces and arms coated in blood and soot. Many of them looked dazed and confused as if they weren’t sure what just happened, others groaned as they held burned limbs. Police officers did their best to preserve the scene, pushing and yelling at the workers who surrounded them on all sides. A smaller group crowded around something, muttering things between each other. As they made space for an ambulance, we saw what they were hiding.

It was a man’s body, still and unmoving. He looked like he was torn apart by some animal, deep wounds and claws all over his body. His legs were mutilated, small bits of bone sparkling in what was left of his calf muscles, the smallest scraps of muscle barely keeping them connected to his torso.

Once the medics saw the man, they rushed over, checking for any signs of life.

As a medic touched his neck, he suddenly rose and screamed, his eyes full of life he didn’t have until that moment. The man reached and grasped for anything close, landing his bloodied hands on the medic who fell back screaming. He pulled the medic close with ease and began viciously shaking him, incoherent mumblings coming from his torn jaw. Officers nearby finally moved and pushed the man off but he didn’t stop. No matter what they did, they couldn’t stop the man from crawling closer, his body tearing apart more and more as he dragged himself across the gravel. He reached forward and brought an officer down, pinning him to the ground with his weight. People yelled and threw orders, the noise all around us growing to a fever pitch, before a bang silenced everything, freezing my breath in its lungs. The madman stopped his attack and looked at the bloody hole now in his chest, the wound bleeding quickly. He seemed confused, almost stunned that it just happened. His gaze then shifted up.

Right to where we were hiding.

His eyes looked too young for his skin. It was too flabby, too creased, too matted with age to be his. His hair was pure white, almost falling out as we stared at him, too afraid to look away. He looked at us with perfect clarity, the madness once there gone completely. His mouth bled as he tried to form words, deep slashes surrounding his jaw. 

A deep, gutteral, almost half whisper sound came out of his mouth, “...or..”, before his body tilted left and landed with a thud against the gravel floor.

Once he fell, the quarry exploded in activity, the workers rushing through the police towards their fellow man. 

Gina and I ran towards our bikes as hard as we could, biking as hard and as fast as we could until our lungs burned and our knuckles turned white from the handlebars. We made it almost across town, nowhere near enough distance between us and that dying man. As we stopped to catch our breath I noticed a poster out of the corner of my eye. It was black and white, far too new than the other papers stapled to the wall. 

At the top it read:

Patricia Matthews

Heated that steady to not lose any of the volatile aroma compounds but also just infuse the oil itself before mixing that then with the vodka. Total of 18 hrs infusion. 4 hours pf room temp with 12 hours in the freezer. Before breaking the fat shell and filtering with a coffee filter. 

-Next I made a consommé that’s basically liquid jasmine rice. Had fresh coconut milk in it and also a few aromats again like kafir lime & lemongrass. Heated that again only till aroma release and to avoid the aldehydes from escaping. Filtered & let it cool and next day turned it into a jello that I froze and then let thaw in the fridge again which gave me a clear liquid. Starch and coconut fats would’ve made it cloudy if I didn’t gelatin clarify. 

- made a fish sauce and lemon grass saline. A palm sugar micro syrup. 

-Used the fresh coconut I ground and the unused cooked jasmine rice that would’ve been waste, to make an amuse bouche that was basically a rice cracker I dehydrated and was fryable. Salted with a Thai green curry herbs salt I made in the air frier.

1pvnryw,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pvnryw/i_watched_entire_rian_johnsons_benoit_blanc/,I watched entire Rian Johnson's Benoit Blanc trilogy today. It's good but we need to talk about something.,"I finally decided to watch Wake Up Dead Man. Because I had a day off and a bit free time to spare, the idea hit me: why don't I just watch all 3?

Knives Out holds up great. It's rewatchable as usual, acting on point and it's just entertaining to observe these beautiful actors play the hell out of that script all the way the bones. The downsides of I would talk about later.

Glass Onion. It's not a bad film. More social commentary (a bit better handled in KO) and RJ honestly tried to shed a bit light onto Blanc's life outside the investigations. Some people didn't exactly like the way it all was handled but the pluses still outweight the minuses. It feels as people just collectively tried to overlook this film and pretend that actual sequel would finally come. It came and if I had a cent every time feed of my social media showing me ""cinephiles"" praising WUDM - I would have bough couple of cups of coffee with these riches.

Wake Up Dead Man is certainly better. Not as good as KO but still improvement over GO. Tone have changed again though - it's not that cozy and warm Agathesque detective. And it seems that people don't really want to learn more about Blanc, they want to see him solving the crimes - which he does. And there's - again - someone who we must like (mostly because of>! enlightened speech in the beginning!< but let's look over that)>! who has been framed for murder he didn't actually do!< (he killed someone, but that was long time ago). A lot of the things that made people and me to fall in love with adventures of mr. Blanc, Benoit Blanc, had came back and it feels good..... but.

Is it only me or you do just as I did feel that 3/4 of the characters became a filler? Part of the formula Netflix bought was 'supporting cast made of familiar actors across generations to widen the appeal across the board'. So people who still remember Miami Vice or Almost Famous or Sideways >!(though, I honestly think that Haden Church was cast due to superficial semblance to Josh Brolin's Monsignor Wicks, for which I beg a pardon because he's a good actor but their nearly paired casting announcement somewhat adds to my theory)!< could find some familiar faces in a cast suited for younger generation. And they get what they paid for but character building suffers greatly. I have this weird feeling that if we would remove nearly everyone the story wouldn't suffer because they are there to be a backdrop to things happening, not the reason why things are happening. Cailee Spaeni just there to make sure Glenn Close's gag-scare would work. Jeremy Renner, bless his soul, is just there to be underutilised and then blamed for things while we watch a tug-of-war around faith between priest and a detective. Andrew Scott is just there to be a depressed neurotic recluse, who is likely a harrowing future awaiting ""aspiring na\*i"" played by Jaeden Martell in KO and Darryl McCormack - blogger - being alternative one in the way he wants to saw discord and aims for future in politics. Kerry Washington, Mila Kunis and others are just there. They all could have been murderers or didn't exist at all - it wouldn't change a thing.

Which is a major letdown.

Because Rian Johnson KNOWS how to create engaging and meaningful characters.

And we need to look no further than Knives Out to see that it were characters who moved the plot, not the opposite:

Marta Cabrera - a skilled and caring nurse, who by doing her job well nearly foiled the murder plot. She doesn't know that so she tries to get away with the murder she didn't do.

Linda Drysdale - eldest daughter of famous author Harlan Thrombey, strong and willful woman, who was the only one who truly loved her father even despite her feeling neglected by him and his attention. Needs father.

Richard Drysdale - Linda's husband and a bit of an idiot, who's financially dependent on her and on Harlan. Petty. Has a secret though. Needs father-in-law's money.

Joni Thrombey - Harlans daughter in law. Steals money from Harlan, tries to pretend her wellness something is successful and pays the bills. Desperately needs father-in-law's money.

Meg Thrombey - Joni's daughter. Cares little about gramps, he pays for hers everything though. Liberal on the surface but when pressured caves in and spills all Marta's secrets to her relatives in order to not to endanger her and her family's prosperous lives.

Walt Thrombey - Harlan's son. The weakest link in the family. Can't stand up for himself. Always has to ask permission to do anything. Made him cruel. Needs to be able to make decisions for himself but has to have a safety net for it because he's afraid to fail (again).

Jacob Thrombey - Walt's son. Have been raised by his loser father and his substance-abusing mother he seeks for empowerment so unlike freedom-seeking Meg he turns to the right. We may say being radicalized but he just doesn't want to become his father and these preachings fall upon an eager ear.

And finally Hugh Ransom Drysdale - Linda and Richard's son and probably the most loved and cared for by Harlan person in this family before Marta came by. He took a lot after his grandpa. Among these whiny and self-centered petty people he's the only one, who's ready to take the matter in his hands. And oh boy he does.

I see a huge unique imprint of Harland on every his child. Except Neil, who perished some time before the events of the film so Jodi feels a bit foreign here, which makes me love RJ's storytelling even more. These people traumatised their own children in a very specific way. It was done so great that this conflict between characters was used to promote the film.

Now, we have a murderer who holds a key to two secrets and wants to restore faith in people by any means. This person can't do it alone due to certain natural limitations so we need two accomplices, one of whom must resemble the victim and second to supply prerequisites needed to conceal the murder (this person also has an entire acid bath setup at home so i think RJ missed an opportunity o flesh out this person, who definitely planned to murder and dispose of someone in very intricate way). And to hide these 3 they needed some colorful folk to mingle so here comes the rest of reverent Wicks's acolites, who were to represent some tropes and views on religion and society: a woman who's promised the miracle but it's all lie, a man, who's paranoia took best of him and he feels drawn towards the man he deems to be strong and charismatic, a lawyer tied to Wicks because of her loyalties to her father and her adopted brother, a failed politician who's here because he wants to make something out of himself and thus to exploit Wicks and on his back break into politics. It's definitely not bad but it doesn't work as an ensemble piece. They tried to emulate Harlan and his children co-dependent relationship, makin Wicks his own center of gravity but didn't work either. And yet, the movie is good.

Maybe I am the problem and it's something nobody cares about? What do you think?",0,1766699457.0,movies,25,0.1,False

I am visiting NYC from 1/16-1/19 to see friends, but would love to have someone to hang out with consistently through the weekend, go on adventures, and to enjoy fun dates with. I'll be staying near Koreatown.

Id like to go ahead and start chatting so we can spend some time getting to know each other and get comfortable (and to make sure vibes are good)!

Maybe we show each other out favorite local food spots, or try new ones in the city. Maybe we get coffee and drink explore a museum, or grab Korean and dance the night away? I'm always open to tying new places!

If we have fun, I'm very open to keeping the connection going. I would also like to verify sooner than later if we start talking. Hope to hear from you soon! ",1,1766699413.0,amwfdating,0,1.0,False
1pvnrbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartRings/comments/1pvnrbf/my_experience_with_the_ultra_human_air/,My experience with the Ultra Human Air,"I bought the UH air a few months ago. I purchased it because I have some issues that require monitoring but I also have nice traditional mechanical watches, so I can't always wear my apple watch.

At first I wore them both at the same time to be able to compare the accuracy of the ring.

I will list my complaints in sections:

1. Begging. the reviews mentioned that the app is pushy and I was a little worried about it and it was completely understated. there are 5 tabs at the bottom, only one of them is health information, the other 4 are adverts for other devices UH makes and everywhere you click in the app reminds you that you do not have these things. This is a 350 dollar piece of fucking technology that is constantly trying to upsell you. Really VC brained bs, really frustrating. The app is also not that readable, have to click in a bunch of difference sections to see the info you want.
2. Battery. the ring is inconsistent in how long each charge lasts. It also doesn't notify you when the battery is low, and you have to open the app to check the battery level, so if I forget to habitually check the app I will often just find out I am wearing a dead ring even though its only been 2 days. And whats insane is if you let it die and try to see anything that is happening today after you charge it, the app lets you know that you need at least 3 continuous days for things like sleep, recovery etc. Which I should have, of course, because i just charged it 2 days ago.
3. notifications. I don't drink caffeine. I never have. The app thinks I do and there is no way to tell it I don't. So every single day I don't get updates about sleep, heart rate, movement, (or god forbid battery life) I just get some stupid push notification letting me know when my nightly caffeine window ends. It doesn't tell me it's dying or that I got 5 hours of sleep, just when I can drink coffee. There is limited control over this. Additionally it seems to have some kind of notification time out system where if I don't open the app every few days it won't send me any notifications at all. which considering all the ones it sends are fucking asinine, no tragedy but i would obviously prefer not to have to open the app and just have the device passively monitoring health trends for me over long periods of time.
4. The actual data. Like it or not the apple watch is the gold standard for wearable sleep tracking. The ring (when it is actually tracking, which it doesn't always do for the above reasons) have only medium agreement with my apple watch. it seems to consistently over estimate the amount of deep sleep I get and order conflates time in bed with time asleep, skewing my total sleep time up.

So tl;dr UH is a greedy company with bad QC that thinks the only thing people wanna know about is when they can drink coffee and makes a ring that can't track sleep.",2,1766699403.0,SmartRings,0,1.0,False

The meeting at the church would turn out to be interesting, and informative.

When Julie McClendon, who was now the minister at Salem Church, made the announcement that she would start a singing group, Jim’s mind went back to that summer evening in 1984 in Lansing, North Carolina.  That was the evening when Jim and his friends made a promise to remain friends forever, no matter what.  Now, it was the spring of 2011.  So far, they were making good on their promise.  At least, the ones who were still there.  Candi Faulkner, who was Jim’s wife, was killed in a plane crash in 2007.  Malachi Holbrook was still living in Boston, where he was running his own law practice (he was licensed to practice law in North Carolina and Massachusetts).  Malachi and his wife now had two kids.  They would eventually move back to Charlotte.  Kurt and Hannah Barrett were now married with a daughter named Summer.  They still lived in the neighborhood.  Vince and Marissa Crabtree still lived in the neighborhood as well.  Russell Gilmore was now a pharmacist in Charlotte.  Scout Gilmore was still living in Charlotte and was now working at a gas station.  Simon Cavanaugh married Ariel and they had a son named Nelson.  Alexandria Cavanaugh (Alex for short) was still single and lived in the neighborhood.  Alex’s sister, Sydney, was still single but seeing someone.  Mark Cavanaugh and his wife, Kendra, had three daughters.  April Lynn Holbrook, Julie’s sister, had a son named Ryan.  Ashley Holbrook Partridge, another one of Julie’s sisters, was now divorced and had a son.  The Brazilian girl named Tia still lived in Charlotte, and she was now working as a teller at a nearby Bank of America.  Julie was now widowed and raising five children.  Julie’s youngest sister, Toni Lynn Holbrook, was still single.

And of course, there was good ol’ Jim Faulkner.  He had been raising five girls on his own since losing his wife.  And he also had his own dealership, and it was named Queen City Chevrolet.  Mark Cavanaugh was the assistant manager.  Jim was also the chairman of the deacon board at Salem Church.  Mark was Sunday school director, and he was also a deacon. It seemed like everyone made good on keeping that promise that was made back on a warm but dreary Saturday evening in August of 1984.

While Jim thought a lot about his mother, Wendy, and her two daughters, Emily and Charlie (two of Jim’s half-sisters), he also did a super good job of caring about his father, Walter Faulkner, who had been out of his life for a good chunk of his childhood.  Walter had since remarried to a woman named Kate.  Jim gained two more half-sisters, Renee and Rachel, and a half-brother named Jerry.

Julie went on about the meeting, and what could be the biggest reason for it.  Everyone at the meeting was given some sheets of paper.  And on that sheet of paper, the name of the candidate for the associate minister.  From what Jim saw, she seemed to be pretty, and maybe a little shorter than him, with light brown hair and blue eyes.  *I hope I don’t spit up*, Jim thought.

Jim read the papers.  Julie went on to describe her.  “Folks, what you are looking at is info on the candidate for associate minister.  We think she would be good for this church.  Her name is Amber Renee Bianucci.  She is originally from a town called Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.  She was born in 1978 and is the oldest of three sisters.  She also has a young son named Skylar.  Amber has never been married, and she’s raised her son by herself.”

Jim looked at the picture of this woman named Amber.  She did look pretty.  Right away, Jim imagined her in a dress.  Jim tried his best not to flirt with Amber, hard as it may have been.  Julie announced that Amber was single.  A thought went through Jim’s mind.  *Oh no!*

Julie continued to describe Amber and her background.  “Amber graduated from high school in Pennsylvania.  After high school, she attended college in Hancock, Maryland.  Then Amber went on to attend Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia.  Amber graduated from Liberty University with degrees in ministry and music.  Amber was also a member of the Marshall University Singers.  Amber was a cheerleader in high school and in college and at both universities.”

Jim saw Christian and gospel singing programs on TV on Sundays since losing Candi.  He watched a lot of those programs.  Usually, Jim watched them just to see who was singing, and if the singer was female, or if the group of singers involved at least one female.  Jim would flirt with them, seeing what they were wearing, and even checking their left hands to see if they were married or spoken for.  When Julie mentioned the fact that Amber was a singer, Jim pictured Amber in his mind, wearing either a dress or a blouse and a skirt, pantyhose on her legs and high heels on her feet, carrying a microphone and looking pretty.  And right now, Jim was looking at Julie.  She was wearing a white blouse, a scarf around her neck tied to one side, and a black skirt.  Right now, Jim did not want anything serious.  And if he did get anything serious, Jim sure wasn’t going to let her enter the lives of his five daughters unless she loved them, and they loved her.  Jim had always been good at keeping his options open.

Julie said, “The floor’s open for questions and comments.  Anyone?”

For a moment, everyone just sat there, quiet as mice.  Especially Jim.  He had a hunch that someone was going to ask if this Amber Renee Bianucci was single.  Right then, Jim just wanted to crawl under the pews and get out of that church as quickly as he could.  Jim did stand up and was about an inch away from walking out the door.  But Julie saw him and said, “Jim.  I’ve got a feeling you wish to say something.”

Jim just stood there, not saying a word.  Jim looked to his left, and then to his right.  April Lynn was sitting beside Jim the whole time.  She just gently took his arm and pulled him back down onto the pew.  Rachel was sitting behind Jim and April Lynn.  Rachel leaned forward and made an intense thing out of whispering something in April Lynn’s ear.  Rachel tried not to let Jim hear what he was whispering.  But he heard it.  “April Lynn, maybe Jim should ask Julie if Amber Bianucci is single and looking for a man to love and marry.”

Then Rachel quickly backed off, but not before April Lynn said to her, “Rachel Faulkner!  I cannot believe you would suggest a thing like that.”

Then Jim said, “I heard that.  And neither could I.”

Julie quickly asked, “Rachel and April Lynn, something you two want to ask?”

Mark said, “Julie, I got a feeling Rachel and Renee want to know more about her so that they could hook her up with Jim.”

Then Rachel asked, “Mark, why would you think a thing like that?”

Mark answered, “Oh, come on, Rachel.  We all know what you and Renee are up to.  You just don’t want to see Jim alone and raising those girls by his lonesome.”

Then Jim said, “You all, I am doing quite well with my girls.”

Kendra said, “Jim, we know you are.  And there is a time and place for matchmaking and this is not the time or place.”

Then Jim said, “Thanks, Kendra.”

Then Julie said, “Yes, Kendra and Mark.  Thanks.”

Then Renee said, “I got three kids and I guess we’re doing well.  But I don’t know if I could do it with five.”

“I’m doing well, thank you,” Jim said.

Rachel quickly stood up and said, “Jim, I don’t know why you cannot get out once in a while and go out with someone instead of trying to do it on your own.”

Then April Lynn jumped out of her seat and said, “Jim will meet someone in his own time and when he feels like it.  Let’s just leave it there.”

“I agree, April Lynn,” Mark said.

Then April Lynn said, “Rachel and Renee, maybe you two should start up your dating website.  Don’t charge anyone for anything.  I’d be happy to be your first customer.”

Renee screamed, “April Lynn Holbrook!  I cannot believe you would suggest a thing like that!”

April Lynn said, “Why not?  You two seem to be pretty good at arranging other people’s lives, starting with your oldest brother.”

Then Julie raised her hand and said, “Okay, everyone.  Knock it off before I forget I am a minister and we are in a church.”

Then Kurt said, “Thank you, Julie.  Let’s get back to the issue at hand.  From what I saw, it seems as though Amber has a good character and a good attitude.  I feel she’ll be good for this church.”

Julie agreed with Kurt.  She proved that by saying, “Yes, Kurt.  I feel she could.  I think she has a lot to offer.”

Then Vince said, “I think Amber has a lot of quality and all the things this church is looking for.”

Then Jim added, “It’s hard to believe there was a time long ago when no one would even dream about the idea of a female person taking the pulpit of a church.  Everyone thought it was a man’s world.  Since Julie decided to become the Salem Church’s first female minister since we lost Reverend Courtland, I feel we’ve come a long way.  We’ve broken down some barriers.”

“Yes, Jim.  I know we did,” April Lynn said.

Then Julie said, “I want to put this to a vote.  But that will have to wait until she does a trial sermon.  And that will be soon.”

“How soon?” Walter asked.

Julie answered, “This Sunday.”

Then Marissa asked, “And when will she be in town?”

Julie answered, “She and her son and her sisters will be leaving Pennsylvania tomorrow.  They should be in Charlotte around seven tomorrow evening.”

Then Hannah asked, “Julie, if I may ask, what is the name of Amber’s son?   And what are the names of her sisters?”

Julie answered, “Her son’s name is Skylar and he’s about nine years old.  Her sisters are Amanda and Callie Bianucci.”

Jim said, “And I suppose Amanda and Callie are as pretty as Amber.”

Julie said, “Jim, I haven’t met them or Skylar.  Just Amber.”

“Then I guess we’ll meet them soon enough,” April Lynn said.

Julie said, “Yes, we will.  Okay, next item of business.”

Julie went onto her next item.  “As you all know, we are about to pay off that stubborn mortgage that has been over our heads for so many years.  Come the end of this month, we will officially make that last payment.  And when we pay off the mortgage, I wish to do something special to mark the occasion.”

Jim asked, “Julie, what have you got in mind?”

Julie answered, “A mortgage burning.  Churches do it all the time.”

April Lynn said, “Julie, I do hope you are planning on doing something legal.”

Maybe the cause for April Lynn’s concern was the fact that Julie was wanting to do some burning.  Maybe April Lynn wanted to make sure Julie was not planning to do anything to violate an ordinance in Charlotte that prohibits certain kinds of burning within the city limits.  Julie eased April Lynn’s fears.  Julie said, “Everyone, please don’t worry.  It’s nothing illegal.  I checked it out.  All I’m planning on doing is burning the mortgage papers on the lawn.  Don’t worry.  It’ll be out just as quick as it starts.”

Jim asked Julie, “Anything else planned for this mortgage burning?”

Julie answered, “Maybe a covered dish dinner.”

April Lynn said, “Sounds very good.”

Then Julie said, “Okay, then.  It’s all set.  Do I have a motion to proceed with plans for the mortgage burning?

Jim said, “As chairman of the deacon board, I make that motion.”

“Second?” Julie asked.

Mark said, “Second.”

And then Julie said, “Okay.  Motion passes.  I’ll let you all know when the mortgage burning is set.”

Then Julie went on to the next item of business.  “And I want to bring up something that I found dear to my heart.  I want to start a new youth singing ensemble.  Maybe an ensemble consisting of both kids, and maybe a couple adults.”

“Julie, that would certainly bring back some fantastic memories,” Jim said.

Julie paused for a moment.  Then she said, “Jim, it certainly would.”

Jim and Julie, along with April Lynn and Mark and Kendra and some of the others, knew that quite well.  They all remember the old Salem Church Youth Ensemble.  They also remembered the songs they sang, the times they had together, and most importantly, the friendships and the promise they made to remain friends forever, no matter what.  And now, here they were, twenty-seven years later.  And Julie came up with the idea of starting up a youth ensemble.  And here, all those years later, they were still friends even though Malachi was now living in Boston.  Candi and Todd were dead.  Some of those friends had kids of their own.

Jim knew his girls loved to sing and that Lindsay, one of his daughters, played guitar.  April Lynn’s son, Ryan, also liked to sing and could play keyboards just like his Uncle Todd did.  Maybe Julie came up with a great idea.  Maybe the kids would love to sing and play instruments for the ensemble and carry on the tradition of the original members of the ensemble.  Maybe those kids would make a promise like the one the original members of the ensemble made that summer evening back in 1984.  Maybe it wouldn’t be the same, but the parents could show their kids what it was all about.

Julie said, “I know what some of you may be thinking, and you may be right.  Maybe it would be cool to hand down some of what we had to our kids.  I feel the same way.”

Then Jim said, “Julie, I would love to play guitar and I’m sure Lindsay would, too.”

Julie said, “Jim, I would be upset if you didn’t.”

Jim said, “Then you have my vote.  I make a motion.”

Then Mark said, “And I second.”

Then April Lynn said, “And maybe our kids will make the very same promise we made years ago, to be friends and stay friends.”

Just hearing April Lynn say that brought a smile to Jim’s face, and then Julie smiled.  And then Julie laughed a little and said, “Okay.  Motion carries.  But we won’t jump into anything just yet.  This will take some planning.  But I can see we’re off to a good start.”

Then Walter stood up and said, “Folks, a promise is a promise and should be kept, no matter what.  I can see you all made a great promise and that you all are doing a great job of keeping it.”

After Walter sat down, Julie said, “Thanks, Walter.  Okay.  Any new business?”

Jim said, “I guess not.  Move we adjourn.”

Julie said, “Okay.  I guess we covered everything.  Do I hear a motion that we adjourn?”

Mark raised his hand and said, “I make a motion.”

“Second?” Julie asked.

April Lynn said, “I’ll second that.”

Then Julie said, “Okay.  Meeting adjourned.”

And with that, everyone got up and made their way to the door.  Julie met everyone at the door.  She said to Jim, “I can tell everyone was in good spirits this evening.  I never forgot our special promise.”

Jim said, “Julie, neither have I.  Maybe we can show our kids what it was all about.  Singing, fun, and friendships.”

April Lynn said, “Jim, I couldn’t agree more.  Ryan does love to play his keyboard.  Maybe we can let him play it some in church.”

Jim and Julie both quickly gave April Lynn a rather strange look.  Maybe it was something April Lynn brought up.  Todd McClendon also loved to play keyboard in church and as a member of the original ensemble.  Todd and Julie got married after high school.  That was back in 1990.  Julie had just given birth to her oldest daughter, Natalie.  Todd was killed in an automobile accident a few years ago.  April Lynn quickly said, “Sorry, Julie.  I guess it just came out.”

Julie said, “April Lynn, don’t worry.  It’s okay.  I understand.”

Then April Lynn said, “Jim, I know your girls love to sing.  Lindsay does play guitar quite well.  And I know Caitlyn likes to model and has ambitions of being in pageants.  Maybe this new ensemble will give her the experience she’ll need.”

Jim said, “Yes.  Maybe.”

Renee and Rachel were on their way out.  Renee pushed Marissa out of the church in her wheelchair.  Rachel said, “Jim, it really was good to see you tonight.  You’re gonna have to tell us about this original ensemble and that promise you all made.”

Jim said, “Rachel, when I get some time on my hands, I’ll tell you all about it.”

Rachel said, “Jim, I’ll be ready to listen.”

Then Jim said, “I guess I best be getting home to my beautiful girls.  They always like it when I see them off to bed, especially Valerie and Caitlyn.”

“You still see the older ones off to bed?” April Lynn asked Jim.

Jim answered, “Chelsea and Lauren see themselves off to bed.  But when I’m not there, they see Lindsay and Valerie and Caitlyn off to bed.”

“We’ll talk to you some more tomorrow, Jim,” Julie said.

Jim gave a wave to everyone, got in his car, and he was off to his house.

 

😊

 

When Jim got to his house, he saw three of his daughters in the living room.  Chelsea and Lauren were doing their homework.  Lindsay was sitting in one of the recliners, listening to her iPod.  Valerie and Caitlyn were already in bed.  Jim asked Chelsea and Lauren, “Girls, why are you doing your homework?”

Lauren answered, “We just want to be sure we’re caught up in our schoolwork.”

Then Jim said, “Girls, you are all still on break from school.  I figured you all would be enjoying yourselves.”

Chelsea said, “Dad, we’ve been enjoying ourselves during the first few days of this break.  Don’t you want us all to do well in school?”

Jim answered, “Chelsea, you know I do.  It’s also good to take some time off.”

Lauren said, “Dad, I agree.  We just wanna get caught up in our studies.”

Jim agreed.  Then he tried to get Lindsay’s attention.  Lindsay took off her ear buds.  Then Jim said, “Lindsay, I see you’re enjoying your music.”

“Yes, I am,” Lindsay said.

Then Jim smiled at Lindsay, and he said to her, “It’s okay, Lindsay.  I like to listen to music, too.”

And with that, Lindsay smiled back at Jim.  She put her ear buds on and returned to listening to her music. 

Jim looked out the living room window.  When he got home from the church, the rain had let up a little.  But it started to rain some more.  The forecast for tomorrow called for more rain with some clearing by that Friday.  He said to the girls, “It looks like we’re in for some more rain.  And there may be more tomorrow.  Do you girls have any plans for tomorrow?”

Chelsea answered, “I don’t know, Dad.  I guess we’re not going to the park tomorrow.  Maybe we’ll just hang out around the house.”

Jim looked at the girls, and he said, “I guess that’s a plan.  I gotta work tomorrow.  After that, I guess my schedule’s free.”

Lindsay let out a yawn, and then she said, “I guess I’ll be making tracks for bed.  Good night, everyone.”

Everyone said altogether, “Good night, Lindsay.”

A few minutes later, Chelsea and Lauren were off to bed.

Jim turned off the lights in both the living room and dining room.  And then he went upstairs to the master bedroom.  He turned on the TV and watched the last of a movie.  Then he watched the news.  He wanted to see if the weather forecast was still calling for rain tomorrow.  It was.  He knew that things at Queen City Chevrolet would be slow, just like earlier today.  No one would want to shop for an automobile in bad weather.

Before Jim could go to sleep, the phone rang.  He wondered who would be calling at this time of the night.  Jim answered it.  On the other end of the call, “Hi, Jim.  It’s Julie.”

Jim said, “Hi, Julie.  What’s up?”

Julie said, “I need to ask you something.”

“If it’s about this Amber Bianucci, please save it.  I told you.  I’m not ready for a relationship.  I got my girls to think of.”

“Jim, I know.  And what makes you think I’m thinking about hooking you up with Amber?  You haven’t met her yet.”

“Sorry, Julie.  What did you want to ask me?”

“Do you still have that book on how to play guitar?”

“You mean ‘Guitar for Dummies?’”

“Yes, Jim.  That one.”

“Julie, are you thinking about playing guitar?”

“I thought I’d take a crack at it.”

“Sure, Julie.  I can bring it to you sometime tomorrow.”

“Thanks, Jim.  That’ll be great.”

“You think any of your kids may want to try their hand at learning to play guitar?” Jim asked.

Julie answered, “Yes.  Maybe.  Morgan and Megan had expressed some interest in learning to play guitar.”

“What about the other kids?”

“I’m not sure.  Cooper’s still a little boy but maybe he’ll find his calling.  Natalie has some interest in piano.  Harmony’s more into singing.”

“That’s good.  Lindsay learned to play guitar from that book.  Maybe it’ll do some good for you, Megan and Morgan.”

“Thanks, Jim.  I hope so.  I can come over and pick up that book sometime tomorrow.”

“Okay, Julie.  See you tomorrow.”

Jim stayed up for a few more minutes.  He thought about that meeting at the church.  He knew Renee and Rachel had been trying to arrange his life since losing Candi.  At first, he thought Julie (and maybe April Lynn also) was about to join the two half-sisters of Jim’s in matchmaking.  Todd McClendon, Julie’s husband, was killed in an automobile accident about a year after Candi was killed in a plane crash.  Since then, it seemed Julie had done a fairly good job at raising her five kids on her own.  Julie was not interested in getting into a relationship, any more than Jim.  Just like Julie, Jim seemed to have been doing a good job of raising his five girls on his own, even though he did have a housekeeper who helped. 

A while back, Jim was watching a sitcom on TV.  It was an episode of “Roseanne.”  He heard a line.  He thought it was cool, and he liked it.  *Concentrating on your life can make you a better person*.  He would use that phrase a lot, along with many others.  He also knew something else.  *If anyone cannot count on his or her family and friends, it is a sorry world*.  Jim did not make that promise back in the summer of 1984 just for the sake of making a promise, and neither did anyone else.  Even though two of those friends were now deceased, the friendships were still there, and stronger than ever.  Jim and the others knew they had friends to count on for the good times and bad, now and forever.

 

😊

 

Jim woke up the next morning.  And sure enough, it was raining.

His daughters were not up yet.  Jim figured he would just let them sleep.  *Good enough day for it*, he thought.  Jim just made himself a cup of coffee (black with sugar, just like he always liked it, and quite strong as well), and he took the cup upstairs while he looked in on his girls.

Jim stopped by the bedroom Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay shared.  He woke up Chelsea so he could speak to her.  He tried to be as quiet as possible so as not to wake up Lauren and Lindsay.  Jim said, “Chelsea, I may be at the car dealership almost the entire day.  As soon as you can, please fix your sisters some breakfast, and please fix some lunch later, okay?”

“Okay, Dad.  I’m getting ready to get up.  I’ll get cleaned up and then I’ll go downstairs and start breakfast.”

“Okay, Chelsea.  You girls enjoy your day at home.  I’ll see you all this evening.”

Jim walked to Valerie’s room and Caitlyn’s room (Valerie and Caitlyn both had their own rooms).  He checked on them before he left for work.  On his way out the door, Jim grabbed two doughnuts and made him another cup of coffee.

 

😊

 

Jim spent nearly the entire day at the car dealership.  Even though the weather was bad, business seemed to be okay, but not perfect.  Jim did not go out for lunch.  Instead, he ate a bag of Fritos, a pack of cheese crackers, and he drank a bottle of Coke.  Jim did manage to sell two cars, a used Cadillac and a new Chevy truck.  Jim took occasional breaks, and during those breaks he just looked out the window.  It looked rather dreary, fog shrouding the skyline.  Rain was coming down, sometimes in buckets.  He thought about Candi, and how much he missed her.  He also thought about the meeting at the church.  He thought about how two of his half-sisters tried their hand at hooking Jim up with a young woman, who would soon be the church’s new associate minister.  And no one, not even Jim, had met her yet.  Jim also knew that Renee and Rachel were also trying to arrange the lives of Julie and April Lynn.  They were not ready for a serious relationship, any more than Jim.  Julie and April Lynn were now single parents.  Julie had five children, including one in nursing school.  April Lynn had a young son, and so did April Lynn’s sister Ashley.  Before Jim left work for the day, he got a phone call from Julie.  She needed to see him at her house as soon as possible.  She said April Lynn, Ashley, Toni and the Gilmore kids would be there also.

 

😊

 

Jim drove to Julie’s house.  After Julie married Todd McClendon, the couple lived in the house where she grew up, but Audrey Holbrook stayed in the house until she moved out and got an apartment in Dilworth, which she shared with Charmaine Cattrall.  Now, Julie was still living there, raising her kids as only she could.

Jim arrived at Julie’s house.  He went inside.  Julie and her sisters and the Gilmore kids were in the living room.  Whatever the reason was for this, it seemed important.

Julie said, “Jim, I got a major phone call this afternoon.”

Jim said, “It must be important, the way you spoke to me before I left the car dealership.”

“Yes, Jim.  It is.  It was from Malachi.”

“What did he have to say?”

“He and his family are coming to Charlotte soon.”

“Another visit?” Jim asked.

Then April Lynn said, “No, Jim.  Malachi may be coming back to Charlotte permanently.”

“Is everything okay between him and his wife?” Jim asked.

Toni answered, “Oh yes, Jim.  Never better.”

Then Julie said, “Jim, his wife’s job is relocating to Charlotte.  Malachi will have to open up a practice here.”

Malachi’s wife.  That would be Stacy Holbrook.  Malachi met Stacy in Boston while he was still in law school.  They eventually married and had two children, a daughter named Michaela and a son named Chandler.  When Malachi made his periodic visits to Charlotte, he would bring his wife and kids with him.  Malachi and his wife and kids would make a point to meet with Jim each time.  The visits would be memorable.  But when they left, Jim would be sad to see them go.  But one thing was for sure.  Malachi, like Jim and the others, never forgot that important promise they made to remain friends forever, no matter what.

When Jim heard the news from the Holbrook sisters, Jim thought of something.  He said, “It looks like we’re all gonna be together again!”

April Lynn said, “And you’re talking about that promise.”

“Yes.  I am,” Jim said.

Then Ashley said, “Of course, there are two who are no longer with us.”

April Lynn sadly said, “I know.  Candi and Todd.”

Toni Holbrook and Jeremy Barrett were not with those kids that summer evening in 1984 when they made that promise.  But Toni and Jeremy would be added to that promise eventually, with help from Jim and the other Holbrook kids and Kurt Barrett, as well as the Cavanaugh kids, Candi, Todd, Russell and Scout and Paulina Gilmore, Vince and Marissa Crabtree, Hannah Duncan, that Brazilian girl named Tia, and Ariel and Jodi Cattrall.  Through the years as more friends were made, they would also be added to that special promise.

True, Candi and Todd were dead.  But everyone felt they were with them, if only in spirit.  They felt it made that promise even more worthwhile.  Now, with Malachi and his family relocating to Charlotte, Jim and the others felt it would be nice if they could add Stacy to that promise.  They planned to do just that. 

Jim asked, “Do you think we should add Stacy to that promise we made to remain friends, no matter what?”

April Lynn answered, “Yes, Jim.  I really think we should.”

Then Julie said, “Malachi told Stacy often about that promise.  I’m sure Stacy will go along with it.”

Then Jim asked, “Any idea when they’re going to arrive?”

Julie answered, “From what Malachi said, about a month.  He’ll be here in a couple days.  Stacy will be with him, but the kids will be staying with relatives in Boston.  Malachi will be looking for an office, and Stacy will be getting familiar with Charlotte, her new office and her new surroundings.  And of course, they’ll have to find a house.”

April Lynn added, “And I will be helping them with that.”

“What kind of work does Stacy do?” Jim asked.

Julie answered, “She is a manager for a children’s clothing store in Boston.  But the store chain is opening a new office and warehouse in Charlotte.  The company appointed Stacy as regional manager.  And besides, Malachi had been wanting to move back to Charlotte.  I guess the move to Charlotte was what both Malachi and Stacy wanted.”

“What is the name of this children’s clothing store chain?” Jim asked.

Julie answered, “The Children’s Closet.”

Jim said, “I heard of them.  I know they have three stores in Charlotte.”

Ashley said, “Yes.  On South Boulevard, Albemarle Road and in the Cotswold Shopping Center.”

Julie said, “They want to add more stores in Charlotte and both Carolinas.”

Jim said, “It will sure be good to have one of our friends back in our fine neighborhood.”

The Holbrook sisters seemed to agree with what Jim just said.  Like the sisters, Jim also kept in touch with Malachi.  In addition to phone calls, Jim maintained regular chats with Malachi by way of Facebook and Skype.  That way, even though Malachi was not in Charlotte, Jim was able to keep up with one of his friends who could not be there.  The chats were memorable, but Jim (along with everyone else) wished they could be in Charlotte.  And now, Malachi was about to return to Charlotte, bringing his wife and kids with him.

Julie looked hard at the three Gilmore kids.  Then she said, “Russell, Scout and Paulina.  We all missed you at the recent get-together at Jim’s house.”

Then Toni asked, “Yeah, what was up with that?’

Paulina said, “Oh, I guess we should’ve told you.  Mom took us out of town to see some relatives of ours.”

“Where was this?” Julie asked.

Scout answered, “Bristol, Tennessee.”

Then Russell said, “That’s where we’re originally from.  You all know about Bristol, don’t you?”

Julie said, “Yes, Russell.  We do.”

Then Russell continued to tell the story.  “It’s like this.  Bristol is situated over two states, Tennessee and Virginia.  But then again, everybody knows that.  Anyway, our father was a county agent for Sullivan County, Tennessee.  Therefore, we had to live on the Tennessee side.”

Then Scout took over.  “We did attend school on the Virginia side.  We also did our grocery shopping on the Virginia side.  We used to ride our bikes to the Virginia side to see our friends.”                  

Then, it was Paulina’s turn.  “Those were some good times.  But suddenly, we began to see some changes in Mom and Dad.  It was becoming clear that they didn’t love each other any longer.  One day after what we felt was a great Christmas, Mom packed up almost everything we had, and we left Bristol.  She said she wanted to start a new life for us.  We kept asking her and asking her where we were going.  All she said was, ‘Until we run out of road.’  At first, I thought we were going to Florida.  But somehow, we ended up here.  Charlotte, North Carolina.”

Russell said, “Christmas of 1983.  I got a boom box, an electronic football game and a train set.  Scout got a slot car track.  Paulina got some teddy bears and a small radio.”

Scout said, “Mom didn’t pack them.  We asked her why.  She said that she did not want to take any toys with us.  We did, however, take some die-cast cars with us.  Paulina took a teddy bear and a couple Barbie Dolls.  Mom didn’t find out about that until we got to Charlotte.”

Paulina closed out the story by saying, “It made us sad to leave all that behind.  Mom doesn’t like to talk about all that.”

Jim said, “Don’t worry.  I won’t bring that up with Pam.”

He never would.

And as for why they were not at the get-together, Jim said, “Russell, Scout and Paulina, I can understand why you weren’t at my house.  And don’t worry.  There’s nothing to be sorry about.  It sounds to me you all enjoyed yourselves.”

Paulina said, “Thanks, Jim.  We’ll try to be at your next get-together.”

Before Jim left the house, another subject came up.  Jim asked, “Julie, what’s the last word on that new associate minister getting here?”

Julie answered, “I spoke to Amber a while ago.  She is going to spend some time with some relatives of hers in Knoxville.  She’ll be headed for Charlotte tomorrow.  Her sisters and her son will be with her.”

“Sounds good,” Jim said.

Then Julie said, “They’ll be in church come Sunday.  We’re going to have an opportunity to check her out.”

Then Ashley said, “I just hope things turn out okay.”

“What do you mean by that?” Jim asked Ashley.

Ashley answered, “Jim, I know Renee and Rachel are wanting to check her out so that they could fix you up with her, I mean if she’s pretty enough.”

Jim said, “I said it before, and I will say it again.  I don’t want to rush into a serious relationship.  I have my daughters to think about and I want them to like any woman I bring into my life.  And I want her to like them.”

“We know that, Jim,” Julie said.

Then Toni said, “Jim, don’t ever be scared to have a girlfriend, even though you have five kids.”

“Thanks, Toni.  I won’t,” Jim said.

Jim got up and made his way to the front door.  Julie walked behind him.  The two walked out onto the front porch.  Julie said, “Jim, please do not what was said in there bother you.”

“You mean about Amber, and two of my half-sisters trying to arrange my life?”

“Yes, Jim.  If you decide to return to dating, the time will come.”

“Thanks, Julie.”

Then Julie said, “You know that State Farm agent who has that office next to the Sunbeam Bread Store?  He asked me out on a date a couple times.”

“And what did you tell him?” Jim asked.

Julie answered, “I told him I’d have to think very long and hard on that.”

“Anything else?” Jim asked Julie.

Julie said, “Yes.  I also told him I have five kids, and that includes one in nursing school.  I also told him they come first.”  

“Good, Julie.  Now I will say it.  Don’t rush into anything.”

“Don’t worry, Jim.  I won’t.”

Jim and Julie both got a look at the outside.  It was still raining, but it looked like it was about to let up.  According to the weather forecast on Channel 3, it would be clearing up tomorrow and getting warmer.  Julie said, “I know we needed this rain.  But I will be glad to see it clear up.  I may take my kids to the park tomorrow.”

“That’ll be good.  Maybe my girls can join you all,” Jim said.

Jim and Julie gave each other a hug.  Then Jim headed for his house.  When he got home, he saw the four oldest girls were in the living room.  Jim asked them, “Where’s Caitlyn at?”

Lauren answered, “Caitlyn’s upstairs in her room.  She hung out with us.  I guess she got tired and went to bed.  She’s been asleep for about an hour.”

Jim went upstairs to Caitlyn’s room.  He slowly opened the door.  He left the light off.  The room was dark, except for light from the outside coming through the blinds.  The radio beside Caitlyn’s bed was softly playing.  Smooth jazz music.  She liked it, just like Jim.  Jim slowly sat down on the bed beside Caitlyn.  He softly played with her curled blonde hair.  It did not awaken her.  But a soft touch of Jim’s hand on her shoulder did.  He asked her, “Honey, are you okay?”

Caitlyn sluggishly answered, “Yeah.  I’m okay.  Just tired.”

“Your older sisters wore you out, huh?”

“Yeah, they did.”

“Well, at least you all enjoyed your day.”

That was when Valerie stepped into the room.  She said, “We played with our Hot Wheels track and we played some video games.  We had a good time.”

Jim looked up and smiled at Valerie.  Then he said, “The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow.  Maybe you girls can go to the park.”

“Can we, Dad?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes, you girls sure can.  And something else.  Julie and her kids are going to be there tomorrow.  Maybe you all can play with them.”

Valerie said, “Dad, that’ll be good.  They’re a lot of fun to play with.”

Maybe Caitlyn didn’t hear what was being said.  She just went back to sleep.  Jim managed to wake her back up.  He said to her, “Caitlyn, I was telling Valerie about you girls going to the park tomorrow.  Julie and her kids are going to be there.  Maybe you would like to play with them.”

At that moment, a song from Jim’s past played on the radio.  It was from an eighties artist named Sade (pronounced *shar-day*).  The song was called “Love Is Stronger Than Pride.”  Jim said, “Oh, girls.  You two just listen to that.  That song reminds me of the good times I had with your mother and my friends.”

“You mean Julie and April Lynn and Mark and the others?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Oh, yes.  We had some good times.”

“Oh, I see,” Valerie said.

“A long time ago, we made a promise.  We promised to remain friends forever, no matter what.  We’re making good on that promise.”

Then, Chelsea stuck her head in the door and asked, “Dad, what should I prepare for dinner?”

Jim answered, “Oh, I think there’s a couple Red Baron pizzas in the freezer.  Why don’t you put those in the oven and heat ‘em up?  And there just may be some salad in the fridge.  Those will sound good.”

“Okay, Dad.  Sounds good,” Chelsea said.

Then Jim said, “I guess I’ll be stopping at the supermarket on my way home from work tomorrow.”

Jim always stopped at a supermarket at least once a week.  He knew it took a lot of food to feed himself and five young girls.  He always made sure there was some food for meals, plenty of Sunbeam bread, peanut butter, snacks for himself and the girls (the girls enjoyed them, especially after school), Cokes and juices in the fridge (especially Tropicana, Hawaiian Punch and V-8), along with plenty of milk and cheese, coffee and all kinds of other foods as well. 

Jim woke Caitlyn and he said to her, “Caitlyn, honey.  Try to stay awake.  Dinner will be ready soon.”

“Okay, Dad.  I’ll be ready for dinner,” Caitlyn said.

Chelsea and Lindsay had dinner ready in about twenty minutes.  Pizza and salad.  It was really good.

 

😊

 

Jim always made a point to tell his girls about that promise he made with his friends back in the summer of 1984.  Jim was sure his friends told their children about that promise as well.  Jim, along with his friends, wanted their kids to know that a promise was something that should be kept, no matter what.  Now, twenty-seven years later, Jim and the others wanted to hold on to that promise and hand it down to their kids.  Jim and his friends hoped that by letting their kids know about that promise, they could know what friendships are about.

Jim asked his girls if they would be interested in joining the new singing groups Julie was wanting to start up.  They said they were interested.  The other kids expressed interest as well. 

Now, they were about to see what that promise was about.",1,1766699361.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

1pvnpcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/infinitenines/comments/1pvnpcr/zenos_paradox_limits_and_why_0999_is_one/,"Zeno's Paradox, limits, and why 0.999... is one.","I saw a comment on another thread in this subreddit arguing that limits are never reached ""I didn’t get to Cleveland on my trip but I am in Cleveland"" and it got me thinking: 0.999... being strictly less than one is just a problem of perspective and the lack of imagination to conceptualize the infinite. 

The easiest way to solve Zeno's paradox is to recognize that the world behaves differently at infinity.

Consider two scenarios that differ only by perspective (1 vs 0.99...).

A) I'm 1km outside Cleveland and I walk at 4kph (and I realize that I'm fixing autocorrect to American spelling while using metric distances). Do I reach Cleveland? Of course, and it will take 15 minutes. Easy.

B) Now suppose that I am standing 1km outside of Cleveland and I walk 900m. Then I walk 90m more. Then 9m more. And so on. Each and every leg of the journey only covers 90% of the remaining distance? Do I reach Cleveland? If you are in the 0.9... != 1 camp then absolutely not: each leg covers 90% of the distance. After n steps you still have 1km\*10\^(-n) remaining and n is a natural number (one of infinitely many) and 1km\*10\^(-n)>0, so no matter how many steps (expanding in their own space) you never get there. 

What if to B we now say 

Me: ""Yeah, but each stage takes 10 percent of the time the previous step took"".

SPP: ""No dum-dum. It is still a positive amount of time for any number of steps. And you can't take infinitely many steps because infinity is ever expanding and it isn't a number."" 

Me: ""Yeah, but the distance covered is an expanding sum and we can compute the distance covered in infinitely many steps and it's a limit.""

SPP and crew: ""No dum dum, limits aren't real. You never reach the limit. You alway cover some distance LESS than the limit. The distance remaining is, and always will be 1km\*10\^(-n)>0, which is always positive no matter how big n is. The distance remaining is positive, you never get to Cleveland."" 

If you view walking 1km as an infinite sequence of progressively shorter distances you will only get there if you accept that 0.9+0.09+0.009+0.0009+...=1, which is the limit of the sum, only if you allow taking infinitely many steps. And I note that I can view walking a fixed distance conceptually as taking infinitely many increasingly shorter journeys and the limit of the sum traversed is reached after infinitely many stages. I'm about to walk to get my second cup of coffee and I'm pretty confident that I'm going to get there because although the distance that I'll cover can be viewed as the infinite sum of a geometric progression I know that the distance covered will equal the limit, and thus 0.999...=1.",1,1766699239.0,infinitenines,3,1.0,False
1pvno3p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvno3p,Christmas !!!,"Just like the title says, this is what I got for Christmas. 

I’m so amazed and thrilled. I’ve been listening to these albums for awhile now, even made playlist just to listen to them like how the vinyl is ..  

“vinyl club edition brown acid” and both of the classical records I had to make playlist for. 

I’ve been obsessed with Japanese 70’s rock for awhile now.. I actually have more records coming so this honestly just solidifies my collection even more. 

Jazz fusion - whether it’s herbie Hancock, Wayne shorter, miles Davis, John Coltrane, etc .. I love it all, also love some of the “funkier” stuff like “thrust” & “secrets”. I could go on and on listing albums.. but then we’d be here all day 😂 

( I also have some Wayne shorter records coming ) 

Classical - I love to sit and drink coffee and read.. so this pairs really well with those moments.. i also genuinely enjoy me some Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin, etc

Brown acid - I found out about brown acid a long while ago.. I’ve known about them for awhile.. you could technically say I’m a poser bc I’m not even a part of the club or monthly subscriber it takes to attain this.. I just ended up seeing it and figure it was kinda rare which after my research.. it seems it kinda is 😂 besides this album I have no other brown acid records .. but trust me I have a full playlist.. don’t ask me why I don’t have any other brown acid records.. bc idk myself 😭 

ATH-S300BT headphones - for me they were a must. 

Not to mention they have noise cancellation.. it’s one of those moments “I’ll never go back” .. every thing can be heard.. every sonic note, and piece of dust 😂.. yes it’s that precise.. ofc I paired them with my audio technica 

AT-LP70XBT record player.. so maybe it’s just my needle.. idk, definitely recommend if you want to take ur vinyl record listening experience to the next level. ",3,1766699142.0,vinyl,0,1.0,False

By Alan J Winters 

In the hush before the sunrise, when the world is trimmed in white,  
A gentle peace drifts over towns still holding to the light.  
Benson’s streets lie calm and waiting, Montevideo dreams along,  
And Dawson hums its winter tune  a soft, familiar song.

The coffee warms the hands that built a lifetime out of grit,  
The tree glows with the stories every ornament has lit.  
Footsteps echo memories of the ones who shaped our days,  
And love becomes the lantern that still guides us through the haze.

The star above the stable shines on every weary heart,  
Reminding us that hope begins in places torn apart.  
So gather close the blessings that this season brings anew 
A quiet room, a steady flame, the ones who carry you.

For Christmas isn’t wrapped in gold or found beneath a tree;  
It’s in the grace that meets us where we are, and sets us free.  
It’s in the hands that mend, the hearts that give, the stories we restore   
A promise whispered every year: you’re held, you’re loved, once more.",1,1766699029.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1pvnma2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1pvnma2/how_are_people_with_horrible_families_moving_on/,How are people with horrible families moving on without them?,"I come from a home where my mom refused to heal her traumas and continues to refuse to heal her issues. All she does is talk about things that happened to her every single day, starting straight when I wake up. That’s literally all she talks about, all day.

For insight: my parents abused me growing up, and my house was always dysfunctional. I had to deal with so much abuse from my parents as a woman. My mom constantly broke my trust and lies to me all the time. She also has this pregnancy addiction where she’s always pregnant. I have so many siblings alhamdulillah, but it honestly sucks so bad. She lets the kids be disrespectful to me, and whenever I try to discipline them with my words or even defend myself, my mom goes crazy. She stops it, sometimes even hits me, and tells me I know nothing and can’t teach them anything. She has something against me. She hates me.

When I studied abroad this summer in Turkey, it was the happiest and most peaceful I’ve ever been in my life. I genuinely didn’t think about my family once while I was gone, except for my baby brother, when I missed him. Talking to my mom while I was there was hell. Every time I called her, she barely listened to anything I was excited about or learned. She would immediately turn the conversation back to how horrible people have treated her, drama with my aunts, and her problems, for hours. The only way I can “get along” with her is if I’m giving her verbal support for her drama. Otherwise, there’s nothing to talk about. When I’m on campus, she only calls me to complain about the same things. I can’t have a normal conversation with her about life, school, or anything.

I’m depressed. I barely leave my bed and don’t take care of my mental health at all. I used to have dreams, interests, and things I loved. My mom would fight with me every day to keep me inside the house, and she still does. Then she gets mad that I’m always in bed. She also does this weird fear-mongering. When I was learning how to drive, she constantly told me she *knew* I would die driving, that she was sure of it, and that I should only take the bus. She did this for years until I completely stopped driving. Now they tell me I’m lazy and need to start driving again. Too late. She was in my ears for three years about not doing it.

My mom ruined my youth. I used to go to Friday prayer with my friends and get coffee or lunch after for a few hours, not far from home, and she would fight with me every single time. Now I don’t even go. She would yell at me for going to the masjid or halal stores because she thought I’d look like a woman with no morals and that I was going there to look for a man. She literally asked me if my goal was to find a man by doing that. Even when I said I wanted to fast sunnah days, she told me I couldn’t unless I was ready to do it my whole life. She doesn’t even pray herself, but she tells me I pray wrong or says crazy controlling things.

She makes fun of my food when I cook or bake. Nothing I do is ever right. I try not to talk to her, but it’s still my mom, and I care about her even if the love feels gone.

There are so many more things. She’s pregnant again, and I honestly can’t stand my whole family anymore. My sisters act the same way. My dad sees it sometimes and tells me he understands, but overall he believes we just need patience and that we should avoid upsetting my mom. Meanwhile, all my mom does is complain to me about her pregnancy pains every day, without even asking how I am. As if it wasn’t her choice. As if she hasn’t done this a hundred times. But she never cares if I’m sick. If I’m crying or sad, she makes it worse. If I’m sick, she tells me to stay away from her.

The moment I see her in the house, all she does is tell me to clean something or criticize me. No other conversation. But when she sees our cat, she’s all bubbly like “oh my baby are you okay.” She has more mercy for a cat than for me. She has told me she hated me before. She abandoned me when I needed her most.

These days I feel zero love for my mom, and it scares me. I never thought life would turn out like this. I used to be the happiest, bubbliest person in the house. I used to shine regardless of my family. Now I’ve been drowning for years, and they’re fine with it. They step on me while I’m down. I can literally be crying and they laugh.

Why would I care about my mom’s pregnancy pains when she doesn’t care about me? When she talks badly about me to my dad and sisters constantly? When she wakes me up screaming at me over ridiculous things? One time she asked me to clean two bathrooms. I cleaned both completely except the bathtub in one because it was 12am and the bleach was making me sick. The bathroom was spotless otherwise. She woke me up screaming asking why i forgot a tub.

I’ve developed so much anger toward my family, especially my mom, because she feels malicious. I never wanted things to be like this. I’m 22, and I ignored it for so long, but I’m too old for this now. I’m too old for constant disrespect and pain. I’m truly depressed. I hate life. She makes life worse. Now life feels ugly. If I can’t trust my mom, sisters, or dad, who can I trust? I have no friends. I’m completely alone. I’m scared. I’ve been hurt by so many people.

I don’t know how other women deal with this. It hurts so much. I want to move out. I have one more year of uni after this upcoming semester. My dream is dental school, but I also want to leave the country. Dental school is best in America though. I know nothing about life and don’t feel educated enough to live on my own. My parents won’t allow it, but my secret plan is to only apply to masters or dental programs out of state and just leave. I know it will be expensive and hard without family support.

I refuse to be the woman whose family was horrible so she gave up on her dreams, got married, and lived miserably. I won’t. I have to fix my life. I don’t know what to do. I just need support and advice. You can comment, or if you’re a woman, please message me. And please don’t recommend marriage. I was already abused by a man, and the last thing I want is to leave one situation just to move in with another man. I won’t do it.

People rushed past, the air was filled with noise but the man walked calmly, quietly, watching.

Ahead, a stranger stumbled into the street, cradling a small, motionless girl in his arms. “Help! Please, someone call 911!” he cried, desperation cracking his voice.

Within seconds, a woman rushed to dial her phone. Another man took off his coat and laid it over the child.

The man walked past, his eyes soft not because he didn’t care, but because he knew she wasn’t alone.

A few blocks later, in a park near a lake, an old man sat feeding ducks from a wooden bench. Suddenly, he slumped forward and fell to the ground.

A jogger immediately stopped, kneeling beside him, checking for breath. Two teens ran to alert a nearby officer. An older woman took the man’s hand and whispered, “You’re okay. We’re here.”

The man walked on.

Around the next corner, he heard a woman cry out from a narrow alley. “Help! Please!”

She was being robbed.

Before the man could even stop, a bystander had already intervened. A shopkeeper stepped outside with a broom, shouting. A cyclist tossed his phone to another, calling 911. The thief fled. The woman collapsed into the arms of the one who helped.

The man kept his way, his hands in his pockets, the faintest smile touching his lips.

At the cemetery beyond the city’s edge, a caretaker struggled with a pulley system as he lowered a coffin into the ground. He wept openly until two mourners stepped forward, silently offering their help. Together, they steadied the ropes, hands joined in quiet reverence.

The man bowed his head, then continued walking.

He crossed an intersection as a car sped toward the corner. The driver, distracted by his phone, looked up too late but a pedestrian grabbed a stroller just in time, yanking it from the street. The car swerved, crashed into a coffee shop window.

Inside, people rushed to help. No one screamed. They moved like one body lifting debris, checking on each other, comforting the shaken.

The man walked past the rising dust, untouched by fear, warmed by the sound of strangers becoming neighbors.

At the next block, he saw a child crying beside her mother, who lay motionless on the sidewalk. A nurse ran from a nearby building, dropping her bag, already checking the mother’s pulse. A group of strangers formed a circle, shielding them from traffic and noise.

The child was not alone.

The man kept walking.

A crowd gathered around two groups arguing in the street. Tension crackled. Suddenly, someone drew a gun.

A loud voice rang out: “STOP!”

A police officer stepped between them just as the shot fired hitting him in the shoulder. He dropped to the ground; both group fled the scene.

But a woman tore off her scarf to press against the wound. Another reach the scene and called for backup. the women took the officer’s hand and said, “Help is on the way, stay with me.”

Their eyes met. the officer saw peace.

Sirens wailed again, but not out of chaos. They were the sound of response, of care coming closer.

The man reached the steps of a home. He climbed them slowly and opened the door.

Inside, a large family had gathered. Children. Grandchildren. Friends. The room was quiet but full to full of warmth, full of life.

In the center lay an old man in bed, surrounded by love. One of the children held his hand. Others sat close, listening, waiting.

The man who had been walking all day stood at the back of the room.

The old man looked up.

His eyes softened. He saw them all those who had loved, helped, fought, and stayed.

And with a final breath, he smiled and whispered:

“A life is not measured by the years we live… but by the love we give away.”

1pvnjym,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pvnjym/persian_romantic_interest/,Persian romantic interest,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice about a woman I’ve gotten close to at work. We don't work directly with one another, but see each other often, and I befriended her quickly. We’ve had coffee together many times, she’s shared personal things about her family and life back home, and she does small thoughtful things for me that feel meaningful. She also asked if I could help her with some things that require us to interact more face-to-face, which I'm happy to do.

I’m culturally ""western"" and older by a bit over 10 years. I’m romantically interested in her, but I’m cautious because of work and because I really value our connection. I gave her my number and we text on other platforms sometimes. She always replies, sometimes instantly and other times much later even days. She’s used heart emojis and heart-eyes/in-love emojis before, which threw me offguard. In person she’s warm, smiles a lot, and has given me small gifts. All of this makes it hard to tell if she’s being friendly or if there’s something more.

The biggest issue for me is the vibe when we’re together. It feels like there might be something deeper, but I’m not always great at trusting my intuition in situations like this. I think I’m extra careful because I don’t want to misread things and lose what we already have.

For those familiar with Persian culture or similar situations, does this sound like cautious interest, mixed signals, or just friendship? How would you approach this without crossing workplace boundaries?

1pvnjk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pvnjk9/the_man_who_kept_walking/,The Man who kept walking,"A man walked through a busy city street, his gaze fixed on the ground. People rushed past, voices blended into a blur, but he remained disconnected, as if moving through a world not his own.

Suddenly, he stumbled into someone a stranger holding a small girl in his arms. The child was limp. The man’s face was soaked in tears as he cried out, “Help! Please, someone call 911!”

But the man kept walking, unmoved.

A few blocks later, he stopped briefly at the edge of a quiet park. An old man sat alone on a bench by the lake, scattering crumbs for a pair of ducks. Then, without warning, the old man slumped forward and fell from the bench. He didn’t move again. The path was empty no one else around.

Still, the man said nothing. He did nothing. He just walked on.

Turning a corner, a sharp cry echoed from a nearby alley.

“Help me!”

He glanced toward the sound. A woman was struggling, being robbed her voice strained, her face contorted in fear. The man paused only a moment before continuing down the street, unaffected.

Eventually, he reached the cemetery at the city’s edge. There, a lone caretaker was lowering a coffin into a freshly dug grave. The man watched from a distance as the caretaker strained with the pulley system. Tears streamed down his face, falling like rain onto the polished wood. Then suddenly, the cord slipped both the coffin and the caretaker fell into the grave.

The man turned away.

He crossed the street just as a car sped toward the intersection. The driver, eyes glued to his phone, looked up at the last second just in time to swerve. He missed the man... but crashed into a coffee shop at the corner. Shattered glass, screams, and dust filled the air.

Still, the man didn’t flinch.

Behind him, chaos and cries echoed through the streets.

At the end of the block, he saw a child kneeling beside a motionless woman on the sidewalk her mother. The child sobbed, clinging to her still hand. The man walked past without slowing.

Further on, a police officer was caught in the middle of a heated conflict between two groups. Tension cracked someone pulled a gun. A shot rang out. The officer was hit in the throat. He fell, gasping, blood pouring from between his fingers.

People scattered in panic, leaving the officer alone.

The man passed by. Their eyes met briefly. In the officer’s final breath, all he saw in the stranger’s face was emptiness.

Sirens screamed behind him as he reached the steps of his apartment. Police cruisers sped past, lights flashing.

He opened the door and stepped inside.

And there hanging from the ceiling  a man.

Familiar. Lifeless.

The man stared in silence.

His eyes drifted to the end table.

There lay a note, written in uneven ink:

“What is wrong with life?”

i'm going to turn 18 very soon, and i do not know exactly where to go, who to be with, and what person should i become.

i have been mindlessly living life, and i have a couple of main topics that i would like to discuss:

  
relationships: this is the toughest one, it's not like i \*can't\* be with people, it's just that i don't want to, yet..for some reason, i pretty much do

i would sit alone at school, listening to music, eating, just waiting patiently for the hours to pass by. i would stare at the plaza near the entrance of the school where students would gather in small groups, having the time of their lives. chatting, laughing, taking pics and making memories.

i would look back at where i'm sitting, a small corner where dust gathers. i lift my limbs and head to class early, where no one will notice how absolutely miserable and lonely i am.

it's not like i truly believe that i am miserable, like, most of the time i'm enjoying my life, i hit the gym nearly everyday, it's been truly the only place where i can feel genuinely safe, i got pretty jacked for my age, i mean some people really look at me with respect (kinda?) and i can feel like i'm progressing.

but at some point, i would sit and wonder, ""is this how i'm gonna spend the rest of my life? am i not...missing out too much?""

like, everyone that i look at looks like they're genuinely enjoying their youth, and i mean REALLY enjoying it, every day there is a new event, a new instagram story, a new crush, a new relationship, a new situationship (it's genuinely the worst word ever invented btw) and i just cannot help but feel so much fucking sadness and anger, not towards them, but towards myself.

what the actual fuck am i even doing with my life dude? like, most people that gave me a chance always tell me that i AM jacked as fuck, i AM pretty fucking smart and i get the highest grades consistently, i AM a good listener and a very good talker. according to them, i've got so many fucking good qualities that people would dream of having, yet i would sit alone ever single fucking day at school, staring at fucking nothing all day, hitting chest in the gym and going home just to cry about how fucking lonely i am, and just sometimes i wonder ""maybe you can just end it all so that u can leave oxygen for people around you""

and yes i tried to do it, more than once actually, and that obviously didn't work out well since i chickened out, so i'm here now, almost 18, ready for more years of suffering

yet you know, i find joy in life sometimes, and sometimes (this is gonna sound contradicting to what i just said before) i think that i'm genuinely better than every single fucker in my school. i'm living it right and all of y'all are wasting ur goddamn time doing nothing but making fake friendships and fake romances that won't last past the next christmas.

to be truthful, i do not know what the heck i should be doing man (wow, shockers), i've been talking to myself for hours lately, just checking in on myself, and honestly, i think i know my problem:

i do not know whether i should be with people or just stay alone forever, i mean, i have been alone for the past 6 years now (roughly) and hey, i've made quite a lot of achievements, i've got myself to be tolerant, resilient, went through a lot of mental issues (very rough dissociation that would last for months on end + depression and anxiety), i got closer to my family, closer to God, won around 13 medals in Karate (before i quit),stayed consistent even when i felt like i want to kill myself (like i would literally study for 4h, go hit the gym and then get back home and stand on the edge of roof and just try to end it all)

when i'm alone, i feel so strong yet so fragile, i can only achieve when i'm by myself, yet emotionally, i am the weakest and most pathetic human on this planet

i've been reading philosophy lately, a lot of it actually, i just love absurdism (albert camus is the goat haha), i just enjoy that bitter-sweet emotion of ""my life is pretty wrecked...ouuh i've got a cup of coffee tho.."" and i just find myself eager to read the next book

i also like music, jazz (laufey is my fav), RnB or even classical when i'm ACTUALLY going through it, it always keeps me in a concentrated mood and it helps me get through the day





when i'm with people, it feels like i'm doing something wrong, i get this itch that won't go away and i feel like i just want to fade from existence and never reappear again.

and ofc, people really treat me poorly, a lot of them (and without exaggerating, like 98% of the people that know of my existence) truly hate me, my classmates bully me every single day relentlessly and blatantly, and people that don't have the courage to do so would just talk ill behind my back, when im literally just a dude that doesn't talk to anyone (like bro i don't even know ur name, i've never talked to u nor to ur friends, i'm just minding my business, why are u like this lmao?) and most of them go on to just label me as ""narcissistic"" and ""egoistic"" since...come on ofc if someone is just trying his best to keep calm and to live in his own world without hurting people then he is just a bad person that needs to be executed.

there is this girl that i think is into me, she is extremely pretty and is such an awesome person, but idk man, i really think i'm gonna fuck this one up as well, but if i just fake it enough, i actually can make her happy, like, i'm not a bad person, i just chose to be one, i'm stuck with a personality of a loner and a loser when in reality, i truly believe i can become way better, and for some reason, i either become better but no one notices, or i fail and now everyone hears about it. but ofc, i don't have the heart to be a fake around her (i can't afford to be like those people at my school) that's why i face my emotions head-on, and that's exactly why i'm probably going to reject her.

i just wanna know, is this a good time for me to open up? do i need to be better? am i not even close yet? and even if i open up and be with people, would i really be a happy person?

i just want to be someone that i can be proud of, someone that i can look back on when i'm at my deathbed and be like ""yep, couldn't have lived it fucking better"", i don't care how hard it will be, i can always destroy myself just to rebuild a better version.

i think that will be it, sry for the very long post (i still got way too much in my chest, but i don't wanna extend this any further)

to anyone who have read this, thank you very much (you literally listened to me more than any of my ""friends"" did lmaoo), you don't have to reply with a huge paragraph, you can just say a word or two, maybe give me some motivation (even tho i don't really believe in ""motivation"" that much) or just share a piece of your own story.

im not rebelling i just hope there would be more integration here, more lived in places and more contact with strangers rather than just constantly using your driver and maid and car to go somewhere five minutes away due to the country not being super walkable (YES I KNOW SOME AREAS ARE EXCEPTIONS BUT IM SAYING IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT THAT IS USED BY A LARGER DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE THAN ONES WHO USE IT HERE in all respect)

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, experimental and insatiably curious?",0,1766697458.0,cf4cf,0,0.33,False

Thoughts?,"I (23M) matched with this person (21F) on Hinge and after a week of talking, we agreed to meet up. In the first date, we got coffee and I dropped her off to her place later that night. However, the date didn’t end then: we took a walk around her neighborhood and found somewhere to sit. We talked for a while and started to cuddle. Before I had to head back home, we kissed and it led to a brief make-out session.

Afterwards, we maintained communication and she agreed to a second date the following week. The second date was pretty good too. We checked out this local nature park and had boba tea. I dropped her off but we talked for a bit in my car and made out/touched.

We exchanged a few Gn texts and both said we had a fun time.

The next day was absolute radio silence. I didn’t think much of it at first but for an entire WEEK, there was absolute radio silence.

It was driving me a bit bonkers so after a week I shot her a text. In said text, I said I have no clue what I did/or say that lead to the silent treatment, but if she doesn’t want to continue things, I perfectly understand. I genuinely meant it as well.

She replied within minutes. In a nutshell, she said her silence was deliberate and she was using that time to think things through. She said also during that week, she had some family issues and it made her realize she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I exchanged goodbyes and moved on with life.

However, a month later, my friend showed me her still active on Hinge and also Bumble as it turns out, which runs contrary to what she said about not being ready for a relationship.

I’m not gonna bother confronting her about it I’m just confused rather than mad: why wasn’t she truthful?",1,1766697441.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1pvn2iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1pvn2iq/the_lehigh_valley/,The Lehigh Valley,"This is obviously an opinion, and I am totally open to critiques.  The intro has a TLDR, and the ratings for the categories are next to the bold text at each category.



**Intro**: TLDR-27 boroughs and 32 townships throughout this region sit around the three cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton. The categories I will be reviewing are Cost of Living, Housing Variety, Location, Amenities/Things to Do, Healthcare, Education, Safety, Work Opportunity, Travel and Traffic

* The Lehigh Valley is a region in Eastern PA made up of Lehigh and Northampton counties.  It is part of the larger Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ MSA, with 80% of the population residing within the two previously mentioned counties.  For the purpose of this review, I will be focusing on the Northampton and Lehigh counties.  The categories I will be reviewing are Cost of Living, Housing Variety, Location, Things to Do, Healthcare, Education, Safety, Transit, Walkability, and Traffic  
* Regional Demographics
   * Population: 715,567
   * Area: 715 sqmi
   * Density: 1,001/sqmi
   * Racial/Ethnic Demographics: White- 66.16%, Hispanic or Latino- 21.52%, Black or African America- 5.69%, Asian- 3.28%, Multiracial- 2.8%, Other Race- 0.54%, Native American- 0.04%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander- 0.03%
   * Median Age: 40.5 years
   * Gender: 50.7% Female, 49.3% Male
* The Region has 3 cities, 27 boroughs, and 32 townships, each with their own municipal governments, fire and police departments, and land boundaries, but can be split into several distinct micropolises.  Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton each have their own boroughs and townships that act as direct suburbs, however the boroughs of Nazareth, Wilson, Northampton, Emmaus, Bangor, Pen Argyl, Hellertown, and Coopersburg all have their own school districts, and form their own small-town hubs within the region.  
* The many micropolises of the region are very well connected via a network of state routes and highways, and despite it being a cluster of small towns and cities, is just as well connected via roadways (or in some cases better) as large cities similar in size to the region.  It feels like there are 10 different ways to get anywhere here.  It has a lot of old industrial charm, since it was a very big player during both industrial eras, with suburban and rural areas in equal abundance.

**Cost of Living: 6.9/10**

* Taxes and Wages:  Local, State, and Federal Income taxes are taken out, with school districts, municipalities, and counties also levying property taxes, and there is a 6% sales tax, with a median household income balancing out the tax burden a bit.
* AVG Home Prices: $375,000, 13.5% below the national average
* AVG Rental Prices: $1,778/mo, 2% above the national average 
* AVG Utility Prices: $350-$520/mo, about the national average
* Groceries and Gas: Grocery prices are about the national average, and is rated at about 3% less expensive overall, with gas being about 11% more expensive, averaging at about $3.30 per gallon of regular unleaded.
* Parking: Most of the cities have options for free parking if you are willing to walk, with meter parking and most parking garages costing about $10-$15 for a full day, but they are often unnecessary for visits.  If it is needed however, monthly parking passes in the cities can range anywhere from $80-$120.
* Healthcare Costs: costs are about $300 monthly per household, which is about the national average.

**Housing Variety: 9.4/10**

* A very well-balanced mix of Urban, Suburban, and Rural Areas all within the region, each with their own variety in characteristics.
* Urban life offers apartments, rowhomes, townhouses, and small-lot single family homes of varying styles, over 50% of which were built before 1940, with apartments making up the majority of new development.  
* Suburban life is present throughout the region is the most dominant, but offers a mix of Dutch colonials, ranch houses, McMansions, and traditional cookie-cutter homes.
* Rural areas are mostly on the outskirts but there are certainly lots and homes for sale on a decently regular basis in the more sparsely populated areas.  Lots of trees and hills and a great deal of seclusion without being too far from urban amenities.

**Location: 9.8/10**

* Withing 1-2 hours of 4 major international airports (JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and Philly)
* It has very close proximity to several state parks, the Appalachian trail, skiing in the Poconos, 
* It is 90 minutes from Philly, the Jersey Shore, and NYC, making those an easy day trip for those willing to make the drive into or close to either city.  Beach day trips are very easy as well.
* It is 3-4 hours from Washington DC, Baltimore, Ocean City MD, and the Adirondacks which make for great weekend trips or even day trips if you're up for that much driving.
* It is 6-8 hours from New England, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Montreal, Virginia Beach, and the Outer Banks.

**Amenities/Things to Do: 7.7/10**

* Shopping: There are the Lehigh Valley Mall and Promenade Shops.  The cities each have some local shops and local farmers/public markets
* Restaurants: There is a decent variety of local restaurants throughout the region, with italian, dominican/puerto-rican, and brew pubs making up the majority.  Diners have a strong scene too, along with coffee shops.
* Entertainment:  Dorney Park and the Lehigh Valley Zoo are decent and Steel Stacks has some tribute band shows, but the real entertainment comes with all of the festivals in the summer and fall, the main one being Musikfest.
* Outdoors:  The region offers a great deal of outdoor activities including a few inlets to the Appalachian trail, a great state park and nature preserve, and over 100 miles of interconnected bike trail.

**Healthcare: 8.6/10**

* Residents receive healthcare that ranks well above the national average.
* The region has two main Healthcare Organizations in St. Lukes University Hospital and Lehigh Valley Health Network, the latter of which recently merged with Jefferson Health. 
* Residents can receive medical care of all varieties without having to leave the region at all from basic checkups to cancer treatment.  
* Both organizations have a plethora of clinics and 5 hospitals throughout the region, making healthcare very accessible.

  
**Education: 8.3/10**

* Very strong with lots of options among 18 districts
* The Private and Charter schools in the region are decent, but the public schools are typically better.
* Extracurriculars are very strong here, especially in sports, music, and theatre.
* Higher Education is very strong, with 2 community colleges, 6 four-year institutions, 2 of which are very prestigious (Lehigh University and Lafayette College), and even a Penn State Satellite campus.

  
**Safety: 8.8/10**

* Violent Crime: 21.5 per 100,000 residents.
* Property Crime: 69.2 per 100,000 residents.
* Very safe Overall, with most issues being drug related or personal.  Best to lock doors and car at night or whenever away.
* Homelessness is an issue, but rarely leads to too many incidents.
* Human trafficking is a minor problem in the region, with law enforcement recently taking down a few groups.

**Work Opportunity: 8.5/10**

* Manufacturing is still a big player here, with opportunities at companies like Air Products, Mack Truck, Olympus, and Coca-Cola.
* Logistics and Distribution have many opportunities as well, with warehouses and data centers continuing to pop up throughout the region.
* Healthcare has, and continues to, grow into a major job market in the region, with both St. Lukes and LVHN constantly hiring all varieties of medical staff.
* Education is another one, with the public-school districts always hiring, on top of a variety of options for work in higher education with all of the previously mentioned colleges.
* Super-commuting is a common thing here, with people who work for big tech companies in NYC and Philly commuting in person to their work city a couple of times a week and working from home the other days.  
* Overall, a lot of options, but not quite as diverse as larger metropolitan areas.

  
**Travel and Traffic: 6.4/10**

* Despite its small-town nature, the Lehigh Valley experience substantial and more than noticeable traffic on a daily basis.  
* The two main highways of US22 and I78 are often congested with trucks and can get clogged up during peak hours.
* Daily commutes can be 15-20 minutes longer during peak hours but can get longer with heavy road work or an accident.
* Traffic is much more manageable if you can avoid the highways, like for more local commutes.
* Not as bad as big cities like NYC or LA, but worse than places like Detroit or Omaha.
* Transit is pretty much non-existent, with LaNTA busses being largely ineffective. 
* Cities and many of the boroughs are quite walkable, and amenities can be accessed on foot for city residents.
* A car is necessary for living in the region in order to everything one might need since grocery stores and large shopping centers are mostly in the townships and cannot easily be accessed on foot.
* There are plans for a train line to come back to the region by the 2030s that would connect to Philly and NYC with stops in each of the three cities.



**Overall Score**: **8.3/10**

* This is a really great area to live.  It's location right in the middle of the Northeast Megalopolis is awesome for short trips, and its Cost of Living, while not the best, is actually much better than most other areas in the region.  
* If you read all of this kudos to you, and I hope that people consider this amazing place if looking for somewhere new.",3,1766697388.0,SameGrassButGreener,3,1.0,False

1pvmwim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1pvmwim/ive_aged_horribly_what_can_i_do_to_look_younger/,I've aged horribly. what can I do to look younger?,"I just turned 25 and I look like a hag. I need help. I've looked this way for about over a year and i've tried a couple things to fix my face but it doesnt go away.

I started to have lines on my neck at 21 but they became noticeable at 23, I started getting static forehead wrinkles at 22 1/2 but they were tiny and could be hidden with makeup until I was 23 1/2 in which case I started having to wear baseball caps to hide them. they've gotten worse since then, now they go all accross my forehead and in straight lines. if i look closer there's a lot of very tiny lines that are like patterns. the mini lines are as bad as my 60yo non retouched mom's forehead. if I scrunch my forehead it looks horrible and my skin takes time to bounce back and return my forehead from the scrunched up state. I started at 22 to have the skin under my eyes thin. now it's very thin, with lots of little lines that are very obvious with makeup. I can't put anything right under my eyes or it just hightlights it. they're very dark purple big bags with spider veins, that never go away. it's sallow and saggy. Generally my skin seems to have sagged a lot, I can feel it since I was 23. The worst for me is the nasio labial folds. that's what makes me the most insecure after the forehead wrinkles. They appeared over night one month after turning 24. and they've just gotten worse. at 23 1/2 i had nothing at all, it was all smooth there. but at 24 deep static lines and saggy skin there. when I smile it's horrible. with makeup i need to be very careful or it cakes in the lines and highlights them. I feel like my lip corners are sagging a bit too. I also have spider veins in my nose and around it that appeared and are getting worse. my skin is very sallow and dull. my pores have gotten much bigger since i was 23. I had no pores then. since 24 they've gotten huge and it's horrible. my skin is so textured now too. at 23 1/2 there was no skin texture, now it's awful. all these changes are getting worse and worse.

I have to wear camouflages to see other people to hide it, like the baseball caps and sunglasses. I have to wear foundation every time i see people to hide the discolaration and pores, but it looks horrible because of the fine lines, texture and bc i'm now quite oily since my pores dramatically enlarged themselves last year.

I probably look this way because I have chronic anxiety especially since 22, and since that age i haven't been able to decontract my forehead (i'm sure that's why i have the lines). Like i physically can't. the only time i've been rested and calm was the one time i got high in recent years. i'm always tense with a contracted forehead. I have had terrible sleeping patterns since i was maybe 17. I used to sleep during the day and live at night. until like 23 when i tried to be better but even now i go to bed half of the time at like 4 am and i don't think my sleep is good. i'm dehydrated probably. i'm not diligent with my skincare or my appearance (unless i'm going in public) most of the time since i study from home and don't really go out or talk to people anymore (i don't even go to the shops, i get everything delivered) so most of the time i don't moisturize or anything because i'm lazy, i drink a lot of energy drinks and coffee (some days i have multiple energy drinks), i get drunk regularely, i don't have much physical activity (i usually spend my days in bed), i've had led lights usually on for the last 3 years (maybe that's part of it), i'm not a very happy person and i'm usually depressed, i either starve myself or binge (my bmi is healthy though), i used shein cutlery for 4 years... could have bad substances, i'm probably pretty vitamin d deficient etc

for if you give me advice, I currently do own a lot of skincare (even though i really don't use it diligently because i don't have energy to really do anything) including anti aging, like i have retinol serum, retinol eyecream, retinol eye masks, collagen powder, hyaluronic acid supplements, vitamin c serum, vitamin c undereye cream, retinol enriched night cream, spf 50.  I also just ordered vitamin c day cream, collagen supplements, vitamin a supplements, collagen gummies, and anti aging face masks. i'm too broke to get botox atm, once i have enough money i'm definitely getting filler and botox. i did have a doctor's appointement like two months ago (not for this stuff though), i did ask about my folds and he disappointingly told me it's normal and they're small. he barely glanced at them though. i was so suprised he thought a 24yo could theoretically look like that. he couldnt see the full extent of my face because i wore heavy makeup and a baseball cap to hide a bit the problem areas, but he suggested my spider nose stuff was maybe dermatitis because i have that as well. but i think he's wrong, i think it's aging. I don't have any known physical health conditions though that could be affecting my appearance but it's possible since i have a terrible lifestyle for years. i'm not that healthy, i have the joints of an old person, i'm faint, have no energy, very weak with no muscle, get tired and want to nap from a 10min walk, etc

the stuff i've tried to fix it, is by putting overnight a couple times vaseline in my smile lines. it didnt do all that much. i tried moisturizing my face deeply a couple times and it didnt make the lines go away. i was at times less lazy with my skincare, and used retinol and vitamin c for two weeks, and took supplements, it didnt fix my face.

anyways is what is happening to me truly aging or is it something else? wether it's true aging or not, what can I do to fix myself (if it's even possible)?",0,1766696892.0,Aging,9,0.36,False

Should I get temporary cement? Or fixodent? 
If I can’t be seen tomorrow would Monday be too late? I am worried about teeth shifting. 

This crown has been one of my biggest stressors the entire time I’ve had it, I am diligent about flossing and cleaning the area and check with my dentist and hygienist at every cleaning to make sure X-rays and gums in the area look clean. I am appalled at what the teeth beside it look like.. I am just SICK over this. I always felt like it didn’t sit quite right and went over this with the dentist who originally placed it and now flipping it over and seeing the underside I am worried about decay. 
I don’t smoke, drink or drink anything other than a morning cup of coffee and water. I floss every single day and I pride myself on my oral hygiene and this has absolutely shook me.

1pvmrfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Employment/comments/1pvmrfu/i_think_i_just_had_the_worst_and_most/,I think I just had the worst and most unprofessional interview of my entire career.,"About 3 months ago, I applied for a job and interviewed with the hiring manager and someone from HR. The interview itself went very well, and they told me they were very impressed with me, but then they did something strange. They kept insisting that I was a better fit for a senior position on the team. I told them I was happy with the role I had originally applied for, but they stuck to their opinion.

A day or so later, the hiring manager called me and said her director wanted to meet me for this senior position. They wanted me to come to their office for the final interview as soon as possible. I had other commitments, so I couldn't make it at the time they initially suggested, but they pressured me to come at the earliest possible date. In the end, I had to cancel things and rearrange my schedule to make it. The journey to their office alone took 5 hours.

The in-person interview went very well, or so I thought. They really liked the presentation I gave. We discussed salary (and they confirmed it was within their budget), the team, relocation, and everything. The director herself told me to my face that she was impressed with me, which is something you almost never hear. She told me she was going on vacation the next week but that I would hear from them the week after.

Anyway, almost 4 weeks went by with complete silence. Then, I received an automated rejection email with nothing personal in it. No call, no feedback, nothing. So in the end, I got neither the original job nor the senior role they pushed me into. Honestly, I can't wrap my head around what happened.

And the cherry on top? They initially promised to reimburse my travel expenses (train ticket and hotel stay), and then sent an email saying they couldn't cover them. This is a Fortune 500 company, yet the coffee shop down my street has more professionalism and class than they do. I'm definitely not going to bother asking for feedback; it would surely just be some generic HR excuse.",2,1766696480.0,Employment,1,1.0,False

How much coffee is OK? I usually was drinking like 400-600 mg a day, which is probably a bit much. Is 2 cups of coffee alright? I want to prevent getting AFIB again until I'm on a blood thinner, but I'm very tired.

Side note, I had no idea AFIB was so bad. My hr was 180-240 and didn't go down until I had cardizem (bolus and drip), 2 doses of metoprolol, and ativan. It was so stressful.

I am a bit new to using espresso makers—ive only used a moka pot. I know I need a new portafilter that is better and doesnt have plastic and a grinder. I’m new college graduate so I dont have a lot of money to spend, but I also dont want to get cheap stuff that is going to break , I would like good quality without killing my bank account. Also, if I can limit the amount of plastic and other contaminations in my coffee.

For the portafilers, I saw a couple of options for these, but im not sure if these are the best options and the most versatile, or if they will even fit my machine:

But if you have a better recommendations, I would love to hear about them.



For the grinder, I would like it to be versatile as I also have a regular percolator and often make cold brew, so I would like to use it for them as well. I have a basic manual grinder that I bought for like $20 from target but now I realize that it is not good enough.  

* Cuisinart Supreme Grinder
* Mr. Coffee Grinder
* hamilton beach burr coffee grinder
* OXO brew grinder

Again, if there are better options, I would love to hear about them.

My roommate and I met online a few months before I started college. We seemed to get along well and I loved playing games with them and talking about school! 

Then I moved in with them. They have some habits like not using a hamper for dirty clothes or brushing their teeth daily, but I could honestly ignore those. It’s the emotional stuff that’s been eating away at me. 

Incident 1: 
We’re walking to class and talking about schedules when I mention that I don’t really know their schedule well besides when our classes intersect. I never really did memorize those things for people in my life, just asked about what they’re learning sometimes - not where the classes meet and when. I told them I have trouble memorizing stuff I’m not interested in, and clarified immediately that I didn’t mean them and their interests- just the whole categorization and memorization of their daily routine and each class meeting is something I didn’t really find necessary to learn to a T. They go real quiet and start speed walking ahead of me, and when we get to lecture I’m still not sure what was wrong (since I clarified and assured them) and try to say hi and inquire about something theyre saying to a friend next to us, when we’re in our seats. They then angrily turn to me and sat in a clipped, angry voice: “I thought you didn’t care about me,” and when the friend asks what’s up they say “SOMEONE here said they didn’t care about my schedule!” It was so strongly worded and I’m just a sensitive person? I guess? I felt really shitty, cried throughout the entire lecture and had to go do some emergency counseling at the psych center of the university- missing a class in the process. They also complained that when they want to talk about their (ship in a fandom) and their music I ‘shut them down!’ But I’ve really, really tried to respond to everything they say and ask questions and be THERE for them. I tried to show curiosity for their music, to listen and not interrupt, to compliment it! And part of it i think was them not understanding social cues (on the spectrum, which is totally fine and I’ve got plenty of friends with similar situations) so when I’m tired in the evening or trying to subtly be like ‘I need some quiet time, you’ve got a lot of energy and socializing in you that I cannot match rn’ it didn’t really get across as such and they thought it was me ditching them, maybe? My responses weren’t maybe as elaborate as when my social battery is filled. 

(Some context, I have OCD with a lot of intrusive thoughts related to secretly hating my friends, being a bad friend, not caring enough. This really spiraled it.) When I got back I made them a little card and got their fav drink (remember that for later.) I basically begged for forgiveness and eventually we were on speaking terms again and I got them to sort of understand that not memorizing their schedule to the exact meeting times outside of making specific plans didn’t mean I didn’t care about them. 

Thought that was it, but not really. 

Incident 2:
I have some issues understanding something in class and I asked them for help, and they don’t explain it to me they just keep reiterating how they ‘can’t believe you don’t understand this!’ Over and over. It’s SO STUPID and sensitive of me, and maybe I was hormonal? Or something? But I just cried myself to sleep because those words on top of the incident recently just hurt I guess. I was just so on edge. When I woke up the next day I apologized for crying and they said they just ‘tuned it out’ and were like ‘well if it was hormones that makes sense.’ 

Something about that hurt my feelings but  honestly I probably was hormonal. It just adds to my negative emotions around them though I really didn’t show it and just kept it down. 

Incident 3:
We’re walking back to the dorm and I tell them honestly that I study a lot during the week but not on the weekends. They told me that’s a bad idea and the wrong thing to do and I’m going to do worse in my classes. I get a little defensive honestly, not proud of it, and was like ‘it’s what works best for me, it’s different for everyone and you might have better results on weekends! I got really good scores on my AP exams with the same method.’ But they double down again and I notice them doing what they did before: going silent, walking fast ahead of me with a glare. My heart goes up in my throat again. When we get back to continue a movie we were watching they say ‘actually I have schoolwork to do,’ put on their headphones and continue watching the movie without me. I feel terrible saying this but I felt… frustrated. Like a little angry? I shouldn’t have been, and I don’t think I showed it thankfully besides hovering a bit and asking to talk about it. After like an hour they start texting me about how ‘we get it, (my name) YOU TOOK A FUCKING AP CLASS, noone cares! It’s not fair that you just get to fucking coast while I’m working so hard. I feel like I’m just a fucking accessory to you sometimes. You won’t read my fanfics, and you don’t talk to me much when we’re out.’ And I guess theyre right, I told them I just felt embarrassed and stupid sometimes and felt like I needed to prove my intellect and my place in college by mentioning my past college credit classes during the similar lectures. They did the same thing and talked about how they didn’t have to take a writing class because they did a bunch of dual enrollment classes- theyre even considered a transfer not a first year based on that. I thought it was fine. I didn’t say that last part about their own credits and stuff though. I then told them I was sorry and for the social stuff that I am like that with EVERYONE when we’re out having a meal. I enjoy time with others even if we’re not talking, I just like to be around them in the same room. It’s how I bond, and the invitation itself is my reaching out to bond. They also said in their text about the last incident that I had tried to ‘buy their affection’ and how it ‘doesn’t FUCKING WORK- I’m still upset.’ Which I told them wasnt it and that I just wanted to give them something nice because I wanted them to feel better and to know I cared. 

We end up talking it out and that’s that, my apology is done and they forgave me. 

Incident 4:
I’m hanging out in my room and my roommate is out of the room showering, I go and leave to get dinner and when I get back I see my roommate crouched in front of the door with a glare. I immediately let them in and they start yelling at me about how I couldn’t adhere to one fucking task. They had asked me to leave the door open for them before but I hadn’t registered it and this was the first time I was hearing it and registering it for real when it’s too late already. As they go in after I unlock the door they block me from the other side with brute force and I have to really push my way inside. They yell some more and leave the dorm building. In an online chat I explain as genuinely as I can type out that I seriously forgot and didn’t do that on purpose and it’s not something I would EVER do because I had locked MYSELF out earlier that month and it SUCKED! They said ‘bullSHIT’ and ‘how could you care so little for me that you couldn’t leave the fucking door open, (my name).’ I end up telling them that I love them and care for them but their tendency to think the worst of me HURTS and I feel like I can’t be the kind of person they want me to be. They genuinely apologize for the first incident and say they’ll try to see me better and that they have trauma from others theyre working on and that therapy didn’t work for them. 

I thought that was it. We had solved our issues! But it happened again.

Incident 5: 
Roommate is walking with me to classes and a truck is coming up on the crosswalk. They tell me to move faster and put their hand on my back lightly to kind of push me (very gently! They didn’t apply a lot of force) and I had said that the truck could wait a little bit. I must’ve been cranky or something cause it was a morning lecture and I was sluggish. But we cross and they start going quiet again and they say ‘you didn’t protest when (other friend) said the same thing!’ Apparently (even I didn’t remember this honestly, I have a really shitty memory I think? Always forgetting stuff..) when we had been out with friends and that other friend had seen a car coming and said we should speed up I had listened to them. But it was different, right? We were in public in a busy road back then versus the tiny little crosswalk next to a dining area that we crossed in present time. It was also later and I wasn’t sluggish or tired or being egged on by a hand push which felt a little demeaning I guess? But they said I was clearly favoring that friend over them and stormed in the other direction. I wasn’t sure they were mad until I tried to follow and they said they were ‘going that way for a REASON.’ We get to lecture and they are sitting there and I remind them that they had PROMISED to try and think of me better than they had been. To trust that I didn’t see them differently or treat them differently than others based on tiny details in completely different scenarios. I didn’t say all that though it was just ‘you promised you’d try to see me better..’ and they broke and said that ‘the EVIDENCE is there and that theyre using FACTS about my behavior to make this conclusion and it’s SO CLEAR that I don’t treat them the same as others..’ I try really hard to explain I do CARE about them and it really wasn’t fair to say that and they respond that ‘when the FUCK did they ever say I didn’t care about them, that they want ME to see THEM better and to believe that people (and them) can CHANGE, and to stop letting my anxiety control my relationships. We end up talking it out again and recovering but it just happens again and again and I feel myself tensing up around them, feeling nervous, tightening up and being unable to relax. 

Incident 6: 
My roommate is allergic to mint but it’s, as they told me specifically, not dangerous and just as long as it’s not like an aerosol spray or directly pressed to their skin and ingested it’s fine. In the past they had offered to buy me a drink and I had asked if it was okay if I had the peppermint mocha, it’s my fav drink and, they agreed and I asked several times at the register to make sure when they paid for it. They said it’s fine and just to keep the lid on when I’m sipping. Maybe I’m remembering wrong though? Either way from that situation and another where I had a peppermint candy with no fuss from them I figured peppermint was fine as long as I didn’t pour it on them and share it with them if it’s a consumable. 

Fast forward a few months and I get a peppermint coffee at the cafe, it was a seasonal syrup i hadn’t seen before and wanted to try it really bad. I told them immediately ‘hey, this has peppermint so just don’t take a sip or anything’ and we sit down and i notice theyre shifting a bit and seeming upset. So I immediately realize ‘oh! Maybe the smell is strong and it’s bothering them, I’ll ask about it.’ So I ask if the peppermint is an issue and they say ‘no, just kind of disrespectful is all..’ and so I’m of course like ‘sorry! I thought it was okay based on the peppermint mocha sitch, but if that’s not the case let me go throw this out and get a new coffee without peppermint. I’m sorry!’ To which they respond that the ‘damage was already done’ and I just feel that stress rise, my throat constricting, heart beating, general stress overwhelming me. They also told me that at the coffee shop I actually hadn’t asked beforehand about the mocha and they thought that I had just forgotten their allergy back then and only dealt with it temporarily at the time. I really really didn’t remember it that way but I told them honestly that either way I had gotten the wrong idea about their comfort levels and wouldn’t eat mint around them AT ALL anymore. I even got them some candy for Christmas making extra sure it was mint free and that nothing else in the basket was minty either. I apologized a ton. 

By itself this wouldn’t have been much but over time everything adds up, I’ve cried so often and felt like such a terrible friend and a terrible person. I even had a nightmare about them recently. I just feel like a failure and like they cannot see my care for them and how much I want to be there as their support and their roommate and their close friend. I want to be better, and I feel like I’ve never ever felt like such a terrible person until I met them. 

I’m trying to be better, seriously. I’m learning all the time. I’m just confused and hurt and I find myself here on break just dreading going back there despite my best efforts to feel good about them. I feel like I can’t be a good enough friend fast enough, that I can’t fix myself in time and that I’m going to hurt their feelings again and they’ll be mad at me again.

1pvmeuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1pvmeuh/how_can_i_prevent_myself_from_becoming_dateless/,How can I prevent myself from becoming dateless and remain a virgin in 2026?,"Time is repeating itself and I need help to make it out of this whole. Currently, I am 28 and still a virgin with no gf. I have barely dated in my life and from the looks of it 2026 seem bleak. I have no female friends whatsoever and I know no single women. My only option is finding a hobby like church or approaching random women in my day like at the gym or coffee shops. 

This year started with so much promise. I was very confident in myself that I walked up and approached women. I even gained a gf after I set up my dating profile. Sadly it ended in September and it broke me.  

Now I get zero matches on online dating. So i guess i need to change my photos. 

I am currently in medical school and unfortunately  I have not be successful with meeting people in med school. My school goes by a social hierarchy meaning that once you are considered unpopular, people stop hanging with you. I will spare the details but my first two years I was ranked unpopular. Alot of people did not want to spend time with me and I was never invited to parties. 

I did everything in my power to fix. I would try to talk to people daily, flirt with women in my class, and go to every social event possible. It didnt matter. I used to get mocked and laughed at in my small class of 35. For those who dont know once you hit the 3rd year, you go inside the hospitals where you dont see your classmates anymore. 

That was in January and it pain my heart that after last January, no one reached out to me again. In the hospitals, I dont see alot of people that I could date. Either they are too old or they have rings on their fingers. 

In fact, I know alot of my classmates who are getting married right now based on instagram. I am painting the scene as vividly as I can so you guys know what I am up against. 

2026 is going to be a hard year as well because I will be studying for a huge exam that will determine my specalitiy so I dont have alot of time to play around. 

So what you guys do If you were me? 

Also as a sidenote, I dont want to not date because its only going to make it harder to socialize in the future. For example, I know how to walk up and flirt. I did it with my ex. She thought I had game, the problem was as I got busier, I couldnt text with flirtatious as much as I wanted. So she started to lose interest because of that. 

As a result, i would prefer a way that doesnt involve alot of flirtation since I will be busy as a doc anyway to be a player lol. ",3,1766695455.0,AskMenAdvice,42,0.59,False

1pvmdyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1pvmdyh/advice_for_class_of_2030/,Advice for class of 2030,"Hello all new students, glad to have you coming to Emory! I'm writing this whole post to hopefully help some of yall joining us. I'm going to try to make this post more about Emory specific things, rather than generic tips, so obviously go over those tips(and please shower. My god some of yall are ANIMALS)

**Apps**

Emory loves apps. They love apps so much that by your first semester end, you'll have a folder in your phone just for apps. Here are the essentials:

PassioGo: This is how we track our shuttle routes. It won't be as important first year because most of the time, you won't be leaving campus for too much, but learning the essential routes(loop, C, D, B, Exec Park) early serves you really well.

CampusGroups: This is where school meetings and events are held, along with clubs. Get used to using it early, because you'll hear about a lot of different things on there. Also, if you are looking for clubs, the way to do so(on your computer) is go to the hub(campus groups)->groups->all groups. This will allow you to see what groups there are. Be sure to look at the right campus, as Oxford and Atlanta have different Hubs. I'll talk a bit about clubs later

GroupMe: Most of your clubs and residence halls will communicate through GroupMe. Make sure to get this one done too.

EmorySafe: Basically a campus security app. Has certain things like FriendWalk and SafeRide which you may want to use late at night. SafeRide is basically a bus service you can call that will come pick you up at any time, which becomes very useful later at night or during weekends when bus services are sparse. FriendWalk allows you to track your friend as they get back to their dorms.

Emory Welcome: Tbh, I haven't used this app since the first week of school. Download it, use i then, then delete it.

Handshake: Not Emory specific, but massively helpful in finding internships, because companies actually hire on there vs linkedin where they just ignore you. Also, set this up early, because sometimes you'll get emails and messages from recruiters for events at Emory or in Atlanta that will be great.

**Clubs**

Clubs can be a shitshow, full stop. There's something like 1000 student organizations here, so trying to figure out what to join is hard, and the process starts like 2 weeks into school and ends like 1-2 weeks later. So, here's my tips:

* Don't get hung up on not getting into a selective club your first semester. It will happen that you will very likely be rejected from Algory or EEIF your first semester. These clubs get a lot more applications than they can handle.
* Go on the hub, note down 10 clubs you really want to join, and follow them on instagram. Almost every club that is serious will have informational services on the first week of club rush.
* Take advantage of auto join clubs. Like 80% of clubs here will let you in if you just put your name on a piece of paper. The problem is that everyone guns for the 20% with an application process. At least sign up for 1-2 of these auto joins. A few that are good here are slow meals, salsa club, and some other niche interest clubs.
* All, and I repeat ALL, Goizueta clubs have general body membership open to all students. What does this mean? Well, these clubs have core members(usually called analysts or something) and they have members. Ever since Goizueta forced clubs to be open to all students, every club has held general body meetings. These happen once every few weeks, and go over a ton of stuff. If you want to join a club, become a general body member! Go to the meetings, and next time club applications open they'll recognize your name(because clubs here are so goddamn nepo)

**Social life**

This is one I'm sure a lot of people want to know about. So, here's the rundown:

On instagram, you should follow Emory Student Programming Council NOW! They host a ton of the student events, from the SPC concert(yes, we get a whole concert, last year we had NLE Choppa and boogie wit da hoodie), first day fest, and a bunch of other fun events. Also, follow dooley after dark. It's run by SILT and they bring students to events around Atlanta. This year alone, I've gone to Falcons(FIRE MORRIS) and Braves games for FREE thanks to dooley after dark, and most people don't even know this exists. You can also follow a few frats that throw events, such as ATO and KAO. Those are the main 2 I know, but that's just because Emory frats only recently started throwing events again after...incidents.

As for general stuff around campus, Emory students go to Mags a ton(please do not get drunk and have to call a dean to pick you up. It has unfortunately happened more than once), which is really close. Buckhead is another big place people go to. Bars like Lost Dogs are pretty fun and social, but know the further you go from Emory, the more you end up in Atlanta(duh). So if you're at Mags, most people will be Emory students on a Friday night. At lost dogs, it'll mostly be young people living in midtown.

And for the big parties and fun stuff, we have GTech. Basically everyone goes to GT for big parties, because these goddamn nerds at Emory cannot throw down. You mfs need to learn how to mosh pit. Anyways, Halloween here is fun. Try to get an in with a GT frat person, or people there.

As for friendship, it's a mixed bag. You'll meet some of the best people here at Emory, but people here are so flakey because they're always busy. No one can commit to plans simply because they're focused on academics. I would say find a solid group of people, but beware that academics will often take over people's lives as we get into the semester. Oh, and please don't do that thing where you meet someone and talk to them, and then when you see them around you just put your head down and ignore them.

**Life tips**

This is more going to be about the day to day of where you can find the essential things you need, or some good places to study

Mail room: Located in the base of Few Hall. Few Hall is a big Sophomore housing facility located right in between McDonogh field, the freshman quad, and the ESC. Keep in mind this is the mailroom you will be using for the first 2 years. It gets really packed in here, so get there when it opens if you can. Hours are 9-6 weekdays

Coffee: There are a few options, but I mostly stick to Kaldi's and Starbucks(or DCT Coffee which isn't terrible). Kaldi's has 2 locations: one in the ESC, and one at the Depot. The ESC one is located directly above DCT, and is across the 3rd floor bridge of the main entrance to the ESC. The depot is another good option. It's an old converted train station down near the freshman quad, near the bridge going over to the health centers area with Rollins and the NBB building. It's really cute, but it gets PACKED, so if you're going here to lock in, get there before 9:30 on weekends or you won't get indoor seating. When it's summer, you won't need to, because it will be warm enough outside that you can actually sit outside, but it WILL get cold. Starbucks is located at the base floor of the bookstore, which has a base floor entrance down near the village, and a 3rd floor entrance near the MSC and Boisfeuillet Jones Center(which is where the career center will be located, so 100% keep that in mind when you want career services). There's also Hawaiian Coffee and Banjos in Cox and Woodruff, but IMO they just ain't the same. There's also a small cafe in Atwood that makes fire mexican coffee, would highly recommend.

Food: Main dining hall is DCT. In fact, it's the only ""dining hall"". It's fine, I guess. Can't say it's terrible, but for how much we pay it could be SO much better. Cox is more of a market, with food service places. It's like a mall dining court. You can meal exchange for certain items over there. The ESC has the eagle emporium, which is one of those self serve Amazon go style stores with a little bodega place where you can get sandwiches or smoothies on meal exchange. There's a few other smaller places, like in between classes you can get a grab and go thing at White hall or the farmers markets on Tuesdays(if you like paying 8 dollars for a small cup of lemonade), but these are the main ones you'll deal with as a freshman. Oh, also, you can only use 3 meal exchanges per day, but unlimited swipes into DCT(on the unlimited plan). Food in Village is pretty good, Wagaya is pretty solid and there's a few places along there with the most intimate lighting I've ever seen, so taking a date there isn't terrible(but you mfs are too scared to talk to the other gender). Oh, also, there are some ways to get groceries. On weekends, the Toco Hills line runs, but it is from the Clairmont campus, so you'll take route C to the Clairmont campus and then Toco Hills. There is a Krogers within walking distance of the route B bus, and executive park goes up to a whole center where you can get some stuff. I think you can also walk to a target from exec park, if my roommate is to be believed. The EDH line runs to a shopping center with an LA fitness and a bowling alley, along with a Walmart and Whole Foods(if you're rich). There's a few other places, but they're pretty far out there so I can't recommend. I would also say the EDH, CCTMA, and South Dekalb lines all run to a little area with good bubble tea and some fast food places, along with a Publix.

Gym: Woodpec is the main gym here. It's the weirdest layout gym I've ever seen. How you get there is go to the main Woodpec entrance, walk down until you see the place where the desk worker is standing, and across there should be a place you can scan your Emory card. Scan, wait for the little doors to open, and go to the 3rd floor. That's where the main gym is located.

**Course Registration**

Okay, so, bad news: That perfect schedule you made? There's no chance in hell you're getting it. Why? Because freshman register last. The way registration works in the fall is Sen->Jun->Soph->transfer->Fresh, and in spring it's based on credits. Your first year, you register last. And that's fine. Get those GEs out of the way. Trust, you'll have more than enough opportunity to finish out that degree. So, here's the essentials:

Our GE reqs are as follows: 1 humanities, 1 social science, 1 natural science, 1 quantitative science. 2 sems of sequential lang, 2(?) courses in writing, and some other race and eth requirements that, realistically, you shouldn't worry ab rn. Focus on these first. My suggestion: Knock out the one you dread the most. For most of you, that will be the quantitative sci one. For this, I would say QTM 100 or 110 are amazing options, but 110 with McCalister is S+ tier.

**Picking the major**

Not going to give generic advice, instead I'll just tell you what majors to follow what careers:

premed(because everyones a premed): Bio, NBB, Human health, QSS(or data sci now)+Bio/NBB

Prelaw: PPL, Philosophy, polisci, econ(a lot of econ prelaws here)

Business: Just go to Goizueta and do finance. Don't bother with Econ. Datasci is a good alt, or econ+math if you want a more quantitative job

SWE: Datasci, CS, CS+math

If there's any other specific careers someone wants, or feedback on a specific major, I'd feel happy to comment. I would also really highly suggest the data science department here. It's amazing. If you want a career in anything statistically driven, at least minor here.

I think I covered most everything I wanted to say. If there's anything other students want to add, I will stay here to edit this comment over time. I would also be happy to try and answer any questions anyone has, whether it's applicants or students who just got in.",10,1766695381.0,Emory,1,0.92,False

# What is Emergent AI?

Emergent is a ""vibe coding"" platform. Unlike traditional **AI Code Generators** that simply autocomplete lines of code, Emergent uses a multi-agent system. You can describe a complex full-stack application in natural language, and the AI agents will plan, code, debug, and deploy it for you.

* **Natural Language to App:** You do not need to be a senior engineer to **build** complex apps.
* **Full-Stack Generation:** It handles everything from React frontends to Supabase backends.
* **Integrations:** Connects seamlessly with tools you already use.

The platform relies on a credit system. Every time you ask the AI to generate or fix code, it consumes credits. This is why having an **Emergent AI discount** is so valuable—it allows you to buy more credits for less money, extending your runway to build better products.

Ceramic hobs constantly cycle on and off to reach the desired temperature, and these rapid changes affect the aluminum, causing significant heat loss.

 I’m confused and need outside perspective
Hi, I could really use some neutral opinions because I feel like I’m losing clarity.
I (23F) met this girl through volunteering. We’ve seen each other around 6 times, always in group/volunteer settings, not really one-on-one for long conversations.
I’ve developed a crush on her, but I genuinely can’t tell if there’s anything on her side or if I’m projecting.
Here are the facts, trying to stay objective:
Things that feel confusing / possibly flirty:
She hugs me very tightly and for a long time (only me, not others)
She’s touched my shoulders when saying goodbye
Strong eye contact, warm smiles, sometimes what looks like a wink (but I’m not 100% sure)
She once said she “adores” me
While talking about her apartment, she mentioned that when she comes back from a trip she’d invite me over for a coffee (her idea, not mine)
Things that point the other way:
She’s inconsistent over text: sometimes warm, sometimes slow or no reply
She didn’t reply to a simple “Merry Christmas” message
She doesn’t really initiate conversations
She doesn’t engage much with my social media
We’ve never clearly talked about queerness, and I don’t know if she’s queer at all
So my questions are:
Does this sound like normal friendly behavior to you?
Am I likely projecting because I like her?
Is it reasonable that it’s just too early / unclear, or does this read as disinterest?
Would you advise asking her out directly to get clarity, or backing off?
I’m honestly fine with either outcome — I just want to stop overthinking.
Thanks if you read this far.",0,1766694928.0,gay,0,0.25,False

1pvm7dv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvm7dv,Aspen Visit & Pickups,"Merry Christmas everyone 🎄
This is a recap of my Aspen experience with two visits in two days.

First off Aspen is such a beautiful city. There was no snow on the streets at all, but it was still an amazing place to experience. The family had a great time, my daughter absolutely loved outdoor ice skating, and the coffee and cookies were on point ☕️🍪.

Day 1
My first visit came from a waitlist call since I was within the top five lined up before the store opened. Honestly the store was pretty dry at first glance, exactly what you’d expect the week of Christmas. That said I eventually worked with an SA who was super cool and really helped me dig for a couple solid pieces. Definitely appreciated the effort.

Day 2
The second visit the following day was a bit underwhelming. Inventory was even drier than day one and there were fewer people in the store. I mainly went back to grab something I had left behind so it still worked out. Getting a visit this time of year is extremely difficult, I got really lucky. For anyone planning a trip plan ahead. As of a few days ago they were booked out past January 2.

Nocta availability
I know people are curious so yes there was Nocta in stock but it appeared to be pre allocated. I saw several people either already wearing it or picking it up while I was in the store. It seemed reserved for regular clientele rather than general walk ins. I wasn’t given any information suggesting it will be available at other locations.

Overall I’m very happy with how it turned out, especially after making the 4 hour drive from Denver.

I've flown several times since, and mostly I am ok-ish. I love to travel and facing my fear is important to me. 

But after certain news incidents lately (to say that lightly), takeoff and landing have been VERY stressful for me. Tonight I flew NYC>London Gatwick via Norse (an airline I love, especially their Premium class). 

After some turbulence throughout the flight, I was sort of frayed. The pilot then announced before landing, ""Hi folks, we're going to experience an autolanding this morning."" He then said it was high-tech, not to worry. But I was already sort of done with the anxiety, and this made it worse. 

I found this odd. Why tell us at all? Is it by law? Maybe it's better he says so, but how would we know otherwise?

Second, the FA said it's a regulation—pilots have to do it every so often for licensing purposes (I guess pilots need to practice autolanding). But why not in the simulator?

How hands-off is this? Can they switch it off if something went wrong? 

And why do they tell us?

For anxious folks, it was something I would have preferred to know later.   
  
Any insiders know? Thanks!

PS, the landing was butter. :) We were 100% fine. 

PSS, The turbulence was maybe a 3/10. A light, constant chop, enough to shake your water but not enough to spill it. It was not fun but the altitude and speed never changed and everything was fine. As pilots say, ""the most we worry about it spilled coffee."" I repeat that to myself every time. 

I fly to Bangkok in a few days and the FA said that route was very choppy. Sigh. We'll see how my Mantra holds up.

Me? I loved their Organic Whole Bean Light Roast. 

What’s curious is that Costco has also removed many of its coffee grinders. Did Sam’s follow suit simply out of lack of competition? Why offer a coffee grinder that requires maintenance and liability when your main competitor does not? 

Or maybe Sam’s maintained the grinders as part of a deal with one of their suppliers that has since shifted away from whole bean distribution? If that’s the case, why the coincidental disappearance of Firehouse Coffee and European Cafe, along with some of the Members Mark Whole Bean options? Were they all manufactured together?

Whatever the case, I’m less concerned with the loss of the grinder and more disappointed about losing the actual whole bean coffee variety. ",0,1766694000.0,samsclub,6,0.4,False

We’re an LDR couple even until now kasi although he’s pure Pinoy, he was born and raised in the US. But ever since he got his job, palagi na siyang umuuwi dito sa Pilipinas during his holiday break to visit his grandparents(mom side).

The first time we met, dinala niya agad ako sa bahay nila dito sa Pinas at pinakilala niya ako sa mga kamag-anak niya. His parents were so kind to me, they never doubted my intentions given that he’s the youngest & only son in their family. The elders were nice too, even his Lolo & Lola. Civil din naman kung makitungo yung ibang mga kamag-anak niya including his cousins from both sides of his family. My only concern was yung mga partner ng mga pinsan niya na super close niya (Let’s call them Family A).

I get it. I was just a stranger dating an American man. I already knew na some people would really think that I’m only dating my boyfriend for money. But what bothered me was of all people na mag judge sa akin ay yung mga kapwa “girlfriend” lang din naman. Honestly, I tried to be close with them. Kaso nga lang, hindi talaga nila ako pinapansin. I did everything to please them, to the point na nagse-send pa nga ako ng cash gifts on their birthdays hoping that they will eventually be nicer to me.

Last year, as usual, umuwi na naman ang boyfriend ko and his parents. That time, kasama umuwi ang Uncle niya (kapatid ng mom), Auntie, and 3 teenage cousins (2 girls & 1 boy). My boyfriend invited me over to stay at their province since Day 1 ng pagdating nila, but due to work commitments, nakarating ako 4 days later. 

I was really excited to meet his cousins and have a good time with them. However when I arrived, whenever I initiated a conversation with them cousins, tinatawag na agad sila ng mga “girlfriend”. Kesyo may pupuntahan sila na coffee shop, pupunta sa malapit na tourist destination, or wherever kung saan may pagkain & drinks… and sila2 lang ang pumupunta kasi Yung mga girlfriend, hindi naman ako kinakausap o iniimik man lang. Nagsasalita lang sa harapan ko para ayain na naman umalis ang mga bata. It’s as if in a span of 4 days,  they have already formed a group that I obviously am not allowed to join. To be fair, it was their first time meeting the cousins from States. And whenever I think about it now, para silang mga personal yaya na nakabuntot sa mga alaga nila na pinagbabawalan nilang makipag usap sa stranger.

Good thing is that my boyfriend also have other cousins (Family B) at may mga asawa na. These other cousins and mga wife nila treated me nicely, always making sure that I don’t feel out of place. Inaaya ako ng mga wifey na mag girls time every time na nalalaman nila na gumagala na naman yung mga balikbayan cousins with the Family 1 without me. The wives made sure to make time for me kahit na mga working moms sila. It turns out, ini-exclude din pala sila ng mga girlfriends kasi yung kino-close lang na mga kamag-anak ay yung mga naninirahan abroad. Taray talaga sa taas ng standard, pero ugaling skwater.

One time, one of the girlfriend posted on facebook stating that hindi daw kabawasan sa pagkatao niya ang pag iwas sa mga taong hindi dapat karapat-dapat pakisamahan. I screenshot the post and sent it to my boyfriend. I asked him kung ano ba ang mga needed credentials just for me to fit in sa ibang family members niya. Kasi to be honest, I am a degree holder with a stable job & a 6-digit monthly income. But the girlfriends, specifically the one who posted it, was an undergraduate and jobless. 

Sure, she can brag about them meeting my boyfriend and his family first, but it doesn’t give her the rights to create walls sa mga bagong salta. They’re not my boyfriend’s siblings and they’re definitely not even married to his cousins yet. I am really curious to know where the audacity came from.

Pagkabalik sa US ng boyfriend ko, I told him everything I felt and noticed. Turns out, napapansin din pala niya ang pang i-exclude na ginagawa ng mga girlfriend ng mga pinsan niya. But him, being so patient and kind, just told me na iwasan ko nalang yung mga girlfriends. That I don’t need to prove anything kasi hindi naman daw sila ang papakisamahan ko. He reminded me that they’re not even legal part of their family yet, as they’re still not married nor engaged to the family. So I just let it go, kasi nagkausap na naman kami ng mga cousins niya na nasa US and they promised to make time for me pag nakarating na ako ng US. However, paminsan-minsan ay  may nararamdaman pa rin ako ng hatred for the girlfriends— for building a wall, instead of uniting everyone. 

In my opinion, ang makakapal ang mukha dapat ang gumawa ng paraan para magkaisa ang lahat. They should’ve at least use their skills in a good way for the benefit of all.

Earlier this month, umuwi na naman ang boyfriend ko. This time, siya nalang mag isa ang nakapagbakasyon. And before siya dumating, he let me decide kung saan kami pupunta. I told him that I want to go to Palawan with his cousins (Family B) and their wives. My wish is his command, and so the vacation was all expense paid by him. We had so much fun. 

And under the heat of the sun, he proposed! 

When we went back to our hotel room after dinner, we video chatted with his immediate family and told them about the engagement. The good news travelled so fast and these girlfriends quickly sent a long & heartfelt congratulatory messages to me— as if we’re super close. lol!

Now they’re being nice to me. Ilang beses na nila akong iniinvite to go out or have drinks with them. But no! I refuse to associate with people who thinks so highly of themselves. And for sure if we go out, I’d be the one to pay the bill. No way! They don’t deserve an inch of my time or even a single penny. And right now, I’m still thinking if they are deserving of getting a wedding invite. Let’s see, mga letse.",3,1766693819.0,RantAndVentPH,5,1.0,False

I(30 M,) never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I don’t really know where else to put it. I can put it in a police report but my mom dont want that.

Growing up  i always thought my parents had a quiet marriage. Not happy abd not loud either. My dad was the type who liked things orderly. Dinner at the same time, the TV volume just right, no talking back. My mom adjusted herself around him so smoothly that I didn’t notice it for years. I thought that was just how she was and i found out by accident.


I was home earlier than usual one afternoon a week ago and because it's my day off , i went to check on ny parents and i heard voices from their room. At first I didn’t think much of it, until I heard something hit the wall and then my mom cried out. Not loud. More like she was trying not to be heard i froze in the hallway. I didn’t want to believe what my ears were telling me, but then the door opened and my dad walked out like nothing happened 

 calm and normal . he barely even looked at me.

When I went into the room, my mom was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding her arm. She smiled at me and said she was fine. She always said she was fine. But this time I didn’t let it go. I asked her straight up what was happening. She tried to brush it off, then she started crying. That was the first time I ever saw her really break.
That night she told me everything. That it wasn’t new. That it had been happening for years. Only when they were alone. Only when he was angry or felt disrespected. 

She said he never hit her face because he didn’t want marks. She said she stayed because she thought it was better for me and my sister . hearing that hurt more than anything else.

she asked me to leave and i did bec i was stunned with what happened. I was never close with my dad bec he has been strict my whole life. And my sister is the only person he shows much affection for . 


i didn’t sleep that night. I kept replaying every memory of my childhood, every time my dad seemed irritated, every time my mom went quiet. I realized how blind I had been.
The next day , I packed a bag. I asked my boss to give me an emergency vacation leave and then I packed another one for my mom with some clothes she left in my apartment whenever she visits my place 

 When my dad left for work, I told her we were leaving. She hesitated. She was scared. She's just 49 years old and has been a housewife for a very long time . she kept saying he would be angry, that we didn’t have a plan, that it might get worse. I told her I didn’t care. I told her I wasn’t letting her stay there another day.
We left with just clothes and important documents. I took her to an airbnb that is 4 hrs away from home. It’s cramped and not ideal, but it’s quiet.ive saved alot of money for the last years that i was about to use for buying a new home but i will do it with my mom this time.

The airbnb is quiet that doesn’t make you flinch. Ny mom keeps on crying day and night. Ive read alot of reddit stories and i know what a trauma bonding looks life and this is one of the best examples.


My mom barely slept. She apologized constantly for taking up space, for eating my food, for crying. I kept telling her she didn’t owe me anything. That she was safe. That was all that mattered.
My dad blew up my phone. Angry messages at first, then apologetic ones, then angry again. I blocked him. That was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but also one of the easiest once I actually did it.
Now we live together. I work from home for now and she’s slowly figuring out what she wants to do next. Some days she’s strong. Some days she’s quiet. But she laughs more now. She watches shows she likes without worrying about volume. She sleeps through the night.
I still feel angry sometimes. At my dad. At myself. At how long this went on without me knowing. But when I see my mom making coffee in the morning, relaxed, unafraid, I know I did the right thing.
I don’t know what the future looks like. I just know she’s not behind closed doors anymore, and neither am I.

I will build a new home for her with no shame or pain anymore in this lifetime.

It's obvious deep down I care about him, but our interactions is anywhere from tepid to ambivalent.

But I borderline loathe visiting him or talking to him most of the time.  He drives me up the wall.  

He lives on a large island a 2 hour ferry ride away.  So it's a big operation to schedule the time off work and visit for a mere 2 day weekend.

His and my personalities are pretty much as opposite as they could possibly be.  I'm a very introverted person who loves *me* time, and have innumerable interests I can pursue during spare time. Boredom is a choice, to me.  He is an extrovert without any hobbies he can partake in in his infirm state who gets stir crazy alone when he has no one to talk to.   When I visit, he can't walk for more than a couple of minutes at a time and he refuses to try to cook, he can't clean effectively, and he's stubborn to boot so half of my visit involves me doing errands for him.   Which would be fine on its own, because I'm his son, but on top of this the entire visit revolves around his bodily functions, his messed up sleep schedule, his meds, and his cravings for fast food. To which I've argued with him only makes his health problems worse to no avail. 

In his state he suggested 2 years ago maybe he should think about going into a home. His condo is 2 levels, so dangerous for him to traverse, and too big for him to care for.  It's paid off, so we could easily rent it out to subsidize his income.  Last summer I took 2 weeks of my vacation time to come help him clear out his place to get prepared for it.  During the process he got anxiety that we were giving away too much and throwing out junk he'd accumulated over half a century (he's not a hoarder,  but it was a *lot* of literally useless junk). Ever since he's been throwing up excuses to not pursue housing so we can't even discuss the prospect without him saying ""I can't deal with this right now my heart is acting up"" ""I don't want to talk about this right now"" ""they wouldn't have me"" ""i make too much money to qualify for subsidized housing"" ""I don't make enough to afford X"" - insert any excuse you could imagine. 

He has always been a hands on, large and in charge person who was fussy and constantly stressed about *something*.  He has a lighter side and a sense of humour, but it was sparing, and these days almost supplanted in favor of constant worry, anxiety, and fussiness over routine, daily things. 

He has innumerable health problems, to which doctors and teams have tested and scanned and come up with concoctions to try to figure out what could be causing these symptoms but to no avail.  He regularly goes to emergency for perceived problems only to have some tests dnd be sent home with a *shrug*.  It's fairly obvious he's practically a known nuisance to the hospital at this point. To make matters worse, he shoots down suggestions for remedies, and things that normally work for 90% of people never seem to quench his maladies.

Example: he can't sleep, so he gets sleeping pills prescribed.  This kicks off a 2 year ordeal where he wakes up after 2-3 hours each night and can't get to sleep. So he changes medication every few months until the doctors run out of suggestions. They tell him to wean slowly off and try to sleep naturally.  He says he tried and he's addicted so he can't even though he's miserable.  I suggest support groups or therapy or exercise.  He says he tried already, or he can't, or it won't work. His head spins from 5 am to mid afternoon every day, 
so his life revolves around watching tv, his bladder, warming his cold feet, driving to mcdonalds for a coffee and ice cream daily, and incessantly calling people to gab at them.  

And believe me, he talks AT them, not with them.  If you had a word counter it would be literally probably 80:1.  I wish I were joking.  He's lost a dozen friends in the past 5 years from being too self interested in his conversations, then turns around and complains he's lonely.  When I bring up the fact that a home would have plenty of people to talk to, he flips and says he couldn't stand that many people around despite the fact that he's clearly lonely.   He has proposed I move in with him but that would mean me leaving my 11 year career and taking a pay cut. I don't have any post- secondary credentials and jobs are niche and low paying in his town so I would basically kiss any hope of home ownership goodbye until he dies, my dating life would be (even more) nonexistent, and he would drive me completely insane. 

He gave up on CPAP for his apnea cuz he says it makes his mouth dry. 

He hates his hearing aids because they're too weak or too strong or too expensive. 

No drugs have their desired effect.  

He won't move or change his situation, and if you broach the topic he bandies his anxiety or health or threatens legal suicide. 

95% of conversations are doom and gloom, health and bowel problems, who died last month or complaints or cautionary tales.

He's too technically lucid for me to exercise power of attorney and force him into a home. 

I have the constant worry of him dying at any Particular time and having to brush aside my feelings to deal with organizing his COL and estate. 

He routinely does things that clearly irritate his bowels and makes dietary choices that mess with his sleep or digestion then gripes that these choices are his only solace. 

He guilts me if I bring up ideas for a career change or a move to better my life under the pretext of him being sad that I'd move farther away or not be as accessible.   

He shoots down all attempts I make for him to move with me to the same town citing that it's too big of a change, ironically, he complains how everyone is dead or awol where he lives now. 

Hell, we don't even share interests in almost any regard - all we do when i visit is watch tv with him, I like Sci fi, fantasy, intellectual plots and he likes reality tv, talent shows, and Law and Order which I despise as genres.

The WORST part of this whole thing is that I feel like a terrible person and son for even writing this.   It's Christmas, and I had to steal an hour away from him at ""the store"" to write this.  

But I can't deny or lie about how I feel at my core about him and this situation.  I feel powerless to help him or do anything past what I've already tried, because he's still the one who calls the shots on his life.  

I know some might say ""Just spend time and lend an ear.  Maybe he just likes to talk to you. ""  He does.   And I do.   But frankly, it's borderline agony to endure most of the time.  I feel like a pet sea sponge trapped in a cage soaking up his toxic chemicals. 

TL;DR.  Sorry.   Fuck.   

I have to reiterate:  I'm making him sound terrible, but he's a good PERSON, just impossible to deal with.  And it gets worse every year.  

I could write another novel but I need a drink, ffs.",2,1766693694.0,Vent,2,1.0,False
