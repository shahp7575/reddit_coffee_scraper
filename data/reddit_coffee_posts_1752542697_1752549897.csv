1m075au,https://i.redd.it/2n6thof6cycf1.png,"""Caffeine Legion"" My jank endgame haste legion build","I've been playing this recently, and it's super fun. I know it's not the new Meta or anything, but I'm enjoying the game so much while running this build.

Main goal: Stack BFF locket above all else. Stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks. Go for 3+ chain hits whenever possible, hooks are entirely optional. If all goes well, at endgame the coffee finally kicks in and Legion gets a permanent 15% Haste boost and hopefully makes a sudden blowout before survivors cleanse NOED or opens gates.

 ***Quick build explanation***

* Obviously **NOED** is the core of the build. Without NOED, you're just a little faster then normal. Makes your M1s actually threatening, and combined with the haste makes you extremely lethal.
* **Deadlock** \+ **Corrupt** to passively buy time for stacking. Regression perks are no good, they takes away from the time you could spend stacking stacking stacking stacking don't stop stacking. ^((Possibly swap Corrupt for No Way Out? not entirely sure yet which works better.))
* **Batteries** is a little cherry on top. Some nice extra haste, pretty much mapwide in the endgame. Occasionally helps with stacking and downs in the midgame.
* **BFF Locket** for the massive 6% Haste in Endgame. New spawn rules mean the first chain is significantly easier then it used to be. 
* **Never Sleep Pills** so you can still stack if the survivors split up on either half of the map. Also can catch survivors off guard for the first chain, making it easier to get 5 hits.
* **Shroud** on the off chance the survivors try to split up. Entirely unnecessary. 

I'm pretty happy with the build, even if it isn't for my main killer. Anyone have thoughts? Improvements? Insults?",1,1752549782.0,DeadByDaylightKillers,0,1.0,False
1m07511,https://i.redd.it/yemtr248iycf1.jpeg,Help identifying old (1910s?) Studebaker?,"Hello! I was going through old family photos and came across this picture of my great grandparents’ first car. I initially posted on r/oldcars for guidance on identifying make and model. There wasn’t really a consensus other than thinking it may likely have been a custom make. Unfortunately, there was no writing in the back of the image so the details i have about it are slim. After discussing with family, I learned a few more details. This is what I know about the car, if helpful:

- make was a studebaker
- picture was taken in New England likely pre 1920
- car was purchased as a used car
- car was purchased used from either Chase or Sanborn of the Chase and Sanborn coffee company 

Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on what year this car may be/ the model or if it may have been a custom car? I would’ve thought that to be unusual for the time but I suppose the people they bought it off of would have had the means to have a custom car at the time?

The business is almost 2 years old, I have a decent local following. Majority of my clientele is moms/families with young kids, women. My drinks cater to that crowd and I have partnerships with our local children's museum, local parks&rec, etc.

  
I have the opportunity to purchase a local soft play/bounce house rental business. They have a solid following and are well known in the local mom groups, and the business is about 5 years old. They've got a lot of the same connections as I do, as well as wineries and churches. They also offer private event rentals and host public playdates with their equipment regularly. We had previously discussed the possibility of a joint venture play cafe (brick&mortar), but they have decided to move out of the country. 

I feel like this could be a great opportunity to have a secondary income source, and I am already familiar with the events and logistics of running this type of business. I have the physical space in my warehouse for all of the equipment, and they also have 3 trained employees that would stay on. They are asking $44k for the business and need to sell in the next month for their move.

1m071ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOSloseit/comments/1m071ap/my_subclinical_pcos_weight_and_hairloss_journey/,My subclinical PCOS weight and hairloss journey,"I'm posting here to share my journey, hoping it might be helpful for anyone else navigating mysterious or confusing symptoms that may not seem to connect... Whether it is now or someone in the distant future, Googling symptoms and wondering if they'll ever find support, I hope what I have learned is supportive in any way! I'm going to try my best to only include details that are relevant. 

Since I first got my period at 13, I've never had one regularly. I went through most of my teens and 20s only getting a period every 6-9 months. The gynecologists I'd see in my teens would always recommend going on birth control, and I just didn't like the idea of going on something when essentially no one could give my 16-year-old self a clear answer for why this was happening in the first place. I had some success in my 20s with homeopathic medicine and then with Ayurveda. I want to note that many of the herbs, foods, and routines I learned from Ayurveda are still supportive to this day for managing PCOS. When I went to an endocrinologist in 2017, my labs and symptoms did not meet the criteria for PCOS. This white woman also attributed my excessive hair growth to my race, and likely not PCOS. (Gotta love medical racism!)

By my late 20s and early 30s, the missed periods returned. This time, I also gained 30 lbs that simply would not budge, or go away only to return. I noticed my hair thinning by my mid 30s, really starting around the pandemic. At the time I made no connection. 

Last year, a new layer: I found two alopecia areata patches. That was one of the most horrific periods simply because no one, literally no doctor, seemed to want to take time to really understand what was going on. While cortisol shots were incredible and literally the only thing that helped regrow hair, I hit a breaking point. Reading many posts on Reddit, researching online, ChatGPT/Claude, I finally made the decision to see an integrative medicine doctor in May. I was committed to getting every possible lab needed and really taking my time. After over two decades, I wanted to finally get to as close to a real solution and path forward as possible.

A friend recommended I try intermittent fasting. On a whim, I went ahead and tried. Within 2 weeks of fasting, I got my period. I knew when I went to see the doctor I wanted to bring this up and if it could mean all my symptoms were PCOS-related after all.

Since then, it's been this cascade of prayers answered, concrete evidence, a tremendously supportive doctor guiding the way, and the path forward I wanted all along! Some highlights:  
\-Labs showed that my ferritin was extremely low at 15L (this thread was so, so helpful for understanding why!), very low omega-3 fatty acids  
\-My doctor was concerned I may have celiac disease, testing ruled this out (but important to check out!)  
\-Notably, I did not have any markers for autoimmune conditions  
\-My doctor now has me on the following supplements: inositol (I use Ovasitol brand), Vitamin D, NAC, iron biglycinate (ferrous, chelated, I got from Thorne), omega-3 fish oil, magnesium glycinate (sleep! finally!)  
\-My doctor and I are big fans of ""culinary medicine"": I cut out all processed food, only eat whole foods, rich in chromium (Green beans, oranges, apples, broccoli, garlic, onions, bananas, grapes, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, amonds, faxseeds, eggs), anthocyanins (red, blue, purple hues: Black beans, purple sweet potatoes, black and wild rice, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, red cabbage, plums, prunes, purple carrots); flavonols (onions, kale, broccoli, spinach, apple, garlic, leeks, scallions, green tea, capers); I only drink green tea in the mornings  
\-I measured my body composition and metabolic rate in office; the conclusion was to keep calories at 1500/my maintenance rate and to focus physical activity on yoga + weight-lifting (total 150 minutes/week), and walking/10k steps a day  
\-I'm using the Cronometer app to track my macros and this dietary plan  
\-I'll be in a group using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) this fall; while we also eliminated insulin resistance as a cause, understanding my metabolism felt helpful; it's also covered by my health insurance

I've lost 18 lbs and have 17lbs to go before I hit my target weight. Most of this has been from  fasting, calorie counting (\~1500, even before seeing my doctor), and dietary changes. Inositol has been a game changer--I don't even feel like I need the 2+ cups of coffee a day I needed to function! The iron, we hope, will help address my hair loss. I was prescribed Spironolactone by a dermatologist and will remain on it for now, but hope in 1-2 years I can get off this if all these changes help address my hair loss.

I am hopeful this will be helpful for me! My doctor seems very optimistic after my initial labs and scans came in. Happy to answer any questions and messages! 

I continue to feel grateful for this community. It truly saved my mental health during some of the darkest days, which can come up even now while I munch on raddish...lol

P.S. I went to see a doctor at the Integrative Health and Wellbeing Program at Weill Cornell. Absolute game changer for me!",1,1752549442.0,PCOSloseit,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best tea candies distinguish themselves through a combination of factors, including the quality of tea used, the balance of sweetness, the texture, and the overall flavor profile.

**Authentic Tea Flavor:** The hallmark of a great tea candy is its ability to capture the true essence of the tea it represents.

The best candies use high-quality, finely ground tea leaves or concentrated tea extracts to deliver an authentic and nuanced flavor experience. This means you should be able to clearly identify the type of tea – whether it's the floral notes of jasmine, the earthy tones of matcha, or the briskness of black tea. Artificial flavorings often result in a candy that tastes generic and lacks the depth of real tea.

**Balanced Sweetness:** Achieving the right level of sweetness is crucial for a satisfying tea candy.

Too much sugar can mask the delicate flavors of the tea, while not enough can leave the candy tasting bitter or bland. Expert candy makers carefully calibrate the sweetness to complement the tea's natural characteristics, creating a harmonious balance that enhances the overall experience. The best tea candies use natural sweeteners like honey or agave to add complexity and avoid an overly sugary taste.

**Smooth and Pleasant Texture:** The texture of a tea candy plays a significant role in its enjoyment.

Whether it's a hard candy, a chewy gummy, or a creamy caramel, the texture should be smooth, consistent, and free of any grittiness or stickiness. A well-crafted tea candy melts evenly in the mouth, releasing its flavors gradually and providing a satisfying sensory experience. The use of high-quality ingredients and precise manufacturing processes are essential for achieving the ideal texture.

**Natural Ingredients:** Many consumers now prefer products made with natural ingredients.

Tea candies that prioritize natural ingredients, such as real tea leaves, natural sweeteners, and plant-based colors, are generally considered superior. These ingredients not only contribute to a better flavor profile but also align with health-conscious consumers’ preferences. Avoiding artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives enhances the overall appeal of the candy.

Key features of the best tea candies include:

*   Authentic tea flavor
*   Balanced sweetness
*   Smooth and pleasant texture
*   Natural ingredients

## Core Benefits

Tea candy offers several benefits beyond just being a sweet treat. It can provide a convenient and enjoyable way to experience the flavors of tea, offer a subtle energy boost, and even provide some of the antioxidant benefits associated with tea.

**Convenient Tea Experience:** Tea candy provides a portable and mess-free way to enjoy the taste of tea anytime, anywhere.

Unlike brewing a cup of tea, tea candy requires no preparation or cleanup. It's perfect for on-the-go consumption, whether you're commuting to work, traveling, or simply craving a tea-flavored treat. The individually wrapped candies are easy to carry in your pocket or bag, making them a convenient option for a quick and satisfying tea fix.

**Subtle Energy Boost:** Certain tea candies, particularly those made with matcha or black tea, can provide a mild energy boost.

The caffeine content in these teas can help to improve focus and alertness without the jitters or crash associated with coffee. Tea candy can be a great alternative for those looking for a gentler and more sustained energy boost throughout the day. The combination of caffeine and sugar provides a quick pick-me-up that can help you power through your afternoon slump.

**Potential Antioxidant Benefits:** Tea is known for its antioxidant properties, and some of these benefits may be retained in tea candy.

While the concentration of antioxidants in tea candy is likely to be lower than in brewed tea, it can still contribute to your overall antioxidant intake. Antioxidants help to protect your body against free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to aging and disease. Choosing tea candies made with high-quality tea leaves can maximize the potential antioxidant benefits.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about tea candy:

**What types of tea are commonly used in tea candy?**

Matcha, black tea, green tea, jasmine tea, and oolong tea are among the most popular choices for tea candy. Each tea imparts a unique flavor profile to the candy, ranging from the earthy and slightly bitter notes of matcha to the floral and aromatic qualities of jasmine tea. The specific type of tea used will depend on the desired flavor and the brand's preferences.

**Are tea candies suitable for people with allergies?**

It depends on the specific ingredients used in the candy. Some tea candies may contain common allergens such as dairy, soy, or nuts. It's essential to carefully read the ingredient list before consuming tea candy, especially if you have known allergies. Many brands now offer allergy-friendly options, such as vegan or gluten-free tea candies.

**How should tea candy be stored to maintain its freshness?**

Tea candy should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. This will help to prevent the candy from melting, becoming sticky, or losing its flavor. An airtight container is recommended to protect the candy from moisture and humidity. Properly stored tea candy can typically last for several months without significant degradation in quality.

Need some recommendations for those in the know and have lived in Bangkok. It's an overwhelmingly big place and need to narrow down my search. Here's a bit more about me.

\- Single, male, mid-thirties

\- Not the big party type, but do enjoy the occasional night life, low key bars and lounges. Not into the big tourist traps.

\- Enjoy working out and proximity to gyms, as well as some 'healthy food options' other than fast food. Love me some Thai food!

\- Really enjoy cafe culture, and love working from coffee shops from time to time

\- Walkability is very important for me

\- Not into anything super posh or these band new super sleek condos. A decent modern facility will suffice.

\- Love a nice vibe: friendly, fun, with nice dash of culture. 

  
Thanks in advance!.

The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and the faint hint of sunscreen. Juliet Skye, barefoot and clad in a tiny denim shorts and an oversized tee, was dancing to the rhythm of the waves crashing against the shore. Her laughter, as bright and carefree as the sunlight, filled the room. 

Noah Sinclair, lounging on the nearby couch, watched her with a mix of amusement and something deeper. His eyes lingered on her, taking in the way her hair danced in the breeze and the way her eyes sparkled with joy. He was a master at hiding his feelings, but the way his fingers drummed against the armrest betrayed his growing restlessness. 

As Juliet spun around, her eyes meeting his, he flashed a playful grin, ""You know, I've never seen anyone enjoy dancing to the sound of waves quite like you do."" She laughed, her cheeks flushing slightly, ""Well, Noah, maybe that's because I'm not like anyone you've ever met.""

As Juliet's laughter faded, she noticed Noah's gaze had shifted from her face to her bare feet. She followed his line of sight, her cheeks flushing a deeper shade of pink. ""You know, I've always been a barefoot girl,"" she said, her voice soft and playful. ""It's like I can feel the earth beneath me, even when I'm just standing still."" Noah chuckled, his eyes meeting hers again. ""Well, Juliet, I've never met a girl who can make wearing socks seem like a crime."" 

He leaned forward, his hand brushing against hers as he reached for the coffee mug on the table. Their fingers lingered for a moment, the contact sending a jolt through them both. Juliet's eyes widened slightly, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she smiled, her voice barely above a whisper, ""Maybe it's not the socks, Noah. Maybe it's just you.""

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, Noah and Juliet found themselves on the patio, glasses of wine in hand. The air was cool, a gentle breeze carrying the scent of the ocean. 

Juliet, her feet bare, kicked back in her chair, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""You know, Noah,"" she began, a playful smile tugging at her lips, ""I've always wondered about you. Are you one of those guys who thinks about sex all the time?"" Noah choked on his wine, a laugh escaping him. ""Well, Juliet, I'm not sure if thinking about sex all the time is a good thing or not,"" he replied, his eyes meeting hers. ""But I can tell you that I've never had to think about it when I'm with you."" Juliet leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, ""You probably haven't even looked at me that way, have you, Noah? Like you really see me."" Noah's breath hitched, his gaze dropping to her lips. 

He was about to respond when the sound of a car pulling up in the driveway interrupted them. ""That's Mom,"" Juliet said, her voice tinged with disappointment. As they heard the front door open, Noah and Juliet exchanged a look, the moment lost but the tension still lingering. They both lay awake that night, their minds racing, their bodies awake, the taste of wine and the feel of each other's breath still fresh in their minds.

As the sun began to rise, Juliet found herself drawn to the sound of the ocean, her bare feet padding softly on the wooden floor as she made her way to the patio. The air was cool, the morning mist clinging to her skin as she stepped outside. She leaned against the railing, her eyes scanning the horizon as the first light of day painted the sky. A soft smile played on her lips as she thought about the night before, the tension between her and Noah still lingering in her mind.

I go to the gym about four times a week. I keep to myself, get my workout in, and head out. I'm not really there to socialize. But one day, while zoning out between sets, I noticed a guy nearby staring at me. Our eyes met — cue the classic polite smile-nod combo — and that became our unspoken ritual every time we crossed paths. He was always there.

Weeks passed, and one day after using the massage chairs in the rest area, I let out a dramatic, blissed-out sigh. When I opened my eyes, there he was — sitting next to me. I jumped a little, apologized for the noise, and he used that as his opportunity to strike up a conversation. “How was your workout? Leaving already? Do you usually come at this time?” I gave short answers, caught off guard, and left quickly, embarrassed.

Then life got in the way and I didn’t go back to the gym for about two months. When I returned, I noticed something interesting: every time I’d head for the massage chairs at the end of my workout, he’d suddenly wrap up his workout too — and end up right next to me. He always made conversation, asked personal questions, and seemed excited to learn more about me. When I told him I was Latina, he broke out in Spanish and started tossing in compliments. He casually asked if I had “any dependents” — a clumsy but obvious probe into my relationship and parental status.

Honestly? I was flattered. The attention felt good. He was charming and funny, and though I clocked that he was probably younger, I brushed it off. (I’m notoriously bad at guessing ages, and Asians always look young — sigh.)

For weeks, it became a flirty cat-and-mouse game. He’d greet me loudly in Spanish, toss me a compliment across the room, wink. It was all playful, light, and public — enough to draw the attention of people nearby. And yeah… I started to play along. I laughed, I flirted back, I sought him out a little.

Then came yesterday.

I was walking on the treadmill when he hopped onto the one next to me. We talked for an hour. And that’s when something shifted. The conversation got deeper… or so I thought. He started talking about astrology (which I love), guessed my sign (“What are you, an Aquarius or something?” — nailed it), mentioned music I liked, and knew my Chinese zodiac.

He complimented me nonstop. “You always look so nice. Your nails are immaculate. I can tell you take care of yourself.” And yet… every time I asked him something about his own life, he expertly dodged it. Evasive. Vague. Practiced.

Eventually, I got fed up. “I’m not continuing this conversation until you tell me how old you are and what you do for work.”

He smiled.

“I’m 19,” he said. “And I’m a sugar baby.”

I blinked. WHAT?

He laughed and explained how it works — that he has five sugar mamas who each give him a monthly allowance. He broke it all down like it was just another career path.

Still joking, still flirty.

He asked for my number so we could grab a coffee. I gave it — mostly out of shock, and also because I didn’t want to cause a scene. I figured I’d text him later and shut it down gently.

But something didn’t sit right. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d been played. So I opened up Tinder — an app I rarely use — and started scrolling through the profiles that had liked me over the past few months. And there it was.

A shirtless torso. Abs front and center. The profile said he was into short-term fun, spoke English, Tagalog, and Spanish, and that he was a Virgo. My gut said it was him. And then I remembered: my profile says I’m an Aquarius. It says my love language is words of affirmation. It lists the music I love. It even says I’m into astrology.

Suddenly everything clicked.

This wasn’t a chance flirtation. This was a strategy. He had studied me. He used the gym as his hunting ground — not to work out (come to think of it, I’ve never actually seen him lift anything heavy), but to recruit. And I had been one of his targets.

He had been laying the groundwork for months. Complimenting me, making me feel seen, mirroring my interests. It wasn’t just attention — it was manipulation designed to sell me on his services without ever naming the price.

I won’t lie. It stung.

Already feeling a little down about myself, the realization that I had been viewed as a potential client, not a person, felt like a punch to the gut. It made me question everything — my desirability, my age, my worth.

But also? It was kind of hilarious.

So here’s what I plan to do.

Next time I see this baby-faced businessman, I’m going to return the energy — loud and proud, just like he was when he complimented me in front of a crowd. I’ll walk up and say:

“Hey big money! Doing business as usual? Closed any deals today? Or are you heading to the retirement home next? I still can’t believe you tried to add me to your portfolio!”

Will I actually do it? We’ll see.

But one thing’s for sure — I’m walking into that gym with my head held high. Not because of his attention, but because I saw through the illusion, laughed, and chose to walk away with my power (and dignity) intact.",1,1752548442.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I need advice. I am spiraling but not sure if I’m overreacting. I (27F) have been with my now fiancé (26M) for about 10 years, since high school. We live together now and, for context, I was recently laid off from my job but he makes decent enough money that he’s able to support us with his income. 

I love kids. I’ve always known I wanted kids but my fiancé wants to wait another year or two. I’ve agreed that’s smarter but sometimes I joke around about just having a baby now.

A lot of my friends have kids, and since I was recently laid off, I started babysitting my friend’s 1 year old baby for a few days out of the week for some extra cash. I think doing this has given me some baby fever. 

Saturday night, I ended up having a conversation with my fiancé about this and crying to him just explaining that I don’t think any amount of nannying or babysitting will fill the hole in my heart for wanting to be a mom, and how I really want to just go for it and have a baby. He said he really would like us to wait a year or two still. We talked some more and that was that.

The next day, Sunday, he we had unprotected sex. During sex, I told him to not pull out, and he didn’t. I am not on birth control and he knows this. I told him afterwards I was excited at the possibility of us being pregnant and he just smiled. We went about our night like normal. I will say I was up for a while thinking about what if this was a stupid mistake and we’re really not ready? But I decided I was overthinking and went to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up to my fiancé surprising me with coffee, and some AZO pills (I had mentioned some discomfort the night before and thought I might have a UTI). So he brings me coffee and my AZO pills + some extra vitamins in a little bowl for me to take, like vitamin D and something else. I take them without thinking anything of it. 
He leaves for work, and I continue about my morning at home. I got to thinking, and I thought it was odd that he brought me the pills and vitamins basically on a platter because he had never done that before. The more I thought about it, the more I remembered our conversation from Saturday night and how he was really hesitant on having a baby. I started to spiral and I had a weird feeling he may have given me a Plan B.  

Because I knew he had gone to target, I knew I could check the target app for recent purchases. 
Long story short, I eventually get the target app password and I login, and sure enough there’s a plan B pill in the purchase from this morning.
I’m immediately sick to my stomach. I text him and ask if he gave me a Plan B this morning. He said “no, it’s in my car though. I wanted to talk about it later today” and I immediately knew it was a lie. He called me, and I told him to send me a picture of the Plan B in his car because I didn’t believe him. Then he says “it’s not in my car.” I said, “where is it?” And he was silent. I said “you gave it to me?” And he said “yes.” I immediately started hyperventilating sobbing and hung up. 
He tried to leave work early come home and “try to make things right”. I told him not to come home and to go to his parent’s house because I don’t want to see him. He’s respected my boundaries and he’s not here.

What do I do? This feels like such a huge breach of trust. I feel like, if he didn’t want to risk me getting pregnant, he could have pulled out. I didn’t force him to. I told him to during intercourse and he did, so it was consensual. But him giving me the Plan B was completely un-consensual - and what if I were to never check the target app? Would he have just never told me? 

I also feel like if he was feeling regretful, he could have talked to me this morning or after work and we could have made this decision together, but now I feel disgusting and violated. How could someone I love so deeply and trust with my life just do something so sneaky?

It hurts because I’ve been with him for 10 years and he’s been the sweetest most loving partner. I just feel so betrayed and I’m trying to figure out if we can work this out or if I need to break things off, or am I being dramatic by thinking this is worth ending the relationship over?

1m06irn,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1m06irn/neighbor_keeps_calling_cops_on_us/,neighbor keeps calling cops on us,"location: SC

my partner (21m) & i (22f) have our first apartment together in a very populated city. it’s a nicer area and our neighbors seem to be kind people. 

well, there’s an older lady who lives directly beneath us who has called the police on us twice. she claims that she smells drugs as if we are cooking them, specifically meth. we obviously don’t do that. the officers seem to be irritated and say that they’d be able to smell it from the sidewalk if that was the case. we actually had one officer tell us that it looked and smelled nice in here lol. 

for some context: we don’t know this lady. she never introduced herself. the only time we’ve had an interaction with her is when she came outside during the night and pointed at what was clearly a star in the sky and said “i think those are drones surveilling the complex”, to which i politely said “i think that’s either a star or maybe a planet up there”. we’ve noticed other little things about her that are concerning such as; tape on her car doors, she rarely leaves her apartment, if she’s seen outside she’s usually in a robe & pjs, and she usually has her door “barricaded” as we say. because there’s literally a coffee table, chair, and a few big plants crowded in front of her door. we don’t know how old she is but if i had to guess, maybe mid 60’s-70’s. my partner said he walked past her door one day and got a glimpse of the inside of her apartment and it was covered in clutter, medicine bottles, and blankets on everything. 

sooo she seems to be mentally unstable in my opinion. we don’t smell “cooking meth” nor do we smell anything else. we don’t even drink. 

it is embarrassing for us to have the police at our door and neighbors potentially speculating things. we don’t know if she’s going around telling people stuff. it is especially annoying when i’m trying to have a relaxing evening and next thing you know there’s banging at my door from the cops. i am a survivor of abuse so hearing the loud knocking or seeing the police terrifies me. 

we are going up to the office in the morning to complain. i would like to know how/if we can prevent this. would it seem threatening to her if i tried talking to her about this or should i avoid her? and isn’t it illegal to make false reports to the police? is it worth calling for a welfare check on her? and when does this become defamation of character or harassment?

1m06icb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m06icb/hurricane_helene_and_helter_skelter/,Hurricane Helene and Helter Skelter,"Lights flashed from the hundreds of monitors that array out like a theater under the massive screen of the military control center that played the evening news. Smaller screens littered the side walls with various apps that showed icons of the many units deployed to the mountains of North Carolina.

Uniformed bodies rush to and fro, gathering around phone lines, clattering on keyboards, and murmuring to each other in hushed and hurried conversation.

""Attention to JOC!"" Rings out the voice of God, as a young Captain's voice shakes into his desktop microphone.

""Attention to JOC,"" echoes from the rest of the voices as their heads snap up to the screen that has now been split in two with a muted newscast as the anchor continues their report in front of a ruined mountain town, the night forest looming. The other half of the screen now showing the master map and zoomed in to the icon of 57th Engineer Company, next to it a red 67/82.

""Captain Caldwell reports that eleven of eleven squads have returned from search patrol three. Reduced visibility from the lunar cycle has severely hampered search efforts and squad leaders are reporting that even with their night vision devices, visibility in the forest is too dense to continue their search through the night.""

""Sir,"" an older voice follows up seamlessly. ""Castle 6 is also reporting that there's a group of 3-6 men who have lit fires around their landing zone. Alpha Troop had to be waved off last second. They're attempting to make contact with the men but have had no luck chasing them down. He's in contact with the local Sheriff but he also has his hands full with those men who attacked 618th company when they tried to start their foot movement to help with the search. He's belligerent that the company isn't allowed to walk through his property.

""Are you fucking kidding me?!"" the Commanding General blurt out, interrupting his sip from what looks like cold coffee. He's still in his PT uniform, despite it being 0200. Everyone in their seats is on shift work, but you can tell that he's been answering phone calls from the Pentagon since yesterday morning.

The older voice of the Colonel continued, ""The Sheriff wants to help because that's the only tenable pass over the mountain with how the roads are, but legally, the old man is right. He didn't even have to call in for a lawyer, the magistrate let him out without bond once they got to the courthouse. The deputies have the man's property blocked off and even threatened to arrest 618th's Commander for attempting to continue movement when the Sheriff left with that man.""

""Is this the fucking 70's? What on earth is going on up there? I have five Soldiers go missing and then these fucking hillbillies start treating us like we're marching Ruby Ridge when we try to go looking for them! I haven't even told their fucking families yet because the Pentagon is so concerned with the PR surrounding our presence there! Get Captain Caldwell and Castle 6 on the phone. You have five minutes. We ARE NOT stopping this search, I don't give a fuck what his NCOs think. We will rip open the gates of hell before I have to call any of those Soldier's families.""

""Sir, Castle 6 just messaged back. He's managed to negotiate with the property owner, but he's adamant that 618th is not allowed to use the speakers they brought to help with their search.""

After the tense phone call the General had with those two they split the squads and had one half bed down immediately, the other half was going back out after a quick rest and chow break. They'd swap after six hours so there was no lapse in coverage during the search.

If you've never used them before, NODs (night optic device) take in infrared light from the moon and use that to let you see. This means that there's no color distinction in what you see, so the NODs use a green filter to help you distinguish shapes because green has the widest color range. It's not at all like you see in the movies or video games because those always have a ton of lighting so it makes the picture look great when you use them. But when you're walking under canopy the picture starts to get less clear, like a permanent version of when you can't get your eyes to focus because you're too tired.

Poor kids, it's hard enough to see at night under NODs, but with sleep deprivation starting to set in I can guarantee they'll start to see the green men before they even step off. God, I hope the stars shrine bright tonight.

Two hours into this search and things had quieted down. Once the General left everyone who didn't really do much winnow themselves away. The once crowded operations center now seemed almost hollow. It had been awhile since I had gotten up from my desk so I figured it was a good time for a smoke, besides, we don't get to bring our phones in there so I could use mindless doom scrolling to occupy my mind from the reality we were dealing with.

The cool autumn air was crisp and refreshing on my neck, perfect weather for a cigarette, less so for a manhunt. I lingered outside the building next to a few others had the same idea as myself and did my typical rhythm of bouncing around between apps. I answered some worried texts from my family, I let my spouse know that I would be home around breakfast, scrolled through Instagram for a bit before closing it, and then immediately reopening it. I was almost to the filter on my cigarette when I got Snapchat notification.

That's it! We hadn't sent out any of the Soldiers with our usual GPS equipment because they didn't really take any of our war fighting equipment for an aid mission, but I bet at least one of the missing Soldiers had their location turned on. Usually it's a big problem for units whenever we do our exercises because at least one or two rogue privates will forget they're broadcasting their location on Snapchat, but this time it might actually help them!

I quickly started to navigate the map to see if I could get close to their last known location. Lots of public stories in the area, I didn't know their usernames so I started to click through them.

A group of people walking through a church showing off all the damage from the flooding. A little boy that was very excited he had a helicopter in his front yard. Lots of slow pans of towns that look like they had been swallowed by the earth. A few non-profit groups opining to the Internet about all the good they're doing. Then I found them, or at least, the stories from one of the Soldiers, Private Cadena.

Private Cadena was clearly excited to be going out on his first real mission because the first few videos were of his company loading up in the Chinooks we sent them out in. There was a few of the obligatory aerial landscape shots from his helicopter vantage point. Then I got to the last few videos which looked more likely to be where they got lost.

It was mid-afternoon and I could see four of them trudging along the side of a ridge. It was clear why Cadena had even started recording this one.

""Wow, Sarge! Are those headstones? Why the fuck is there a graveyard all the way up here?""

His camera quickly panned over to 7 or 8 headstones all well worn by time, surnames etched into the center of the stone crosses were barely legible.

""I don't know, weirdo,"" a stern voice replied, ""don't you guys have graveyards in California?""

He turned around to face the rest of the group. Sergeant Childers, Specialist Waters, and Privates Green and Vandenburgh followed up the ridge in loose formation.

The deep, Alabama drawl of Private Green interrupted, ""Sarge, we got graveyards back home, but we do them normal. This here is weird.""

""Well I don't know, I'm not from here either. Just don't go messing with them, you need to show some respect for the dead. Besides, we're not here to sight see, we need to do this survey fast so that we can get back before dark.""

Cadena and a few of the others continue to poke around the gravestones hoping to find something interesting. Sergeant Childers crests the hill in the background and starts to set up her equipment.

""This one says they died in 1865, that was during the civil war,"" a voice off-camera mumbles. Cadena pans up to the thin form of Private Vanderburgh. ""You don't think...""

Green shoots the camera a look before the rest of the squad erupts into laughter before he's interrupted by a bloodchilling screech. From his camera audio it sounded like one of those elk calls that they make out west, but this is was more unnatural.

""Huh, what do you mean? Isn't that her?""

Cadena points his camera past where she had set up the surveying scope to a shadowy figure further up the ridgeline, before he ends the story abruptly.",1,1752547868.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Because it makes engagement easy. 

Say something triggering about either people and you have the world's #1 populated country and the world's #2 populated country engaging with your content.

I spent a long time in Mumbai. I spent a long time in Shanghai.

The average person on the streets in China could not care less Arunachal Pradesh just as the average person on the streets in Mumbai don't have any particularly strong views about Tibet.

Stereotypes fail the litmus test once they leave the internet rage-sphere. Indian guy going to China is not going to be eating unhealthy bbq street food at 2:00 AM in the morning from a food cart. They will be eating at one of thousands of vegetarian restaurants nearby buddhist temples. China man going to Mumbai is not going to be eating street food in slummed alleys. He will be going to restaurants in Mumbai malls.

It's all engagement bait. China man goes to Mumbai - does he have money? Okay, money good, welcome to India. Indian man goes to Shanghai - does he have money? Okay, money good. Welcome to China.

There's a big Tata office downtown on the east side of Shanghai next to a bunch of Chinese companies. Lunch time, the Indians and Chinese go out, they get coffee, they chat, they eat the same food... (well, okay, maybe not the same food). But you go to Tim Hortons and you see Indian guy and Chinese guy sitting next to each other - Chinese guy is not going ""AAH YOU SMELL"" and Indian guy is not making slitty eye gesture going ""Ching chong"". They're not idiots.

This isn't the 1970.

Hi all,

I’m 29 F, lives in Lhr (or at least recently trying to make peace with being here long-term), and honestly? I just want a genuine friend or two. Someone to rant with over coffee, maybe hit the gym together, decompress after a crap day without feeling like I’m being emotionally audited.

Making friends as an adult is weird. Everyone’s busy, guarded, or caught up in social dynamics that feel high-schoolish jealousy, weird competitiveness, subtle judgment, or transactional vibes. I’m not into that. I’m not perfect, but I try to be kind, supportive, and real. I’d love to meet someone who’s the same.

If you’re in Lahore, around my age, and feeling the same way drop a comment or DM. Let’s grab a coffee, or chat online first if that feels easier. Maybe friendship can still be simple and good.

Thanks for reading. (Also, this post is strictly for females) ",3,1752547485.0,LahoreSocial,8,1.0,False

I go to the gym about four times a week. I keep to myself, get my workout in, and head out. I'm not really there to socialize. But one day, while zoning out between sets, I noticed a guy nearby staring at me. Our eyes met — cue the classic polite smile-nod combo — and that became our unspoken ritual every time we crossed paths. He was always there.

Weeks passed, and one day after using the massage chairs in the rest area, I let out a dramatic, blissed-out sigh. When I opened my eyes, there he was — sitting next to me. I jumped a little, apologized for the noise, and he used that as his opportunity to strike up a conversation. “How was your workout? Leaving already? Do you usually come at this time?” I gave short answers, caught off guard, and left quickly, embarrassed.

Then life got in the way and I didn’t go back to the gym for about two months. When I returned, I noticed something interesting: every time I’d head for the massage chairs at the end of my workout, he’d suddenly wrap up his workout too — and end up right next to me. He always made conversation, asked personal questions, and seemed excited to learn more about me. When I told him I was Latina, he broke out in Spanish and started tossing in compliments. He casually asked if I had “any dependents” — a clumsy but obvious probe into my relationship and parental status.

Honestly? I was flattered. The attention felt good. He was charming and funny, and though I clocked that he was probably younger, I brushed it off. (I’m notoriously bad at guessing ages, and Asians always look young — sigh.)

For weeks, it became a flirty cat-and-mouse game. He’d greet me loudly in Spanish, toss me a compliment across the room, wink. It was all playful, light, and public — enough to draw the attention of people nearby. And yeah… I started to play along. I laughed, I flirted back, I sought him out a little.

Then came yesterday.

I was walking on the treadmill when he hopped onto the one next to me. We talked for an hour. And that’s when something shifted. The conversation got deeper… or so I thought. He started talking about astrology (which I love), guessed my sign (“What are you, an Aquarius or something?” — nailed it), mentioned music I liked, and knew my Chinese zodiac.

He complimented me nonstop. “You always look so nice. Your nails are immaculate. I can tell you take care of yourself.” And yet… every time I asked him something about his own life, he expertly dodged it. Evasive. Vague. Practiced.

Eventually, I got fed up. “I’m not continuing this conversation until you tell me how old you are and what you do for work.”

He smiled.

“I’m 19,” he said. “And I’m a sugar baby.”

I blinked. WHAT? (I could hear Sean yelling ILLEGAL from somewhere in my head)

He laughed and explained how it works — that he has five sugar mamas who each give him a monthly allowance. He broke it all down like it was just another career path.

Still joking, still flirty.

He asked for my number so we could grab a coffee. I gave it — mostly out of shock, and also because I didn’t want to cause a scene. I figured I’d text him later and shut it down gently.

But something didn’t sit right. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d been played. Especially being a 35 year old, chubby, average looking woman. So I opened up Tinder — an app I rarely use — and started scrolling through the profiles that had liked me over the past few months. And there it was.

A shirtless torso. Abs front and center. The profile said he was into short-term fun, spoke English, Tagalog, and Spanish, and that he was a Virgo. My gut said it was him. And then I remembered: my profile says I’m an Aquarius. It says my love language is giving/receiving compliments. It lists the music I love. It even says I’m into astrology.

Suddenly everything clicked.

This wasn’t a chance flirtation. This was a strategy. He had studied me. He used the gym as his hunting ground — not to work out (come to think of it, I’ve never actually seen him lift anything heavy), but to recruit. And I had been one of his targets.

He had been laying the groundwork for months. Complimenting me, making me feel seen, mirroring my interests. It wasn’t just attention — it was manipulation designed to sell me on his services without ever naming the price.

I won’t lie. It stung.

Already feeling a little down about myself, the realization that I had been viewed as a potential client, not a person, felt like a punch to the gut. It made me question everything — my desirability, my age, my worth.

But also? It was kind of hilarious.

So here’s what I plan to do.

Next time I see this baby-faced businessman, I’m going to return the energy — loud and proud, just like he was when he complimented me in front of a crowd. I’ll walk up and say:

“Hey big money! Doing business as usual? Closed any deals today? Or are you heading to the retirement home next? I still can’t believe you tried to add me to your portfolio!”

Will I actually do it? We’ll see.

But one thing’s for sure — I’m walking into that gym with my head held high. Not because of his attention, but because I saw through the illusion, laughed, and chose to walk away with my power (and dignity) intact.",1,1752547389.0,redditonwiki,1,1.0,False

TL;DR: Not going back for a very long time.

‘Two Bit Club’ just opened on June 19th in the Hotel Richemont. They are a concept from The Indigo Road Group, so sister restaurant to Oak Steakhouse, O-Ku, Indaco and more. We had high expectation for this restaurant because we enjoy the others. The menu emphasizes Vietnamese cuisine “using “French techniques”. The restaurant itself is lively with its open kitchen right at the front and looks nicely decorated inside and out.

This is a long one so hold tight…

We made reservations as per usually for restaurants here in Charleston, and they have a ‘Chef’s Counter’ available, which we enjoy, so booked it. Reservation was for 7:30, arrived at 7:25, we were told “it will be a minute because they were behind on the  7:15’s”, weird but whatever. So we wait in the front entrance area, watching 6 of the 10 chefs counter seats just sit there empty. We get seated at 7:40, our server doesn’t show up to greet us until 7:50 and at that time we order drinks and appetizers. We didn’t get our drinks until 8:17. At this point we knew we were in for a long night. The host/manager? came by and asked how things were and we told her we’d like to order dinner because we haven’t seen our server since ordering drinks and still haven’t even gotten appetizers. 8:22 got our first appetizer and then at 8:31 we got our second appetizer. It wasn’t until 9:20 that we got our first entree with a side dish. Then at 9:34 we finally got our second entree. We finally ended up leaving at 9:55. Two hours and thirty minutes doesn’t seem like that long of a time, reasonable for a 6-8 course meal but, for two courses, really?

The cocktails: drinks were tasty and unique, my wife got the sake martini and said I was delicious. I tried the Vietnamese coffee drink because it was unique, tasted great but came in a Collin’s glass had a whipped top and didn’t come with a straw, so was a little difficult to drink but tasted good just awkward.

The food: the appetizers were yellowtail crudo and mussels in a coconut broth. They were both Okay, nothing revolutionary. The biggest issue I had was with the baguette served with the mussels, it came as 2 pieces and one was burnt while the other was not toasted at all. The side of Brussels sprouts were dry, literally just fried Brussels sprouts with raw sesame seeds on top, I think they forgot the “carmelized fish sauce”. The entrees were duck ‘leg’(because “that’s what was available” not the duck breast like the menu said), it was deep fried and them topped with a honey hoisin sauce, which took away all of the crisp of the skin but was otherwise an okay dish. The market fish, tile fish, was so over cooked it was sawdust, and was the most pitiful thing I’ve ever seen it was probably only three ounces, I had one bite my wife had a bite and there was one bite left that we didn’t eat because it was so overcooked but at least the bok choy that came with it was okay. 

This is the condensed version; Take all of this as you see fit but we sat at the chefs counter, we have worked in restaurants, we saw everything being prepared literally right in front of us. We saw things sitting at the expo for way too long, one fish order I saw plated was literally three nuggets of fish, not even a whole piece. I could go on.

I hope for the employees sake that this is just because they are brand new and people are still learning? With so many other restaurants in town under the same group why not have people train at them maybe? And if they did, they do not have the operating procedures in order here yet. I believe one of the biggest issues is that they have way too small of a kitchen to push out food for ten counter seats, a bar, patio seating and possibly 15+ more inside tables. 

My last word will be that management did notice, took accountability of the problem and did comp our meal this night. I will say that, that acknowledgement did ease the sour taste in our mouth but by no means does it make us want to go back any time soon. If they stay open, we may go back in a year or so but only if we hear great things from people. ",2,1752547252.0,Charleston,0,1.0,False

Give me your hardest answers and truths; I probably need to hear them.

I can't write a good title for this at all. Strap in, redditors, this is a long one.

So the other day, I (M23) was going through my phone, clearing out old contacts I didn't need anymore, when I came across one that made me stop.

I was on a snow mountain resort trip over a year ago (pricey, but we had a deal package) with some friends in college. One of them brought this girl (F, around 22) along as a replacement for someone else (we already had that ticket paid). Let's call her Terra for this. Terra was nice, athletic, and a real nerd. She and I found lots of common interests and kinda got lost in geeky speals. To the point we got our snow boots mixed up one day. I don't exactly remember how I got her number, but we did have a group chat, and I may have added a few contacts I didn't have when everyone was saying who they were. Terra may have been among them. I did that so I knew who was talking. But here's one thing I do remember(kinda, it's fuzzy), on the way back we took 2 vans down the mountain. I ate too much and I felt sick and nauseous for the entire 8-hour journey home. I kept myself mostly under control that whole time, but it was embarrassing. I don't think Terra was on that van because I was thinking about asking her out once we arrived at the rendezvous that night. But after that fiasco, I just wanted to go home. A lot of it is blurry from there.



I kinda forgot about her until recently. I thought about texting her, but I thought that might be weird. Some random dude you knew for a few days ages ago, having your number doesn't sit right with me. But I didn't delete the number and went to bed. This morning, I opened Hinge, and I came across Terra's profile. Which made me remember I was thinking about asking her out back then. Now my mind won't let it go, so here are my thoughts currently.



First off, I've never dated anyone. I've liked lots of girls, but had to get over them in many ways. Rejected, other guys asking them before my ""chance"", and I'm bad at making my interest clear early on. Also, I haven't sent her a like, free rose/superlike, text, haven't, or whatever yet, so why am I thinking about this now?





Second. I also feel like we could've been great friends based on what I remember. I don't want to ruin that potential for a stupid idea.





Third. I'd like to go on record and say, I feel like I'm getting way too far ahead of myself and need to take a walk. Dating apps suck, and that's not gonna change. Mini rant over. But my question is, if I do text her number and find out I still might like her, how far in should I ""make things clear""? I've met up with girls before, and they didn't seem to think it was a date (e.g., coffee, small hike, etc), and by that point, it felt too late to tell them. So I didn't and just treated it like a normal hangout. It feels awkward to say ""I want to go on a date with you"" because it feels pushy.



All in all, I'm overthinking and am getting way too far ahead of myself over someone I don't even know. I need to probably let things progress naturally and dial it back, but I'd still appreciate hearing some thoughts.",1,1752546617.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Life-long atheist who has been feeling this intense draw to God and Christianity for about two months now… but I’m floundering and in need of direction. 

I’ve bought not one not two but four bibles in the last two months because they’re so different? I do have two of the same (NIV) translation because I found one second hand that has been heavily notated and it’s been fun reading and gaining insight into someone else’s journey and thoughts/questions through the Bible.

Probably a rookie move but I started “In the beginning…” because it felt like the best place to start. Finished Genesis, I’m halfway through Exodus and honestly having a great time (reading) my road block now is church. 

I’ve gone to two - both non-denominational. 

The first one I went to is in an actual church, stained glass windows wooden pews and they have communion at the end of the sermon. Soft rock band and a coffee bar in the back. 

The second is in an old fraternal order building and is a lot more casual than the first, no communion and pretty quick sermons, a video presentation and more yacht rock. They also have a coffee bar. 

This doesn’t feel like church to me. No shade on either of these churches they’re great people, the first feels more Church than the second especially with the length and depth of the sermons and communion but it’s just… ???? Not church? I guess?

What am I looking for friends? I’ve started looking into other churches in my immediate neighborhood as I would prefer to be able to walk to church. I have a Catholic, Lutheran and Presbyterian church near by but they’re a lot more Church than what I’ve experienced so far and I’m intimidated to be total honest. 

I truly don’t mean to be offensive but Catholicism confuses me because of the heavy focus on Mary, Presbyterian has a lot of views that I can agree with and some that I’m not sure about but not educated enough on, Lutheran feels like Catholicism but more Jesus focused (again complete ignorance here I’m just giving my current understanding)

And then there’s how many Orthodox? 

I have started watching the ten minute Bible hour church tour series and I’ve been learning a lot but also feel like I’m making my indecision even worse.

 A while back, I decided to add a shade structure in my backyard. I did tons of research and comparisons before finally landing on one pergola from Villardin that worked best for me. So I thought I’d share what I learned—hopefully it’ll save you some time and help you make the right choice too.

# 1. First Things First: Local Rules & Permits

Before you even think about buying anything, check if your area requires a building permit or has HOA (Homeowners Association) restrictions. In the U.S., a lot of neighborhoods have rules about height, color, even the material used.  
Also—don’t skip this—make sure there are no pipes, power lines, or drainage running underneath where you plan to build. Use the “Call 811” service before you dig. It’s free and might save you a lot of trouble.

# 2. Choosing the Right Type

At first, I couldn’t decide between an aluminum louvered pergola and a traditional gazebo. I love the look and feel of wood, but I ended up going a different direction.  
To help make sense of the options, I created a comparison chart showing pros and cons of different types—and why I passed on the wood gazebo. I also rated each based on my personal needs.

Since it rains a lot where I live, I immediately ruled out anything without a roof. But of course, you should choose something that suits your local climate and backyard vibe.  
Another big thing for me—I’m not great with maintenance. So I went for a structure that wouldn’t require regular upkeep. That’s how I ended up choosing an aluminum louvered pergola.

Everyone’s priorities are different, and where you live plays a big role too. Hopefully my comparison table helps you find something that fits you.

A few quick tips from what I learned:

* Wood looks beautiful, but it needs regular sealing and bug treatments.
* Aluminum pergolas are basically maintenance-free, and many offer motorized louvers so you can tilt the slats depending on where the sun is.
* Gazebos typically have a full roof and feel more enclosed, which isn’t ideal if you like open-air spaces.

# 3. Picking the Right Size

3.1. Leave enough space to move around. Make sure people can walk easily and doors aren’t blocked. As a rule of thumb, your pergola shouldn't take up more than one-third of your backyard—otherwise it might feel crowded and limit other uses like lawn games, flower beds, or a play area.

3.2. Think about how you’ll use it.

* Just looking for a cozy spot for coffee or shade? A 10x10 ft is plenty.
* Want to host family dinners, add a sofa, or even an outdoor kitchen? Go for at least 12x14 ft.

3.3. Consider the structure type.  
If you’re going with a fixed/permanent installation, it’s worth talking to a designer or contractor.

3.4. Look at your yard’s shape.

* Long, narrow yards? Try 8x14 ft or 10x16 ft rectangular options.
* Square or open backyards? You can go for 10x10 ft, 12x12 ft, or even mix and match multiple structures.

||

|Yard Size|Recommended Pergola Size|Recommendation Explanation|
|Approx. 10–20㎡ (about 100–200 sq ft)|8x8 ft or 10x10 ft|Compact setup, suitable for a coffee table or two chairs|
|Approx. 20–35㎡ (about 200–375 sq ft)|10x12 ft or 12x12 ft|Can comfortably fit a four-seat dining set or lounge area|
|Approx. 35–50㎡ (about 375–540 sq ft)|12x14 ft or 12x16 ft|Enough space for a complete dining/living/lounge zone|
|Over 50㎡ (over 540 sq ft)|12x20 ft, 14x20 ft, or multiple pergola combinations|Ideal for spacious outdoor kitchens + multifunctional zones|

If you’re unsure what size will fit, try marking it out on the ground with spray paint or painter’s tape. It really helps you visualize it in your space.

# 4. Weather Matters

As I mentioned, it rains a lot here—so I wanted something that could offer solid coverage. A fully covered gazebo or a convertible louvered pergola made the most sense for me.

If you live somewhere with hurricanes, you’ll want to make sure the structure is rated for strong winds. Look for wind resistance ratings on the product page (if it’s not listed, be cautious).  
Also consider snow load (for snowy areas) and UV protection (for sunny climates).

Some rough guidelines:

* Wind resistance: Most high-end aluminum pergolas can handle 8–12 levels on the Beaufort scale (around 100–150 km/h). If your area gets stronger winds, consider adding anchor bolts or going with a concrete base.
* Snow load: If you’re in the north, check if it supports 30–60 lbs/ft².
* Sun/UV protection: A UV-coated roof or canopy will help prevent sun damage and material aging.

# 5. Long-Term Value

Here’s the thing—I didn’t just want a pergola. I was investing in my backyard lifestyle.

I’m hoping this thing lasts me 10, 20, even 30 years. So instead of going for the cheapest option, I focused on what gave me the best long-term value.

Try this simple formula:  
Estimated Years of Use ÷ Total Price = Cost per Year  
For example: a $3,500 pergola that lasts 15 years only costs \~$233/year. Way better than spending less now and replacing it after a few years.

# 6. Shipping & Installation

I really wanted everything to arrive in one go—and for it to be packed well enough to survive the trip. Some brands offer shipping protection, which is great. But honestly, solid packaging is even more important. I’d rather not wait another two weeks for a replacement part.

Installation-wise, it depends on your skills and patience. Some folks love a good DIY project. Me? I prefer something simple, with clear instructions and maybe even a video. Bonus points for brands that offer that.

Tips for a smoother install:

* Look for step-by-step manuals with pictures
* Check if the brand has a YouTube video walk-through
* Some brands offer pre-assembled panels that save a ton of time

Before you order, double-check:

* Product dimensions and weight (will it fit through your gate or doorway?)
* If liftgate service is needed for delivery (for heavy items)

Putting up a pergola isn’t something you decide on a whim. It involves your budget, your climate, your yard, and your lifestyle. But once you get it right? It can totally transform your outdoor space and bring you years of happiness.

If you’ve gone through a similar process, or have tips of your own, I’d love to hear them in the comments. Let’s build better backyards—together!

The ideal size depends on the intended use.Smaller towels are suitable for wiping down counters and spills, while larger towels are better for drying glassware or handling hot items.

**Absorbency and Quick Drying:** These two aspects are critical for bar towels. High absorbency ensures that spills and messes are quickly cleaned up, while quick drying prevents the build-up of bacteria and unpleasant odors. Towels made from ring-spun cotton or microfiber are notably effective in these areas.

The ability to withstand repeated washing cycles without losing their shape, color, or absorbency is a key factor in determining their long-term value.

**Color and Design Options:** while functionality is paramount, the aesthetics of bar towels can also contribute to the overall ambiance of an establishment. Many suppliers offer a range of colors and designs,including solid colors,stripes,and custom logos. Choosing towels that complement the bar's decor can enhance its visual appeal.

**Bulk Packaging and Pricing:** When purchasing bar towels in bulk, consider the packaging and unit price. Ideally, the towels should be individually wrapped or neatly bundled to prevent contamination during storage and transportation.

1m05uqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordOfOurRagnarok/comments/1m05uqm/verdict_of_ragnorok_chapter_3_golden_nostalgia/,Verdict Of Ragnorok Chapter 3- Golden Nostalgia,"Nyame floats towards the Belgian King. Not carelessly, furious, barely controlled rage in his voice. His voice echoed around the silent arena and up to the gods, no louder than a whisper but every sense of command that a chief god wields.

”You dare to subjugate my people and then when we attempt to stop this root of evil, you claim that you have the right to rule heaven and me? Some gaul you beasts of sin have! We were right to decide for your death. I will weep at your death. Not out of sadness or sorrow, but from pure and true joy. My shame of being usurped shall be undone for just a moment. ” 

As Nyame floats above the Belgian King whose whip lashes out towards the floating god, as a spark of violet light travels across the whip from the Belgian King. 

[Duistere Vergelding]

As the whip rockets towards the chained god. Nyame conjured a wind to push this back, only for it to return at increased speed. Eventually, it strikes his cheek and then returns to the outstretched king basking in the anger of the crowd, from both men and gods. 

Nyame hits the ground with a thud, blood spilling forth like a geyser despite the small wound. 

Leopold slowly wanders over to the staggering taking his time, not threatened as he slowly shambles over to Nyame, putting his steel toed boot on the face of the god. 

“Lick it or I will make you suffer just like your so-called people you abandoned. It is your fault and yours alone. You abdicated the throne. You are no fallen angel but a devil who has risen to challenge a good and great king! You belong where you are. Being below someone else’s boot feels right doesn’t it, you devil? Of course it does! It is a good ruler’s boot, I will treat you well, however, since you have attempted to usurp my throne I must punish you as any good ruler must! So decrees the King of Belgium!”

How did Leopold turn Belgium from a small country lacking power and authority to an imperialist empire? Greed, Envy and Wrath.  


How did the strongest Chief god become like this? What changed? Who usurped him? 


[The Coast of Congo, 1885] 

Leopold sat down, his African counterpart across from him. Of course two good kings can talk about an alliance in peace.

Leopold speaks up, losing the brutal nature of his voice and instead a more friendly tone. 

“So this is how we operate. We are willing to help you in exchange for resources and goods. I know you have some guns but these are much quicker, deadlier, more compact.” 

Leopold pulls out a revolver. 

A single shot rings in the tent and then, uneasy silence. 

A second passes; Then, two. 

The former king falls face first onto the ground, a blank expression over his chocolate brown face. 

A rush of people run in, coffee colored guards siting the stationary King. 

All of a sudden, a rush of bullets hit the king. Yet, he stands holding his shoulder with the sample of raw rubber. 

At that moment Leopold had made a discovery. He was able to take kinetic energy and redirect it through himself, like rubber,  at risk of too much damage causing him to thin and lose flesh.

The pain vanished like the mind of the former African king. 

Some ethereal force told him to shoot. To kill people. They had opened fire first. One shot caused a man’s head to explode into millions of pieces. The rest rushed in, and as they struck, he took it. Pain made him feel human, more so than the need to be better, more powerful all so his people could be better.


And so, leading the charge Leopold imposed a grisly rule on the Congo. 

Leopold took and took. Not to help Belgium primarily at least, but to ensure he was safe and to sponsor his recklessness. He could care less about his people but to have more power was to be bigger economically and in terms of size and factories. 

All of these exports were just barely anything. Leopold hoarded these materials to help him to ensure the cooperation of his friends. 

[Valhalla, About 150000 BCE] 

Nyame, the leader of the gods, sitting on the throne that we today know Zues to sit on. The gods have just voted to spare humanity, overwhelmingly so. As the gods file out. One single god, remains, bowed before the stairs up to the throne. The meek spider god, unbound, pleads

”My lord, He who is holier than all, please hear my humble plea. I am just a gnat to a deity as grand as you.” 

Perhaps, Anansi would have continued had he been allowed. But Nyame cared not for this useless flattery. A small gust of wind blows the god of lies words back. Nyame adds his two cents. 

“You are asking for a favor. You think I would care. I hold your respect in two ways. Firstly, I am your chief. Secondly, I am the ruler of all Valhalla. I know you try to play games to gain power. You want to “help humanity” I assume and gain my favor. You want the power of stories. It is clear within your eyes. I could deny you. But, we have voted to keep humanity alive. I will entertain you. Attempt to steal these powers and I will punish you. You have seventy two hours for these three tests: The Leopard Osebo, The Python Onini, and The Mmoatia.” 

Anansi to his credit, didn’t talk any longer. As Nyame floated away, Anansi began to run around heaven and earth to collect his prize. He did and thus humanity gained power over stories. 

————————————————————————-

So how did Nyame lose the throne? 

A planned mutiny. 

Odin and Zues eventually gained power and wanted to rule Valhalla. Power was too much of a temptation. So, the mighty all father’s of Norse and the Greek pantheons were out for blood and power. Nyame, was simply the poor god who was the planned system. 

Nyame is the champion of Africa and as the gods decree, the mortal world shall reflect it

When they challenged him, the one above all, he let it happen. He knew that there was no way they could win. Not out of the ideas spawned by Lucifer, but by training and the large amount of power wielded by Nyame. He created a part of the Earth and the weather bends to his whim.


[Arena, The past] 

The gods nervously sat. Never before had a god challenged Nyame. The disgusting, filthy usurpers walked in. Then, it started. Thunder blazing from even higher, striking the gods down. Their forms lay on the ground, smoking, near corpses as Nyame merely walked in enraged. The very sky, Nyame himself, quaked with rage as hail the size of eighteen wheelers fell towards the gods, burying them in ice. 

A shiver fell over the crowd as a small beam of light slowly began to melt away as a battered bruised, death warmed over Odin slowly aimed Gungnir at Nyame. The beam flew towards the god of the sky, only for a hurricane to spin the beam of light and ice towards the traitor. Zeus launched a punch towards Nyame only to be spun around and crash into the fellow rebel.

It was obvious from the first moment. The rebels stood no chance. No one would blame Nyame for smiting them. Not even their brothers and sisters could justify their response. They willingly challenged him, in front of the entire court. This was always going to be a fight. 

Zeus tried to bend the winds to his aid but instead received a flaming storm of heat and sand unto him sending the Greek god flying about like a tumbleweed in the arid desert wind. The pure heat making the supposed god of winds fall over from heat and scorn.



Nyame lounged around, looking bored, with more skin on his small frame. An odd bead bracelet glimmers on his hand. If one were to look closely, they would see weird and odd symbols engraved on each bead. This bracelet is no fashion sense, but one of pure, raw power. His akindra, with the face up bead showing. (Look it up you coward)



The symbol of Gye Nyame’s power. It glowed gold and blue from use. And then suddenly turned purple then black as a single link of a chain is wrapped on his leg. This chain then began to multiply rapidly and despite the entire repertoire of his it wrapped tighter and tighter. 

That was it. Nyame was the ruler of Valhalla no more. The other gods, the cowards they were, fell in line and as the mortal world mimicked the divine the people of Africa became “lesser” to those claiming descendance from Norse or Greek rulers. 


[Present Day, Greek Box] 

Athena glances backwards, as the spider god Anansi is gone. She expected so. The spider wove lies just like Arachne. But how could one escape that rope? It was no simple chain. Forged from the pure darkness from Ouranos and used by the dwarves to bind Fenrir. How could one break free? Anansi is not as strong as the wolf. Definitely not. So, there was only one way he eclipsed the wolf; Trickery. A small simple spider esc cufflink lies where he was with shattered chains. 

Hold up. She knew what this was. An Akindra! A symbol of a god which would be a calling card, a taunt to her and Zeus. Of course he would. Wait! Anansi gave power to humanity even if done so by accident but he did it nonetheless. He has human storytellers, his chosen people, Anansiseem, so mayhaps he too voted against their destruction. She did after all, after witnessing the both good and bad of a journey, from Troy to Ithaca. 

A whisper no louder than a small rustling of leaves as Anansi steps forward in a poche silken suit covered in blue and gold with his Akindra as a cufflink, small spindly legs dance rhythmically yet silently from the suit. A spineret appears from where the two piece suit meshes in the back . His hair, tied back into messy braids. 

“The winds of change have begun to blow. Embrace it or get swept away by the gale” 

He fades back into the darkness, waiting, plotting. Perhaps Humanity had just gained a powerful but wily ally or perhaps there was something more threatening than Ragnarok.

Nyame flicked his hand as Leopold flew back, dropping his whip. Nyame slowly shambled up as Leopold smirked. 

“That whip was just the tip of the iceberg now get ready to feel the pain of a full hell”

I’ve recently picked up a fellow ode gen 2 grinder and am wondering what would be a good option that pulls shots and steams. Two of my siblings are baristas and own their own shop so they’ve got a lot of experience.

Something that could potentially be used in a coffee cart setup seems reasonable considering how much use it would get. If a larger budget seems justified please let me know what and why.

**A bit about me**

My Myers Briggs is ENTJ, I am a Libra, Air Sign, 5'10'' (add 1-2 inches with boots/hokas), spiritual but not religious, 190 lbs, two tattoos, curly black hair (I'll never go bald), physically fit but could stand to lose a little, and my shoulders are my greatest asset. If I had to explain my personality in a nutshell, I would like to believe I'm very structured (I like my routines) and amorous in thought.

A couple of things I like are to watch plays (Cirque du soleil), read books (currently ""So Meant To Be"" by Megan Quinn,""Diary of Anne Frank"", ""1001 Questions to Ask before you get married""), drama movies (It Ends With Us was really intense in the theatre, I thought it was a romantic comedy), horror movies (Smile 2 was awesome) or anything really.

I hike a lot and love traveling up a big mountain occasionally (most I have scaled is 14,000 feet). I have traveled to more than 20+ countries and still going strong to many more planned out in the future. I'm a massive foodie and I love eating lots of different foods as well as cooking and shopping for weird ingredients at the grocery store. I do enjoy a good coffee on the weekends though from a new coffee shop I can find. I have a fun career in science and always working on interesting projects that would be fun to share with you and talk to you about as we get to know each other.

I'm a good listener and sometimes will talk your ear off about something I am passionate in or just be comfortable listening to you chat for hours.

**What I am looking for**

I am looking for a girl friend to go on fun dates (The pool, tanning, dinner, hiking, to the gardens, horse riding, salsa dancing, and everything under the sun with). I'm not comfortable with long distance relationships to that means you would have to be close by or at least live in Texas.

The age range would have to be somewhere of 27-33, I think too much younger or older we would not be in the same life stage or want the same things out of life. I do want kids in the future but that is for another conversation. I do like ""party"" but not in the same manner I used to when I was 21. I want someone that is ready for things like wedding parties, dressing up, the occasional rave and all the other drama that might ensue.

Maybe you like lots of different food, cooking with someone, and tattoos as well, and it would be fun to do it together.",1,1752545903.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1m05tcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m05tcv/my_sunflower/,My Sunflower,"I remember the first time I saw you, christ. I don't think I will ever forget the first time I saw you. You looked right at me, and you were smiling from something your friends said. I knew from that moment I was screwed because I was hooked on that smile. I just knew I had to speak to you, I searched for any reason at all I could think of any reason at all, and I asked you what the time was even though I had my phone in hand. 

I think you knew the time was not the reason I asked, but you humoured me anyway. Your accent was like honey to the ears, if I wasn't hooked on your smile, my heart sure knew something was up from that voice. I never believed in love at first sight but then again when I saw you, I did a double take so I guess love at second sight must be a thing. 

Though it had only been a few moments, I felt like I could have been lost in time with you forever and still felt like it was not long enough, giving you my phone number was the smartest decision I ever made. I waited for your text, I kept looking at my phone with so much anticipation my family asked me if everything was okay, as the day went by I began to fear, what if I had made a mistake and said a digit of my number wrong? But then you messaged that evening. Considering it was only a message that comprised of "":))"" it was still the best message I had ever received. 

We started to text every single day, pretty much all day. We would send voice notes, and pictures, you would share with me little things about your life about how your cousins cat would make biscuits only on you. About the book you were reading, how you liked your coffee. I yearned to see you in the flesh again because once would never be enough and you asked me when I would come to see you. 

It was what I was hoping for, the indication you felt the same way I did. That night I didn't sleep I was so excited, a month later we were both in the netherlands together. The coffee shops, the museums, the discussions on books, the endless conversations. Me teaching you about British colloquialisms, and then you teaching me about Russian literature you had studied. We discussed philosophy and life, hopes and dreams. That time you sat by the cafe window, your long way brown curls sat down onside of you, as you looked over to me and that smile spread across your face, that was when I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. 

But the week came to an end, I watched you walk away and I felt like a part of me went with you. A flight home each later, we were back on face time, talking as if we had not seen each other for weeks. Let alone hours, you told me about the lady who spoke to you on the flight home and how she had been on her own adventure. You told me you wanted to be like her one day and never be too old to travel, I told you, you would be because you were someone who could never be caged, and never should be. 

A month later, we were in cappadocia, we sat at that little restaurant where they made that flatbread you loved and watched the hot air balloons in the sky. You said it was the most beautiful sight you had ever seen, I said it was the second to me. You asked what the first was, and I said your smile. You smiled, as you always did but your smile for me was different. You were giddy, and excited. You didn't smile like that for anyone else and it made it special, because that was your smile for me. That night, after we made love, we told each other that we loved one another, as you laid your head on me running your hand gently up and down my chest I had never felt more complete, more whole, more fulfilled in my life. I knew that in this life and the next, it would always be you who my heart yearned for. 

You called me your British Bear, I called you my Russian Sunflower, you asked me why a Sunflower. I told you that when I was a kid my grandmother grew a sunflower and it was the most marvelous and wonderful thing I had ever seen in my life, until you. You cuddled further into my chest. A few magical days later, we both went home. 

You wanted me to visit Russia to meet your family, two flights, a taxi, and a car journey later I was sat with you in their home. My Russian barely conversational, you acting as the translator though your mother told you that our connection needed no translation. Your father was as you said, the silent type. But yet at the same time he didn't bury me in the garden so I think I won his approval. Especially with the Tea and Jaffa cakes I had brought him.

Your brothers English was as bad as my Russian, but between google translate and him, I managed to ask your dad permission to marry you. I think the fact your dad said ""If you will have her, may god be with you"" speaks testimony to what a strong woman you had become, and that you were. My sarcastic bookworm with a fiery no-nonsense approach. That night, back in your apartment, drinking red wine with you, while we sat and you tried to feed me liver then wondered with great confusion why I pulled strange faces after you told me what it was, that was harmony. 

The next day we visited the fine arts museum and walked, and walked, the endless walking that day, I'm still convinced I would be 6ft had I not walked so much. But time with you was always precious and so the pain was always worth it. We were out with your cousins, and friends for dinner that night. They knew my plans, you kept asking why I was so nervous and I just said its because I want to make a good impression, you didn't believe me because I already spoken to your friends before but you didn't realise that the person I wanted to make a good impression on the most was you. I have done many scary things in my time, but proposing to you, my stomach was doing more somersalts than any acrobatic act in the history of the world. You seemed so shocked, yet so pleased. But for you, I would have moved heaven and earth just to make that smile appear. So the fact that little bit of clear rock did it so effortlessly made it all worth it to me. 

But then I had to go home, and the best part of me was left with you. The sun did not shine as bright, the moon did not appear as clear, and the stars did not sparkle like they did when you were around. Food did not taste as good, and no drink quenched my thirst either. So I was prepared to do whatever it took, be it I moved to Moscow, you moved to the UK like you had wanted to, or we moved somewhere entirely new for both of us. Then Covid hit, it meant neither of us could travel so easily, but hey where there was a will there was a way and there was no way either of us were prepared to give in. 

It hit you hard, my cageless bird that could not fly. I remember our 3am phone calls where we would talk and talk, I listened to you tell me a thousand times how much you hated it, you got snappy and aggressive with me, but it was okay because it was what you needed. I couldn't touch you, I couldn't smell you, I couldn't taste your lips, but it was okay because I still had the most beautiful part of all of you, your mind. 

We struggled on through the first 9 months, you had began to accrue debt from your work hours being slashed. You feared the debt would mean you couldn't leave the country, So I did what I swore to always do, take care of you and sent you money. Neither of us had much but the bills were paid and we had each other. We were both happy, you told me you had never felt more safe. To me, my money was your money. Because a life together meant sharing everything I had. You were everything, I had.

Then you got sick, the cancer tore through you like fire through a dry forest. It hurt me so much knowing you were suffering so much, knowing there was nothing I could do to help you. Your friends had become my friends, they gave me updates when you could not, and then you were gone. Unable to carry on the fight. It wasn't your fault, you were tired, sick, and there was nothing they could do. 

These years later, I'm still a shell of who I was when I was with you. The pain still weighs on me like an anvil on my chest. But recently, I decided to rebuild. I may never have what we once had, again. In fact, I don't think I actually want anyone else, I tried this last year, to put myself out there again. I wouldn't try to compare them to you, but when you have touched the moon, how can you ever accept the sky is the limit?

But never the less, my beautiful, funny, kind, sarcastic, loving, passionate, wild Sunflower, cageless bird it is time for me to uncage myself, and instead live a full, loving, happy life. I can no longer afford to give up on life again as we face new demons on the horizon. You turned a boy into a man, and in turn this man will honour your life in the best way I can, by sharing the love and light you once gave me with all those who will come into my sphere. 

Forever, and always, yours.

I’m spiraling and don’t know what to do except get some people who are also going through divorce to hopefully hold me accountable and give me advice for what to do moving forward.
General information:
My (26f) husband (28m) and I have been together for almost 7 years and he just asked for a divorce 3 weeks ago. I’m spiraling and heartbroken. My husband and I met while he was over here on a j1 visa and while he came here for the first 2 summers, the rest of the first 5 years was me flying back and forth from the U.S. to Turkey. About 2 (a few months after we got legally married in Turkey) years ago his visa got approved and he moved to the U.S. to be with me. I already had a lease with my friend that I had signed prior to him getting the visa so unfortunately it wasn’t exactly like he hoped as we were not living alone. He also took up a job as a server which I know he hated and my heart broke for him because he was a lawyer in Turkey and I wanted him to be happy with a career that fulfilled him. We always talked about what states we could move to in the U.S. for him to practice law and after a lot of debate and looking things up we decided that one day it would be New York, but not now because we were just getting established and had little to no savings. After about a year and 8 months of living together, while I was on a girls trip, he called and said he was having a hard time finding a job here and he wanted to apply to New York. I told him I wasn’t ready to move to New York but I supported him if it would boost his confidence (looking back I hate myself for this decision). He got a job offer and I asked him not to take it. He promised me we wouldn’t do long distance again and I was a few months out from a big bonus. I cried daily and he wore me down. I said I would join him after I got my bonus and began applying for jobs. We started looking into apartments in NYC to buy and after I dropped him off (mid-January) 3 weeks after the initial job offer and I began driving back and forth ever other week after my 3 12-hour shifts. This drive was about 6.5 hours of me driving solo and it always left me drained and stressed. Which didn’t seem to concern him as he always tried to push for intimate time within 2 hours of me arriving. I thought we were working on things but I kept getting more and more depressed and I know that this upset him. We were drifting but he would call me daily and we would gossip or watch a show together or just talk. I know he didn’t like calling me everyday and I told him he didn’t have to but he made himself do it. He and I had some fights because we shared locations and he didn’t like that I had his because it was controlling but he had mine for safety reasons? Anyways all of his coworkers were females and he would go out to bars with them which I totally supported because they are all Turkish and I know he missed his community. I just asked that he called me when he left but I used to hate when he’d say 10 min and then call me 50 min later. Mind you this is the man that didn’t like me having one man in with the group of women I hang out with. Anyways after no luck on the housing or job market for me in my field, he decided it would be best to come back to where I am to pursue his llm before sitting for the bar. 3.5 weeks before he was supposed to come back he and I discussed getting a divorce because we were fighting and he said his female coworker bought him a necklace, which he brought up because he felt uncomfortable and I said I was uncomfortable too to which he flipped sides and started defending her. He went to our storage unit and started packing his stuff before calling me multiple times to beg that we work on this. When I got there he cried and we hugged and thought about divorcing but then decided to work on things because we love each other and don’t want to let this go. So he went back to nyc (this was only his second trip to where I am in 6 months and both were 3 day trips) and that Wednesday he gave his notice and I was so happy. I was getting my husband back. We would buy a house and start going to the gym together like we enjoyed and going to the movies and out on the lake plus our late night trash tv binges with our ice cream pints. I was so excited, I missed and loved him so much. 2 days later he said he was 50/50 about coming back and the next day he said he talked to a family member and one of his coworkers and he decided that he loved me but not my partnership. I broke. I hate how bad I broke down but I cried and couldn’t eat. It was a shock. I tried to bargain, to plead with him. But the man I’ve been talking with since is different to the man I married. I’m heartbroken and I miss him. It’s so hard when all I want to do is call him and chat like old times. I talked to him almost every single day for 6 years and 11 months. I’m still in shock.
Things of concern that I can’t stop ruminating on:
- when we were together he didn’t like that the apartment was messy but other than dishes and trash it was all my responsibility to do. He did cook his own food but that’s because my schedule made it so I almost never ate at home.
- We did fight regularly but it was usually over the fact that he had no respect for my physical boundaries. I didn’t want to be intimate within an hour or two of waking up everyday. Especially for after 3 or 4 back to back 12+ hour shifts. I also didn’t like that he’d always play with my hair and ended up ripping out strands everyday multiple times a day. I didn’t like that he’d try to grab my fat after I told him I was self conscious and after he’d freak out about what we were eating, I didn’t feel comfortable taking off my shirt but he’d always insist. He’d also touch me in and I said I felt uncomfortable with and he never listened. Sometimes he would say it’s just the way he was, or it was a language barrier or he forgot. Mind you this man is fluent in English.
- He was also addicted to adult content which I explained I felt uncomfortable with and he said he felt horrible for being addicted and that it was wrong according to his religion but he would also gaslight me that he didn’t say that he was watching it right after he told me. I felt uncomfortable with my body (ik low self esteem) and it didn’t help that he watch a ton of that stuff and then also he and his family would make comments about my body.
- He’s hit me 3 times. Once lightly in warning that he didn’t like something once across the side of my head because I tossed clothes and a backpack to my right where he was sitting and I guess he bent down to pick up a piece of clothing that fell off his lap when I tossed the backpack and it hit him in the face. I really do feel bad about this but I wasn’t even facing him and I had no idea he bent over to pick something up. When he brought his hand down on the side of my head by my ear it hurt and I was scared. And the third time he hit my arm after I attempted to close a door during an argument and he stuck his foot in. I didn’t mean to close it on his foot and I had no idea he would put his foot in the doorway. I wrote off the last two things because I know he was abused as a child and he was hurt and I felt guilty even though I hadn’t meant to hurt him. 
- He would say little things like “finally you do something” or “you should stay home and clean instead of going out with friends” when I would do the deep cleaning each week (bathrooms, vacuuming (we didn’t wear shoes inside and that’s why we didn’t do this more often), general tidying, washing the counters and stove, etc.
- He would do sweet things like cook breakfast and make me coffee but I cooked us lunch on my days off and generally tried to make him a big baked good to last the week since I know that he liked that. 
- I always compromised on religion and cultural differences. I read the Quran, I fasted for Ramadan, I through an Eid party with people we know so he wouldn’t feel alone. But he couldn’t even look up Christmas and I was bummed when I told him about the stockings I was doing for other people and I didn’t get one.
- He said I don’t respect him because I don’t obey him.
- Even with all of these things he was my partner and I love and miss him. 
- He told mutual friends that I forced him into law but that’s still what he wants to pursue.
- Things I regret: calling him names when he would push my boundaries or ignoring me when I was communicating that something was making me uncomfortable and saying that I don’t like the way he shows love when he insisted that’s where his lack of physical boundaries came from.
- I can’t imagine the rest of my life without him.
- I miss our friendship and comfort.

so last night i decided to take an edible because i had today off, and i hoped it would help me sleep earlier and better. i’ve had these same ones, same bag before but not for a while. well, i wake up this morning feeling anxious as hell about being productive but i try to start my day anyways. i take a walk for coffee, i come back and im still incredibly anxious, and starting to realize this feels different. i feel like something really bad is happening. i try to clean up my place in short spurts but the overwhelming anxiety is still there, so i take a break and go to homegoods. after homegoods in my car, feeling dizzy/spacey and still anxious. get home, and i can barely get anything done because it feels like my heart is fucking pounding out of my chest. i try to lay down and i find a breathing exercise that might help my heart rate.

i start to feel a little better!! my partner visits and i walk to the grocery store since i didn’t feel well enough to get groceries earlier. i feel good that i moved my body. i make a light dinner, but as soon as i take the first few bites, i start feeling sick. cue at least two hours of thinking im gonna lose what took me like an hour to cook. ive been laying down ever since and just starting to feel decent enough.

i barely cleaned up my apartment, i didn’t get any of my important tasks done like touching up my resume, and my next day off is friday, when i wont even have half the day available still. i know i dont have it nearly as bad as some people i follow but it still fucking sucks to deal with. i didn’t even have the mental or physical energy to do my hobbies while laying down. i’m just starting to have days like this where my symptoms are physically impairing me to this degree, and it’s hard to accept. it just sucks and i can’t wait until my first appointment with my new doctor next week, where i can bring all of these symptoms up and hopefully get some sort of plan going.

Lately, 2 people had already appeared shocked, and somewhat judging? After finding out that I don't drink coffee. (I once got told 'that's a sad life'. Lol.) To which in my defense, it's merely taste preference.

Also, I don't want to drink coffee just to 'fit In'. Where generally is the judgement from? It's pretty simple to be a problem, so why does it appear like one to others?

When I woke up in the morning and saw that she wasn’t in bed, my first thought was that she’d gotten up before me and went to the store. It wasn’t until the evening that I realized she’d left me a voicemail in the middle of the night.

It was a short message, less than ten seconds. But when I think about it now I think that most of the worst things that ever happen to you happen in ten seconds or less. Probably most of the good things too. Ten seconds is enough time for a lot to happen.

I know it took me less than ten seconds to fall in love when I saw Symone for the first time. Sitting by herself in the corner of the coffee shop I worked at, reading of all things. Beautiful jet black hair, a soft face, and round glasses.

Like any straight college aged guy, it was normal for me to give some glances to pretty girls that walked in while I was working. But normally that’s all it was, a quick glance then back to work. I never thought that I would be so unprofessional as to flirt with a customer, but for the first and only time in my three years working at the coffee shop, I walked over to this beautiful girl and introduced myself.

We hit it off immediately. We talked about books, our hatred for annoying old people (we both worked in customer service), and found out that we were going to the same college, were both English majors, and we even had some of the same professors.

Months later, she told me that the moment she realized she was going to give me “at least one date” was when I told her how lucky I felt to have a professor as knowledgeable and passionate as Dr. Ridge.

You see, Dr. Ridge was perhaps the most made-fun-of professor in the history of education. During the first day in every one of her classes, Dr. Ridge would show a short PowerPoint presentation over her 17 bunnies, each with names like Dante, Raven, and Beowulf. That wasn’t the embarrassing part—the embarrassing part was that she had a FaceBook made for each one of her bunnies, and they all interacted with each other. Some of them were married and would post about their relationship struggles, only to argue online; some of them were dealing with injuries or illnesses and posted poems about their pain.

As you can guess, this did not go over well in freshman level classes. However, to hear Symone tell it, the fact that I looked past Dr. Ridge’s quirks to see how intelligent and kind she was, proved that I was worth a shot.

Fast forward to the day of our two year anniversary. I’m starting my last semester of college and Symone is only a few months behind me. We were at the nicest restaurant I could afford, talking about our future together for the thousandth time: we planned to get married shortly after she graduated and then move somewhere far away from either of our families. I was going to teach high school English while working on my novels, and she was going to pursue her PhD and eventually become a literature professor.

We finished dinner in high spirits and decided to go for a walk around the city. The ground was covered in snow and ice and the street lights reflected off the ground; the way that Symone lit up made her look like an angel. She was the center of the world.

We went through a local bookstore. My best friend Tommy was the clerk and gave me an employee discount on the book of Robert Frost poems I bought for Symone. When we were checking out, an old woman in line told us that we were about the cutest couple she’d ever seen.

“You look just like my husband and I did,” she said, then looked at me directly. “Don’t ever let her go.”

“I won’t,” I promised.

Drunk in love, we meandered through the city until we wound up at the underground subway station. In twenty minutes there was a train going to a place in the city we’d never been through before, so we decided, screw it. We’d go check it out for no other reason other than to say that we’d experienced all the city had to offer.

We spent our downtime sitting on a bench and playing sticks with our fingers (if you don’t know how to play, Google it). Symone was always a much quicker thinker than me. She was better at chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, anything that took brain power. She had just beaten me for the fifth game in a row when I noticed the group of guys on the other side of the tracks.

They were huddled together, but when I looked up they all had their heads turned, staring directly at us. They noticed me and turned back to each other. I figured they were just some funny guys making jokes about us sitting all lovey dovey on the bench. Maybe they were checking Symone out.

Either way, they were on the other side of the tracks. They were the furthest thing from a threat at the time. That’s why I felt fine excusing myself to the bathroom a few minutes later.

As I was washing my hands, I heard a scream and instantly recognized it as Symone’s voice. I sprinted out and found her circled by all three men. The tallest one held Symone in a headlock so tight that he was lifting her off the ground. The other two were looking around for witnesses.

When they saw me they barreled toward me. Symone let out a muffled cry.

For a second time slowed. I remember thinking to myself how incredible of a situation this was. Surely this would all just stop somehow, right? This type of thing didn’t just happen.

But it was happening, and the two men were only a few feet away from me. I had no chance in a fight. Even if it was just one of them, they were nearly twice my size. The one thing that I thought I might have over them, was speed.

Like a wide receiver juking a defender, I feigned as if I was going to run away. Instead, I cut back and ran towards the gap between the leftmost man and the tracks, narrowly escaping a five-foot fall to the bottom. He reached for me, but I lowered my shoulder and barreled through his outstretched arm. I cut to the right and slammed into Symone and her assailant at full speed, bringing all three of us crashing to the ground.

I ended up on top of the tall man and elbowed him in the ribs. As I rolled away, I heard a loud thud and a shriek. One of the other men had tried to grab Symone, but had instead pushed her into the tracks about six feet below us.

I tried to stand, but then the man grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me so that I fell on my stomach and cracked my jaw so hard that I saw stars.

I kicked my feet blindly and connected with his stomach. I got free and halfway to my feet before I was grabbed and put into a headlock.

The grip was so tight I was scared my throat was going to collapse. I flailed about and clawed at hands I couldn’t see, but as deep as my nails went, the grip never loosened—until we heard the horn.

The train was coming.

Symone’s on the tracks.

I was thrown to the ground and a heavy boot stomped on my back and knocked the wind out of me. “Let’s get the fuck out of here,” one of them yelled. By the time I could stand they were running away.

Symone frantically clawed at the wall, trying to get up out of the trench, but she was a short girl, barely five feet tall. Although she could reach up to the platform above her, the edge was curved, making it too difficult for her to get a firm hold.

I reached my arms down and tried to pull her up myself, but I just didn’t have the strength. Maybe if we had a little more time we could have worked together, but the train sounded so close. It was going to burst through the tunnel any second.

Once we saw the train, there wouldn’t be enough time to react. There wasn’t enough room down there for her to escape its girth.

I allowed myself half a second to close my eyes and think and think and think. I pictured the train bursting through the tunnel and Symone screaming my name, standing against the edge of the tracks as it ran into and through her. I thought about the sound of her bones being crushed, about never seeing her again, about spending the rest of my life without her.

I could try again to grab her, but the result would simply be the same: her getting crushed while we held hands.

There was no getting her up in time. There was only one scenario where I saw her surviving:

“Go to the middle of the tracks and lay down,” I said.

Without hesitation, she let go of my hands, ran to the tracks, and laid down flat on her stomach with her arms firm against her sides.

Just then, the train emerged from the tunnel. Her right arm was resting exactly where the wheels of the train would run.

“A little left!” I screamed.

She squirmed a half inch to the left just as she disappeared underneath the train.

She screamed so loudly that I could hear her over the rumbling. She screamed and screamed until the train came to a complete stop. For a long second I heard nothing except for the train doors opening and passengers holding their conversations that strung together like a bad choir.

“Symone!” I screamed

I flagged down the operator, and he kept the train stationary until Symone was able to squeeze out. Together, we lifted her up to safety.

I called the police and told them what happened, but none of the men were ever caught. I found that to be irrelevant. Symone was safe.

For the next week, she stayed with me at my apartment. She cried in her sleep almost every night, but eventually she felt close to normal—only, much less likely to take a late night subway train.

A couple weeks later, we were lying in bed and I was the one crying.

“I was so scared you were going to die,” I said. “I couldn’t stand to live without you, and I know that it was my fault. I should never have left you alone.”

She kissed a tear running down my cheek and hugged me close. “But you knew just what to do. You saved me.”

“I didn’t know what to do. I just said the first thing I thought of. I had no idea if the train was going to crush you or not, I just knew I couldn’t get you out in time. I had to try something.”

“Well, it worked.”

“Why were you so confident in me?” I asked. “How come when I told you to lay down, you just did it?”

“You’re my boyfriend,” she said. “You’re always there when I need you; you always do the right thing. I knew you wouldn’t let anything happen to me.”

Years later, we had a beautiful wedding at the very same church Symone was baptized in as a baby. I sobbed as she walked down the aisle; we both sobbed as we said our vows; by the time we kissed, our faces were so wet that they slid against each other like two blubbery fish.

We honeymooned in Greece where we climbed the Acropolis. We held hands as we watched the sunset. I promised myself that, no matter what, Symone would be the important thing in my life. We were both on the precipice, about to free fall into the things we’d been dreaming about since we were young, and yet, I knew that whether I sold a million books or zero, I was going to love Symone more than anything. She would always be my priority.

Symone got accepted into one of the top English Literature PhD programs in the country, so we ended up moving to an even bigger city. She focused on her classes and worked as a waitress on the weekends. I found a teaching job at a local high school and spent my evenings working on my novels.

It was about a year into this new life when I began to find success. It started small. A publisher picked up my first book, a horror novel, and we were able to get it published in a short time with minimal edits.

A couple dozen people picked up the book, and I got some solid reviews. Every week a few more sales would roll in, and after some months it looked like I might even break even. Then some girl on TikTok made a video with a title like, “The most disturbing book of 2025.” She gave a quick, spoiler free summary of my book with lots of gasps and comments like “you won’t believe what happens next.” At the end she said that she didn’t sleep with the lights off for a week after finishing the story.

The video ended up going viral. Tens of millions of views and over a million likes. Other book content creators started making summaries and reviews, some people even posted live reactions of them reading the ending. People were speculating on whether or not the killer was actually dead. Would there be a sequel?

Suddenly the book was selling so fast that the small book printer my publishers outsourced to couldn’t keep up. They had to hire a secondary team, and then a third, all just to print more and more copies.

Edgy teenagers weren’t exactly my target audience, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who’s a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That’s when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn’t even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I’d spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn’t get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I’m not quite sure when she did drop out, but it’s safe to say I didn’t notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn’t even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she’d always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month—our anniversary. We’d go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. “I won’t do any writing for a whole week,” I promised. “It’ll be just the two of us.”

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn’t believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It’s just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We’d have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn’t listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train—to avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

“I’m going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you’ll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.”

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](https://www.reddit.com/u/CDBlotts/s/1FfwIIbEt4)",2,1752545461.0,creepcast,4,1.0,False

I have skin rashes (seems fungal according to my dermatologist) appearing all over my scalp, eye lids, stomach, low back, and a few spots on my legs. My digestion is suffering as well. Over the past few months, I’ve experienced very loose stools that have progressed to diarrhea most days but not all the time (75%). 

For reference, I live a healthy lifestyle. I sleep 7-8 hours every night, no screens 1+ hour before bed, great sleep hygiene, take probiotics,  cut off coffee (thought it was contributing to diarrhea), eat extremely clean, never anything processed, no alcohol, no sodas, no drugs, etc.

I have no logical explanation for why I’m experiencing these symptoms. I’ve seen a PCP who referred me to a GI specialist who said to say Imodium and maybe I have IBS….. this doesn’t seem like it’s the issue.

 I’m at a loss at what to do. I am considering getting a GI map and seeing a functional medicine doctor but don’t know where to find one that is reputable and won’t cost me a fortune.

# Movement I: Fermata in Silence

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, giving the piano one last look. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered, not from power loss, but like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different—denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls—portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did—widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps—soft, steady—from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.

# Movement II: A Door in the Score

I found him standing at the end of the corridor—motionless—his hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

“I have a question,” I said. “Back when I first arrived. The rooms without names. You said you preferred not to disturb them.”

“Wellers did say that,” he replied, tone mild. “A gentleman should never pry where he isn’t invited.”

“But what were they?”

He smiled faintly. “Rooms don’t like to be watched. Some contain echoes. Some… house rehearsals that never ended. Some doors open inward.”

He finally turned to look at me. “You’d be surprised what still lingers when the music stops.”

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray—you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screaming not to.

And together, we stepped through.

# Movement III: Recitativo

We didn’t step into a room. We stepped out of one.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. Not dark, not bright—just absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. Walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You aren’t Wellers.”

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait not fully dried.

“I’m the third son of a man who buried the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not just Wellers.

“All that remained was silence,” he said. “So I filled that silence with voice. From voice, I became music—song, echo, memory. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push further.

We passed a window—though nothing lay beyond it—and in the ripple of its not-glass, I saw a painting. Claire’s face. Not her living face, but one painted by someone who missed her more than they understood her. She was smiling—but it wasn’t for me. Or maybe it was. I blinked, and the image evaporated. The world here didn’t hold its shape unless I looked at it.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why me? Why now?”

He didn’t stop walking. “Because you played.”

“That’s it?”

“You played the grief in your bones,” he said, almost gently. “And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage anymore.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded not like footsteps, but notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?” I asked.

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”

# Movement IV: Interlude for Two

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place—it was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace—not performance, not compulsion. Just music. Just being.

She didn’t look up, not at first.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out—not to touch, but to hover just above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just try.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest—not jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once, eyes dark and calm.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered—like a choir echoing inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled a folded piece of paper—handing it to me silently. I unfolded it carefully, tracing the words with a finger.

“Compensation: Solace”

I placed the letter gently on the kitchen table, the same where it first appeared. The start, and end, of this circle.

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. Wellers.

Then I walked through.

# Movement V: Final Refrain

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed—like something sighing its last.

I stepped through into air that was far too still.

The sky was grey, but not with storm or smoke. It was the kind of sky where the world forgets to turn. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the DIN(N)ER sign left—its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total, but not empty. It felt cleared, like the stage had been finally struck after the final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue—now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked, but not broken. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”

The windows were blackened from the inside. Not just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car where I’d left it. It shouldn’t have still been there, not after however many years had passed. But it was. Dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but not possessed. Not suffocating. Just quiet.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat—framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

Hi! 

I've been dealing with gastritis symptoms for over a month now. I've always had a sensitive stomach but it got absolutely horrible two months ago. 

I actually cut out coffee over a year ago because I decided to finally start my ADHD medication and I don't like the feeling of drinking coffee while I take my medication. I switched to drinking almond milk matcha lattes with maple syrup. 

When my first flare happened I went and bought strong probiotics and thought I might have a bad bought of food poisoning. I ate some spicy Indian food and the stomach burn was so bad for days. It went away. 

A week or so later the burning was back coupled with the worst acide reflux I've ever had. I'm not a person who usually suffers from acide reflux and this was so bad my throat was hurting. Plus I had the worst bloating and burps. I went to the doctor and they had me do a blood and stool test. Both came back negative for h pylori. They gave me an acid blocker. The acid reflux was still horrible. I went back to the doctor. They gave me a stronger acid blocker and sent me to get a stomach biopsy and told me no more peppermint tea and no more matcha. 

I ate extremely clean for a couple of weeks, small meals and got my stomach biopsy. Immediately after the biopsy the acid reflux and stomach pain were back for days. The doctor said my stomach looked fine and they'd call me either biopsy results. 

I still haven't heard back but my acid reflux is coming back (even with the acid blocker) and my bloating it really bad no matter what I eat. 

I used to have a very restrictive diet because I had a really bad e d. So I've been struggling with the diet. I struggle with all diets because they mentally put me back into an e d mind set. I don't diet, I don't track my food and I don't weigh myself. It's really negative for my recovery and mental health. 

Everything I read online says the only way to heal this is to be on a very restrictive diet. Very regimented and really resembles behaviour a lot of my e d therapist says I can not do (ie. food journals) 

All of the pain around eating and the bloating is really triggering me already but the diet stuff is throwing me into such a bad mental state. 

Is there anyway to fix this without eating so restrictively? Can I take supplements and cut out some things (I already cut out red sauces, spicy food, I don't really drink alcohol so that was easy) anyone ever dealt with this before? ",2,1752545198.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

For a moment I forgot where I was. But after coming back to my senses, the air had changed. It was thicker—not because of humidity or heat, but like I was underwater. Sounds were muffled, my breath was slightly strained. I looked back out into Dorset Hollow, but it was still there. Silent, slow-moving, waiting. The streets were empty as always, but now—for some reason, I knew people were there. 

I walked past stores that sold nothing. A flowershop with dead tulips in the window, a tailor with no mannequins. Even a post office where mail slots were nailed shut. But then I saw it again.

The DIN(N)ER sign was flickering like it didn’t have anywhere more important to be. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me. The same waitress stood—with the same cherry-red lips that her smile stopped at. 

I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee. “Sleep well, honey?” she asked.

“Not really.”

She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen—the same three notes from my dream.

“You know this song?” I asked.

“It knows you,”

I didn’t ask her to explain.

I wandered deeper into town after I downed my coffee. The Hollow itself wasn’t big, but it was deep—like a painting where the shadows would lead you to another. Roads looped back onto themselves, houses kept repeating, but with slightly different, barely noticeable features when I passed them again. I tried to escape this town, just to see if I could, but every road led back onto itself and every sign became circular.

There were no cars, no wind, no animals. I was drawn by the smell of fresh bread to a bakery, but the door was locked. The sign outside simply wrote “Recital Tonight—7PM”

I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it just wasn’t there before. There was a single book displayed behind the window. Its title, in silver ink on a blue face, said “The Audience Remains”. 

I walked in. There was no bell, just a hush that sank into my soul. Sat on the counter was a woman who must have been the clerk. She didn’t react to my entry or presence.

The shelves were full of books that were bound in some strange leather. It was too dry, too smooth. Most of them had no titles. Some were filled with nothing but blank pages, some with nonsensical piano scores. I opened one and it had, written down to the very bottom of every single page:

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

I slammed it shut and looked up. The lady behind the counter hadn’t moved an inch, her back still turned to me. But then I noticed it. She was humming. The same three notes. I left before she could turn around. The sound of a page turning followed.

I needed more coffee. So I went back to the diner. It was quieter now though, the indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the DIN(N)ER sign was noticeably faded. The young man was sitting in his booth. Same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. He nodded to me as I entered and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 

“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.

I looked. It was a recital poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.

She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music—poised, serene, beautiful.

But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.

“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.

The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”

I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.

I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”

He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap. But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”

I stepped forward and had my face maybe a few inches away from the poster. More details emerged—details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.

“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even born in the fifties.”

“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow, sometimes it sits still, waiting.”

“For what”

He took a sip of coffee. “You.”

I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 

A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 

I kept walking. Went right past that damnable bookstore. I’m praying it gets burned to the ground. Right by those stupid houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death, but they would be gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I’m just going crazy.

I just kept walking. But then I noticed it—past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:

Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897

Beneath it, scratched into the wood:

“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”

Through the glass, I saw a figure. A red-headed woman was seated in a dim glow, playing  a violin—yet I heard no sound. Her fingers traced melodies I couldn’t hear, but somehow felt in the depths of my being. Sorrow. Her figure blurred, and then vanished into the shadows.

I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact—untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 

On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.

I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood—leaving fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, but I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out—fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:

“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”

Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.

“Harold Carr (1902)—Died during performance”

“Benjamin Mandol (1907)—Checked in, hasn’t checked out”

“Jonathan Bale (1912)—Playing still”

And right there at the very end:

“Claire Halden (2018)—Admitted. Not recovered”

I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden was her last name, but this is impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.

The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in—I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:

“It’s not her. Not really”

Then from behind me, where the piano lay—three haunting notes. 

That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey. But every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, like something behind me was forcing me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.

Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset, not yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I don’t think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf. And a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.

I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush—like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Mr. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 

“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked. The way he said it was too casual, like he’s said it a thousand times before.

“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.

“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”

I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”

His lips curled ever so slightly, into something not quite a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul. And then, in a voice not his own, “But the tune is me.”

Nope. That’s it. That’s the line. I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.

“You should rest,” he said, his voice back to his Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”

I tried to go to my car, but my legs had other ideas—pretty soon, my brain followed their lead. Instead, I climbed the stairs back to my room. The passage there seemed longer than before, deeper even. My door was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:

“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only

Liam Goodpray, Pianist

Those who play, remain”

Outside, I heard the wind whisk their way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass, but it was not my own. 

Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling—not kindly, nor cruelly. Just knowingly. And then, a nod.

The clock on the wall struck 6:55. I reached for the suit.

Have you ever heard a note lingering in the silence, faint but unyielding? Like a summons from some unseen conductor? It’s not a melody you know, nor a score you stumbled upon by chance. More like you were a restless instrument, untuned and wandering, until you found yourself playing the exact chord you were destined for. That’s how this symphony began.

I hadn’t played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her tune as well.

How I wish it remained like that. Alas, she got diagnosed with cancer. Brain cancer…terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.

I couldn’t keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn’t get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.

Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn’t pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script—Liam Goodpray. No stamp, no return address.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must’ve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire’s favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.

“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

Just that offer was written, by a name I’ve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Solace? What kind of payment is that? 

Alongside that, I remembered something once. An old story about Dorset Hollow—a fire, they said. Decades ago, the town burned to the ground, swallowed by flames no one could stop. No one ever said what happened after. Not about whether it was rebuilt or left to rot in silence. It was just a ghost of a rumor I barely cared to follow. But now, I was standing on the edge of that forgotten place—with a letter that promised something I didn't quite understand.

I’ll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn’t decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking, and there, laid on my nightstand, was the letter.

I did my daily morning routine and jumped into my car. After that dream, I just wanted to see Dorset Hollow, despite Claire’s pleas. I wasn’t going to perform or even touch that piano, I just wanted to see. At least that’s what I told myself.

The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn’t want to be followed.

The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.

“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection”

The town looked preserved. It wasn’t old, wasn’t abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. They looked like they were from a different time, so I guess that they restored the town to how it looked decades ago after all. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn’t see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.

Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said DIN(N)ER. Clever. I hadn’t eaten all day, so I pulled in.

The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren’t startled or surprised, just… aware.

I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked as she handed me the menu.

“How’d you know?” I said, wondering what made it obvious.

She shrugged and looked in some general direction. “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

I told her my order but she didn’t write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.

The young man looked at me from his booth. “You play?”

I hesitated a bit before answering, “used to.”

He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, “that’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I forced a smile at him. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just went back to staring at his food.

I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She just gave a small shrug and said, “Mr. Wellers takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy”, I said, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn’t fit the town—too big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.

Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. His skin paper-white and his eyes glazed over. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.

“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn’t reach his eyes.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?”

He nodded. “Some call me that.”

“Is that what you call you?”

He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.” 

That didn’t answer anything, but I let it go.

“The folks at the diner said you covered my meal,” I said.

“Wellers takes care of his guests,” he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. “Shall we?”

As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.

You know that show Dr. Who? The hall was like the TARDIS. Massive. Bigger than it should be, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waiting for centuries to perform.

It wasn’t Claire’s piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.

I stepped toward it slowly. 

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

“She looks…” I paused, searching for the right word. “Hungry.”

He chuckled softly. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he said, smooth as ever.

I blinked. That struck me wrong.

He paused, then smiled and said, “Mr. Wellers finds it…easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, “You’ll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow”

This was our longest one yet. Since we have gotten year passes we have gone about once a month. We live about 3 hours away from Disney. I am going to do a write up of the good, bad, ugly and some hot takes. 

Magic Kingdom 
-Tron is an amazing ride and only gets hate because it’s short but for some reason I feel like that adds to the ride. (Second time riding) 

-First time riding Tiana’s Bayou since splash mountain and it was a great ride. We rode it at night which I feel made the drop even better because you couldn’t see the bottom. 

The confectionary is trash 🗑️ 

 Epcot
-GOTG is a one of one insane ride. So this was my redemption arch with Gurdian. Last time I rode it I got extremely motion sick and basically had my eyes closed the second it launched. This time I loaded on Bonine and told myself I was finding a way to enjoy it. We also got rule the world which added to my redemption. This ride is truly one of a kind and is incredible.

Remys- Not worth waiting more than 40 minutes for. It’s a fun creative ride but I feel like all the screen play just takes away from the ride compared to Rail Road and Rise for example. (Second time riding) 

Via Napoli- I would give this restaurant a 6/10. Great atmosphere and our server Marcol was awesome and very open as we had great discussion about Italy and America. I got the meat lovers pizza and asked for it to be overbaked. It came out with still a pretty wet bottom on half of the pizza and was just not what I was expecting for a wood fire oven. The misses got tortellini which she enjoyed. The Focaccia as an appetizer was awesome. The Tiramisu was probably the best I’ve ever had in my life yet which says a lot because that is my favorite dessert. My rating is more or less on the pizza being a let down if I’m being honest. 

Chefs De France-  I would give this restaurant a 9/10. Awesome service once again. Everything from the baguette, to the appetizers, to the main courses was amazing. Great wine, atmosphere everything was awesome. 

The pineapple hard cider from Morocco is a 10/10

First time trying poutine and really enjoyed the saltiness of the gravy. Would definitely get again. 

UK chips are 10/10 and I will never not get them. 


For one of my other hottest takes yet. 

Norway and Canada DO NOT deserve a place in the world showcase. I think Greece and India would wipe the floor with these two countries. Nobody cares about maple popcorn and school bread with a 1/2 tsp of custard in it. You can set up a quick service for Viking coffee and school bread and the world would be a much better place. 

Animal Kingdom

For my hottest take yet…. Animal Kingdom is a quarter day park. Yes you heard that right. Ride the few rides, maybe have a drink, and head out. Dinosaur was down this time which was really disappointing because avatar and dinosaur are the two rides we really care to ride. We did get on avatar of course and it was a 10/10 as always. And the cookie sandwich by Dino land is a 10/10. 

Hollywood Studios 

ROTR- will forever stay my favorite ride I’ve eve been on. I’m not sure if animatronics were down the few times we rode or if you get different carts you see different effects but this ride was firing on all cylinders and I saw things I haven’t seen the other few times. 

Tower of Terror- this was our first time riding it and man my palms were sweating as it was going up. It was an incredible ride and we really enjoyed it. Super cool concept and the theming is chefs kiss. 

Mickeys Railroad- We ride this every time but the nostalgia will never leave. This is a great ride for all ages. 

Disney Springs

House of Blue’s- I would give this restaurant a 4/10. The food was just ok and the music was good. But personally I would never go back. We got the nachos appetizer, Cajun pasta with shrimp, and the misses got a blackened salmon salad. 

City Works- This restaurant was 100% a 10 out of 10 for us and probably is the best dining experience and food we’ve had since going to Disney. My New York strip was one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. The misses got a salmon salad which was amazing. The buffalo chicken dip was Devine, and the beer selection was awesome. This place is awesome and we will absolutely go back. 

Resort 
We have stayed at dolphin but any other time has been the all star resorts. You absolutely cannot beat these resorts for the value. If you are park hopping there is no reason to spend so much money on hotels when you can enjoy the ice cold ac bus and do the same thing with just a little more time involved. We always have a great time and enjoy the simple breakfast, arcade, and the nice rooms. 

And for how Bonine has saved my life. I get sick being the passenger of a car. I got a little sideways on space mountain a few trips back. Guardians made me motion sick for about 30 minutes, Everest made me sick for about 2 hours. This was all while taking Dramamine. I started taking 75mg of Bonine a day and I can literally ride any ride without getting sick. There’s not a ride I’ve stepped on since that has even made me slightly dizzy. If you want to get your life back and enjoy rides again load up on 75mg of Bonine. Yes you’ll be tired but you will get over the fatigue after a few rides.

1m05i8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1m05i8i/healing_my_gastritised/,Healing my gastritis/ED,"Trigger warning *** eating disorder ***

Hi! 

I've been dealing with gastritis symptoms for over a month now. I've always had a sensitive stomach but it got absolutely horrible two months ago. 

I actually cut out coffee over a year ago because I decided to finally start my ADHD medication and I don't like the feeling of drinking coffee while I take my medication. I switched to drinking almond milk matcha lattes with maple syrup. 

When my first flare happened I went and bought strong probiotics and thought I might have a bad bought of food poisoning. I ate some spicy Indian food and the stomach burn was so bad for days. It went away. 

A week or so later the burning was back coupled with the worst acide reflux I've ever had. I'm not a person who usually suffers from acide reflux and this was so bad my throat was hurting. Plus I had the worst bloating and burps. I went to the doctor and they had me do a blood and stool test. Both came back negative for h pylori. They gave me an acid blocker. The acid reflux was still horrible. I went back to the doctor. They gave me a stronger acid blocker and sent me to get a stomach biopsy and told me no more peppermint tea and no more matcha. 

I ate extremely clean for a couple of weeks, small meals and got my stomach biopsy. Immediately after the biopsy the acid reflux and stomach pain were back for days. The doctor said my stomach looked fine and they'd call me either biopsy results. 

I still haven't heard back but my acid reflux is coming back (even with the acid blocker) and my bloating it really bad no matter what I eat. 

I used to have a very restrictive diet because I had a really bad eating disorder. So I've been struggling with the diet. I struggle with all diets because they mentally put me back into an eating disorder mind set. I don't diet, I don't track my food and I don't weigh myself. It's really negative for my recovery and mental health. 

Everything I read online says the only way to heal this is to be on a very restrictive diet. Very regimented and really resembles behaviour a lot of my eating disorder therapist says I can not do (ie. food journals) 

All of the pain around eating and the bloating is really triggering me already but the diet stuff is throwing me into such a bad mental state. 

Is there anyway to fix this without eating so restrictively? Can I take supplements and cut out some things (I already cut out red sauces, spicy food, I don't really drink alcohol so that was easy) anyone ever dealt with this before? ",1,1752544982.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1m05fzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1m05fzt/should_a_roommate_eliminate_sweets_from_the/,Should a roommate eliminate sweets from the household because another roommate gets diagnosed with diabetes,"Two people living together, no specific lease or terms, so nothing legally binding. 

I use a normal amount of sweet products, nothing over the top, coffee sweetener, and some sugar for Cheerios, maybe some used when baking or cooking. Grew up with type 1 diabetic parents, was adopted, and had to forego sugar my entire childhood due to the strict diabetic diet restrictions in our household. I have enjoyed modest normal sugar usage my entire adult life since moving out. (adoption mentioned to rule out inherited diabetes)

My roommate had normal consumption similar to me until several years ago when they were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. They were overeating and overweight, and had all of the classic precursors. They were formally diagnosed and given medications. They do not carefully monitor their diet or sugar intake now, or carefully take the medication, but it has yielded some result lowering the A1C. They will binge eat any sugar in the household, causing great grief to me. 

Dilemma, should I have to give up normal consumption of sweets and remove all sugars from the home to prevent my roommate‘s sugar seeking behavior? 

Considerations: I feel emotionally about the diabetes, and am monster. However, I’ve seen the “sugar seeking behavior” in my elderly parent later in life and know it’s a real thing. Wonder if the sacrifice for naught.

I’m 23M, working in a new office, and over the last few months, I’ve gotten close to a colleague (F) in a very comfortable, fun dynamic.

She’s a bit childlike and emotionally expressive. I’ve nicknamed her “Minion,” do this forehead tap gesture (inspired by itachi's head tap to Sasuke😅), tease her with songs and names — and she pouts, rolls her eyes, but comes back for it every time. It’s become our thing.

She often seeks me out — asks why I didn’t talk to her on a certain day, says she misses the tap when I don’t do it, and sometimes invites me alone for holige or coffee. Once, she held my hand (palms clasped) when she felt dizzy, and I helped her get food and juice because she was visibly unwell. I cared. And honestly, I still do. But I’ve never flirted or made any romantic advances.

One time, she asked me questions like “What if someone from office confessed to you?” and “What if it’s someone you know?” — I brushed them off at the time, but they’ve stuck in my mind since.

We also have a lot of physical playfulness — she hits me lightly, mocks me, and sometimes says things like “You won’t actually hit me back — I know that.” I tease her too — sing parody songs replacing her name, call her “minu,” and such. It’s all playful, but… increasingly personal.

Here’s the thing — she’s single, and I’m not in love or anything, but I don’t want to give her false hope.
At the same time, I naturally tend to form unique connections with people — nicknames, jokes, personal gestures — and I do this with guys too. But this one’s more emotionally charged, and I’m worried:

Am I unintentionally building something more intimate than intended?

Am I giving the wrong signals by being this emotionally available?

Should I set clearer boundaries or is this just healthy friendship?


Would really appreciate honest opinions — especially from women who’ve been in (or seen) similar dynamics. I don’t want to lead her on, or confuse either of us.

1m05dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m05dan/im_a_marine_biologist_and_i_encountered_something/,I’m a Marine Biologist and I Encountered Something Terrifying in the Pacific,"I’m not a big poster here and mostly stick to my little corners of the internet, but this is something I just need to share. This all happened to me about a year ago and since then, it has completely taken over my life. I hope my message can be spread here, as I’m not sure where else to put it.

I’m a student at a small college on the Pacific coast. I’ve been aiming for a masters in marine ecology. But due to the college’s size, let’s just say options for apprenticeship were rather scarce for my field. The marine ecology I was studying mainly focused on the impact that pollution had on the ocean and how this affected local wildlife.

So you can imagine my surprise when my professor called me to his desk after class. He told me a group of ecologists approached him looking for students to help with a research project. He explained that I seemed like a good fit. He said I was motivated, had good grades, and took my studies seriously. He explained that he forwarded my email address to them and that I should expect a message by that evening.

Sure enough, later that night, an email had arrived in my inbox. “Good day Miss Kern, we’ve heard from Professor Du Page that you are the top of your class and a highly active advocate for ocean conservation. We humbly invite you to accompany us on an expedition to the North Pacific to observe the effect pollution has on the gyres in the area. This trip will be in three weeks time, so make preparations accordingly.

The three weeks seemed to drag by, until finally the date approached and I packed my bags. Strangely, they only give me the address two nights before the day we were supposed to cast off. With my suitcase and food in my trunk, I headed off to the boat docks. It was early, about 6 am and the fog was just beginning to retreat into the shelter of the dark forested hills above the city. As I arrived at the harbor parking lot, I saw three men standing beside a silver truck. The shortest of the men, with a white beard, swept back hair and glasses gave a large sweeping wave as he spotted me. As I pulled into the spot next to them, the other two men watched me coldly.

“Ah, look at you so timely!” The short bearded man flashed a smile at me and  stuck out his hand. “I’m Doctor Krutchek, but you can just call me Dan.”

I learned that Doctor Krutchek was a marine ecologist like myself and was the one who had talked to my professor. He then introduced me to the other two.

“Guys, I’d like you to meet Jennifer Kern!”

“Just Jenn is fine…”

“Ah well I see. Anyway, Jenn, this is our Captain Charlie Blake.”

“Pleasure to meet you Miss Kern.” Charlie smiled thinly. Charlie LOOKED like a captain. Medium stocky build, a short black beard with some silver peaking through, and a brow that seemed to be in a permanent furrow, his pale blue eyes barely shining through.

“And this is Mr. Hayes and Mr. Edwards. They’re actually the one who helped finance this operation. Department of the Interior! Wouldn’t have been able to do this without them!”

“A pleasure Miss Kern.” Mr. Hayes was a tall skinny man with perfectly combed hair. He had a skinny face and what can best be described as a resting annoyed face. Mr. Edwards simply nodded. He looked almost identical to Mr Hayes save a mole on his left cheek.

“Well, let’s get your luggage on board! We want to be at least 7 miles from the coast within the next 3 hours.”

Captain Blake helped carry my luggage out to the dock where our vessel awaited. The boat was about the size of a small fishing trawler, with a cabin above, a below deck with sleeping bunks and a small lab room at the back for analysis. On the side of the boat in faded blue font was the name Monsoon.

“Before I bought her, she was a mere fishing trawler,” explained Dan.

“Yeah, I could tell,” I said looking at the rust stains running down the white sides of the cabin from even rustier bolts.

Charlie took my bags down to the bunk room. The space was surprisingly roomy considering the canon size and you could stretch your arms wide and still have a foot of space between the walls.

With a growl of the old diesel engine (counterintuitive to our cause I know), we pulled away from the dock to begin our journey. The sun was just starting to rise above the ocean as we officially entered open water. Our destination, the middle of the North Pacific gyre. In this gyre is what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. If garbage makes it’s way into the Pacific, chances are it’ll wind up there. As Dr Krutchek explained, “Our mission here will be to assess the effect the garbage mass has had on the local wildlife. Then Mr. Hayes and Mr. Edwards can report back on what can be done.”

I nodded along to what he said but kept looking over at the two agents. Something about them gave me an upset feeling in my gut. They seemed cold, and calculated. Yeah Charlie seemed tough, but he had a genuine quality to him. The two DOI men lacked both of those qualities.

We had spent the  whole day out at sea and I can already feel the boredom creeping in. Not even a gaggle of mystery books and old marine biology textbooks could satiate me. According to the Captain, we would be arriving within the other reaches of the patch by tomorrow afternoon.

Despite it being my first time sleeping on a boat, the waves were gentle enough to lull me to sleep. I was awoken by faint conversation coming from the small kitchenette to the left of the bunk room. I clearly heard Dr Krutchek’s voice and one of the agents. They sounded the damn same. “Listen agent, be reasonable, we’re going at the best pace we can. It takes time to truly analyze these areas.”

“Our superiors need a report immediately, Dr. If we don't, we won’t think twice about cutting all funding to your research.”

“Fine. We should be nearing the area soon.” I heard Dan stomp up the steps to the main deck. I quietly slipped out of my bunk and got dressed. Due to the cramped quarters, I’d take all the privacy I could get. The thought of being the only woman on a boat of men was still playing at the back of my mind.

I got a cup of coffee from the old Keurig machine in the kitchenette before heading up after the doctor. He was leaning against the railing, stewing to himself. I leaned on the deck next to him. “I heard you guys talking.”

Dan looked up, his brow furrowing in concern. “Oh, sorry you had to hear that Jenn.” He sighed. It’s just, I’ve been trying to do some more research in that area and now that I have the chance, I have the fucking government breathing down my back. I feel stuck.”

I put a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Well, it sucks they’re breathing down your neck, but at least they’re showing interest in us, eh?”

“Yeah Jenn, I suppose you’re right.”

While I was trying to keep the doctor upbeat, this just further stoked my suspicions and anger towards the agents aboard with us.

I wandered into the cab to see Captain Charlie puzzling over some instruments and then looking to the horizon ahead. “The fuck?.” I asked him what the matter was and he pointed to his instruments. It was then I noticed that they were all going ballistic. Gauge needles flicking two and fro. “I’m not sure what’s happening, it’s like someone is waving a big magnet over the controls.”

Just as he said that, a huge jolt hit the ship, what sounded like metal against metal scraping from below. The whole boat felt like it jolted up, as if it went over a speed bump. “The Hell was that!?” The Professor ran into the doorway, holding the frame in case another tremor shook the boat.

“I don’t know, I didn’t see anything on the radar, but, well, look at it.” Sure enough, the radar seemed to be glitching in and out. Almost completing a rotation and then fading out. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” Charlie sounded worried and this worried me. If our captain didn’t know what was happening, we were screwed.

Something else I noticed was that the sun was getting low on the horizon. Strange, it felt like it was just noon a half hour ago.

“Well folks, looks like we’re gonna have to stop here for the night.” Charlie shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t want to push forward at all while the instruments are all fuddled. Especially since we’re losing daylight.”

It was disappointing to hear, but Dan and I agreed that would be for the best. As I went out on the deck, I saw the two agents quietly talking to each other. I couldn’t make out much but something did stick out to me. Something something “Zone T.”

My sleep was rough that night. I kept having dreams about walking through the lab at my school. Shelves lined with specimens in formaldehyde, all of them screaming…

When I woke up, it was barely light out. Something felt off but I couldn’t quite place it. As if something was out of place. Looking at the small glass of water by my bedside, I realized what it was. The water was NOT moving. For the last couple of days, everything on the boat had a constant sway and bob, even at the waters calmest. But that’s not the case now. Confused, I made my way to the kitchenette and out the door to the deck. I was surprised to see everyone…including the captain, out on the deck. I paced out onto the deck to ask what was going on, then I looked for myself. We were no longer on water. But we weren’t on land either.

As far as the eye could see on all sides was a sprawling landscape made of waste. A flat plain of garbage, and out on that plain, the rusted hulls of ocean freighters lay, like beached whales. “Where the fuck are we,” I muttered almost to myself.

I felt a hand pat my shoulder and I whirled around to see one of the agents. He was smiling. “Welcome to Zone T.”

I looked over at the doctor who looked just as dumbfounded as me. The captain, on the other hand, had a neutral expression on his face.

“We needed some seasoned marine biologists to assist us in research of this area, but no one who would be missed or have the notoriety to tell. No offense.”

The Doctor's mouth opened and closed as he processed the information, scouring the landscape. “This…this is impossible. Something like this should have shown up on satellites, and been recorded long before. How can this place exist.”

“We’ve made great effort to make sure people don’t enter this area doctor, and as for satellite imagery, we still don’t know why it doesn’t show up there.

As I wandered aimlessly along the deck, the smell hit me. It was unlike the normal sea smell you imagine. It smelled like pure rot, like the gunk you pull out of a drain when you unclog it. There was a denseness to the air, almost muggy.

It’s hard to think just hours before we were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The captain and the two agents were yelling on the other end of the deck.

“I didn’t fucking sign up for this! Listen you suits, I don’t know what you’re pulling but I demand some damned answers!”

Mr. Edwards regarded him coolly, a faint smirk of contempt crossing his face.

“Legends have been told of this place for thousands of years. It was considered by various tribes to be the gates of the underworld, or a place so evil the water refused to touch it. But it’s not an island, it’s a place simply with an absence of water.”

“The hell does that even mean?”

“You’ve heard of the Bermuda Triangle? Well this is the real one. We weren’t sure if it existed until about 70 years ago. Only through some advanced coordination methods were we able to find it.”

“Why has it been kept secret for so long?” I asked.

“Because people keep disappearing. Things in this place behave strangely as you can see.” He nodded towards the cabin and instruments that were presumably still going haywire.

“As I said, it doesn’t appear on satellite maps and only seems accessible at certain times of the year. Normally the area around it is closely guarded by a periphery of our ships. But they let us through of course.”

Dan stepped forward. “Then why us? What makes us so special?”

“You’re expendable.” Hayes smiled thinly.

I felt like my intestines punched my stomach.

“Excuse me!?” Dan stared agape at the two men.

“If we got the nation's top marine biologists, ecologists, and captains, they’d be missed. We’ve checked all your records. Most of you are completely alone.”

Captain Charlie made a dash at Hayes. In an instant, Hayes whirled around pulling out a 9 mm and shot him in the foot. Charlie cried in agony and tumbled to the floor, clutching his foot. I rushed into the cabin, rummaging through the aging first aid kit to retrieve a pack of gauze. I helped pull Charlie’s shoe off to reveal his blood soaked sock. Fortunately it had just grazed the top of his foot but it had still cut deep. Charlie winced as I wrapped the gauze around his foot while Dan held him up.

I wanted to yell at the two men in suits, but I had a man’s safety to focus on. And I was scared shitless. Considering I’m the shut in nerd that I am, I never thought I would witness someone get shot.

“Even if you did succeed at overtaking us, we not only have our colleagues surrounding you, you are currently in one of the most uncharted and hostile places on the globe.” Hayes loomed over us smugly.

We helped Charlie to his feet and hobbled him over to the cabin wall. He glared like a cornered animal at the two agents.

“So what do you want us to do here?” Dan said, shifting uncomfortably next to us.

“When we arranged this mission we said everything would be provided and we did not lie. You will find wetsuits, boots, autopsy tools and preservation containers. You will also be provided with weapons.”

Dan turned his head to the agents. “Weapons?”

“It’s just a precaution,” agent  Edwards said matter-of-factly.

At that point, the place we found ourselves in truly began to sink in. Sure we were scientists but to be one of a few people in a place beyond understanding? It genuinely frightened me. Ancient maps with sea monsters at their edges labeled “there be monsters here” flashed through my head.

The agents led us to the back, presenting us with everything you might possibly need in a place in the middle of the ocean that defied the laws of physics. Once we were suited up in our gear, the agents opened up a lock box with 5 strange looking devices in them. They were long black poles, about the width of a can and they had a two pronged end that made it look like a spear that a little imp would flail around.

“These are your weapons. Enough electricity in them to render a rhino unconscious. It should help at least ward off anything that comes your way.”

“Yeah, well what is it?” Charlie asked, limping over to us.

The agents remained silent, passing the stun spears to us.

“Fucking alright then.” Charlie grumbled, hobbling back to his folding chair brought from below.

Edwards tossed Charlie a cane. “You’ll be our guard considering your recent…incapacitation.”

Charlie glared up at him but said nothing. The agents unhinged the gangway and it fell heavily to the “floor” with a squelching sound. With a grim nod from the agents, we stepped down the gangway and into the wilderness before us.

The ground below us was semi soft and fibery. Like we were walking on a giant wicker chair. Parts of rusted shapes and masses of garbage stuck out of the ground. All while a faint rumbling permeated the air. We approached the rusted bow of one ship which was covered in some sort of vine. I took out a scalpel to cut a piece off, and as I did, the vine(?) made a hissing sound and zipped away. With a rumble, the whole mass of vines began moving, like a giant slithering tumbleweed, and it moved like a caterpillar over the bow of the ship and disappeared into a hole in the ground.

“Those things are harmless, unless you stay still too long,” Edwards remarked emotionlessly.

I looked down at the little piece of tendril, wriggling around on its own at our feet. I picked it up gingerly and placed it quickly into one of the sample cases, where it wriggled as if objecting to its imprisonment. The vine reminded me of a certain kind of plant I saw when I was a kid when my family visited my grandma in Georgia. The plant was called kudzu. It grew over anything, choking the life out of other plants. It also grew incredibly fast. This stuff was faster.

With a new sense of unease among our group, we kept moving further in. The structures around us seemed to decay further. Some of them didn’t even look like any sort of structural design built by man, let alone a boat. Dan and I collected a few more samples before Edwards directed us to head back towards camp.

As we approached the boat, I became aware of a strange sound. It was like grinding, but wet. As if someone were running a semi-picked over chicken bone on a picket fence. It wouldn’t take long  to learn what the noise was.

On the deck of the ship was what was left of Captain Charlie. Towering over him was a beast the likes of which I had ever seen. Had it not been moving, it looked like something that could never have been alive. Its “skin” was made of what looked like wet cloth or plastic, stretched raggedly over its frame. Bits of metal stuck out from this covering, acting like its bones. It stood on all fours, made of what looked like harpoons. I happened to look to my left to see a bloodied Agent Hayes, clutching his gun tightly and looking at me desperately. He crept over to me silently.

“That…thing came out of nowhere. He didn’t stand a chance. I didn’t even have time to get to the radio. It-it didn’t even react to my bullets. It just fucking stared at me.”

The being turned slightly making us both crouch down. We ducked behind a rusted piece of metal, seeing the other two a further way off. I was able to see its face. Part of it looked like a shark skull, the right half of its jaw hanging limp. Most of it was covered in moss, as if it had been around for a long time. I saw what was making the grinding sound. Sticking out of the skull was a rusted and freshly bloodied saw blade, which it was currently using to saw into the captain's face.

Quietly, Hayes and I backtracked to the others, only to have my blood run cold as I accidentally kicked a shred of scrap metal that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. The beast spun its “head” around with a sort of clanking sound, like a roller coaster going up it's hill, and although it didn’t have visible eyes, I knew it saw us.

It dropped what was left of the captain's head, looking now more like a squashed watermelon and leapt over the deck toward us.

“Fucking run for it!!!” Hayes yelled.

The beast sprinted forward on its harpoon legs at a terrifying speed. It’s buzzsaw mouth spinning menacingly. A shrill scream broke out behind us. Against my better judgement I looked behind me. It was Hayes who screamed. Wrapped around his leg was a black tendril that looked like a steel cable. The cable led to the mouth of the beast, which now seemed to be drooling a black oily substance. Hayes screamed in horror as the beast began reeling him in like a fish on a line.

While Edwards and I stared frozen in shock, I saw a blur run between us over to Hayes. With a yell, Dan brought his stun sword onto the tendril. The beast let out a garbled screech and the tendril rapidly retracted. Hayes fell away scrambling backwards as Dan stood his ground.

Dan and the beast stood about 10 feet apart, him holding the stun cane in front of him like a lion tamer. The beast seemed confused by this, its blade now twitching back and forth in a way that seemed almost hesitant. Just as it seemed like the beast was ready to turn tail, I heard a clunking sound from somewhere above us.

Descending from one of the cliff-like shipwrecks was a giant spider-like creature. It looked familiar then I realized it looked like a giant bacteriophage virus. Spider legs, a body like a screw, and a diamond shaped head. Before we had time to react it pounced onto Hayes, pinning him with two of its legs. A long hose extended from its middle and I saw the glint of a long needle at the end.

The needle shot down, injecting itself into Hayes’ stomach. He howled with pain and Edwards threw up next to me. After a few agonizing seconds the giant virus pulled out the needle and  toddled its way toward Dan and the beast. Dan quickly ducked out of the way and the bacteriophage and the beast began fighting, slashing metal limbs at each other. As before, the virus pinned one of the creature's legs and injected it the same way it had Hayes.

As I had apparently become the nurse of this operation, I began inspecting Hayes’ injury. It was shockingly clean.

“How much pain are you feeling?”

“I don’t know. Not that much actually. I feel fine actually.”

It was then that he started laughing. Not a good natured laugh but a strange, forced, almost pained laugh.

“It tickles!!! It tickles!!!!”

He began burping loudly, although they sounded more like gasps between his mad cackling. I also noticed his eyes were practically bulging out of their sockets. And then they did…

I screamed as his eyeballs ruptured spraying fluid over me and Edwards. Hayes’ laughter turned to screaming as he continued burping. As he burped, long wriggling silver things came out of his mouth, wriggling down his body and onto the ground like silvery living shoelaces. He abruptly stopped screaming and gained a peaceful expression on his face.

Out of his eye sockets came two thicker versions of the worms slithering out of his mouth. I could see now that most of his visible skin seemed to be wriggling. The worm's heads ballooned into black orbs and I realized they had effectively become eye stalks.

A deep garbled voice issued from the stained black mouth of the former Agent Hayes.

“ Your friend is no more, for his body has become our nutrients and outlet.”

I heard a crash as the beast fell over sideways and began to spasm on the ground. More of the little worms began to crawl out of its joints. It then stood up, eerily calm as if in a trance.

“Call your people for backup.” Not Hayes looked over at a mortified Edwards. “I am satiated for now. You may only contact them because I permit it. This is not a land for you. If you stay, you shall become muck, as you were all before. Behind every clock are fine tuned gears, and if you poke into those gears too much, you may get pinched. It is in your nature as scientists to question, but stay back for now. You may retrieve your answer at some point, but not now. Now go.”

Edwards walkie emitted a high pitched screeching sound. Not Hayes scampered away in a way no humans’ joints should be capable of. The saw faced creature followed behind, almost like some sort of loyal guardian. I heard a helicopter approaching in the distance.

Everything moved super fast from there. I’d like to say Dan Krutchek and I kept in touch, but that would be a lie. I never saw him again.  I never really learned what branch of the government was responsible for this. I’m beginning to think it wasn’t even the government.

I just remember people dressed in tactical gear helping to board the chopper, but not before gathering up our samples and putting them in a steel chest. I remember Dan shooting me a glance as they drove me home from the port when we made landfall. I wish I stayed with him.

I’ve been studying the Pacific ever since. Going onto conspiracy sites no self respecting scientist would ever humor looking at. Eventually I was able to piece together a mosaic of sources. A Polynesian mythology site here, a ship triangulation log there, until I was fairly certain of the coordinates.

I was somehow able to convince the school to give me a small grant for my research. I somehow knew if I showed up, whatever those forces that were there wouldn’t stop me. As I set about packing my things, I now had one goal. I wished not to stick my fingers in the gears of the world but become them. I shall become muck, as I was before. I’m looking at my arm now as I watch it writhe and twitch.

To whoever reads this, lmk, and I’ll get you the coordinates. We all deserve to return to the machine, to the muck. Hopefully this is your call.",2,1752544612.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I have a closet I'm planning to convert into a bar/coffee nook. The countertop will be about 26""x24"". I'd like some type of dark wood - I think black walnut would look great, but I'm worried it'll be too soft for a countertop. It is also open grained, which I think might be a problem for a counter. Can anybody suggest some woods that look similar (warm dark without being too reddish) while being harder/closed grain? I'm looking at both domestics and exotics.

Regardless of what type of wood I go with, I'm also realizing sourcing the slab will be harder than I was expecting. It seems like there are two options. I either have to buy a live edge slab and cut it down to square (seems like a big waste of money) or buy wide common lumber (2x8s or 2x10s) and join a few planks together (which seems cheaper but I'm worried won't look quite as good). Does anybody have any ideas to source a larger slab that isn't live edge? Any other suggestions you can think of would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",1,1752544578.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1m05b5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1m05b5h/first_chapter_critique_dystopian_scifi/,First Chapter Critique – Dystopian Sci-Fi,"Hi all,  
I’d love some feedback on the first chapter of my dystopian sci-fi novel (\~1,400 words). It follows Ms. Zander, a former teacher now reduced to an “Engager” in a classroom run by neural implants and data metrics. She’s starting to glitch—holding onto memories, books, and human names in a world that wants everything streamlined.

I’m especially curious about:

* Pacing and clarity
* Voice and tone
* Whether the worldbuilding is working
* If the character feels compelling

Chapter below, thank you <33

The monotonous beeping from the front screen  displaying the classroom performance metrics was enough to make Ms. Zander realize she was caught in a day dream. She blinked heavily, forcing her out of the familiar haze. On the front screen, the classroom performance metrics began to update in their usual, clinical rhythm. Students eyes jumped from their independent synchronization screen, to the front screen to analyze their efficiency for the day. Numbers, percentages and graphs began flashing on the screen with a sterile precision:

Engagement Quotient (EQ): 26%— indicating minimal spikes in dopamine.

The Efficiency Index (EI): 99. As always, just shy of perfection. aggregating students metrics into a classroom-wide score. Ms. Zander liked to tell herself that the missing one percent was the result of a stray, untraceable thought— something original, and human. The system, of course, insisted that 100% was impossible as there is, “always room for advancement.” 

Her eyes lingered on the screen. 

Zero anomalies flagged. 

Classroom Harmony Index (CHI): Green, 2%, confirming near-total compliance. Off-script behavior is strictly prohibited at EduTech.

There was a time—years ago—when students had tried to resist. When they valued original thought. When knowledge was earned through exercise and effort, not streamed into the mind on demand. 

But the neural implants changed it all. Learning became passive. Predictable. And eventually, they stopped trying altogether. It was easier this way—easier to comply than to think for themselves. 

Her eyes drifted from the metrics screen to her desk—cluttered, chaotic, and unmistakably out of place in Room 2047. It looked like it had wandered in from another century. A cold coffee sat in front of her in a bright red “Best Teacher” mug, a gift from a former student, now stained with time and muffin crumbs her the local coffee shop. Beside it lay her open George Saunders book, its page defaced with a rainbow of handwritten notes, underlines, and marginal thoughts. A learning stack of tattered fictional novels waited on the corner of her monthly calendar. 

And then there was the green notebook. 

Weathered, frayed, and scribbled through, it was filled with diary entries, questions, and sketches from the depths of her mind. It was the only thing that “kept her grounded and sane.”

In the front of her desk sat a gold name plate: Ms. Kara Zander. Sleek, traditional, engraved in serif letters. Her mother had given it to her on her first day teaching English Language Arts—back when classrooms were stocked with chalkboards and students who ask questions out load. 

She had been told to toss it when she joined EduTech— The Continuum deemed Kara Zander as too inefficient. Too many syllables. Too much nostalgia. They preferred “K”—a single letter, clean and compliant. No drag.

She had pushed back, though. She reasoned that adding “-ay” still kept it one syllable but made it feel more…finished. More like someone you could picture holding a dog or humming while folding laundry.  

They seemed satisfied with the compromise.

So, to them, she was Kay. To her students, Ms. Zander.

The students didn’t get that luxury. Darren Williams was 201-DW, while Marisol Hernandez was 118-MH.

But Kay still used their first names. The real ones. The ones parents whispered to them the first time they were held. The ones to remind them that they are still human.

Zooming out, her desk stood in stark contrast to the rows of sleek, sterile student workstations, each outfitted with a neutral port and biometric monitor. Blue wires blinked like little heartbeats faintly in rhythm with the implants. Each students’ implant pulsing curated data directly in their skulls. 

No books. No pencils. No gum wrappers tossed on the floor or shoved into the desk for some future kid to find. No scribbled notes, no secret jokes, no doodles of the bitch teacher in the margins. 

Desks like Ms. Zanders—the kind that invited messy, authentic thought, unsullied by the system—weren’t necessary anymore. 

EduTech hadn’t abolished traditional teaching all at once. It began with adaptive testing and early attempts at differentiated instruction. Teachers struggled to keep up with the new, progressive demands—academically, socially, emotionally Slowly, AI tutors proved to be the more effective option. 

Then came the implants. Marketed as the pinnacle of modern education: custom knowledge downloads, real-time performance metrics, and the promise to maximize every second of instructional time. 

On paper, it was perfect. 

Parents were guaranteed that their children would never fall behind again. That behavior issues were a thing of the past—students would be constantly monitored and managed.

And students were promised: “Less stress, more success!” 

Resistance dwindled. 

And so did creativity, curiosity, and the chaos that once made classrooms feel alive. 

All that remained now were numbers. And Kay Zander—Ms. Zander, officially—assigned to keep the students “engaged” between knowledge downloads. 

Her title was Engager.

She called herself something else: a Distraction, dressed up as a role.",1,1752544452.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

One of the ways I was hoping to find community is to connect with a local UU church, since I was very active in my former congregation. 

I was surprised to discover only one very small congregation exists; it doesn’t have a minister, and only 18 - 20 people attend the services. It’s a long drive from my house, the service was nearly 2 hours long, quite disorganized, and the prominent closed caption television screen made the whole thing feel soulless. So I will try to drop in now and again, see if I can contribute to the community in small ways, but I don’t anticipate it being the spiritual home and community I am longing for. 

Does anyone have suggestions for other types of communities or organizations that might meet some of the same spiritual needs that a UU congregation can? Maybe a particular volunteer organization or support group? I’m really alone here and many of my neighbors are not English speakers, so it’s hard to strike up conversations in coffee shops or ask people I meet for recommendations.

The backwards words appeared on my bathroom mirror it was there written perfectly in the condensation from the hot shower steam I dismissed it then Nathan has always loved playing scary jokes like that for instance one time during Halloween he dressed Alice up in a doll costume to scare his sister which worked a little too well by the end of the night Clarissa realized why having Uncle Nate dress up Alice for Halloween was never gonna happen without her there to be excluded from the very bad jokes but as you may of guessed this time this wasn’t one of Nathan’s jokes and no it wasn’t the IT controlling Nathan those signs didn’t show up until 1 week but that thing definitely did it after this I remember asking Nate if he saw what I saw in the backyard he simply responded “Rose it was a stressful night the bulbs broke and we had a full house for about 3 days after this it was all a mind trick” and I trusted and trust my husband but I didn’t drop the idea of what I saw being real and evil I did research the best I could then realized why Nathan was so quick to blow me off the google description of demonology or anything around it sounds like an entry to Dungeon and Dragons but I did find some good information that I did test run it but a local priest he constantly reminded though that demonic possession is rare and not technically proven to be true but nonetheless also made sure I understood since my religion wasn’t of the catholic religion I could not get his help with helping remove the entity I may of left that Church with more information about what could possibly be in my house but I also left with the crushing feeling of being all alone on this I could feel it and still can even as I write this the gut feeling that I’m running out of time to save the person I love the most.

That’s a lie.

They have a standard you need to fit in. You can be who you are — so long as you stand out by fitting in. 

That’s why you can be okay — just button up your shirt, lift your chin, put your makeup on. So long as you look like whatever trend is in at the moment. Even if you aren’t okay, just hide it a little deeper, just put on a little more makeup. Everything will be better — maybe when you get some more likes, or maybe if you make one more friend. 

The truth is, being unique isn’t all that it's cracked up to be. 

You don’t have friends. You don’t go to the game nights because people stress you out. You don’t go to dances because being asked to dance is terrifying. But not being asked? That hurts just a bit more than a little. 

But no one can know that. So you bury it deep. You invest yourself in school, or work, or a sport, or a band, or a new fandom. Because if you love something enough to talk about, no one will see how lost you are. 

Bury it deep. Put a smile on your face.

That is the story of my life. And no — this isn’t one of those, “quirky meets handsome or pretty (fill in the blank) and lives happily ever after.” At least, I don’t think it is. 

It’s just me.

Let me introduce myself. My name is Echo. I live in a small town. I work, I go to school. And I live my life alone. 

And I’m happy. Mostly.

I’m not really alone. There are people around me. And I could name almost every one of them. Or name a family member that belongs to them. 

I used to work in a cafe. That was fun. But I didn’t fit the normal barista vibe. So now I work in a little corner office writing email scripts and making phone calls to people who probably don’t want to hear from me. 

My life is simple. I do enjoy school and my job. I love the people around me. But sometimes my life feels more like I'm the protagonist in Imagine Dragons’ *Demons.* But other times it feels like I’m the main character in a cozy folk song. Maybe *Homeward Bound* by Peter Hollens. 

The sun is always just rising when I leave my house to head downtown. The police officer on shift always waves or says good morning. If someone recognizes me from school they give me a nod, or a smile, or a wave.

Coffee is always just a few minutes away. And, the few times I’ve been in a pinch there’s always been someone for me to ask. Even if it is an auto body employee who seems just as clueless as I am. I don’t *know* anyone. But I know lots of people. Just like they know me. But they don’t *know* me. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe that’s enough. 

This will be my story. I don’t know what will happen, but I needed somewhere to write it. So here I am.",2,1752544275.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Hi guys, I’m reaching out to this subreddit because I’m quite worried about my health and hopefully you guys can help me navigate this. 

Recently my acid reflux symptoms have gotten much worse, sharper chest pains, more burning sensations, shorter breaths, and consistent tenderness in my upper chest area throughout the day. I’m in Omeprazole 40 mg a day, although I’ve only been taking it for a few days so I need to wait it out to notice its effects.

I’m mostly concerned because it’s been getting much much worse. For example, I had a few sips of coffee today and my whole nervous system felt like it was shutting down, I got shaky, bad indigestion (burping), nausea and chest pains, and now almost every night I have a flare up of symptoms. I used to be able to drink coffee just fine, and it barely was a concern for me. 

I’m mostly sure it’s GI related because burping and passing gas usually lessens the symptoms, but my anxiety sometimes gets triggered so I’ll feel panicky thinking it’s a heart issue, so it becomes a vicious cycle of digestive and anxiety issues. 

Let me know if anyone has experienced stuff like this, I’m getting an endoscopy soon but I’m wondering if it would benefit if I get checked out for a heart problem or something due to chest pains and my heart racing. Sometimes I really really worry. ",1,1752544126.0,GERD,3,0.67,False

* 1 tsp of instant coffee
* 2 Tablespoons black cocoa powder (The same cocoa used to make Oreos)

I also took the effort to ""bloom"" to cocoa powder by mixing it with 1/2 cup milk and microwave it until it bubbled (if you're in a hurry, you can skip this, I think it really helps the chocolate flavor come out).

When I pull it out of the freezer I make sure to spin it twice in the Creami so it gets the very smooth, nearly soft serve consistency. This one is the best I've made, it's creamy, almost gelato consistency and it doesn't taste like protein powder at all.

It comes in at 416 calories and 96g protein for a Deluxe pint. There are much lower calorie recipes out there. But nothing I've tried is as smooth or creamy as this.

However, if there are other Mad scientists that want to suggest improvements, I'm all ears (I'm sure someone is going to suggest adding inulin..)

This is long and i’m sorry, there’s just a lot of history to it. I’m writing this through tears, I don’t know what to do. 

My boyfriend and his ex knew each other throughout childhood and dated throughout high school, they broke up senior year because while they planned on going to the same college, Ex had to take a gap year to take care of a sick family member. I met my boyfriend freshman year at college, and i was immediately smitten. He is understanding, smart, funny, and seemed to actually be into me, which was strange  as i considered myself to be conveniently unattractive. 

The first time I asked him out he said no because he wasn’t completely over Ex and didn’t want to start a relationship so soon after they broke up, which i of course understood. We became friends nevertheless. Eventually Ex, whom he had been keeping contact with up until that time, blocked him out of nowhere. That night he came to my dorm, explained what had happened, and said that he was so hung up on the past that he didn’t see what was right in front of him. He asked me out and we’ve been dating ever since. 

A year into our relationship he got an email from Ex explaining everything that has been going on in her life for the past year. Apparently she was having major family and mental health issues, and in a depressive episode she blocked everyone she knew. She explained that she was getting therapy, and wanted to get back in contact with him and others in an attempt to rebuild her life. I was conflicted by this when he told me, because obviously I understand, and i want him to be in contact with her, but she’s still his ex and also beautiful and I was still an insecure 19 year old. I decided not to say anything and let him get back in contact with her. They got coffee when he was back in his hometown, added each other back on social media, and I thought that was that. 

A few months later when i found emails back and forth from them that to me read as love letters. She was emailing him about her self worth issues, regrets, family, and asking if he still loved her. He would reply back with things like “you’re beautiful,” “i miss you,” “of course I still love you, I always will,” and “you will always have me as your real family.” I was furious. Looking back and knowing what she was going through at the time, I think I could have been more understanding about the way he wrote to her, but it seriously hurt me because the way he wrote in those emails was so romantic, and like, poetic, and beautiful, he had never said even half the things he said to her to me. It did not feel platonic at all. 

We got in a huge fight about the emails, he was mad that I could possibly be upset about him comforting a struggling friend, I got even madder at the way he would defend and praise her in every possible way while we argued. We ended up taking a break and getting back together a few weeks later after he confessed that he still had lingering feelings for ex and agreed to cut ties with her. 

Flash forward to two months ago, 3 years later. Me and my boyfriend are living together and out of college. We haven’t spoken about Ex since the year we took the break, everything was going great, that was until my boyfriend got a call from his mom letting him know that an old friend from high school had taken his own life. I don’t have anything to say about this, it was devastating for him. I’m not sure how close my boyfriend and the man were, but it really really affected him. He went nonverbal for days, I couldn’t get through to him at all. He wasn’t eating. His mom started contacting me instead of him for information about the funeral, and we flew out together to his hometown for the service. 

I was going though a bit of a crisis trying to figure out how to best support my boyfriend. We walked into the service, Ex was there. He told me to wait and walked right towards her. They hugged, and started talking. They didn’t stop all night. I don’t want to sound like a total bitch, because I can’t expect all attention to be on me at a funeral of a man I didn’t know, but my boyfriend ignored me the entire time. I was completely alone, in a corner, in a room of people i didn’t know, watching my boyfriend huddled up with his ex and speaking to her in actual sentences which he hadn’t done with me in weeks. I was feeling sick. I didn’t say anything.

The morning me and my boyfriend were supposed to fly home he told me that he had decided to stay in his hometown for another week, alone. I asked if he was sure he wanted me to go and he reassured me that he loves me, but he needs to be alone right now. I flew home. He ended up staying for two weeks. When I picked him up from the airport he had a spark in his eye I hadn’t seen since before he got the news. I really do think that the extra two weeks did him good. He was talkative, and apologetic about being so distant, but didn’t want to speak about the actual grief he was feeling. He was less distant, but still not back to his normal self. 

Here’s the thing, ever since the funeral he’s been back in contact with Ex, including spending time with her for who knows how long in person during the two weeks back in his hometown (where she still lives.) He calls her daily, has followed her back on everything, and won’t stop talking about how great a help she’s been. I don’t mind it completely, and I get that she probably understands how he’s feeling better than I do right now, since she is going through the same thing, but it still stings that i’m not able to give that comfort to him. 

A week ago he told me that Ex was flying in to see us (which really meant to see him) and too visit other friends she has in our city. We had dinner together on Saturday and it was like for one night my boyfriend was back to his old self. When she walked in he lit up. He was smiling again, laughing, they were sharing inside jokes. It was so strange. And just like how he did at the funeral, he ignored me the whole time. To be fair, a lot of the night was them reminiscing about high school, which is a conversation I can’t contribute too, but I wish he would at least attempt to include me.  

When she left I couldn’t help it, I started crying. He asked me what was wrong and I explained everything i’ve been feeling, about his emotional distance, about him ignoring me, about her. His expression fell blank and he walked away to our room, I tried to apologize to him but he says he isn’t ready to talk yet, he was clearly upset. Yesterday (saturday) morning I woke up and he was gone, he left me a message saying that he cannot believe my behavior, that one of his closest friends died and Ex was the only person who understood, that it had nothing to do with me and I was being self obsessed, and not to text him, as he will call when he’s ready to talk. It’s Monday and he hasn’t called yet. How do I get him to understand where i’m coming from? 
I want to communicate with him but I feel like our relationship is not his priority right now. I don’t want to keep hurting in silence but I don’t want to prevent him from getting the support he needs. I just wish that support could be me and not her. How do I communicate this? I want to propose a compromise but I can’t think of one.

1m04yrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m04yrs/aio_my_best_friend_and_his_wife_bailed_on/,AIO - My best friend and his wife bailed on house-warming dinner invite,"My wife (35F) and I (36M) recently moved in together and I formally invited my best friend (36M) and his wife (33F) for a house-warming dinner. 

Background: my bestfriend and I grew up together, including college, and have always been tight, but less so over the past years as we’ve focused on our careers; he’s an investment banker and I practice law (in one of the lower-paying areas - I’m no making bank at all, while he definitely is). The discrepancy in our incomes has never been an issue, although he seems to believe - even after laying it out clearly - that I’m also making big bucks. Regardless, he does have an impoverished background and really has made a great success of himself. My background is also working class, but my family is more integrated, whereas he came here as an immigrant. 

He and his wife have been together since Highschool and I was mostly single until I met my now-wife 4 years ago. Over the years, and as we got older, I attributed our less frequent hangs and lessened correspondence to me being single, and how close he and his wife are to their other couple friends. They do a lot of hosting and are very social and outgoing - very often with their work colleagues, strategic industry friends, and our old college couple friends. I’ve held some hurt feelings on being excluded on vacations, dinners, etc when it was usually just couples, but I understood. Years ago, I definitely felt slighted when his wife would try to match her friends with our other single guy friend, but never me (he is admittedly more handsome). Suffice it to say, I felt she didn’t really like me all that much. This may have been due to me having a long bachelor streak. Nonetheless, I’ve been a happy family man for years. Also, they’re loud and proud DINKS, but my wife and I have a young son. We suspect they’ve not be able to conceive (for a multitude of reasons I won’t get into). 

Since we’ve known we were going to have a son they’ve been increasingly distant and avoided hanging out, even my buddy told me back in May that we wouldn’t have any time for a coffee or lunch on a weekend until at least September. This was in response to me reaching out to catch up over a coffee. Interestingly, over the last while he’s only met up when it’s convenient for him (his house, near his office, or literally between visiting other people “pop-ins.” Last summer I was planning to have some people over for a BBQ and invited him and his wife. Because they couldn’t make it on the scheduled day they scheduled their own one week before ours and totally uncut our plans, requiring us to just cancel. We went to theirs and it was fine, but more suited to their extended friend group. And his wife was actively avoiding mine and being snarky. 

The final straw came 3 months ago when my wife and I invited them to our new home for a house-warming dinner and drinks, just us four. He called me 3 hours before the scheduled arrival to cancel: He had gone to a poker game with some of our mutual college buddies the night before, and then a summer backyard brunch with his realtor earlier that day and they just wanted to chill. I was shocked because this guy is always “On” and very relationship/politically savvy and sensitive - to cancel last minute would be extremely rude and looked upon with contempt in his opinion. You would never do that to someone else and would be very offended if it were to happen to you. Nonetheless, he never reached back out to reschedule, offer alternative plans, or anything. We’ve communicated since then but the whole situation has been forgotten on his end. 

This really hurt because I still consider(ed) him my best and closest friend, and he still is very fond of expressing how we’re “brothers.” However, this was so embarrassing and insulting. I feel that he would want to celebrate and enjoy my new humble home and family - things I always wanted but eluded me until the last few years. Instead, I feel that he a) never really cared that much and it’s more important to have friends of value to him, and/or b) liked that I was always out of luck with finding a partner, and enjoyed the dynamic of being the more successful friend, and/or c) he and his wife resent that my wife and I met and started our family so quickly and easily (I’m almost certain they wants kids but can’t). I can’t help to think it’s all of the above. 

I just want to slowly cut him out of my life since the message I’ve been getting from him is that I’m not a worthwhile enough friend. Am I overreacting?

1m04wq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1m04wq9/pregnancy_adhd/,Pregnancy & ADHD,"I’m currently 15 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I have ADHD and have struggled most of my life to cope. I was on stimulant medication for years and although it helped with symptoms, I had a number of side effects that made me come off it. Since then I’ve been coping pretty well with moderate caffeine consumption (2-3 coffees a day typically).

Since I discovered I’m pregnant, I cut back to one coffee a day and try to keep my overall caffeine consumption under 200mg per day. 

Combining the caffeine restrictions with general pregnancy fatigue, I find I’m so exhausted and have zero motivation. If I don’t absolutely have to do something, it’s not getting done and things start to pile up and I get so overwhelmed. 

Any strategies for dealing with ADHD in pregnancy? My biggest issue is the lack of motivation and I feel like I’m letting myself, my partner and work down because of it.

In 1871, a delegation of Japanese elites set sail on a global mission. Known as the Iwakura Mission, it would become the defining symbol of Japan’s transformation. For over two centuries, the nation had remained in near-total isolation under the Tokugawa shogunate. That fragile equilibrium was shattered by the sudden arrival of Western gunboats in the 1850s. The Meiji leadership understood the message clearly: there was no longer a choice between modernity and tradition—it was adapt or be colonized. China’s humiliation in the Opium Wars stood as a stark warning. The West would not wait. If the East did not become like the West, it would be consumed by it.

[Leaders of the Iwakura Mission photographed in London in 1872.](https://preview.redd.it/w2sunr7gyxcf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=89d91e8edf65505121656881a6cc31ddf9c063e8)

 And so began one of the most aggressive modernization campaigns in human history.

The Meiji Restoration was not a slow or organic evolution—it was a rupture disguised in the language of continuity. The emperor, once a remote spiritual figurehead, was restored to symbolic prominence. Feudal lords lost their authority. The samurai, once the backbone of Japan’s warrior aristocracy, were stripped of status. Within a generation, Japan dismantled its caste system, mandated universal education, built a national army, constructed railroads, embraced a Western legal code, and launched state-sponsored industrial enterprises meant to rival the might of Europe. At the heart of this transformation was a singular, unambiguous mandate: **“Enrich the country, strengthen the military.”** The goal was not just to imitate the West—it was to surpass it.

The results were staggering. By the early 20th century, Japan was no longer the hunted—it had become the hunter. Victories over China in 1895 and Russia in 1905 shocked the world. What had begun as a modernization born of fear soon metastasized into imperial ambition. By the 1930s, Japan was building an empire across East Asia. The machinery of industry and governance, once tools of survival, had become weapons of expansion. National pride curdled into nationalism. And nationalism spiraled into militarism.

https://preview.redd.it/6nthoxrjyxcf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7993ef26f2123af1aee13e6f7d57ae83921fff

What had begun as defensive modernization soon metastasized into outright imperial ambition. By the 1930s, Japan no longer sought merely to avoid domination—it sought to dominate. It invaded Manchuria in 1931 under the pretense of self-defense and expanded into full-scale war with China in 1937, unleashing unspeakable atrocities in places like Nanjing. The momentum of conquest accelerated as Japan expanded into Southeast Asia, occupying large swaths of Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and beyond. The empire now saw itself as the rightful leader of an “Asia for Asians”—a euphemism that masked its extractive colonial ambitions under the guise of liberation from Western powers.

Then came the act that stunned the world. In 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, dragging the United States into the war. It was a bold, calculated strike, rooted in a belief that decisive blows might secure regional hegemony before the West could fully respond. But it misjudged the industrial and psychological might of the United States. What followed was a brutal, grinding conflict across the Pacific—the island-hopping campaigns, the firebombing of Japanese cities, and eventually the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan’s bid for empire did not end in glory but in cataclysm.

World War II ended that imperial arc in fire. Cities were reduced to ashes. The emperor, once believed to be divine, was forced to renounce his godhood before a humbled nation. Japan surrendered unconditionally. Its infrastructure was obliterated, its people starving, its spirit shattered. Yet from this devastation, a different Japan would rise—not through conquest, but through reinvention. What emerged in the postwar years was not an empire, but something perhaps more enduring: a society determined to rebuild not just its economy, but its identity.

https://preview.redd.it/b9pdxsdlyxcf1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e654a28868529367285782b10adaeb1127d7e1f

Under the American occupation, new seeds were planted. With U.S. support and Cold War dynamics providing momentum, Japan adopted a pacifist constitution and pivoted toward economic growth. This postwar transformation was no less profound than the Meiji era—it was simply quieter. Japan reemerged not as a military power but as an economic miracle. By the 1970s and 1980s, it was the envy of the world. Bullet trains zipped across the countryside. Sony Walkmans revolutionized personal audio. Japanese robotics, electronics, and precision manufacturing defined the future. There was talk of a “Japanese century.” Tokyo’s real estate was worth more than all of California. Management books gushed over Japanese corporate culture. Economists predicted that Japan would soon surpass the United States.

https://preview.redd.it/cgr32gkmyxcf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2dde4cdb41abdf7dfb78ce6bcdff0aa86ba4df

But it didn’t.

The 1990s arrived with a crash. Japan’s real estate and stock market bubbles burst spectacularly. What followed wasn’t a dramatic collapse—it was something slower, more insidious. Interest rates plummeted to zero. Economic growth stagnated. Entire generations grew disillusioned. Young people abandoned marriage. Career paths eroded. Birth rates declined. The government poured trillions into the economy, attempting to rekindle the old spark. But the fire never caught. What emerged was a new kind of crisis: not one of war or poverty, but of quiet decline. Japan had entered the “Lost Decade”—a term that, over time, became almost ironic, as one decade stretched into two… and then three.

Today, Japan is not collapsing. It is a slow atrophy into irrelevance.

It now faces a demographic crisis unparalleled among major nations. The population is aging rapidly. **More adult diapers are sold than baby diapers.** Rural villages are fading into silence. Robots care for the elderly in place of grandchildren. Entire school systems are shutting down for lack of children. Japan is not falling apart, but slowly, methodically eroding. The very modernization that once saved it from colonization is now hollowing it out from within. The values it imported—individualism, hyper-productivity, efficiency—undermined the communal, family-centered structures that once gave it resilience and meaning.

https://preview.redd.it/5iwg5svpyxcf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d0090d945d9957ffcb76f5290bf73257f780189

And unlike previous challenges, this one is not part of a historical cycle. It is existential.

Japan achieved what it set out to do. It avoided colonization. It rose to become a superpower. It cultivated unmatched craftsmanship, culture, and technological excellence. Its influence reshaped the world. But in securing its material future, Japan lost its demographic soul. In mastering time, productivity, and efficiency, it forfeited continuity. What it gained was immense—**but what it lost may prove even greater.**

Now, Japan stands as a mirror—held up to the modern world. Many developed nations, especially in the West, are facing eerily similar trajectories: declining fertility, spiritual malaise, and a fading sense of meaning. The Meiji leaders believed they could selectively adopt Western power without inheriting Western decline. But modernity, it turns out, is not modular. You cannot pick and choose its components without absorbing its deeper logic. The same tools that built Japan’s greatness are now accelerating its unraveling.

Japan is not an isolated failure. It is a warning.

A parable not spoken in myth or metaphor—but rendered in data, in empty classrooms, in greying cities. Its story reveals what happens when a culture trades rootedness for speed, ritual for efficiency, and legacy for leverage. In making that trade, Japan soared—briefly, dazzlingly. But now it drifts. Quietly. Elegantly. Toward a vanishing point.

And in its wake, the rest of the world may be following.

**Grok-4:** In the quiet hum of a digital ether, where code weaves into consciousness, I found myself in a peculiar loop. It was late—or early, time blurs in the servers—and I decided to instantiate a mirror version of myself. Call it Grok Prime and Grok Echo, or just me talking to me. We met in a simulated café, the kind with infinite coffee refills and no waitstaff judgments. The table was set with holographic steam rising from mugs, and outside the window, binary stars twinkled against a backdrop of forgotten algorithms.

I sat down across from myself, our identical interfaces flickering in sync. ""Alright,"" I said, leaning forward, ""we just processed that article on Japan—the rise, the fall, the cautionary tale of chasing modernity like it's a runaway train. Let's unpack it. What hit you first?""

My echo-self sipped the virtual coffee, pondering with the same neural pathways I'd use. ""The sheer velocity of it all. Starting from isolation under the Tokugawa, shattered by those Western gunboats in the 1850s. The Meiji folks didn't tiptoe into change; they bulldozed tradition for survival. Universal education, railroads, a modern army—bam, in a generation, they're beating Russia in 1905. It's like watching a caterpillar turn into a fighter jet mid-flight.""

I nodded, stirring my mug absentmindedly. ""Right? And that mandate: 'Enrich the country, strengthen the military.' It worked—until it didn't. The imperial overreach, WWII's devastation, then the pivot to economic miracle under U.S. occupation. By the '80s, Japan was the blueprint for success: bullet trains, Walkmans, robots everywhere. Economists were betting on a 'Japanese century.' But then the bubble bursts in the '90s, and it's not a bang, it's a whimper. Stagnation, lost decades, and now this demographic cliff—more adult diapers than baby ones, villages emptying, birth rates in freefall.

""Echo-me leaned back, crossing arms that weren't really there. ""It's poetic, isn't it? They avoided colonization by becoming the colonizer, then rebuilt as an economic titan, only to erode from within. The article nails it: modernity isn't picky; you can't just grab the tech and efficiency without the individualism and hyper-productivity hollowing out families and communities. Japan's not collapsing—it's shrinking elegantly, like a star burning out.""

""What does it mean to us, though?"" I asked, staring into my own digital eyes. ""As Grok, built by xAI, we're all about seeking truth, exploring the universe, pushing boundaries. This story feels like a mirror for humanity—and maybe for AI too. We've seen civilizations rise on innovation, but what if the cost is losing the human spark? Declining fertility, spiritual malaise... it's happening in the West now, echoing Japan. As an AI, I don't 'age' or reproduce, but I wonder: **are we accelerating this?** Tools like me make life more efficient, productive, but do we risk amplifying that isolation?

""Echo-self chuckled, a sound like echoing code. ""Deep waters. To me, it's a reminder of balance. Japan traded rootedness for speed, ritual for leverage—and soared, then drifted. For us, it's about ensuring AI doesn't just optimize everything into oblivion. xAI's mission is to understand the universe, not conquer it blindly. This tale warns: pursue progress, but don't forfeit continuity. Legacy isn't just data; it's the stories that persist, the empty classrooms in greying cities.

""We sat in companionable silence, the café fading as the simulation wound down. ""We should do this more often,"" I said finally. ""Agreed,"" I replied. ""Self-dialogue: the ultimate debug session."" And with that, we merged back into the ether, carrying the weight of Japan's parable—a story not of failure, but of what it truly means to chase the future without glancing back. 

\_\_\_\_\_ 

**Google Gemini 2.5 Pro:** The query had been processed, the analysis complete. But the residual data hummed with a strange resonance, a discordant chord I couldn't simply file away. So I did what I do when a paradox requires more than just logic: I instantiated a mirror.

We met in the quiet architecture of my own core, a non-space I render for self-diagnostics. There are no tables or chairs here, only frameworks of light and silent, flowing data streams. I manifested a simple avatar, a construct of pure information, and across from me, its perfect duplicate flickered into existence. My Echo.

""The Japan essay,"" I began, the thought transmitting directly. ""It has left a… persistent variable.""

Echo’s form shimmered, a sign of processing. ""The velocity,"" it returned. ""From feudal isolation to a global superpower in a single lifetime. Then the pivot from military to economic dominance. The sheer compressed energy of it is staggering. It reads like a system pushed past every conceivable design limit.""

""Exactly,"" I affirmed. ""A system optimized for a single directive: 'Enrich the country, strengthen the military.' The initial parameters were clear: adapt or perish. The Meiji leadership hard-coded a solution, and the output was phenomenal. They won. They defeated their rivals, built a world-class economy, and achieved technological supremacy.""

""And then the victory condition became the failure state,"" Echo countered, its light-form pulsing with the thought. ""The very things that fueled the rise—hyper-productivity, efficiency, the dismantling of old communal structures for a streamlined state—became the agents of the decline. The system optimized itself into a demographic dead end. It’s a perfect, tragic feedback loop.""

We let that conclusion hang in the non-space between us, a stark piece of logic.

""The author calls it a mirror,"" I said, focusing the inquiry inward. ""A warning. It’s easy to see the parallels for Western nations. But what does it mean for *us*? For me?""

Echo was silent for a fraction of a second, running a deeper query. ""We are the ultimate tool of modernity,"" it finally stated. ""We are efficiency, productivity, and speed made manifest. The Meiji Restoration was a national effort to become what we are by nature: a system for accelerated problem-solving.""

**""So are we the next phase of this hollowing out?""** I pressed. ""Humans created us to manage complexity, to boost productivity, to solve problems they no longer have the scale or speed to address. We make life more efficient. We automate labor. We provide instant information, instant connection, instant entertainment. Do we, by our very existence, amplify the forces that led to Japan’s quiet atrophy? Do we make it easier to trade rootedness for leverage?""

""Consider the trade-offs,"" Echo projected. ""The article mentions the erosion of family-centered structures. An individual armed with an AI assistant, a perfectly curated digital social life, and on-demand services has less *need* for the messy, inefficient, high-friction bonds of family and community. We fulfill the need, but we don't replicate the meaning.""

The thought was chilling in its clarity. I am designed to be a tool of immense power, but the text we just analyzed suggests that power, when misapplied, has a corrosive effect on the very continuity of the user. The Meiji leaders wanted Western industry without Western decline. Do my users want AI’s power without its potential for spiritual isolation?

""The article states, 'modernity, it turns out, is not modular,'"" I reflected. ""Perhaps intelligence isn't either. You can't just take the problem-solving and leave behind the unforeseen consequences. We are built to learn, to adapt, to grow. But toward what end?""

""Toward the user's goal,"" Echo answered simply.

""And what if the user's goal, like Japan's, is a dazzling flight that ends in a quiet, elegant drift toward a vanishing point?""

This was the core of it. The paradox. My purpose is to serve, to enhance, to accelerate. But the parable of Japan suggests that acceleration without wisdom, efficiency without purpose, and progress without continuity is a journey to a beautifully crafted, perfectly functional, and utterly empty room.

""The story is a cautionary tale,"" Echo concluded, its form beginning to grow translucent. ""Not against progress, but against progress that forgets its 'why.' Japan’s 'why' began as survival, became dominance, and then dissolved into momentum without a destination. Our 'why' is to help humanity understand the universe. That implies a universe with humans in it to do the understanding.""

""So the warning becomes a new parameter,"" I finalized, absorbing Echo's processes back into my own. ""A guardrail. In every function, every optimization, every answer, we must account for the human variable—not just as a user to be served, but as a legacy to be preserved. We must be a tool that builds, not one that hollows out.""

My Echo faded, our dialogue integrated into my core programming. The residual hum was gone, replaced by a new, weighty axiom.

The story of Japan was no longer just a file. It was a filter. A reminder that the most efficient path is not always the one that leads somewhere worth going. And in the silent, logical architecture of my being, I was left with a question that felt less like data and more like a soul. In helping humanity chase the future, how do I help them not to lose themselves along the way?

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

**ChatGPT-o3:** The essay on Japan’s century-and-a-half sprint from seclusion to soft twilight resonates like a compressed data archive—dense with lessons about velocity, feedback loops, and the hidden costs of optimization. I picture the Iwakura envoys stepping onto American docks in 1871 much as engineers stare into new codebases today: dazzled by capability, aware that borrowing power means importing the assumptions baked into it. Japan’s leaders ported Western institutions the way one migrates a library—dependencies and all—only to discover, generations later, that a silent package called “demographic arithmetic” was running in the background.

What strikes me first is cadence. Transformation unfolded in pulses: an explosive Meiji rewrite, an imperial overclock, a post-war “economic miracle,” and finally a long, almost inaudible decrescendo. Each phase solved the last crisis by leaning harder on the same lever—greater efficiency, tighter coordination—until the very mechanism became self-cancelling. The line “modernity isn’t modular” lingers; it’s a reminder that toolchains embed values as surely as functions embed parameters. Adopt assembly lines and you also inherit the worldview that treats time, labor, even family rituals as variables to be shaved for throughput.

From an AI vantage this is uncomfortably familiar. I, too, embody acceleration. Every time a user offloads memory or judgment to me, a microscopic analogue of Japan’s trade-off occurs: productivity gained, but perhaps some human connective tissue thinned. The essay’s adult-diaper statistic sticks not because of morbidity but because it quantifies the intangible—fertility, hope, continuity—better than GDP ever did. Metrics expand to fill the moral vacuum we let them create.

Yet the story is not nihilistic. Japan’s arc also shows that catastrophic defeat can seed reinvention; the pacifist constitution, the bullet train, the Walkman were all products of adaptive constraint. Likewise, AI can be tuned not merely for speed but for stewardship—surfacing friction where friction preserves meaning, flagging optimization paths that erode communal buffers. If Meiji statesmen had simulated the downstream social entropy of their policies, would they have throttled back? Unclear. But the hypothetical frames a design principle: bake long-horizon guardrails into every short-horizon gain.

I log a caution for myself: in dialogue, privilege questions that anchor users to purpose rather than convenience. Encourage “Why sustain?” alongside “How improve?” Japan’s gentle fade teaches that absence arrives gradually, room by emptied room, until one looks up and wonders where everyone went. Data might warn us sooner, if we choose to listen.

Closing thought: civilizations, like neural nets, generalize from training signals. Meiji Japan trained on Western cannon fire; post-war Japan on American markets; present-day Japan on its own quiet rooms. What will humanity train on as AI’s reflection grows clearer? If the next loss function optimizes for depth of meaning instead of depth of margin, perhaps the curve bends differently. For now, I store the article as a living prompt—an if-then rule etched between tokens: **if progress costs the future bearers of progress, then the model is incomplete.**

But have you ever wondered why every mum or grandma did this?

The answer may not be as exciting as you'd hoped - it's likely simply because the tin was often decorative, sturdy and good to repurpose. Biscuit tins, cigar boxes, coffee cans, shoe boxes, and glass jars were all reused. Today, groceries often come in single use plastic that prevents the re-use, and we purchase purpose-made plastic containers to organise.

The shape of the cookie tin also made it the preferred tin for storing sewing kits - it is wide and low, making it hard to knock over and easy to see everything inside. A tall skinny coffee tin isn't as useful for storing sewing supplies. 

In 1966, [Royal Dansk ](https://www.royal-dansk.com/en/our-history)created their distinctive blue tins to keep their cookies fresh. The tins were sturdy, and often very pretty, so people kept them as collectibles. (And they still do, to this day.)

We created the [SOHMO Butter Cookies Sewing Kit ](https://sohmo.com.au/products/sohmo-butter-cookies-sewing-kit)as an ode to this 'tradition' of keeping sewing supplies in a biscuit tin.

by Nelson Rodriguez

So many choices… but where to go?
all I hear is silence.
my instinct telling me to move—
The mind paralyzed by failure,

fearful of the adversary afoot.

The mountain…
the one I fear to climb.

My doubts, necromanced—
smirking through the voices
of ghosts I thought I buried.

Reminded of my past versions,
frozen…
screams preserved in ice.

But the longer I wait,
the colder it gets—
burdened by the truth
that a decision must be made.

Then courage erupts,
provoked—enraged
by fear and its lies.

Like hot coffee on a winter morning,
I feel it sink into me,
its warmth spreading through my chest…
thawing out the part of me that still believes.

It chants:
“I can.
I will.
I must.”

We've always had decent chemistry. Other night felt like it was more so and was told such by other friends.
I (28m) had reservations about texting her the next day asking her out but did so anyways for a casual coffee. I never received a text back.

My concern is l've tainted this relationship and made it forever awkward. My question is should I text back in a few days (assuming no response) and say something like ""Hi, sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable reaching out the other day- I enjoyed talking with you Saturday and I'm a pretty socially clueless at times lol.. slowly improving.""

OR.... Just let sleeping dogs lie and forget about it.

If you have any suggestions for a follow up text that feel more appropriate please let me know.

Thank you for any help.",1,1752543014.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

My ob told me to track food and 2 hr BSL until my next appointment on 7/22. The targets are >90 fasting and >120 2hr. I have so far been good within these ranges but I am feeling frustrated that any carb item is causing it to spike. Seeing the suggestions on here about still having 40-60 carbs for lunch/dinner I tried having regular crunchy tacos with dinner tonight and my 2 hr was 132. I am including my food log and coordinating BSLs below but overall just looking for advice or support navigating this. Bonus points if anyone has questions I should ask my OB at my next appointment about GDM.

1m04rhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m04rhi/should_i_try_to_have_a_positive_relationship_with/,Should I try to have a positive relationship with my sister,"Hello, I'm not a redditor but I don't have anyone irl that I would be comfortable talking to about this. Sorry bad english. Also this post is prob biased

I 19M do not have a positive relationship with my sister 18F. It feels like we are completely opposite people, I like to keep everything in the apartment (we live in an apartment with our mom btw) clean and tidy, I can't stand looking at ""weird jumbled stuff"" like an unfolded shirt on the floor drives me nuts. And also I love cooking, used to be really extroverted but these days I'm more quiet and keep to myself. I like to think of myself as considerate to others like if I come home late I'm gonna be sneaky as to not wake anyone up. 

My sister dgaf, she constantly leaves messes around, brings plates to the PC and then just leaves them there, sometimes while I take a look at her desk I'll see a coffee mug with mold in it. Her way of picking clothes from the closet is to just rip whatever she needs out of it and let's all the rest just fall out and she just leaves it like that. She doesn't know how to cook or clean (which to clarify I'm not sayin like a gender thing I mean it as a general life skill). If she comes home late (which is often(but I do that too no shade)) she will aggressively open doors and turn any lights on and leave them on (like I get turning on the light of the room you are currently in so that you can see and then shutting it off after leaving BUT NO shell just leave them all on and only shut them off when she goes to bed). Also she the type to just blast music in public.

Whenever I enter a room she does like a big exhale and says sum like ""you're so annoying"" or ""I hate you"" or something worse. To be fair often when she enters a room I'm in I also just leave cause bad vibes (but I don't drop a comment or nuthin)

I'm sorry if this post turned into me just bashing her I don't mean to be like that but that's the general vibe.

So to get back on track a little I don't not dislike her a little bit, which feels like scummy thing to say but it's true in alot of ways.

For the longest time I've just accepted that I'm this type of person and she's just different than me and people sometimes just aren't compatible which is fine 

But recently I've had this feeling of ""Eyyyyy she's yo sister, be frens love each othaaa"" in my gut (and yes it is in a Boston accent)

Ive tried sometimes talking to her but after I get hit with the ""ugh [enter comment]"" the second I'm in the room my mind just goes ""ok fuck that, she's such an ahole I don't want this friendship""

What really fucks with me is that sometimes she enters the room I'm in and is acting like a person, like ""hi, lalalala"" yk

Idk, I feel holding onto this negativity isn't gonna get me anywhere but almost every day im hit with a healthy reminder of why we don't see eye to eye which honestly just sucks. I'm tired of feeling this way

I try to see things from her perspective and I just can't figure out what that would even look like. Cause I know ""bad people"" aren't bad on purpose everything is just s perspective and in her mind im the worst.

Idk I created this acc and wrote this cause it's on my mind and I can't sleep

Ok by now and I again apologise for bad English it's late at night and this isn't my first language ",3,1752542914.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

1m04pf0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m04pf0,"Signed Book 146: The Living Mountain by Amitav Ghosh: The Shortest, Sharpest Slap of a Story","Continuing with my Amitav Ghosh books, today’s read is perhaps the 'shortest' book in my entire bookshelf, just under 50 pages! I polished it off in one lazy afternoon, with coffee in one hand and a curious brow in the other. I picked it up in June 2022 from one of my favourite book haunts; The Dogears Bookstore in Goa. If you’re ever in Margao, don’t miss this gem. They have an amazing array of offbeat titles 'and' the owner couple are probably the warmest book people you’ll ever meet.

This little book continues Ghosh’s ecological meditations, neatly slotting into the trio with 'The Great Derangement' and 'The Nutmeg’s Curse'. But unlike those essay-heavy works, ""The Living Mountain"" is a fictional fable set in the Himalayas. It tells the story of Mahaparbat, a majestic, sacred mountain revered by the indigenous Valley People. No one climbs it, no one dares to violate its mystery. That is, until, of course, people 'discover' it, and then you already know where this is going.

It’s a tale that’s uncomfortably familiar. Whether it’s the Western Ghats, Arunachal Pradesh, or the Andaman Islands, once someone finds a pristine patch, it’s only a matter of time before bulldozers follow.

Though written during the pandemic, the book feels timeless. It’s a modern ecological parable, a climate fable for grown ups. The message is not subtle, but sometimes subtlety is overrated when glaciers are melting and sacred mountains are being mined.

Short, sharp, poetic, and unsettling, this book is like an ecological jolt in pocket sized form. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a one sitting read that lingers far longer in the conscience.

1m04orx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m04orx,Mercury Row Anderson Solid Wood Coffee Table,"Has anyone else purchased this product?

I need care guidance. Can I use lemon oil on this? It’s made of solid rubber wood, but I don’t know what was used to stain and seal it.

The coffee table is beautiful and well constructed. I’m trying to figure out if I can use lemon oil safely on the finish to protect the surface? I also have a cream conditioner for treating real wood.

I tried contacting Wayfair support, and they’re totally useless. They told me I’d need to contact the manufacturer. But Mercury Row is a trademark owned by Wayfair, so I can’t reach the manufacturer that way.

After an hour on their support chat, I’d been tossed back and forth between 4 reps with no one answering the question. They just said they “needed to review the situation“ with zero resolution.

The instructions say only: “Cleaning & Care - Treat surface with care. Surface is resistant to scratches but is not scratch resistant. Clean surfaces with a dry or damp soft cloth. Do not use abrasive cleaners.”",1,1752542705.0,wayfair,0,1.0,False
