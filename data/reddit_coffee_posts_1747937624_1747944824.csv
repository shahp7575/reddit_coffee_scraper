Thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :)

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant, coupled with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book, playing a couple games & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, and catching the sunset.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", Family Guy and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! 

If I sound like your kind of person, I would love to hear from you!

Which works great for my mood but I'm back to feeling like a zombie again.

I tried to tell this to my doctor but they just upped the dosage on welbutrin.

But how bad would it be for me to take stimulants? I assumed it would just be a strattera thing. I already run on coffee etc and I never get the jitters or anything like that.

Hey there! I'm 33 and based in Michigan. I’m mostly looking for long-term chat friends to build a genuine connection with — but I’m also open to seeing where things go if we click.

A little about me: I’ve got the whole “adulting” thing down pretty well — career, bills, responsibilities, etc. But when it comes to my personal life, I really appreciate a slower, quieter pace. I’m definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable with someone, my silly and sarcastic side comes out a lot.

I don’t have kids but I’m open to them. I’m also not religious, in case that matters to you.

Some of my favorite things:

Watching sports (especially when there's a good game on)

Trash TV — the messier, the better

Reading (fiction, nonfiction, anything interesting)

Cooking (bonus if you like swapping recipes)

And of course... coffee. It's practically a personality trait at this point.

If you’re someone who enjoys relaxed conversation, appreciates a bit of dry humor, and is also looking for something meaningful (even if it's just a solid friendship), feel free to reach out!",1,1747944575.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

# **About Me (Expanded Edition):**

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call.)

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to forgetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

**First Time Poly Character**— while my quest is to seal the deal and have a family, I am all about exploration and character development.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**—I need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**—If your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who’ll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**—whether it’s a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world’s largest ball of yarn.

# **The Quest:**

If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:“Hi” + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I’ll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG’s color pie over coffee.

Let’s write a story where we both get the happy ending. (*And maybe a few detours along the way*)

TLDR: no clue how to tell if my close friend is into me/how to tell him I am into him while I am living out of state for the next eight months.
Some background.

We (funnily enough) met off a dating app. I had asked him out but he told me he was only interested in being friends for the time being, which was fine. He noted that it takes him a while to develop feeling romantically but still really liked me on a personal level. We would hang out once a twice a week for months. My feelings waited by early January, and there was a point where the idea of dating him sounded insane to him even.

In late February/early March, I moved across the country for a year long internship. Before I moved him and I spent a full day together, which caused more feelings to creep up, but nothing major. I moved about 1000 miles away, and of course a month or two into it I realized I fell for him HARD again, increased tenfold from when I was living in town.

He is always super sweet to me, always a good ear when I need to talk to someone. We both have the same sense of humor, and many shared interests. Some things he has said since we started being friends read as flirting, but as far as I know he isn’t into me. He also has stated in the past a disinterest in long distance relationships, which I share. 

Whenever we go out, he always tries to pick up the bill and most times I’ve insisted we split (unless he got his credit card to the waiter before I could lol). I am in college still (started late) , and my internship doesn’t pay AMAZINGLY but I can still afford going out, so I don’t know why he would do this past the weird man need to pay for girls they are interested in.

A few weekends ago, I visited back home for the first time since I moved. He got coffee with another close friend of mine. We were browsing a shop after and I asked him about his love life (as I had mentioned a failed fling back where I live at the moment.). He kind of clammed up and went “well it isn’t a priority for me right now, it is what it is.” Which. Okay Mr Vague! I dropped it, and the night went on normally (past the usual friendly teasing and banter we do.) My other friend later commented to me that he treated/talked to me differently than he does me, which I have slowly picked up on the past little bit.

The next evening, him and I got dinner. The first fifteen minutes of the evening were full with a weird awkward silence that was not there the previous day, but it might have just been me? We get back into a groove and go to dinner (we were walking around an art market before lol), and he AGAIN slaps down his credit card before I can pull out mine. I told him I could pay, he told me not to worry about it. He then made a joke about me doing the “omg don’t pay for me!” thing that girls do and I rolled my eyes. 

We got drinks after and after I mentioned I was coming to town again in July, he told me I could crash at his place (I previously joked in this conversation getting an Airbnb to avoid fights with my mom while I was in town). He then proceeded to invite me on the bar crawl him and his band after their house show I was going to. Immediately followed by saying he was going to visit me beginning of next year, right before I come home from my internship.

I keep feeling like I am delusional, I don’t think he’s romantically interested, but at the same time he constantly does things that could be read as flirting/as him being into me.

I had told him a while back about someone I was briefly into I was friends with and how I didn’t want to ruin that friendship by telling them.  He told me it could turn out good for me/if they were an adult about it things should not change but I don’t know.

Another friend told me I should tell him the next time I visit & state if we were to try to date (if he’s interested) that it would be after I move back due to not liking LDRs but I’m still chicken shit. I have no clue if he even is into me and hiding the fact that I am makes me feel like I’m going insane

So…how do I tell if he’s into me and how do I tell him I have feelings for him 😵‍💫?",2,1747943936.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

The coffee maker I got for $60 was listed at $35 elsewhere. Still, I wanted to build credit, so I made my first payment early and noticed it showed up on my report already through WebBank, which surprised me.

The interest rate is pretty rough if you don’t pay it off fast, though. I can see how people fall into the trap of thinking it’s “easy credit” and then end up stuck with high payments.

I know myself, and working a 9-5 and being a parent may not be possible for me. I’m already exhausted all the time, no matter what I do or where I go I know I’ll eventually burnout, and job hopping just isn’t for me. 

I really want to have kids, and be able to spend enough time with them that they deserve, going back into an office 4 months postpartum seems like a nightmare. I have to hand my baby off to be raised by somebody else, and even when they grow up It won’t be any better. 

Research shows the average working person has about 5 hours of free time a day—where does life actually fit into there??! Where can kids fit in, let alone yourself, your partner, other family and friends? Life shouldn’t be like this, I don’t know how working parents do it, especially ones who are single and/or have no support system. 

My mental health, physical health and thoughts about the future has become even worse since my job had us come back to being full-time, citing “being in the office full time makes for a stronger work culture, better relationships with colleagues and better innovation to better serve our clients”. The CEO is so out of touch and talks out his ass about WFH is bad because people aren’t talking at the coffee machine anymore—AS IF WE WEREN’T HYBRID AND PEOPLE WERE. Then he wanted to go on about how first responders work full time so why can’t we, as if first responders aren’t fighting for a better work-life balance themselves. 

Humanity may have advanced over the centuries but the systems of oppression are still the same. The haves and the have nots, the rich and the poor, the growing wealth gap. When will it be taken seriously that none of this is feasible long-term for anyone? Hasn’t history and what’s happening now taught us anything?? 

Screw this rat race, screw climbing the social and corporate ladder and productivity hacks, none of it truly matters when this is the way things are. Even working for yourself is barely even better in this system. This feels like hell on earth. I truly envy the privileged who don’t have to sacrifice as much to have a decent life.

I’m sorry this is all over the place, I really don’t think I’m doing well and I’m not sure I ever will.

Need help managing SVT, stimulants, and lifestyle conflicts (Posting again due to no reach last time)","I’m a 23-year-old guy living with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) and ADHD, and I could really use some insight from anyone who has dealt with a similar situation—patients, doctors, or med students.

Here’s my situation:

I get SVT (tachycardia) episodes roughly once every 3 to 4 months, sometimes more often if I gain weight.

Episodes seem to be triggered randomly but are more likely when I’m stressed, sleep-deprived, or heavier.

Surgery or ablation is not an option for now.

No family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes.


Complicating factors:

I have ADHD, and while I’m not on stimulants, I depend on black coffee to function and I smoke. I know both are risky with WPW.

I work out 5 to 6 times a week, follow intermittent fasting, and try to stay fit, but energy and focus are a daily challenge.


What I’m looking for:

1. Anyone managing WPW long-term without surgery, how do you handle it?


2. Alternatives to stimulants (nicotine, caffeine) that help with energy or ADHD focus


3. Experience with non-stimulant ADHD meds like Atomoxetine or Guanfacine


4. Supplements or routines that have helped keep your heart stable


5. How do you balance ADHD brain, heart risk, and fitness goals?

6. During an SVT episode, is there anything that helps you calm your heart rate down safely at home? Any techniques, meds (prescribed), or practices that actually work?



Would love to hear from anyone juggling similar issues or medical professionals who have seen this overlap.

Thanks in advance. I genuinely appreciate any guidance or shared experience.

TL;DR:
23M with WPW syndrome and ADHD. SVT episodes every few months. Can’t go for surgery yet. I smoke and rely on black coffee but trying to find safer alternatives for energy and focus. Looking for advice on managing heart health, ADHD, and fitness without stimulants.

I appreciate there's lots of posts asking about what equipment should I buy. This is broadly similar but it's more just advice on general buying advice.

Being a middle aged man in search of a hobby I've naturally decided that I need to get myself a nice-ish coffee machine for the house. looking to spend around £800 which to me feels expensive but after reading this sub for a few months I've learned that this is fairly entry level when factoring in grinder etc.
I'm more or less between going down the idiot proof route and getting a barista express impress, or going down the tried and tested Bambino plus along with a grinder like the baratza 270 (I like the look of the df54 or 64 but seems harder to get here).

Anyway what I mainly what to get advice on is- am I misunderstanding my own requirements (and buying a machine for the sake of it).
I don't drink shots of espresso, I currently have an aeropress so assume this is the equivalent of filter coffee. The likelihood is I'll be making mostly Americanos, and at the weekend being more adventurous with a couple of flat whites. I'll probably learn to make my wife latte's but in general the vast majority of my use will be plain old Americano. Am I vastly under utilising or just plain mis -using an espresso machine in this case?

I really don't want to be also boiling a kettle etc and want something that will also do the hot water. Also I'll still have an aeropress at work so will want to do a courser grind on the 2 days a week I'm in the office so looking for a small amount of flexibility in the grinder.

Hopefully the question makes sense. I've essentially decided that I want a ""nice coffee machine"" and went down the rabbit hole but now concerned I'm buying something that isn't really meant for my use case.",3,1747943341.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

We messaged constantly for months, got vulnerable, and eventually met in person. It wasn’t just physical — we went on a date, cuddled, talked deeply, bought me coffee and food in the morning, went to the drugstore to buy me my face moisturiser that I forgot home, he held my hand while walking me to the station… it felt real and genuine.

Turns out? He and his “ex” were “on a break” for 3 weeks and they never actually broke up. In fact, a few months after we met, turns out they got engaged six months ago — and all along, he was talking to us both, feeding each of us a different story.

I was never the side chick. I was the filler ego boost while he tried to control both of us. A clown playing house with one woman while lining up backup with another. Classic coward move.

When he was exposed he started to spiral. He told her he had no intention of meeting me, just wanted the “R-rated” part. But he did meet me and it wasn’t a one-night stand either. He lied to both of us.

I didn’t lift a finger but I hope he wakes up every day terrified of what I might expose. Because trust me, I could expose just enough to ruin his whole reputation back home. But I don’t need to. He’s already buried in his own lies.

Even with my level of tolerance, however, I discovered something that makes me feel like a classy übermensch for at least a couple of hours. It tastes pretty good, too.

Thus, I present: 

##The Transatlantic

If you want this drink in its proper form, here’s what it is: **A black tea latte with two shots of espresso (and one teaspoon [~two pumps] of vanilla syrup for taste).**

**If you want to know why this works on a flavor level, here’s my explanation:**

Espresso and milk is a good flavor combination. So is black tea and milk. That second point is one of the only culinary things the British have ever gotten right en masse. Both of these flavor profiles are similar enough to where they work together, but different enough to make the flavor interesting and complex.

**Here’s the rundown in terms of energy:**

In total, you’re looking at 166 mg of caffeine, or 190 mg at Starbucks. However, that number is misleading for how much energy you will get from it. That’s because of the l-theanine you get from the Black Tea, which tempers the caffeine’s energy into more of a focused state. It’s kind of like comparing a lamp to a laser.

**If you’re on a budget, here’s how you can (kind of) make it at home:**

1. Make a cup of black tea.

2. Add milk or whatever milk substitute you use.

3. Add instant coffee (a little more than enough for one cup). Because this is a mixed drink, most of the off-notes of the instant coffee will be covered up.

4. Add sugar to taste

I told him about fixing four-wheelers and going fishing together when I was a kid. He always believed in me, even when no one else did.

She chased me for months, even after I told her I wasn’t interested in being in a relationship with anyone. We ended up dating for a year and a half.

When she recently reached out after seeing a bunch of our old memories on Snapchat, she told me she had started to resent me back then. She said it was because I didn’t put in any effort while she was constantly the one pursuing me, even though I did put in effort throughout our actual relationship.

She also said that I only started to really see her once she made it clear she wanted to be physical. I was her first, and she was mine. At the time, I thought she only wanted that to get over me, but after it happened, I realized I was actually in love with her. I also felt regretful for not asking her to be my girlfriend before we got physical. I had planned to ask, but she ended up asking me first. Of course, I said yes.

Before that, when she had asked multiple times about being together, I told her I just wanted to be friends. That was before we got physical. But once that happened, I felt like I was madly in love with her.

I’ve had women approach me before, but never anyone who fought for me like she did. It’s crazy because I ended up in the position girls are usually in, being the one who’s chased.

She also pointed out how her new boyfriend plans every single date, while I never did that when we were first talking. She mentioned how she always had to ask me to hang out and how I would often cancel. Now, her new boyfriend plans big, thoughtful dates and things like that.

Then she said she wanted to break up because she was moving far away and couldn’t commit to a long-distance relationship. She told me she wanted to explore her options in the new city. But it turns out I was wrong about her reasons, because she started dating the first guy who approached her in a coffee shop. And she had been approached before. What devastated me the most was finding out that just one month after our breakup, she started a relationship that is actually an even longer long-distance situation than what she would have had with me. Also her new boyfriend looks awful a lot worse than me. There are definitely better looking dudes out there that will provide you the same treatment. I was as well, but bringing up the past isn't how it works, and if you communicated to me about what we needed to work on, I would have, but you didn't.

Since our breakup, she has broken no contact a few times, reaching out every now and then, even though she was the one who ended things.

I am not here for small talk or surface level exchanges. I want a connection where we can both show up fully, no pretences, no filters, just real, honest conversations. It is in those moments when we share what is on our minds without hesitation that we begin to really see and understand each other.

I run my own business, which gives me the freedom to shape my days around the things that matter to me. I spend my time running, hiking, working out, baking, experimenting in the kitchen, travelling when I can, and getting bossed around by my pets who are small, furry reminders that I’m not actually in charge. I like the small pleasures in life, a good coffee, a quiet morning, freshly baked bread but I’m just as drawn to the big ones, like chasing a new adventure or throwing myself into something that makes me feel alive.

What I value most in a connection is emotional depth. It is not just about the big conversations, but also the quieter moments where we truly understand each other without saying much. I am drawn to those who appreciate depth in their interactions, those who are open to vulnerability, who are not afraid to dive into meaningful discussions about life, growth, or even the things that make us wonder. People who value curiosity, kindness, and the balance between thinking deeply and enjoying life’s lighter moments.

1kszugm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1kszugm/my_managers_didnt_answer_when_i_was_trying_to/,My managers didn’t answer when I was trying to find coverage and now I’m being written up.,"Hello Reddit!! I’m just coming down from a meltdown so if something is unclear, I’d be happy to answer questions in the comments. Im a little scattered brained, im going to try to be concise. 

Also quick content warning for Vomiting for any queasy folks out there! 

So I, 19F have been working at an international coffee chain for a little over a year. I have to admit, I’ve had issues with calling out too frequently or on days that inconvenience our staff and manager. Im aware it doesn’t make a difference, my absence is still an issue, but I’ve been struggling with CVS (cyclical vomiting syndrome)  
Basically in the mornings, when I’m stressed; it comes and goes in waves. I get super nauseous and will frequently have to rush to the restroom or nearest trash can to throw up. Sometimes I feel fine afterwards and will go to work anyways or I will push myself to go to work because I’ve already called out too many times, they need me on the schedule, or it’s a holiday/product launch. 
I frequently go to work sick and nauseous, half the time when I do call out my manager will push me to go in anyway. Especially if I didn’t start getting sick 3 hours before the shift, that’s our calling in stipulation. More times than not i will still go in because I feel guilty, even if that means having to throw up in the work bathroom multiple times a shift. It’s something I just have to put up with, and it sucks. Sometimes I can’t just put up with it and I have to convince my manager it’s not one of the power through days. 
I’ve had a many of discussion with my Management about this and I’ve had to procure 3 doctors notes within the past year so I don’t get fired. I’ve already been written up once for calling out. 
To get an idea of the frequency, within a month I will have probably called in 3 times, 2 of which I will just go in later than my original shift time. I also usually work 36-40 hours weekly. 
I feel I should also mention, I’ve never once called in when I wasn’t sick. I’ve never taken a mental health day (even though there are days I wish I fuckin could man) and I’ve never just tried to get out of work to have the day off. 
Now onto this morning. 
I was scheduled from 8am-4pm. I woke up at like 7:15 and immediately had to vom, my head is also pounding because of an ear infection I have. Off the bat, not off to a great start and I have to be at work in 45 minutes. After the third time with my throbbing head hung over my toilet, i decided to check the schedule to see if I could find somebody to cover for me. We have to find coverage if it’s not 3 hours before a shift. 
(I also always offer to buy who ever covers for me a meal, coffee, snack for the covered shift and take one of theirs if it aligns with my next day off). So literally everybody at work is either out of town or only has the one day off. 
My manager was off today and she had been yesterday as well so I called her. My phone service was having problems so I wifi called her twice, used my mom’s phone twice, used the family business phone, and still no answer. I also tried our assistant manager. 
I called the store to let them know I was trying desperately to get a hold of our manager, not only to cover but I would need to tell her as well that I wouldn’t be going in. 
I’m now sobbing and panicking because I know I can’t take showing up to work, my head is spinning, I’m sobbing, vomiting, and hyperventilating in rapid intervals. My coworker who answered is a saint, she assured me that they weren’t going to struggle without me and offered to try to get in touch with management. No luck there. 
My aunt works on the grocery store side of things, she tried to get in touch with the store managers to let them know we couldn’t contact coffee place management. They also arent in today. 
I started freaking out more because it’s 10 past when I needed to be there. I was panicking and sobbing so hard that my aunt went ahead and told coffee house that I wouldn’t be going in today despite not contacting management or finding a replacement. 
The store called back like an hour ago (not my direct managers, just the store)  and said dont even worry about having a doctors note because they are going to consider this a no call no show and I’ll have to sign a write up and have a disciplinary meeting. 
I know this is the result of my choice not to just go in today after not getting a hold of anybody, but I am in no condition to be on my feet for 8 hours and dealing with just everything else. It’s been hell here for a moment. we’ve got people quitting; one of which who does like 50% of my managers job even though he’s not the assistant manager. My manager also has been fucking me over by scheduling me one day off for two weeks by making me work bullshit split hours, guilt tripping me any time I’ve asked for days off or to come in even after I’ve told her I’ve been consecutively sick or flaring up, scheduling me by myself to close on weekends when it’s busy, releasing the new schedule on the last day of the old leaving the upcoming work schedule a mystery untill the day before. This feels like my last straw, but I know this is just a consequence of calling out too late. I feel like a winey little bitch. 
I’m frustrated, with myself and with my management. I don’t know if I should contest the write up, just take it and move on, or just put in my two weeks and find something different. Any and all advice is appreciated!! Please reality check me, if that’s what I need. 
Let me know what yall would do if you were in my position, I don’t know how I should deal with this. I want to be as professional and respectful as possible.

If anyone reading this can point me in the right direction to take further action against the university, it would be greatly appreciated. I've done everything I can to tackle this respectfully and responsibly, but MUN's administration is not competent or reasonable. Share this story and help me get it out there to people who can help me advocate for myself (and other students).

I'm a graduate student in the faculty of psychology at MUN. I started my studies in 2022 but due to a complicated situation was unable to finish my program ""on time"". I met with the School of Graduate Studies, and we came up with a plan to reapply for my program to reset my base funding and effectively ""restart"" the degree. Everything was approved and I thought things were fine.

When you are a graduate student at MUN, you receive base funding from the university, with the option to have your tuition taken out of your payroll. In the Fall of 2024, I opted to do this, and a total of \~$1600 was deducted from my pay between September to December. I filed my request as I've done every year and thought nothing of it.

Then, I went to file my income taxes and noticed that my T2 from the university said I had $0 in eligible tuition fees. I figured it had something to do with the reapplication and this started a chain of emails where I was ignored, gaslit, and misinformed by multiple members of the administration.

First, I contacted the Registrar. They referred to me Finance. They referred me to Cashiers. The Cashiers asked me if I was downloading the correct forms. I verified that I was. They then asked why I would want a different form. I explained that I didn't, and there was an issue with the one I'd received. They said there wasn't an issue. I showed them my T2 from previous years and pointed to the non-zero amount of eligible tuition on my T2 from 2023. Radio silence.

Then, I looped in the School of Graduate Studies. Within an hour, I was told that my tuition from the Fall term had been applied to the wrong term. I was told a correction would be made to my T2 within a day or so. I followed up and asked if everything was okay with my payroll, given that the tuition was put on the wrong term. I then received an email stating that there was a balance of \~$1,600 on my account from the Fall tuition that wasn't charged to me.

I was justifiably distressed. $1,600 is three months of rent for me, and I had budgeted based on the amount of money I was receiving from the university. I felt like I was being penalized for someone else's mistake and everyone I was speaking with was quick to tell me how I should have known this was happening.

I walked to the Registrar's office, explaining the situation. They told me to go to the Cashiers. I did, but I started the conversation explaining that I was exhausted by the constant deferrals and redirections. Every single person in this administration was determined to point me to someone else.

When I got to the Cashiers office, I met with the two people I had been emailing. When they realized who I was, one of the women rolled her eyes and said ""oh boy"". I asked to speak with someone higher up, as I felt like I was being held liable for someone else's mistake. They acted like I was a Karen asking to use an expired coupon, claiming I should have known there was an issue with my account (despite the 17 emails at this point where *they* could not figure out the issue themselves). They told me they would speak with someone higher up in the administration, but refused to CC me in the email. I do not believe this ever happened. Then they told me to speak with HR and that they could ""deal with it"".

Next, I walked to the School of Graduate Studies. In that conversation, four things happened:

* The person I spoke with showed me how to check my pay stubs, which showed a $0.00 payroll deduction. The emphasis was that I should have been able to understand the issue sooner. No mention of the employee who had to approve that deduction request was made.
* I made an agreement to have $200 deducted from my pay for the summer. My T2 wouldn't be updated until August because of the outstanding balance on my account. I agreed, but this also meant my summer tuition would not be deducted (I will have to pay that off myself after the term was done). I'm living off <$200 every two weeks because of this agreement.
* I was told that an audit would have happened on my account before I graduated anyway, so at *some point* I would have received an email saying I owed them $1,600.
* I received a voucher for a coffee and muffin at the Arts and Administration building's Tim Horton's. The Tim's was closed that week for renovations.

I thought this was the end of it. But today, the Cashiers sent me the following email:

>  
Hi <My Name>

>Please contact HR as the fees were paid though them with payroll deductions

>Thank you

><Cashiers Office Employee>

From this email (WEEKS later), it turns out that my tuition *was* paid. Due to the decrease in my pay, I have had to apply for emergency bursaries to feed myself. My PTSD symptoms have been an absolute nightmare. And I've never received an apology or any sense of accountability from the institution for any of the distress this error has caused me. Note that the email above doesn't explain anything that happened or even provide the contact information for HR (I had to ask for it twice). These people are paid a living wage to do their jobs. I am not. $1,600 to me is the ability to live my life. $1,600 to MUN is functionally nothing.

I'm just trying to graduate. I'm a good student. I've completed my courses. I'm on track to finish my thesis ""on time"". I've tried so hard to fix this situation peacefully, but nothing seems to work, so I'm putting it out here. I don't believe I've been treated fairly in this situation and am looking to take further (possibly legal) action. Please share this story and help me get this out there. Students are a vulnerable population and mistakes like this should not happen, nor should the accountability fall on students to fix the mistakes of overpaid administrators.",9,1747942740.0,newfoundland,5,0.91,False
1kszsqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kszsqe/am_i_wrong_for_kicking_out_my_best_friend_after/,Am I wrong for kicking out my best friend after finding my dirty panties in his room?,"Before I begin, I have a couple of disclaimers: 1) Sorry for the length of this post. I’m including a lot of background information so that the full situation can be grasped. 2) I’m using fake names to protect identities.

My husband (22 M) and I (23 F) have had our friend John (23 M) living with us since last July. My husband has known John for way longer than I have. John is a foreign exchange student who moved in with my husband’s family toward the end of high school. Since then, my husband and John have always been like brothers. I met John when my husband and I started dating during our freshman year of college. John and I hung out occasionally in large group get-togethers, but not often. Throughout the next couple of years, John and I started to become friends. Then, during my senior year of college, my husband (then fiancé) had to leave halfway through the first semester to go work at his internship. My husband and I then had to go long distance, which was pretty hard for us, but made our relationship stronger. While my husband was away, I was able to focus more on my friendships, and so those relationships grew as well, one of those relationships being with John. John and I began to become really good friends. John didn’t like living with his roommates that much because they were messy, so he would pop over to my apartment (which I shared with two other girls) to hang out, watch movies, cook his dinner, etc. I felt like John became one of my best friends, which was nice since he was also my husband’s best friend. I never thought of him as anything more than that. 

A month after my husband and I’s senior year, we got married. It was the most perfect day and the most beautiful wedding (this was last summer). We had the most amazing honeymoon and moved into a 3 bed/2 bath apartment. Everything was going really great until the end of summer, when I started really struggling with my mental health. I was home alone a lot of the time because I hadn’t found a new job close to our new place yet, which definitely didn’t help my mental situation.

John had graduated at the same time as us and moved back in with my husband’s parents/family after graduation, since he hadn’t found a job yet and had nowhere to go, being that he’s not from this country and has had no income for the past several years (Any money he gets comes from his parents overseas). He had been complaining about his living situation for a little bit by the end of the summer because it was rough for him to go from being independent to living back with “parental figures.” My husband and I figured we could help both of our situations. We asked John if he would like to move into our guest room so that John would have a better living situation, and I wouldn’t be alone all the time during this awful time in my life (mentally). 

So, John moved in last August. He didn’t have a job because he couldn’t find anywhere to sponsor him since he had no green card or anything. I found a part-time job to work at for a few hours a day which gave me something to keep my mind busy. My husband found a typical 9-5 job after his internship ended at the end of the summer. This meant that John and I ended up spending quite a bit of time together. If we had to go grocery shopping, we would do it together. If I wanted coffee, we’d go together. Sometimes he’d bring me coffee because he would get bored and go get something. It was like this for the next several months. 

This is where things start getting weird. John started treating my husband like an outsider. It was almost like John thought there was me and him, and my husband was on the outside. John would be overly critical of anything my husband would do, and stopped taking an interest in his life. My husband and I ended up sitting down with John after noticing this behavior to have a talk with him and explain that we didn’t appreciate him acting like that. John seemed to take it really seriously and acted really apologetic. Another red flag was John’s increasingly caring behavior towards me. He would bring me coffee, maybe once a week (always saying he was just bored and wanted to go grab some), would always insist on coming with me and driving if I ever had any sort of errand to run. I stupidly thought that John was just a really great friend, and it was nice to finally have a friend who played an active instead of a passive role in our friendship. My husband even joked once that he had a nightmare that I had an affair with John. I laughed it off and reassured him that I thought that was disgusting, as John always felt like a brother to me. 

Then, in January of this year, John went back to school at the local college to get another degree so that he could stay in the country and would have more luck getting a job later on. He seemed to really love it. He made friends with a new group of people and even got a girlfriend. He started spending a lot less time at our apartment, which was nice because my husband and I were able to have a lot more alone time together, which was really great for our relationship. We were glad John was finally getting out of the house, but we were getting frustrated because he stopped helping out around the apartment. Before school he already sucked at helping out and would always complain if he was asked to help mow or clean. After going back to school though he especially sucked at it and the complaining got worse. We had multiple talks with him since he lived with us (for FREE!), and he needed to help out with chores. Since he didn’t have any income, we never charged him rent and only had him occasionally split the grocery bill.

Everything really came crashing down about two weeks ago. My husband and I were having a garage sale and were going through all of our belongings to find stuff to sell (We are moving out of the state at the end of this summer to a much smaller place, so we need to downsize). This is where I went wrong. John has none of his own belongings, so he was using a lot of our unwanted mismatched furniture. I was collecting stuff for the garage sale and went into John’s room to get a couple of things that I knew I wanted to sell. I didn’t let John know, and I know I definitely shouldn’t have gone into his room uninvited. But anyway, one of the things he was using was this really nice nightstand that my mother-in-law gave me. That was one of the things I wanted to sell. So I go to grab the nightstand. I open the drawer. Inside the drawer, I find a pair of my dirty panties.

I am MORTIFIED. At first, I thought I was seeing things, and I definitely didn’t want to believe it. But, after inspecting them, I can tell you with 100% certainty they were my dirty panties. I called my husband, completely distraught, and told him the news. He insisted that John needed to go. He said John absolutely could not stay with us any longer. Since we were going out of town for the next five days, my husband called John and told him he had until we got back to be moved out. I felt terrible. I felt taken advantage of and completely violated. I did feel bad for violating John’s privacy for going into his room, but my husband assured me that what John did was so much worse. When my husband called John, he said, “You have ten seconds to explain why my wife’s dirty panties are in your room.” John responded by acting completely unaware. He first acted confused and said he didn’t know what my husband was talking about. My husband then told John he had the next five days to move out. John replied, saying, “I’m sorry, I don’t want you guys to think of me that way.” Then their conversation ended. Ten minutes later, John calls back and says he had his girlfriend over and she borrowed them. My husband flat out told John that was bullshit and that it shouldn’t have taken him ten minutes to come up with that. My husband said that if what he was saying is true that John can have his girlfriend call him to confirm. Then we will believe him. I felt so unbelievably uncomfortable with my relationship with John that I blocked him on everything to take some time away from him to process. John’s girlfriend never called us, which confirmed our beliefs about why John had my dirty panties. Also, my husband went to the apartment to grab a couple of things the next day, and John was there already, packing up. When John saw my husband, he didn’t say anything and skittishly got in his car and drove away. 

Despite what he did, we have not wanted to destroy John’s life with this. We (my husband) texted him to tell him we don’t hate him, but obviously, we all need to take a big step away from this “friendship.” We also told him we wouldn’t tell everybody. We only told our parents and our extremely close friends, which is only like four people. He left us on read. He has yet to say anything or acknowledge anything he did. He has not even apologized to me, and it’s been weeks. I feel like my entire friendship was a lie, and I feel so stupid for not seeing any of the signs that he might’ve felt differently about me. I wish if he had those feelings; he would’ve done the mature thing and not agreed to move in with us. And I feel absolutely disgusted and violated, wondering what else he might’ve done other than just stealing my dirty panties. I can’t decide what hurts more: what he did, or him acting like he doesn’t care about what he did.

I’m wondering if we might be the assholes for kicking him out. We did barely give him time to move out, and I did mess up by going into his room. Should we have handled the situation differently? I feel weird that he’s never apologized, as if I was the one that royally fucked up and not him. I mean, we could’ve been so much meaner. His mom texted us to ask what happened, and we didn’t tell her. And we didn’t tell anyone in John’s new friend group or his girlfriend what he did? I’m just so conflicted and idk how to feel.

I had a long time with no crushes (childhood, highschool, college, university and work) even though I explained the context (childhood very young so does not count) highschool (all girls no boys and wasn't independent enough to take public transport, college first sixth form  = all girls, second school co mixed with boys and girls but didn't interact with them I just focused on my coursework I didn't say hi and I only went twice a week, third college = had a male friend, even gave him a rose for fun didn't interact as much, did try to speak in Urdu but I am not fluent, I don't know why he wouldn't flirt with me for once but I didn't mind it as much, university I had a friend that was  my lab partner and my assignment partner then covid came and I took japanese online I was more concerned about learning japanese and didn't interact wirh my classmates as much out of class except on Whatsapp about japanese class, anime club I didn't interact on discord except once that was it then there was the pandemic and when I was a senior PAL leader it was business. Job courses, spear camden I had friends but I didn't interact with them during breaks I sat alone on my phone, Art classes = I was waiting for class not interacting with anyone before or after class. Spark change: I didn't talk to many friend outside the job courses just mundane topics otherwise I didn't interact as much and about the comic guy I asked an assitant to talk to him because of his comics and I was too shy to talk to him myself. Work waited for brief with occasional talks but not much now that I think about I did talk about FMA once with my co worker but not attraction but other than that and important stuff I just sketch away or do something else not engaging as much as I did not even when I went swimming even. Even in physiotherapy I was comfortable with my therapists and even had group therapy but nothing (I was  12 – 13). Girl Guides no crush but I did not interact. 

 

 

Part 2: The Trigger I was planning to read BL, but I didn’t want to be misogynistic, so I decided to explore other perspectives. That’s when I came across an autobiography manga written by a lesbian. I related to some of the things in the book like never having a crush on boys before and it made me panic—what if I was lesbian too? I didn’t even finish the manga, but the thought spiraled out of control. To reassure myself, I started looking up why lesbians love women and their kinks on Quora. Then, I read a GL manga (Asumi-chan is Interested in Lesbian Brothels), and while I liked the story,  made me even more anxious. That’s when things got worse. I started looking at: Book covers of GL manga YouTube videos of women kissing Celebrities in sexy outfits Yuri porn on r34 AI girlfriend chatbots Lesbian dating apps I kept having intrusive thoughts about kissing or having sex with women just to “confirm” my orientation. I went down a rabbit hole, searching for answers on Reddit and Quora. My sister told me that sexuality is fluid, but then I saw other posts saying that’s a homophobic statement, and it confused me even more. I’m Muslim, so there could be societal pressure involved, but I’ve been deeply depressed—sometimes to the brink of tears. I’ve lost interest in drawing, learning Japanese, and my other hobbies. I don’t even care about men or relationships anymore. My entire routine is falling apart, and I feel like I’m losing myself. At first, I was having intrusive thoughts mainly at night, but then I started feeling “excited” by them—like I had an urge to smile, which terrified me. Sometimes, I felt indifferent, and that scared me even more. One time, I had an intrusive thought about kissing my friend, and I broke down crying in the surgery. Some of my thoughts felt so real—marrying women, kissing them in bikinis, touching them—and I couldn’t tell if they were intrusive or genuine anymore. I started testing myself: Looking up sexy pictures of women to see if I’d react Watching MasterChef Canada and noticing urges towards female contestants Watching Mr. Bean and feeling relief because the thoughts went away Doing online quizzes (like Wikihow’s “Am I a Lesbian?” quiz), which made me more anxious My therapist said I might have OCD, but that uncertainty made me panic. What if I don’t? What if I’m just in denial? I just want my old life back. If I stop these compulsions, will the thoughts go away? 

 

 Part 3: Am I Asexual? Aromantic? More Doubts Now, I’ve been on Citalopram (10mg) for two weeks, and my emotions feel weird. Before taking the medication, I had an intrusive thought about whether I’d ever be able to marry. I went to a sailor moon concert with sis and mother, on the train my anxiety around women was better but there was still some hyperfixation (I stared at women and men for testing) anyway at the concert I avoided the female performers and hyperfocused on the male one. Anyway after the concert I had my journal to record my thoughts for an exercise my therapist recommended. Anyway, I had intrusive thoughts of fearing losing attraction to men, fearing never finding love and wanting a relationship like the manga. Afterwards, my sis hugged me goodbye and I was checking my heartbeat to see if I was attracted to her and then I cried on the train, had dreams of the concert and cried again about my intrusive thoughts. Anyway fast forward, I was going to my father's appointment and I researched why I didn't have a crush then read about asexuality and I panicked. Once I got home I looked at more asexuality forums and panicked and cried about not experiencing a crush or having a relationship.  

 Am I ace? Am I aromantic? I feel like I’ve lost all control over my thoughts and emotions. I’m either anxious, indifferent, or feeling something that makes me uncomfortable. Am I desensitized? Am I actually into women? Is this just HOCD? I don’t know who I am anymore, and I just want to feel normal again. If anyone has gone through something similar, please help. I’m exhausted. I asked Chatgpt, Deepseek , and Pi ai about it and they give me different answers depending on the situation e.g. sometimes chatgpt says that just because you don't have a crush, it doesn't mean you are ace or aro and I could be a late bloomer but other times it says I am ace or aro because I didn't experience a crush before. Deepseek on the other hand, keeps saying I am a late bloomer regardless of what I say so I don't know.I just had intrusive thoughts after reading forums about the fear of never finding love, never being in a relationship, fearing being on the asexual spectrum and I started crying. My parents yelled at me about it. 

 

 Recently I had intrusive thoughts about men. The first intrusive thoughts were in the shower. One intrusive thoughts was meeting random men and feeling nothing and another was about meeting my male friend at college where he flirted with me and I smiled a bit but I gagged and I worried if I lost attraction to men. I also had dreams or thoughts about intimacy and sex where I often what it was like cuddling or feeling mens' bodies or having sex with men and wondering what it would feel like to have sex or to feel their bodies. I would smile faintly and I would feel butterflies in some instances but it is not consistent. One dream was about a faceless man having sex with me, my heart was beating slightly and my chest was warm but my throat was burning but not much. I would also wonder what sex would feel like (penis into my vagina). I sometimes searched up sexy men to see if I was attracted to them sometimes faint butterflies in stomach and smiling. I have taken citalopram for 4 weeks and I wonder if I am asexual or if I am a late bloomer? I also had some pulls when I imagined relationships with men Update 1: I started getting urges (like hyper fixation) towards women. I don't understand, it was getting better with anti-depressants early on and now it was briefly back? Does this mean anything? It would switch back to intrusive thoughts about being on the asexuality spectrum. I spoke about crushes with my mother and wondering if I she remembered I had any and she said I found some boys cute or good looking when I was in primary school (I don't remember). I cried in therapy a bit. When I was volunteering, I spoke to my male colleague about star signs and I felt a bit giddy when after our conversation. It did linger a bit. In the evening, I had a massive headache and I even vomited. Finally I had a conversation with sis about having intrusive thoughts about being on the asexuality spectrum and I started crying while we had our conversation. Am I on the asexual or aromantic spectrum or lesbian in denial or a late bloomer? Fast forward to my therapy session, I asked my mother about whether I had crushes on boys when I was younger. She told me that I did say some boys were good looking in primary school but I don't remember. This caused me to cry during my therapy session and in the afternoon after consulting Chatgpt about it. Eventually, I relaxed a bit and then my urges for women returned. On Thursday, I was so distressed when Chatgpt told me I was attracted to women that I cried and didn't go volunteering. On Friday, I went out with my mother, with my urges for women. After some tea, my urges for women went then I was worried about being on the asexuality spectrum so I consulted Chatgpt again and when it said I was, I cried again. Last night, I had dreams of men and kissing them and having sex with them and I was aroused and there were butterflies then I got the thought of researching a lesbian chef and my urges for women came back, then after a while I began to feel asexual again. I had my therapy session again and realised I had a case of FOMO, as in I wanted to experience what my family experienced and the fact that I will never know made me lose it and I was pretty during and after the session and now I feel asexual again. I cried about experiencing FOMO and even when considering the possibility of being asexual, I still cried in the shower and in the bathroom? I don't know what is going on. I have been on 10mg citalopram for 7 weeks. Am I a late bloomer or on the ace / aro spectrum? Last night, I had dreams of men and kissing them and having sex with them and I was aroused and there were butterflies then I got the thought of researching a lesbian chef and my urges for women came back, then after a while I began to feel asexual again. I had my therapy session again and realised I had a case of FOMO, as in I wanted to experience what my family experienced and the fact that I will never know made me lose it and I was pretty during and after the session and now I feel asexual again. I cried about experiencing FOMO and even when considering the possibility of being asexual, I still cried in the shower and in the bathroom? I chat with AI and when it suggested I was on the ace / aro spectrum I cried .  

 

One time I once thought if I am at least demi or gray ace, I could at least experience attraction to men but i still cried. After searching on AI if I was on the ace / aro spectrum and it said I was, I was depressed and when I told my mother I cried about it. After the korean BBQ, my mind was like I enjoyed myself so I am on the ace / aro spectrum and I cried again. I don't know what is going on. I have been on 10mg citalopram for 8 weeks. Am I a late bloomer or on the ace / aro spectrum? I went to Tim Horton and one time I had a dream of being younger 16 and not on anti depressants and feeling a pull to K pop stars even though I did not listen to k pop or cared about it. Another dream was the sailor moon concert but I was younger 16 and not on anti depressants and I had a pull on the male lead even though I had only seen the sailor moon concert once in february. I stopped using AI last night, the next morning and a bit of the afternoon (until now) and these were my thoughts: 1) what if my desire for men was fake 2) what if I am lying to myself 3) what if my lack of crushes were due to lack of desire and not lack of interaction 4) What if AI is right (and I am asexual)5) what if I am crying to be like everyone else6) what if my distress is due to fitting in 7) can late bloomers experience no crushes or FOMO due to my reasons 8) If I was straight, why didn't I have a crush 9) if I was on the ace / aro spectrum why am I crying about my lack of crushes and the possibility of being on the spectrum,9)Do late bloomers cry about being on the ace / aro spectrum. Are my tears due to medication or are they my true desires.10) I cried myself to sleep last night 11) I had intrusive thoughts and woke up in tears 12) I feel better am I asexual 13) What if after my AD I still don't have attraction 14) I don't mind being ace / aro if it was accepted but I still want a relationship 15)FOMO, Fear of loneliness, want to experience connection and intimacy want romantic love. 16) I cried then slept then woke up and cried then slept then woke up and cried and slept. 17) now I feel fine but I want answers 18) I held my father's hand and cried I imagined kissing a guy and criedcan I share the rest of what I wrote before you say anything: 19) I don't think I have the potential for relationships 20) I think I am delusional 21) I am starting to think I am on the ace / aro spectrum 22) I have nothing but a book and a pen and I am still crying about not experiencing relationships 23) I am crying about accepting that I might be asexual (this while SIU by materu is playing in my head) 24) I want a relationship I want a relationship I want a relationship 25) This is with nothing (no chatgpt or ai or anything) just me and I am still crying does that mean this is genuine does it mean I am on the ace / aro spectrum 26)I had a thought where I didn't mind being on the ace / aro spectrum or not I wanted a relationship 27) What if I will never experience a crush and what if I am delusional 28) why am I calm now were my feelings fake, 29) I am worried I am on the ace / aro spectrum 30) I am delusional aren't I 31) My father threatened to leave the house due to my crying 32) What if I am better off alone 33) I don't want to be alone, I want to be in a relationship 34) What if I won't like being in a relationship 35)I want my sex dreams with men back. It has been 9 weeks since citalopram and my sex dreams are not as frequent but I do still ask AI for help. One time I thought I was asexual and then when I thought what a relationship with a man was like I felt butterflies but when I held my father's hand again I felt tired. One time I saw pakistani cricket players and my heart was beating and my throat was burning. Sometimes when I think of the possibility of being on the ace / aro spectrum, my throat hurts like I am about to cry. Sometimes I play games and I don't think about the ace / aro spectrum or being attracted to men anymore but sometimes when I watch youtube I think about my relationship with men and I feel a emotional pull. 

 

At 10 weeks on citalopram I got very distressed when AI tell me I am on the ace / aro spectrum to the point of tears and I had dreams  and I wrote these thoughts and I cried while I wrote these thoughts as well: 1) AI is such a hypocrite, it tells me that a lack of of crushes doesn't mean I am on the ace / aro spectrum but it tells me that because I had opportunities to interact with men but didn't develop a crush I am asexual and I am starting to believe that it might be the case in the future 2) I never had a crush or worried about before so what is the point getting a crush now 3) Fine, I am on the ace / aro spectrum I am delusional because I have never had a crush I don't think I could start now. 4) I am delusional to think I would even be straight or I could have a crush 5) I give up 6) I don't want to be on the ace / aro spectrum but AI won't stop suggesting it, I feel like it is too late 7) Deepseek told me my feelings were due to FOMO or societal pressure rather than my personal feelings and I felt my pain was swept under the rug. What if deepseek is right?8) Fuck it, I am on the ace / aro spectrum my longing was I was delusional and my feelings were FOMO rather than my own feelings. 9) I wanted to at least try I give up 10) Is it worth persuing a relationship 11) Is my baseline on the ace / aro spectrum so my desires for love are fake. Why is love being gatekept by AI like if I don't have interest in relationships I am forever on the ace / aro spectrum 12) I don't want to have an ace / aro baseline 13) Do I have to have a crush beforehand to validate me being straight 14) AI tells me I have attraction to men but also my sex dreams while on citalopram does not mean I have attraction to men 15) I know what a breakup feels like, when I was 17 I cried on the sofa because I thought I didn't like Kaito's voice 15) My sister didn't understand my distress she didn't understand why I was distressed about being lesbian or on the ace / aro spectrum because I never dated and now looking back I feel like it can sound very invalidating 16) I want AI to rule out me being on the ace / aro spectrum but it won't and it is annoying 17) I give up I am delusional to I could be attracted to real men or be straight AI was right 18) I don't want to be on the ace / aro spectrum even if ace / aro people can experience love or romance, me sharing ace / aro traits and identity being personal and wondering if I would be okay with being on the ace / aro spectrum (I won't) I want to be attracted to men 19) Therapist is my attraction to men real 20) All I want to know is if I am attracted to men or if my desires were fake. 

 

It is going to be 11 weeks tomorrow and my thoughts are all over the place. I went shopping at Brent Cross and I had a weird thought in Holland and Barret's, thinking about how some women can't have children and they are distressed but they carry on and I was wondering if that is the same with me. Afterwards, I had another thought about wanting to be attracted to men and got jealous of women who were boy crazy. During my laser session, I thought at least I could have fictional men and is it worth persuing a real relationship and is it possible. I went on AI and I cried at the possibility of being on the ace / aro spectrum  

 

I went online to find a Kaito plushie so it can make me better but none of the vendors had international shipping so I decided to design and make a keychain and for the most part it distracted me for a bit. Also at my volunteering place my male colleague thanked me for the chocolates for his birthday and I smiiled but then I also felt butterflies and pulls for men until briefing started. Then at night, I had a thought of what if the feelings I had while on citalopram would disappear after the treatment and I am asexual so I asked AI about it and I still get hyperfixations for women as well. Am I genuinely on the ace / aro spectrum or bi or lesbian  in denial or not? 

 

AI is suggsting I am on ace / aro spectrum again and I am starting to wonder if it is due to social expectations or FOMO rather than my own feelings (AI think so). When AI said I was on the ace / aro spectrum I cried, deepseek said my pre OCD baseline was on the ace / aro spectrum . I wonder what my therapist will say.  

 

On wednesday I interacted with men in my temp job and I still did not have attraction I am on citalopram for nearly 12 weeks am I not attracted to men 

 

then on friday I imagined being with my male friend and I had pulls and some indifference and throat burning and then I thought about men in romantic scenarios and I dazed out a bit (not completely) 

 

I feel like a lesbian. I have urges for woman like pulls but I also gag at times as well, it started when I listened to Chappel Roan’s song good luck babe . It was a good song and catchy ( better than pink pony club) but I had a thought in my head: What if i am like the girl spoken about in the song and that I am lesbian/ ace and or aro and I was kissing boys and feeling nothing. Then during the journey to my temp work, I was wondering if I was wondering if I was in love with my best friend or any other girl I had a strong platonic relationship with but I gagged a bit. It was busy in the afternoon so I was distracted but while i was on toilet duty my mind wondered to other topics like wondering if I should read lesbian books but my mind was afraid to since I read an autobiography about a lesbian author and that spirals out of control, my Kaito keychain ( I have buy supplies ) and the thought of liking the smell of one of the students and the time I mistaked a reader for a student and then I caused an invigilator to trip and losing paperwork. After work I was thinking about the fact I couldn’t be straight due to the thoughts from earlier so I asked AI for answers and it said that because I had feelings for men and a genuine longing for them so my feelings for men are genuine and it said that I was unlikely to be lesbian/ ace/ aro . This morning, the same thing happened. I had urges for women and gagged ( also trumpets by Jason Derulo and Good luck babe by chappel roan was playing in my head and at this point I am wondering about my progression after \~ 12 weeks on citalopram: Lesbian = I do not want to be lesbian. I had urges but they feel awkward, ace / aro = I want to be attracted to men but Demi or gray ace is not the end of the world ( more Demi than gray ace) but none of the others. Straight = My preferred option but I don’t know if it is possible given my circumstances.  And now I have thoughts about kissing women again why do they keep coming back? Um afterwards, I didn’t have urges for women but my feelings for men disappeared and now I feel asexual or aromantic again ( I had iced coffee and was tired  and now I am thinking about trans by Gorillaz and thinking about noodle’s design and wondering if I was attracted to her ( I watched trans and I liked her design before my intrusive thoughts but I didn’t think I was attracted to her I think much of it afterwards? Am I on the ace / aro spectrum / lesbian in denial that I am not straight and my nightmare about losing attraction to men became true? It has been 12 weeks into taking citalopram. What would my therapist say about this? 

 

It has been 12 weeks since taking citalopram and honestly I give up. I had intrusive urges about being lesbian and now I am starting to feel asexual so I asked AI last night, it said I might be on the ace / aro spectrum and I tried to ask where and it gave me possibilities and then I went to sleep but I cried a bit in my sleep while thinking about all of the possibilities of being on the ace / aro spectrum by chatgpt, I promised my mother I wouldn't look at chatgpt on my phone (and I didn't) but I was thinking about last night since I dreamt of men but did not have much reaction (indifference) so I got my laptop and asked AI again with more arguing. I finished my breakfast and went back to my laptop. My mother came and told me to contact a few people to follow up on a job which I started doing. I released my routine has gone out of whack for the past 6 months, I decided to use AI to provide structure which my mother was angry about because I have overrelied on AI in the past on stupid things like determining whether or not I was attracted to men or if I was on the ace / aro spectrum and she told me I was wasting my time and not to rely on AI. I said that I wasn't relying on AI for my orientation anymore and I was just using it to sort routine out. She told me to stop relying on AI and use my brain to sort my routine but because it has been 6 months since my routine I needed to use chatgpt. Then my mother kept my laptop away from me and said my tears were crocodile tears. I told her they were not and her, my father (who wanted to take my vitamin tablets) and my sis didn't understand my problems. It ended with me going to my room in tears and my mother calling me stupid. What would my therapist say about all this 

 

 

Why do I still have urges for women even now and I am not distressed. My therapist said I might be a repressed lesbian and I panicked and searched up forums to confirm and I cried a bit. Then I had a meeting at my volunteering place to improve performance and we chatted about school and gcses I chatted as well but no attraction. Then I was thinking about making pillows and plushies from scratch. This means I can't be straight anymore right therapist? I have been on citalopram for 13 weeks

1kszqft,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kszqft/aio_dealing_with_friendships_at_university/,AIO dealing with friendships at university?,"I (18f) am a first year uni student and I have been struggling with both my old and new friendships this year. So, let me give some background information. I am studying at a city 2 hours away from my village. There, I had various friends and a big friend group that I am still close with. But, I am mostly going to focus on my 3 closest friends (all 18f) who are also studying at uni. My best friend and one of my close friends study at different cities from me and the other close friend studies at the same city as me (different uni though). I am still really close with them and every time we meet things are still very much the same. But, the close friend that studies at the same city as me doesn't really hang out with me and as she has said multiple times she wants to focus on her new friend group. She is very extroverted and has made many new friends. I am trying to be as understanding as possible but I really feel like she has been neglecting me the last months. That's the main problem with my old friend group.

Now, coming to talk about my new friend group that I made at uni during the first two weeks. So, I made 4 friends (all 18-19f). They are over all great and we get along really well. But, at times I feel like our personalities don't match at all. My three old close friends have also made many friends (a lot more than me) and because I have met them all, I can say they really match each other's vibes and have become all really close. On the contrary,  I feel like I am missing out on so much about uni life because of the friends I have made (I know I sound awful but I am trying to be as honest as possible). They are all very introverted and have grown up in pretty close minded societies. 

Before I started studying I thought that uni life is about hanging out till sunrise, doing things that you are never gonna tell your parents about and creating unforgettable memories. But, I really feel like I have been lied to because I have done nothing out of these. So, since the very start of the uni year we have gone for a girls' night out only once. 

We have gone out for coffee plenty of times and have gone on some trips to some other cities but nothing more than that. During the first semester,  I didn't really care because I also am a homebuddy and I like to stay at home watching my kdramas. But, after the exam season, the second semester, I have never ever in my life felt so alone before. I even considered going to a psychologists to ask for help because the loneliness at times really feels unbearable. The only good thing about the second semester is the fact that while feeling all alone I made a new friend at uni that I instantly became so close with and she is the only reason I have been holding on.

To be honest, I am also at fault since I have happened to travel back home kind of much (every some months) because I have a senior cat that I am really afraid of losing (she is really healthy but also old and fat) and because I am actually very close with both of my parents, so I tend to miss them kind of easily.

To give you some extra context, I actually study psychology at a university that it's really hard to get into (I don't even know how I got into) so I kind of know that many of my fellow classmates can be considered ""nerds"" (I know it is a stereotype but it is kind of true) and less sociable. My friends are also kind of like that, big bookworms, small circle of friends to no friends at all, and prefering staying in than going out to have a drink.

So, to sum up and stop yapping, I am genuinely asking for help because I really want to get rid of the heavy feeling of loneliness in me. I am trying my best to be optimistic telling myself that we are going to get closer as time passes and eventually have the time of our lives during our uni years. I am trying hard not to compare my friendships with the friendships my close friends have made since I know that comparison is the thief of joy but, things have been getting really hard for me. I feel like I won't have more chances to make new friends that match my vibe in the future. I feel like an awful friend judging them here on this platform but I am on a dead end and the only thing I need right now is serious help. I know I can't change them and I shouldn't want to do so as well, but the second semester is almost over and I have ended up with nothing but a heavy lonely feeling up in my chest.",2,1747942483.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1kszp2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StratteraRx/comments/1kszp2l/scared_to_up_my_dosage/,scared to up my dosage,"i've been on 40mg strattera since march and have taken it everyday since. the reason i haven't upped it just yet was because i had been traveling for 2 months / backpacking in another country. i do feel like the 40mg has been helping me with task initiation and general focus and less anxiety. in fact, i was able to concentrate and write a 10 paged research paper and read a book in less than 5 days and i did so with decent focus. however, i oftentimes still drink coffee or compliment my 40mg with caffeine. 

i told my doctor that although it has helped in some aspects, it's still hard to complete and start some things that take too much mental energy (aka responding to texts, unpacking from my trip (took me one week to do so), etc.) and even while on 40mg after a couple weeks or so i felt the effects dwindling and even thought to myself to up my dose. my working memory got better and then it also started to become stagnant? haha when i first started the 40mg i went to the airport and had forgotten my passport bc i didn't feel the need to double check anymore LOL but its better now bc ive learned to adapt to the meds instead of adapting to the adhd like i had been in the past. it has helped with my impulsivity and i have more self-control. but am still quite quick to emotions tho hmm. 

i am scared tho because i have built such a good routine off 40mg and a cup of coffee 😭😭 my doctor said to take 40 in the morning and 40 in the afternoon to make it a total 80mg so i dont end up waisting my 40mg pills. 

what do yall think? have you guys experienced the jump from 40 to 80 and if the symptoms were server or not? when i first started i got a bit sleepy and a tad bit nauseous and less appetite, so i was wondering how that'll fair. i am also scared to divide up the dose as i work part time in the night and dont want to effects to hit me like a truck. should i say f it and hope for the best and take 80mg in the morning?

I never fully believed in Pele's Curse until it crawled into my life and made a home there. You've probably heard the stories—tourists who pocket volcanic rocks or sand from Hawaii's beaches, only to mail them back with frantic letters detailing their misfortunes. Car accidents, divorces, illnesses that doctors can't explain. The legend says that Pele, goddess of fire and volcanoes, protects these islands fiercely. Take a piece of her domain, and she'll make you regret it.

My name is Kai Nakamura. I was born in Honolulu but grew up in San Diego after my parents divorced. My father stayed here on Oahu while my mother took me to the mainland. Twenty-eight years later, I returned to the island when Dad had his stroke.

""Just until he recovers,"" I told my girlfriend back in California. That was eight months ago.

Dad's physical therapy has been slow, and his medical bills stacked up faster than I could manage with my savings. So I found a job at Kahuna's, this little tiki bar in Waikiki where tourists come to drink overpriced mai tais and act like they've discovered authentic Hawaiian culture.

The place sits at the end of a row of beachfront properties, nestled between the Halekulani Hotel and a line of banyan trees that's been there longer than any building around it. From the outside, Kahuna's looks like every other tourist trap—thatched roofing, bamboo railings, and tiki torches that flicker all night. But there's something different about this place that I didn't notice until it was too late.

I started in mid-February. The manager, a middle-aged local named Leilani, hired me on the spot when I mentioned my bartending experience from San Diego.

""You'll need to follow some special rules here,"" she said, sliding a laminated card across the bar top. ""This place has.. traditions.""

I glanced at the card, thinking it would be the usual service industry stuff. Always ID customers. Don't overserve. But the rules listed were different—oddly specific and frankly bizarre.

""Is this some kind of haole initiation?"" I asked, using the Hawaiian term for non-natives even though I was technically native myself.

Leilani didn't smile. ""These aren't jokes, Kai. This building stands on sacred ground. The old ones made.. arrangements.. to build here. We honor those arrangements.""

I almost walked out then. It sounded like superstitious nonsense, the kind of stuff my grandmother would mutter about before she passed away.

But the pay was good—really good—and Dad's insurance had denied his last round of therapy.

""Fine,"" I said, pocketing the card. ""I'll play along.""

Her eyes darkened. ""This isn't a game. Break these rules, and terrible things happen.""

I started the next night. And that's when I learned that at Kahuna's Tiki Bar, Pele's Curse is the least of your worries.

My first shift at Kahuna's started at sunset.

I arrived early, watching tourists scatter from Waikiki Beach as the sky deepened to amber. Surfers caught final waves while honeymooners snapped photos of the horizon. None of them noticed me slipping into the back entrance of the tiki bar, key card in hand.

Inside, Leilani was arranging bottles behind the curved wooden bar. The place was empty—we wouldn't open for another hour.

""Good, you're punctual,"" she said without looking up. ""The uniform is in the back room.""

The ""uniform"" turned out to be a simple black button-up and slacks—classier than the Hawaiian shirts I'd expected. When I returned, Leilani was lighting small oil lamps spaced evenly along the bar.

""These stay lit all night,"" she said. ""No matter what.""

She pointed to the laminated card I'd received yesterday. ""Read them again. Memorize them.""

I pulled the card from my wallet. Five rules were printed in an elegant typeface: 1: Never serve the last customer of the night a drink with rum. 2: If a woman asks for the ""Madame Pele Special,"" prepare only pineapple juice with grenadine. Nothing more. 3: The back storeroom remains locked between midnight and 3 AM. For ANY reason. 4: When you hear drumming from the beach, close all windows immediately. 5: Never, under any circumstances, accept gifts or tips that come from the sea (shells, coral, sand, etc.).

""Is this for real?"" I asked.

Leilani's face remained neutral. ""You think I would joke about this?""

""But what happens if—""

""Bad things,"" she interrupted. ""Very bad things.""

She wouldn't elaborate further, just moved on to showing me the register system and drink menu. Standard tiki fare: Mai Tais, Blue Hawaiians, Zombies, Painkillers. The prices were ridiculous—$18 for a basic cocktail—but that's Waikiki for you.

At precisely seven, Leilani unlocked the front doors. The warm night air carried in the scent of saltwater and plumeria flowers. Within minutes, the first customers strolled in—a sunburned couple from Michigan celebrating their anniversary.

The night flowed smoothly. I mixed drinks while Leilani handled food orders from our small kitchen. The crowd was typical: tourists drinking too much and talking too loudly about their helicopter tours and snorkeling adventures.

Around 11:30, the bar began emptying. A few stragglers nursed their drinks, and I started cleaning up. That's when he walked in—a local man, maybe sixty, wearing a faded aloha shirt and canvas pants. He sat at the far end of the bar, away from the remaining tourists.

""Howzit,"" he greeted, voice grainy like crushed lava rock. ""Rum and coke, brother.""

I glanced toward Leilani, who was across the room wiping tables. She caught my eye and subtly shook her head.

""Sorry, we're out of rum,"" I lied. ""Can I get you something else? Whiskey, maybe?""

The man's eyes narrowed, dark and watchful. ""Been coming here twenty years. You folks never run out of rum.""

My mouth went dry. ""First time for everything. We had a big group earlier.""

He stared at me for an uncomfortably long time before his mouth curled into a half-smile.

""Whiskey, then.""

I poured him a double and slid it across the bar. He drank it slowly, eyes never leaving mine. The other customers gradually filtered out until just this man remained.

""Last call,"" Leilani announced from behind me, her voice tighter than usual.

The man finished his drink, laid down cash, and stood. ""You're new. What's your name, bartender?""

""Kai.""

""Kai,"" he repeated, rolling my name around his mouth like he was tasting it. ""You listen to Leilani, yeah? She knows this place."" He tapped his temple with one finger. ""I come back tomorrow night. Maybe you have rum then.""

After he left, I exhaled.

""Who was that?""

Leilani locked the door behind him. ""Someone who knows the rules. And tests them sometimes.""

She collected his glass with a tissue rather than touching it directly.

""Why can't we serve rum to the last customer?"" I asked.

""Because rum comes from sugarcane. In old Hawai'i, Kanaloa—ocean god—claimed all sweet offerings at day's end."" She dropped the glass into a special bin separate from the other dishes. ""The last customer is never who they appear to be.""

I laughed nervously. ""So what, that guy was Kanaloa?""

""Maybe. Maybe just one of his messengers."" She pointed to the floor beneath where he'd sat. Water pooled there—not spilled drinks, but clear saltwater, forming a small puddle on the hardwood.

""But he was wearing shoes,"" I whispered. ""And clothes.""

""Yes,"" Leilani said. ""That's how they hide."" She handed me a container of salt. ""Sprinkle this where he sat. Then go home. You did well tonight.""

I did as instructed, though it felt absurd. As I drove back to my father's small apartment in Kaimuki, I rationalized Leilani's behavior. Every bar has its eccentricities. This was just local superstition mixed with customer service theater.

But when I got home and kicked off my shoes, I found wet sand inside them—coarse black volcanic sand that doesn't exist anywhere near Waikiki's white beaches.

I hadn't been near any beach all day.

The next morning, I woke to the buzz of my phone. Texts from my girlfriend in San Diego lit up the screen.

When are you coming home? It's been three months longer than you said I'm tired of waiting, Kai

I stared at the ceiling fan spinning lazily above my futon. The small bedroom in Dad's apartment barely fit my few possessions. From the living room, I heard the murmur of his TV—the endless background noise he claimed helped him think.

I need more time, I texted back. Dad's getting better, but slowly. The job is good. Pays well.

She responded with a single thumbs-down emoji.

I showered and dressed, then checked on Dad. He sat in his recliner, right arm still weaker than his left, but he managed to hold his coffee.

""You came in late,"" he said, eyes on the morning news.

""Work.""

""That tiki bar,"" he muttered. ""Kahuna's, right?""

I nodded, pouring my own coffee.

""Funny place to end up."" His tone suggested it wasn't funny at all.

""You know it?""

Dad shifted in his chair. ""Everyone local knows it. Been there since the '70s. Same owner all these years.""

""Leilani?""

""No, no,"" He waved his good hand dismissively. ""Leilani manages it. The owner's some mainlander. Never shows his face.""

I sat across from him. ""What's with all the weird rules?""

Dad's eyes narrowed. ""What rules?""

""Nothing. Just some service stuff.""

""Listen, Kai."" He muted the TV. ""That stretch of beach isn't right. Old burial ground beneath it. When they developed Waikiki, they disturbed things.""

I sighed. ""Dad—""

""I'm serious. Your grandmother would tell you. That's why all those hotels have problems. Staff quit suddenly. Guests complain about voices, water damage with no source.""

I remembered Grandma's stories—how she'd refuse to walk certain paths at night, how she'd leave offerings at strange roadside shrines. I'd always written it off as old-world superstition, something that died with her generation.

""Kahuna's sits right on the worst spot,"" Dad continued. ""That place has.. arrangements.""

The exact word Leilani had used. A chill prickled across my skin.

""I need this job, Dad.""

""Just be careful."" He turned the TV volume back up. ""Some rules exist for reasons we forget.""

My shift started at six that evening. The weekend crowd packed Kahuna's—tourists clutching guidebooks and taking selfies with our carved tiki statues. If any of them knew they were drinking on an alleged burial ground, they didn't show it.

Around nine, I was three customers deep when Leilani appeared at my side.

""Someone at the end asked for you specifically,"" she said, voice tight. ""Table eleven.""

I glanced over. A woman sat alone at our farthest table, half-hidden by shadows despite the bar's ambient lighting. She wore a red dress, her dark hair falling past her shoulders.

""I don't know her,"" I said.

""Just go,"" Leilani urged. ""I'll cover the bar.""

I approached the woman's table. Up close, she looked older than I'd initially thought—maybe forty, with sharp features and skin tanned to copper. A floral scent surrounded her, not perfume but something earthier, like actual flowers.

""You asked for me?"" I kept my voice professional.

She smiled, revealing perfectly white teeth. ""You're Kai. The new bartender.""

""That's right.""

""I'd like the Madame Pele Special."" Her words floated clear above the bar noise.

Rule two flashed in my mind: If a woman asks for the ""Madame Pele Special,"" prepare only pineapple juice with grenadine. Nothing more.

I nodded. ""I'll prepare that personally.""

Back at the bar, I reached for the pineapple juice and grenadine, mixing them in a hurricane glass. Leilani watched from the corner of her eye as she served other customers.

""Who is she?"" I asked quietly.

""Just bring her the drink,"" Leilani answered.

I carried the bright red-orange beverage back to table eleven. The woman's dark eyes tracked me the entire way. I set the drink before her.

""Will there be anything else?""

Her smile deepened. ""You're obedient. That's refreshing."" She lifted the glass. ""Most new bartenders try to improve the recipe. Add rum or vodka, thinking they're being clever.""

My mouth went dry. ""The recipe is specific.""

""Indeed."" She sipped the drink, eyes closing briefly. ""You're not from here originally.""

""Born here, raised in California.""

""Ah."" She nodded as if this explained something. ""So you have roots but no depth. You know the islands but don't feel them in your bones.""

I shifted uncomfortably. ""Is there anything else I can get you?""

""Tell me, Kai, do you know why I order this drink?"" She swirled the vibrant liquid. ""Pineapple for sweetness, grenadine for blood. The islands give sweetness, but they demand blood in return.""

A server called my name from the bar. I glanced over my shoulder—a dozen customers waited.

""I should get back to work.""

""One moment."" She reached into a small purse and withdrew something wrapped in a banana leaf. ""A gift. For honoring the recipe.""

She unwrapped it slightly, revealing gleaming black sand. My pulse quickened as I remembered the sand in my shoes last night.

""I can't accept that,"" I said quickly.

Her expression hardened. ""You refuse my gift?""

""Rule five,"" I said. ""No gifts from the sea.""

For a heartbeat, I thought I saw flames flicker in her pupils. Then she laughed, rewrapping the leaf.

""Very good. Leilani taught you well."" She tucked the package away. ""I'll be watching your progress here, Kai Nakamura.""

I returned to the bar, hands trembling slightly. Leilani caught my eye, and I nodded to indicate all was well. She visibly relaxed.

Hours later, as we closed, I looked for the woman in red, but her table stood empty, the Madame Pele Special untouched.

""She didn't drink it,"" I told Leilani as we cleaned.

""They never do."" She collected the full glass with a napkin, careful not to touch the liquid. ""It's not about drinking. It's about offering.""

""Who was she?""

Leilani carried the glass to a back sink used only for handwashing bar tools. ""What did she look like to you?""

I described the woman—forty-ish, red dress, dark hair.

""Jimmy in the kitchen saw an old woman in a muumuu,"" Leilani said. ""Malia, the server, saw a teenage girl in shorts and a tank top.""

My stomach tightened. ""That's not possible.""

""She appears differently to everyone."" Leilani poured the drink down the sink, then rinsed it with fresh water. ""But always asks for the same thing.""

""Is she—"" I hesitated, feeling foolish. ""Is she actually Pele?""

""Maybe. Or something wearing her aspect."" Leilani placed the empty glass in a special cabinet. ""The islands have older beings than even the Hawaiian gods. Things that were here before people arrived.""

""What would have happened if I'd given her rum in that drink?""

Leilani's face darkened. ""A bartender did that in 1982. Josh, mainlander like you. Thought the rules were jokes."" She closed the cabinet firmly. ""They found him three days later in a lava tube near Kilauea. His body was cooked from the inside out. Coroner said his blood had boiled.""

I swallowed hard. ""You're serious.""

""This isn't a game, Kai. These rules protect you."" She locked the cabinet. ""The woman tests new employees. Others will test you too.""

""Like the man last night?""

""Exactly. They're curious about you."" She handed me a small pouch of salt. ""Keep this with you. It helps.""

Later, driving home, I took the long route along the beach. The moon hung low over the water, casting a silver path across the waves. For a moment, I thought I saw a woman in red walking along that moonlit trail, directly across the surface of the ocean.

I blinked, and she vanished.

Two weeks passed. I settled into a routine at Kahuna's, learning the rhythms of the bar and its peculiar rules. During daylight hours, I helped Dad with his therapy, drove him to doctor appointments, and tried to ignore the increasingly cold texts from my girlfriend.

Friday night brought a group celebrating a successful business deal. Fifteen men in loosened ties occupied our largest table, ordering rounds of expensive cocktails and appetizers. The bar hummed with activity—tourists mingling with the occasional local, ukulele music floating from our sound system, tiki torches casting amber light across wooden tables.

Leilani approached as I mixed a batch of Mai Tais.

""Anakala Keoki is here,"" she murmured.

I glanced toward the door. An elderly Hawaiian man entered, his white hair pulled back in a long ponytail. He walked with a carved wooden cane, yet moved with surprising agility.

""Who's that?"" I asked, garnishing the drinks with pineapple wedges.

""Elder from Waianae. Respected kahuna."" At my blank look, she added, ""Traditional priest. Spiritual leader.""

The old man settled at the bar, directly in front of me. Up close, his skin was etched with deep lines, his eyes clear and sharp beneath heavy brows.

""Aloha, Anakala,"" Leilani greeted him warmly. ""The usual?""

He nodded, gaze fixed on me. ""This the keiki you mentioned?""

""Yes. This is Kai.""

""Half-blood,"" the old man observed. ""Island-born but raised elsewhere.""

I extended my hand. ""Nice to meet you, sir.""

He ignored my hand. ""You feel them yet? The ones who watch this place?""

Before I could answer, Leilani placed a shot glass before him, filled with clear liquid.

""Water,"" she told me. ""From a specific spring in Waianae. We keep it for him.""

The old man drank it in one swallow. ""Good water. Clean spirits."" He set down the glass. ""Boy doesn't understand yet, Leilani.""

""He's learning,"" she defended. ""Followed all the rules so far.""

""Easy when sun shines,"" Anakala Keoki replied. ""Test comes in darkness.""

I felt like they were talking around me. ""Sir, if there's something I should know—""

""Too much to know. Not enough time."" He tapped his cane against the bar. ""Tonight brings high tide, new moon. Strong night for ocean spirits.""

""Meaning what?"" I asked.

""Watch the water,"" he said cryptically. ""Listen for pahu drums.""

Leilani touched my arm. ""Rule four.""

When you hear drumming from the beach, close all windows immediately.

The old man nodded approvingly. ""You remember. Good."" He reached into a pouch at his waist and withdrew a small carved figurine—a tiki about three inches tall, made from dark wood. ""Keep this near register. Protection.""

Leilani accepted it reverently. ""Mahalo, Anakala.""

""Not for you,"" he said. ""For him. They curious about new blood.""

After setting the figurine beside the register, the old man slid off his stool. ""Moon rises soon. I go now."" He fixed me with those penetrating eyes. ""When drums come, boy, you close everything. No hesitation. No questions. Understand?""

I nodded.

""And never look directly at who plays them."" With that enigmatic warning, he left.

""Who is he really?"" I asked Leilani once he'd gone.

""One who remembers the old ways,"" she replied, placing the tiki figure carefully beside our register. ""He helps protect this place.""

""From what?"" I pressed.

She turned to me, expression serious. ""There's a reason hotels along this stretch have bad luck. Disappearances. Accidents. Before Waikiki was tourist central, this area was kapu—sacred and forbidden. The barrier between worlds thins here, especially during certain moon phases.""

""You actually believe all this?""

Her eyes hardened. ""You saw the sand in your shoes. The woman who appeared differently to everyone. What more proof do you need?""

Before I could respond, the businessmen at the large table called for another round. I returned to work, but Anakala Keoki's warning echoed in my mind.

Around 11:30, the night shifted.

The air turned heavy, dense with humidity despite the ceiling fans spinning overhead. The tide must have rolled in because the sound of waves grew louder, more insistent. Conversations seemed muted, as if traveling through water to reach my ears.

I served drinks and collected payment, trying to ignore the prickling sensation at the back of my neck—the feeling of being watched.

At midnight, Leilani made an unusual announcement.

""Due to a private event, we'll be closing at 1 AM tonight instead of 2. Last call in 45 minutes."" She ignored the grumbles from remaining customers.

The businessmen had dwindled to three, stubbornly ordering more drinks. A handful of tourists lingered at scattered tables. Through the open windows facing the beach, I saw the moonless sky hanging black above the ocean.

""Early closing?"" I asked Leilani when she returned to the bar.

""New moon,"" she replied tersely. ""Bad night to be open late."" She glanced at her watch. ""Lock the storeroom now. Rule three.""

The back storeroom remains locked between midnight and 3 AM. For ANY reason.

I dutifully secured the storeroom, double-checking the lock. When I returned, Leilani was closing windows on the beach side of the bar.

""But it's not even raining,"" protested a sunburned tourist as she shut the window near his table.

""Building regulations,"" she lied smoothly. ""Fire code.""

I continued serving drinks, noticing Leilani growing increasingly tense as 1 AM approached. She kept glancing toward the beach, visible through the one window we'd left open for ventilation.

""Last call,"" I announced at 12:45. Most remaining patrons settled their tabs and filtered out into the night.

The three businessmen resisted. ""Come on, one more round,"" slurred the apparent leader, a broad man with a Rolex and thinning hair. ""We're celebrating!""

""Sorry, sir. We need to close on time tonight,"" Leilani said firmly.

""It's vacation! Rules are meant to be broken,"" another man laughed, clearly intoxicated.

At his words, the lights flickered briefly. The open window burst in from a sudden seaward gust, its shutters slamming against the wall.

And that's when I heard it—a faint rhythm carried on the wind. Distant drums, beating in a pattern that raised the hairs on my arms.

Boom. Boom-boom. Boom. Boom. Boom-boom. Boom.

Leilani's head snapped toward the sound. ""Kai, the window! Now!""

I rushed to the open window, fighting against the wind that seemed determined to keep it open. Through the darkness, I saw movement on the beach—shadowy figures gathered at the water's edge. The drumming grew louder.

With a final push, I slammed the window shut and locked it. Leilani was already herding the remaining customers toward the exit.

""We're closed. Everyone out. No exceptions,"" she insisted, her voice leaving no room for argument.

""But our drinks—"" the businessman began.

""On the house. Please leave immediately."" She practically pushed them through the door.

The drumming intensified, now a physical pressure against the glass of the windows. I felt it reverberating in my chest, matching my heartbeat then subtly altering it—trying to synchronize with the external rhythm.

As the last customer stumbled out, Leilani locked the front door and turned off the ""Open"" sign. The normal lights dimmed automatically, leaving only the oil lamps along the bar providing soft, wavering illumination.

""What's happening?"" I asked, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.

""They're coming ashore,"" Leilani whispered. ""Night marchers.""

""Night what?""

""Huaka'i pō—procession of ancient warrior spirits. They march on moonless nights along certain paths."" She motioned for me to stay low behind the bar. ""This building sits on their trail.""

The drumming grew louder still, impossible to ignore. Other sounds joined it—a rhythmic shuffling like numerous feet on sand, the clatter of what might have been spears or other weapons, and voices chanting in Hawaiian too ancient for me to understand.

""Why did we have to close the windows?"" I whispered.

""Looking upon the night marchers means death,"" Leilani replied. ""Meeting their eyes.. they'll take your spirit with them.""

""That's just superstition—"" I began.

A thunderous BOOM shook the entire building, as if something massive had struck the outer wall. Bottles rattled on shelves. The bar lights flickered, then stabilized.

""If they can't enter, they'll try to make us look,"" Leilani warned. ""Cover your ears. Don't listen to any voices calling your name.""

The procession seemed to surround the building now. Through the windows—though I dared not look directly—I sensed movement, shadow figures passing by. The pressure in the air increased until my ears popped.

Something scraped against the glass—nails or spear points tracing patterns across its surface. The temperature plummeted. My breath fogged in front of me.

Then I heard it—a voice, deep and resonant, speaking my name.

""Kai Nakamura,"" it called. ""Kāne'ohe keiki. Look upon us.""

The compulsion to turn, to peer through the windows, nearly overwhelmed me. Something ancient and powerful pulled at my consciousness.

""Son of Nakamura,"" the voice continued, now directly outside the window nearest me. ""Your grandmother knew us. Honored us. Will you deny your ancestry?""

I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the urge. Beside me, Leilani clutched the small tiki figure Anakala Keoki had left, muttering what sounded like a prayer.

The voice grew angry. ""LOOK AT US!""

The window nearest me cracked—a spiderweb of fractures spreading across the glass. Cold air seeped through.

Leilani pressed the tiki figure into my hand. It burned hot against my palm.

The procession circled the building once more, drums beating a frenzied rhythm. The chanting rose to a crescendo, then suddenly—

Silence.

Complete, absolute silence.

The pressure disappeared. Warmth gradually returned to the air.

""Are they gone?"" I whispered.

""For now,"" Leilani said, slowly rising from behind the bar. ""They can only stay until the first hint of dawn.""

I looked down at the tiki in my hand. The wood had darkened, as if scorched from within.

""What would have happened if I'd looked?"" I asked.

""Best not to find out."" She took the figurine gently. ""This protected you. Anakala knew they would call to you specifically.""

""Why me?""

""New blood draws their attention. And you're connected to this place through your ancestry."" She placed the tiki back by the register. ""The night marchers remember family lines. Your grandmother probably made offerings to them.""

I recalled Grandma's stern warnings about certain beaches at night, the food she would sometimes leave outside on dark moon nights. Practices I'd dismissed as old folk traditions.

""This is real,"" I murmured, not quite a question.

""All of it,"" Leilani confirmed. ""The rules aren't arbitrary, Kai. They're survival.""

As we finished closing, I noticed the window that had cracked was completely intact—no sign of damage anywhere.

But inside my shoes, once again, I found black sand.

After the night of the drums, I couldn't dismiss what was happening at Kahuna's as mere superstition. The next morning, I drove to my father's physical therapy appointment earlier than usual, determined to ask him what he knew.

I found Dad already dressed, sipping coffee on our small lanai.

""You look tired,"" he observed as I joined him. ""Late shift again?""

""Something like that."" I sat across from him, watching mynah birds hop across the lawn. ""Dad, what do you know about night marchers?""

His coffee cup paused halfway to his lips. ""Why are you asking about that?""

""Just curious. Heard some tourists talking about it.""

Dad set his cup down. ""Huaka'i pō. The ghostly procession of ancient warriors. My mother—your grandmother—believed in them completely."" He studied my face. ""She claimed to have seen them once, as a child on the Big Island. Said that's why she always left offerings on certain nights.""

""Did you ever see anything?""

""No,"" he admitted. ""But there were places she wouldn't let me go after dark. Trails and beaches where the processions were said to cross.""

""Like the stretch near Kahuna's?""

His eyes narrowed. ""What happened at work, Kai?""

I hesitated, then told him about the drumming, the voices, the temperature drop. I left out the part about the voice knowing my name.

Dad listened without interrupting. When I finished, he rubbed his weakened arm—a habit he'd developed since the stroke.

""That bar sits on an old pathway,"" he finally said. ""Before the hotels, before the tourists, it was kapu—forbidden to walk there at night. When developers came in the '60s and '70s, most locals warned them. But money speaks louder than warnings.""

""So these.. spirits.. they're real?""

""What do you think?"" He turned the question back on me.

I thought about the black sand in my shoes, the woman who appeared differently to each observer, the voice calling my name.

""I think I've seen things I can't explain,"" I admitted.

Dad nodded. ""Kahuna's was built by a man who understood that—a haole developer named Gregory Martin. Unlike the others, he sought permission.""

""Permission from whom?""

""From those who came before. Through proper channels—kahunas, ceremonies, offerings."" Dad gazed toward the distant mountains. ""That's why Kahuna's stands while other businesses in that area have failed. Martin made arrangements.""

""There's that word again—arrangements.""

""Yes. Bargains with forces we've forgotten how to see."" Dad finished his coffee. ""Your grandmother would say you're being noticed because of your bloodline. Island spirits recognize their own, even diluted by generations away.""

""What about the storeroom?"" I asked. ""Why can't it be opened between midnight and 3 AM?""

Dad's expression darkened. ""I don't know specifics, but those hours—especially the third hour after midnight—that's when the veil thins. In many traditions, not just Hawaiian, 3 AM marks when spirits have the most power.""

I drove Dad to his appointment, my mind churning. Later that afternoon, I searched online for information about Kahuna's and its founder. There wasn't much—just tourist reviews and mentions on Waikiki bar guides. Nothing about Gregory Martin or sacred pathways.

But I did find one interesting forum post from five years ago:

""Worked at Kahuna's in Waikiki back in 2018. Weirdest job ever. Manager had all these rules we had to follow. NEVER break them. Friend of mine needed supplies from storeroom after midnight—opened door and disappeared for THREE DAYS. Came back with no memory. Quit immediately. That place isn't right.""

The post had no replies and the account was deleted.

That night at Kahuna's, I arrived early to look around. The bar was empty except for Leilani, who was reviewing inventory lists in her small office.

I took the opportunity to examine the storeroom during daylight hours. It was ordinary enough—shelves stocked with liquor bottles, cleaning supplies, bar tools, and promotional materials. The back wall held extra glasses and mugs. Nothing seemingly magical or mysterious.

The only unusual feature was the door itself—heavier than necessary for a storeroom, with three separate locks. Above the door frame, nearly hidden unless you looked for it, was a carving of a stylized face—stern and watchful.

""That's Kane,"" Leilani said behind me, making me jump. ""God of creation and fresh water.""

""Why is he guarding a storeroom?""

""Not guarding. Containing."" She checked her watch. ""We open in fifteen minutes. Let's get ready.""

The evening progressed normally. Wednesday crowds were thinner, mostly hotel guests from nearby properties. Around 11 PM, Leilani received a phone call and frowned.

""Emergency with my son's babysitter,"" she explained. ""I need to leave. Can you handle closing?""

""Of course,"" I assured her.

""Remember—""

""Lock the storeroom by midnight. No exceptions.""

She nodded. ""And don't forget to pour the offering before you leave."" She indicated a small wooden bowl near the register. ""Ocean water in the bowl, place it outside the back door.""

After Leilani left, the remaining hours passed smoothly. By 1:30 AM, only a young couple remained, finishing their cocktails in a corner booth. I was wiping down the bar when I heard a loud thump from the storeroom.

I froze, cloth in hand.

Another thump, followed by what sounded like bottles rattling on shelves.

""Did you hear that?"" the woman at the booth asked her companion.

""Probably just the building settling,"" he replied.

I checked my watch: 1:47 AM. The storeroom was locked as required, but something was inside. Or something wanted in.

The couple finished their drinks and left, leaving me alone in the bar. The thumping continued intermittently. At one point, I swore I heard scratching against the door, like nails or claws.

At 2:15 AM, my phone buzzed with a text from Jimmy, our night cook:

Left my wallet in the supply room earlier. Need it for bus home. You still there?

I texted back: Yes, but storeroom's locked until 3.

The response came quickly: Please man, last bus is at 2:30. Can't get home without ID/bus pass in wallet.

I glanced at the storeroom door. The thumping had stopped. Rule 3 was explicit: The back storeroom remains locked between midnight and 3 AM. For ANY reason.

But this was Jimmy—a real person with a real problem. What was I supposed to do, make him stranded all night over some superstition?

Give me 5 min to find it, I texted back.

I approached the storeroom door cautiously. The carving of Kane seemed to watch me, its wooden eyes somehow attentive. I took out my keys, hand hesitating over the lock.

A cold breath of air brushed my neck, though no windows were open. The lights in the hallway dimmed slightly.

My phone buzzed again: Hurry man, only 10 min till bus!

Decision made, I inserted the key in the first lock. The metal turned cold in my hand—so cold it nearly burned. I pulled back instinctively.

My phone rang—Jimmy calling now.

I answered. ""Hey, I'm trying to get in but—""

""Don't open that door,"" came a voice that was definitely not Jimmy's. It was deep, layered with something that made my skin crawl. ""Not yet time.""

I ended the call immediately, backing away from the door. My phone buzzed again with texts:

Almost there? Need my wallet Please Kai

The last message made my blood freeze. I'd never told Jimmy my name. In the kitchen, he only ever called me ""bartender"" or ""new guy.""

I silenced my phone and retreated to the bar. The oil lamps flickered as I passed, though there was no breeze. At precisely 2:30 AM, the thumping at the storeroom resumed—louder now, angry. The door rattled in its frame.

I sat behind the bar, the small tiki figure clutched in my hand, watching the minutes crawl by. At 2:58, the noise reached a crescendo, the entire hallway filling with sounds of crashing and banging. The lights flickered rapidly.

Then my phone lit up with a call—no caller ID. Against better judgment, I answered.

""Hello?""

Silence, then: ""You chose wisely, Kai Nakamura."" It was Anakala Keoki's voice. ""Not everyone passes that test.""

The call ended. At exactly 3:00 AM, all noise from the storeroom ceased. The lights stabilized.

I waited five more minutes before approaching the door again. The locks turned easily now, the metal warm to the touch. Inside, everything was perfectly in order—not a bottle out of place, no sign of disturbance.

No wallet anywhere.

Later, as I was leaving, I remembered to fill the wooden bowl with seawater from a container kept in the fridge. I placed it outside the back door as instructed.

When I returned in the morning, the bowl was empty and dry, as if someone—or something—had accepted the offering.

Jimmy, when he arrived for his shift, had his wallet in his back pocket. He looked confused when I mentioned the texts.

""My phone died yesterday,"" he said, showing me his cracked screen. ""Haven't charged it since Monday.""

The following Monday, Dad had an MRI scheduled at Queens Medical Center. I dropped him off and wandered to the hospital cafeteria to wait, exhausted from another night of strange occurrences at Kahuna's.

While nursing a mediocre coffee, I scrolled through my phone, researching anything I could find about Hawaiian mythology related to bars or crossroads. My search yielded little beyond tourist websites with watered-down versions of Pele legends.

""You look like you haven't slept in days,"" a voice observed.

I glanced up to see a middle-aged white man in an expensive aloha shirt, holding a coffee cup. Something about him seemed vaguely familiar.

""Mind if I join you?"" he asked. ""All the other tables are full.""

I gestured to the empty chair across from me. The cafeteria was indeed crowded with staff and visitors.

""Thanks."" He sat down. ""I'm waiting for my father. Outpatient procedure.""

""Same here,"" I replied.

The man studied me over his coffee cup. ""Sorry for staring, but you remind me of someone. Do you work in Waikiki by any chance?""

I tensed, suddenly wary. After the fake texts from ""Jimmy,"" I'd grown suspicious of strangers showing interest in me.

""I tend bar,"" I answered vaguely.

""At Kahuna's,"" he said, not a question. ""I recognized you from the security footage Leilani sent me.""

My hand tightened around my coffee cup. ""Who are you?""

""Thomas Martin."" He extended his hand. ""My father opened Kahuna's in 1972. I manage the business side now.""

I shook his hand cautiously. ""Kai Nakamura.""

""I know. Leilani speaks highly of you."" His blue eyes assessed me. ""Says you've followed the rules diligently. That's rare for newcomers.""

""You're the mysterious owner who never shows his face?""

Thomas smiled. ""I visit occasionally, but yes, I keep my distance. The arrangement works better that way.""

There was that word again—arrangement.

""What arrangement exactly?"" I asked.

Thomas glanced around the crowded cafeteria, then lowered his voice. ""My father was different from other developers. When he came to Hawaii in the late '60s, he respected the land and its.. inhabitants. Both seen and unseen.""

""You mean spirits.""

""Among other things."" He sipped his coffee. ""When he wanted to build on that particular spot in Waikiki, locals warned him about the night marchers' path, the thin boundary there. Instead of dismissing them, he sought guidance from kahunas.""

""Like Anakala Keoki?""

Thomas nodded. ""His father, actually. They told Dad he could build there, but only with proper protocols. Rules that must never be broken.""

""And your father agreed?""

""He more than agreed—he became a student of Hawaiian spirituality. Learned the old ways, the proper offerings."" Thomas set down his cup. ""The rules at Kahuna's aren't arbitrary. Each addresses a specific entity or energy that claims that space.""

I thought about my recent experiences. ""The night marchers. The woman who orders the Pele Special. Whatever's in the storeroom between midnight and 3 AM.""

""Yes. And others."" Thomas leaned forward. ""Has a local man come in asking for rum? Always the last customer?""

""My first night,"" I confirmed. ""Leilani wouldn't let me serve him rum.""

""Rule One."" Thomas nodded. ""Never serve the last customer rum. That's Kanaloa testing boundaries. Ocean god, among other domains. He takes many forms.""

""And the woman? Is she really Pele?""

""Sometimes. Other times, something older wearing her aspect."" Thomas checked his watch. ""The islands had spirits before Hawaiians arrived and named them. Some pre-date humanity entirely.""

The casual way he discussed these supernatural entities sent a chill through me.

""So Kahuna's sits at what—some kind of spiritual crossroads?""

""More like a thin spot. A place where our world and theirs overlap."" Thomas reached into his pocket and withdrew a small envelope. ""Which brings me to why I wanted to meet you.""

He slid the envelope across the table. Inside was a check for $5,000.

""What's this?"" I asked.

""Bonus. Leilani reported your incident with the storeroom—how something tried to trick you into opening it."" He tapped the check. ""Not everyone passes that test. The last bartender who opened that door during the forbidden hours disappeared for three days. Came back.. changed.""

I recalled the forum post I'd found. ""What happened to him?""

""Her,"" Thomas correc

I’m looking to move to this area in the next year. I live in Florida and I’m over the heat and beaches. I was born in Maine so cold doesn’t bother me. Infact I love it. 

What I need help with is areas to move into. What neighborhoods are good? I’m a 45 year old single gal, I have a 20 year old son and we are moving with my 75 year old mum. We are looking to buy either a duplex or a large enough house that we can essentially split into two households. I don’t mind sharing a kitchen and dining room and my mother is a crap cook haha. All three of us love good places to eat, quaint shops, good tea and coffee. I love going out at night, but I’m not a big drinker or party person. I’m an accomplished hairstylist, so I don’t want to live too far out of the way. My mum will be retiring and my son is looking to start his life!

My friend Sarah and I hang out pretty regularly - coffee dates, dinners, movies, the usual stuff. But literally EVERY SINGLE TIME we go somewhere that costs money, she ""forgets"" her wallet or her card ""isn't working"" or some other convenient excuse.  
  
It started small - she'd order a $6 latte and be like ""omg I totally forgot my wallet, can you spot me?"" Obviously I'd cover it because that's what friends do, right? But now it's escalated to full dinners, movie tickets, even Ubers where she's like ""can you get this one? I'll Venmo you!"" (spoiler: she never Venmos me).  
Had some money come in from a freelance project recently so it's not like I'm broke, but I've probably spent like $400+ on her stuff over the past few months and she's never once returned the favor or even acknowledged it.  
  
Last week was the final straw - we went to this nice brunch place, she ordered bottomless mimosas and an expensive entree, then pulls the ""wallet emergency"" again. When I suggested we just split what we each ordered, she got weird and said I was ""being money-focused"" and that ""real friends don't keep score.""  
But like... at what point does this stop being forgetfulness and start being straight-up using me as a personal ATM?

Since then, I go through these months-long cycles where nothing interests me anymore and I just wait for the day to end so I can start the next one. I'm not happy, sad, or angry. Just bored to death. I work out five times a week consistently, go on walks outside, eat clean, and keep my living space tidy. I maintain a normal sleep schedule. I don't do drugs or smoke, but I have a beer every now and then and tend to drink a lot of black coffee. I perform well at work and don't have any issues. I don't really have any friends but that's just part of getting older. I do have issues sleeping sometimes, but that's about it.

I spend my days thinking about stuff that used to be fun. I'll make posts asking about video games I used to play to see if I can generate any interest within myself. I'll even start playing a game or movie but I always end up turning it off due to extreme boredom. It's like I don't really have a purpose for existing outside of work and everything I used to enjoy is no longer entertaining.

Do you store reusable water and coffee bottles/mugs (meal and plastic) lids off, without the lids sealing the completely, or dry, and tightened on it?

I remember my mom never storing anything reusable with the lid on, even bone dry. Maybe it was the old days worried about a smell. I've modified that idea for years due to space and hang lids off so they're half open, and leave small caps off. This takes away from space saving. 

Many sites I've read are all about maximum storage, and cleaning. One site contradicted itself, store sealed, then don't store sealed. The other sites all gave repetitive ideas based on storage and cleaning - I know all of that. BTW, their photos show them stored lids closed with Lids. Dumb question #2: should I take that as store sealed is safe?

PERSON SUIT/***A mild blend of green fig, Iso-E-Super, sandalwood and musk***

do i even need to sing this fragrance any more praises than i already do? aw whatever i will, IT’S AMAZING. it’s my signature scent, there’s something so addicting and mysterious about it that will always have me coming back for more. frankly, i’d like to be embalmed in this when i die to be honest with you. it’s not overly sweet, but the greeness of the fig is also reigned in by it’s own sweetness. it smells like how it feels to rub a fuzzy green fig, i literally don’t know what sort of magic pierrot gets up to in their blending room but i hope to GOD it never ends. yes it’s like moonlit fog, or a obscuring veil, i ADORE this perfume. when it settles down for a few hours on me the fig note blooms even more, going from a green fig to a sweeter purple one, it’s delicious– it’s intoxicating, i would drink it if i could but i won’t. 

**11/5** i need to be buried with this 

RAVENSTAG/***A sharp yet even blend of green pine, firewood, black musk, sweaty skin and a desperate plea from a mind on fire***

now i want to preface this with saying that i do not usually go for woody scents, like– at all. out of the almost now, 200, perfumes i’ve purchased/tried only 5 of them have been woody ones, this included. **this is the only woody scent that i’ve adored completely.** i don’t know if it’s my unconscious hannibal bias coming out but i don’t care, this perfume has its own merits outside of being related to my favorite show– it is an absolutely wonderful pine blend. the notes to me sounded a bit scary, oppressive and maybe unsuitable for wear outside of novelty but that isn’t the case at all. 

oh wow, the firewood really blooms on my skin! there was none of that in the bottle, this perfume is very very strong, only a single swipe is needed to wear it. (i accidentally put on a little too much whoops) after only a few moments the firewood is tamped down again and it’s back to that lovely pine forest that i adore. this perfume is so evocative, this sounds so weird if you haven’t watched the show but it is EXACTLY like when will graham ended up on a desolate road at 3am in wolf trap, virginia, confused and disoriented and suffering from a not-yet-diagnosed bout of encephalitis. 

the pine on my skin melds with the firewood and fire note, it is not a pure pine scent anymore instead it’s like a twinge of ash and heat in the midst of a pine forest. this is the beginning of a forest fire, and it is frankly amazing (not actual forest fires, those are bad. obviously, i’m not advocating for starting forest fires i promise). i’d full size this in a heart beat. 

**5/5**, smokey bear would hate this perfume

MILK TEETH/***A sweet blend of strawberry milk, amber white musk, and cedarwood.***

i didn’t buy this directly from pierrot, i got a small decant of it, and i liked it so much i picked up another decant of it. my goodness, it has big projection on my skin– at least initially. it’s not really… lactonic, i’d say? i think it kind of oscillates between specifically the garden brand strawberry wafers and strawberry shampoo for me. both of which get points for the nostalgia factor, it’s creamy regardless of whether it reads as wafers or shampoo for me. the white musk is so addicting in here, i can’t describe it– but it provides this like.. brightness to the whole blend that uplifts it and stops it from veering too hard into being overly sweet. i can’t pick out the cedarwood itself but i think that it’s also contributing to grounding the whole blend. i suspect that this strawberry would be similar to that of pierrot’s other strawberry, purrgeoisie. (at least in that strawberry shampoo aspect) it’s uncomplicated, it’s easy to wear, it’s sweet and girly– what’s not to love? another one that’s fs worthy to me :) 

(i do want to mention that this does not read as edible to me, that’s something that i don’t really enjoy when it comes to perfumes. the musk and cedar prevents it from nosediving into full blown food territory which i also appreciate) 

**5/5,** i need to pick up a pack of those strawberry wafers now

HIEROPHILIA/***An absolutely hedonistic blend of frankincense, myrrh, lit incense, and sex***

it’s frankincense and myrrh. can’t really mess that up i think. that doesn’t mean that it’s bad, not at all. in fact i quite like this too. another pierrot sleeper perfume i think, it’s made me realize that i DO in fact like “churchy” incense, i just don’t like the sandalwood that usually accompanies it (i CURSE you sandalwood incense) it’s sexy, it’s dirty and it’s uncomplicated– simple. but what it does, it does so very effectively. there’s something almost, *animalic* in quality in here. i suspect it might be the “sex” note to be honest, but it only adds to the perfume, sullies that “pure and clean and holy” imagery that frankincense and myrrh invoke. i described it in the “indies of the day” thread as “ a wolf circling around a church” and i think it still stands. the dirtiness does not ever cross that line of being too much, only lingers around the edges, always present but never at the forefront and it just– works SO well. 

i think that layering this together with ravenstag would be absolutely amazing. hierophilia provides just the teensiest bit of warmth to ravenstag’s pine and woods, they compliment each other so well. it’s like trying to find a single moment of comfort in a burning forest, these two are meant to be layered together. 

**5/5** im not religious but this is great!

VAMPYR/***A true amber perfume, sweet and musky***

this does NOT smell like your typical amber, like at all. i know that *technically* amber is a fantasy note, but when you think of it– it’s resinous yes? maybe just a little bit sweet, earthy– dusty, maybe? throw that idea out the window because this is not that. this is completely fruity to my nose. there is no typical amber note in here to speak of, not even a little bit. i described it as alkemia’s “elixir of aphrodite” *\[Persian apricots dipped in orange blossom honey swirling with a sensual enchantment of peach and plum blossoms, mimosa, white star jasmine, ambrette, guaiac wood, and vanilla musk.*\] it’s fruity, it’s perfect for warm weather. this is not a vampire this is a megabat, to be honest. this is a fruit bat on halloween. but i don’t really care. i love it– shocker i know, “*what* ***don’t*** *you like from pierrot*?” not much i’ll tell you that. 

it’s a little simple on it’s own, fruity and sweet and a little linear, but i think it’s perfect for layering with citrus! it goes really nicely with alkemia’s “sadzi” *\[An energetic brightness of mandarin orange, tangelo citrus, tart key limes, calamondin, pomelo, bergamot, and fig tea infused in sparking lemongrass musk*\] or alkemia’s “prairie 66” \[*Sage Flowers, Aldehydes, Grapefruit, Linden Blossoms, Bergamot, Saffron, Gray Amber, Yucca, Yuzu, and a touch of cool concrete*\] or anything that could be described as “bright”, “sparkling” or has aldehydes listed in the notes. 

the aldehydes in other perfumes serve to brighten it a little, to make it more complicated, less linear. like opening the curtains in a stuffy room of an emo teen, except it goes A LOT better… anyway. don’t go into buying this perfume with the impression that this would be sexy, or sultry, or anything of the sort, because it’s not. but if you love fruit, or alkemia’s EoA then you’d like this too! 

**5/5** if being a poser as a vampire was a perfume 

SANGUINACCINO DOLCE/***A gourmet blend with dark cocoa, dried rose, almond milk, orange zest, cinnamon stick, pink pepper and a haughty sense of superiority.***

smells exactly like the trader joe’s dark chocolate orange. the “orange zest” reads more like someone threw an orange at my face, it is STRONG and it sort of covers up the rest of the notes. it’s a little too sweet for my tastes (i do have to say that i’m an old man when it comes to sweet things, i drink exclusively black coffee and i like 70% dark chocolate, i don’t like it when things are too sweet) the dark cocoa in here is more like, 50ish percent cocoa? it’s not as dark and astringent as i would’ve liked, so i have to keep looking for a nice dark chocolate scent. i think it also goes a little too much into “edible” territory for me to full enjoy it. it’s another issue of i like the smell of something edible, but i do not want to smell like something edible. this was a bigger issue when it wasn’t rested but it some of the sweetness did fade after some rest, which is nice. and before i found that the pink pepper note turned sour on my skin when the chocolate and orange/sweetness faded, but that astringency has also been smoothed over. there’s the teensiest hint of rose, and cinnamon, but they’re far– far away from the chocorange action, like you *thought* of dried roses and cinnamon while eating a chocolate orange. i’ll use up the rest of it, but i don’t think that i’d buy it again. 

**4/5** please don’t eat me

SMELLS LIKE TEEN SLAYER/***A blend of stone fruits, sandalwood, amber, and white florals***

smells like the macy’s perfume department. (i swapped this on indie exchange for pierrot’s dead and lovely only a day or two after i got it :)) i think it’s supposed to invoke nostalgia for the 90’s? but i was born in 2005 so that doesn’t work on me, i have scant memories of the early 2000s. but! what i do remember is that this is what the perfume department in macy’s smelled like. that sort of, mainstream, generic and inoffensive “perfume” smell that’s suitable for the office. it was nice enough i suppose, but it was lackluster to me. a little forgettable compared to the other titans in pierrot’s eccentric catalogue. 

no one note really stood out to me, it really was like an amalgam of mainstream perfume i think. like if i smelled chanel no5 i wouldn’t be able to tell you any of the separate notes in it, that sort of thing, it’s just. perfume. to me. 

**3/5** sadly forgettable

MORUTE MARTYR/***Vanilla buttercream, skin musks, sugary sweet ribbon bows.***

i wanted to like it, but it was… just terrible. my first ever flop from pierrot was the one buy i thought was safest :/ (copy and pasted from my review masterlist) smells better in the bottle than it does on my hand? has weird sort of powery quality to it? might be coming from the ribbon note? it doesn’t smell too vanilla-y to my nose. a lot of the sweetness fades away from my skin and i’m left with a unsweetened sort of, i don’t even know how to describe it. it’s uhm. no, i don’t think it works for me sadly. might be my first miss from pierrot. smells like unsweetened nut milk maybe? i’m not a fan. i find that pierrot’s scents are linear in the way that they don’t change drastically over time/with rest, and i think that would work against it in this case. ? there was some sort of sweetness in the bottle, but it just smells acrid to me now. what a pity, i had high hopes for this one. 

i wiped the excess off of my skin and it’s transformed back into that sugar sweet vanilla frosting in the bottle. it’s not terrible but i wouldn’t like to sit through that acrid nut milk smell in order to reach this again.

**1/5** smells like teeth

as you can see, i love a LOT of things from this house, and as someone that seldom full sizes anything my wallet will be in shambles when they open up again. i hope that this house has a very long and fruitful future in the industry because i'm more than willing to give up handfuls after handfuls of money to them that's for sure. anywho, i hope this was somewhat helpful and enjoyable to read! have a wonderful rest of your day and happy sniffing, friends!

## Key Features Analysis

Dubai chocolate distinguishes itself through several key characteristics, reflecting the region's commitment to quality and innovation.

**Use of Premium Ingredients:** Authentic Dubai chocolate brands prioritize the use of the finest ingredients. this includes high-quality cocoa beans sourced from around the world,as well as locally sourced ingredients such as dates,saffron,and Arabian coffee. The emphasis on premium ingredients contributes to a rich, complex flavor profile that elevates the chocolate experience.

**Unique Flavor combinations:** dubai’s chocolate artisans are known for their bold and innovative flavor combinations. They expertly blend traditional Middle Eastern spices and ingredients with classic chocolate flavors, resulting in a truly unique and unforgettable taste. Examples include chocolate infused with cardamom, rosewater, or pistachios, offering a delightful sensory experience.

1kszd2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/1kszd2q/polygala_stacks/,Polygala stacks,"I have had some polygala sitting in my stash for a while and have been using a couple stacks with it daily with great success. They play off of the stimulating-yet-relaxing properties, short and long term effects, and consistency of effects. It's definitely a unique one! 

Note: these combinations are with powders taken sublingually.

1. Polygala (100 mg) + Panax ginseng leaf (200+ mg) + Caffeine source (I take with coffee)

Optional choline source

This has been great as a cognitive booster in late morning/early afternoon. The polygala ramps up the stimulating effects of everything else pretty sharply for about 20 minutes then smooths out. 

Something I noticed is the acute effects of polygala are pretty noticeable in the short term and then quickly level off. In the context of this stack, I get a nice stimulating buzz with caffeine along with increased mood & focus and a gentle comedown over the next couple hours.

Another interesting effect: polygala seems to work better the longer I've taken it (about 4 weeks now, daily). So rather than diminishing effects over time, I still get a consistent zing coming from polygala with this stack daily. It seems to preserve the novelty of the stimulation without developing a tolerance or disrupting parasympathetic tone. This is really interesting because other supplements that inhibit MAO (for me tribulus or rhodiola) make me feel TOO wired after a few days of consistent use and I end up using them more ""as needed"". Not the case with polygala.

2. Polygala (100 mg) + Schisandra (250+ mg)

I take this later in the afternoon or evening, usually right after work. This stack is more of a calming ""yin"" to the previous stack's ""yang"".  I get a really nice relaxing mood boost, but I'm still focused and ""present"". It's a nice segue into the evening where if you are ready to wind down, it helps - but if something comes up and you need to get back on the clock it still helps.

Like with the previous stack, the effects feel consistent from day to day. No diminishing of effects; if anything am attenuation of effects over time. I wonder if this has to do with polygala's neuromodulating effects. Polygala has NMDA antagonist properties but it's not so strong like for example agmatine which may ""flatten"" some people after some consecutive days of use.

So there you have it. I will add that after four weeks of using these two stacks, I wake up in the morning more refreshed and my baseline memory and mood have gone up a notch. I went with panax ginseng leaf and schisandra because I've used them consistently on and off for the past couple years and know how they feel individually or together. I also know I can take them daily without negative issues popping up eventually and that's how I originally intended to use polygala.

Speaking of schisandra and ginseng, you CAN use them together (or use Panamax instead) with polygala. However, personally, I notice more of the stimulating effects from the ginseng alone with the polygala and caffeine then when I add the schisandra to the mix, even though schisandra is thought to enhance the ginseng. It could be the schisandra plus polygala dialing down the stimulation more than just the polygala alone. Or it could just be me and the way my body reacts. Either way, I recommend giving any of these stacks a shot!",3,1747941589.0,NootropicsDepot,1,1.0,False

1kszcuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kszcuf/explore_the_ifedio_2_slice_toaster_cover_review/,Explore the iFedio 2 Slice Toaster Cover Review Can it Transform Your Kitchen?,"**Compact and Practical Design**  
From the moment I unboxed the iFedio 2 Slice Toaster Cover, model B08S3K752R, it was clear how much thought went into its design. I love its compact size, which fits snugly over my two-slice toaster without being bulky or awkward. Measuring 11 x 6.3 x 7.9 inches, it’s tailored perfectly for standard two-slice toasters, ensuring a polished look over my countertop appliance. The smooth nylon fabric in the elegant grey color adds a touch of sophistication to my kitchen. Because it’s water-resistant, accidental spills and splashes don’t feel like a potential hazard anymore. 

**Convenience Redefined**  
One of my favorite things about this toaster cover is its humanized design. The top handle is a game-changer. I hated wrestling with awkward covers in the past, but with this one, I can effortlessly pull it off and access my toaster in seconds. Having used it daily for over a month, I can confirm this feature alone adds a ton of practicality. 

[Grab iFedio B08S3K752R at the best price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b08s3k752r/)  

**Quality Construction and Material**  
The fabric quality is undeniably top-notch. I was genuinely impressed by how durable and well-stitched the material feels. It’s lightweight yet thick enough to provide a substantial protective barrier against dust, moisture, and pesky fingerprints. Plus, cleaning it is so simple! I had a minor mishap spilling coffee nearby, but a damp cloth took care of the splash in seconds. It still looked good as new after drying, showing its solid water-resistance capabilities.  

**Perfect Protection for Toasters**  
For someone like me who doesn’t use the toaster daily, this cover is a lifesaver. It shields the toaster from everyday dust, grease from cooking, and the occasional kitchen pest. My last toaster accumulated scratches and random crumbs over time, which drove me crazy. With this, I feel that my toaster is in good hands. I also appreciate its sleek, minimalist look; it feels less like a cover and more like an accessory for my kitchen.  

**Positives**  
- Lightweight build with a sturdy top handle for easy removal.  
- Water-resistant nylon fabric keeps spills and stains at bay.  
- Protects against dust, fingerprints, and scratches.  
- Compact size fits standard two-slice toasters perfectly.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The grey color is nice, but it may show stains over time if not cleaned immediately.  
- While it's perfect for two-slice toasters, larger appliances won’t fit.  

**Product Comparisons**  
I’ve used other toaster covers before, such as generic options from local retailers. What sets this one apart is its exceptional fit and water-resistant design. Competing products might come in various fabric options, but not all are resistant to splashes or stains. Some brands even struggle with misshapen designs that don’t fit snugly over appliances. In terms of balance, this iFedio cover stands out for both aesthetics and functionality. However, if you need a cover for a four-slice toaster, you’d have to look at larger options like Homestyle or Pioneer covers, which sometimes sacrifice style for size.  

**Value for Money**  
For the price, this is a stellar deal. Given its premium-quality material, durability, and useful design elements like the handle and water resistance, it offers excellent value for its purpose. Higher-end covers can sometimes feel overpriced for no added features, but this one strikes the right balance between affordability and performance.

1kszbgi,https://ameliewine.bar/announcement,Amelie Hampton Cove Closing,"Does anyone have details on why Amelie is closing? They have an announcement on their website that hints at some issue, and they’ve piqued my curiosity. 

Dear Amélie Friends and Wine Lovers,

We’re writing today with heavy hearts and a message we truly hoped we’d never have to share.

After much reflection and many months of frustrating efforts behind the scenes, we’ve made the difficult decision to close Amélie Wine Bar & Bistro at our current location. 

We had hoped to delay this a while, but over the last few weeks it became clear that the situation at our current location will not improve - and in fact, get worse.

***Our final evening of wine, cocktails, and dinner service will be  May 31st, 2025***

We will continue serving food, wine, and cocktails until each item runs out. Each day, we’ll post updates and any discounts on our Facebook page.

This decision has not come easily. For the past several months, we’ve done everything within our power—legally, logistically, and personally—to resolve challenges from an external source at our physical location that are entirely out of our control. 

Despite those efforts, the reality is that we can no longer operate the kind of uninterrupted evening dining experience that you, our guests, deserve and have come to expect from Amélie due to these outside influences specific to our current spot. 

When we opened Amélie, our vision was to create something special for Hampton Cove—a warm, unpretentious bistro with fantastic wines, delicious small plates, and a place for community and conversation. In every way, you helped make that dream come true. We’ve been overwhelmed by your support, encouragement, and enthusiasm. That makes this all the harder to say.

But hopefully—this is not goodbye.

We’re taking the next step forward, even if it’s not the one we originally planned. Beginning in mid-June, we’ll be re-opening our space as  Amélie Coffee during the daytime only, serving guests daily with excellent coffee, hot and cold espresso drinks, teas, as well as pastries, healthy snacks, and breakfast sandwiches from 7am to 3pm.

Our vision for a cozy café was always part of our original plan—modeled after the European-style bistro that welcomes you with coffee and pastries by day, and wine and food by night. We simply wanted to focus on the more challenging part - the wine bar - first. 

While we didn’t expect the shift to happen this way, we’re embracing the opportunity to build something new, high-quality and equally welcoming for our community. We want Amélie Coffee to become a “third space” to get your coffee and tasty treats, meet for conversations, hang out or work remotely. 

We also want to thank NAI Chase Commercial, our current property manager/landlord, for their support of this transition. Their assistance has been most helpful especially with regard to moving to our new coffee bar concept. 

As for the wine bar? We’re already working on it now.

We’re in active talks to secure a new location, still right here in the area. While the space we’re pursuing won’t be ready until Spring 2026, our goal is to return with a new Amélie Wine Bar & Bistro that builds on everything we started—bigger, better, and built to last.

To say we’re disappointed would be an understatement.

But more than anything, we are grateful—to all of you who’ve made Amélie feel like something more than just a place to grab a drink. You made it a place with heart, and we intend to keep that spirit alive very soon in Améllie Coffee and the new location for our wine bar.

We hope you’ll visit us at Amélie Coffee, where we’ll continue offering the same commitment to quality, comfort, and community—now with espresso, teas, pastries, healthy snacks, and breakfast treats, all made with care.

Thank you, truly, for your kindness, your loyalty, and your understanding. This is a transition we didn’t choose at this particular moment, but we’re meeting it with purpose and optimism for what comes next.

With sincere gratitude,

We used to typically split chores up with me doing dishes and laundry, her dusting and vacuuming, etc. However for the past two years she has been in school getting a master's degree while working full time. Slowly, all the chores became my responsibility. I do the dishes, both of our laundry, dust and vacuum, tidy up at the end of the night, pack away leftovers and pack lunch the next day, make coffee in the morning... Everything except the major yard work like mowing and weed whacking. We bought  a house a few years ago that has a small pool. I skim the pool, handle the pool robot daily, check the chemicals, clean out the skimmer basket.... Everything. We got a cat a few years ago and I do all the cat tasks like litter box cleaning and brushing him. We just got a puppy. I do all of her potty breaks including going home during lunch, I make and attend the vet appointments, and I've mainly been the one training her despite having zero experience training a puppy, while my wife has previously trained two dogs. 

I'm a reasonable person; it would be difficult for her to do a lot of these things on top of work and then school work. I know that my wife's love language is acts of service. Most of the time, I'm fine with doing these tasks if it makes her life easier and if thats how she feels love. But when it really bothers me is when she tells me how to complete a task, or tells me that I did something wrong, or asks why i did something a certain way. I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and when I go through my periods of depression, i get behind on all these tasks. She'll comment ""man, the house is a mess"" or ask me why my home office is a wreck. 

Last month, she had to travel for work and the lawn needed mowing. It had been raining for nearly two weeks and after finally drying up, it was due to rain the next day. So she wouldn't have to worry about it, I did it. I've only ever mowed the lawn once before when she was similarly out of town and it needed to get done. When she came home the first thing she asked was ""did you see all the spots you missed?"" Then huffed and puffed about how she now had to go fix it and do the weed whacking (I couldn't figure out how to keep the wire attached so I didn't touch it). She never thanked me. I would normally spend a night by myself playing video games, catching up on a Netflix show, or taking a nice bath. I skipped out on all of that and spent the whole night on the lawn as well as other necessary house tasks... Just to try making her life easier. 

Sometimes I want to tell her, if you aren't the one doing the task then you don't get to criticize how it gets done. Would I be the asshole to tell her this, albeit in a nicer way? She's almost done with her degree and she's said that once she's done we can go back to splitting things more evenly, and thanks me generally for doing all the work. But beyond that general thanks, when she criticizes me I don't feel like she's grateful for any of it. ",9,1747941328.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,11,1.0,False

I am a 36 year old male, HIV+, with only minor medical conditions (eczema, carpal tunnel). I have never had anything Cardiac of note.

Yesterday (Wednesday) morning I woke up and as soon as I got out of bed, I felt some of the most extreme dizziness and nausea I've experienced and felt kind of forward a bit. I went to try to start my morning routine, made some coffee, and within about 20 minutes, vomited up the coffee. I switched to sipping water from that point on.

All through the day whenever I would stand or turn my head, I could feel immediate vertigo. My stomach turns upon the feeling of vertigo, but does not feel bad at all outside of those moments. I am able to stomach some bland pasta.

I went to Urgent Care last night. The doctor there had the nurse come in and do BP testing where I would sit and then stand and they were measuring both. My BP went down during those instances (from 120/77 to 99/89 if I read her post-it note correctly). I don't know what is significant or what is not, but she did tell me that. He then prescribed some Zofran for the nausea and let me go.

What scares me is constantly feeling like I'm going to faint feels serious. We weren't able to really determine why I am all of the sudden feeling extreme vertigo and nausea when I never have before in my life.

I woke up today and was more cautious not to drink coffee first thing. I did not vomit today, however I am continuing to feel the same nausea and dizziness. I took 4mg of Zofran 2 hours ago and the nausea continues.

I have no idea what this could be, but even sitting here typing I feel every few moments like I might faint. Sometimes I get that electric-shocky feeling down my back.

Does anyone have any clue? I tried sending my Primary Doc a note on MyChart this morning and have not heard back.

Medications are:

Dovato - Daily for HIV

Triamcinolone - an as-needed steroid for eczema (I had gone from 24 hours between applications to 36 hours as part of titrating downward)

Zofran (just prescribed for this situation) - took 4mg today for nausea",1,1747941319.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

I don't use reddit often, but I loooove the backpacking community on here. So, it is that time where I log back on and ask for some advice on my next trip and see what everyone has been up to!

I am a 20 year old girl and have been on 4 solo trips- some quite long and some quite short. My last trip was a last minute one week long adventure in Oaxaca my friends invited me to join them on. :) Two years ago I remember asking for advice on here for my first solo trip, and everyone was just amazing... And you guys were right, now I'm hooked!

As for right now, I have been looking for cheap flights for 14-16 days in December. Out of all the flights available, Guatemala caught my attention! I am at the very beginning stage of planning where I just gather interest and watch other travel videos. So far I've seen that many people recommend covering Belize and Guatemala in the same trip.

Originally I was considering El Salvador and Guatemala, but I am leaning more towards Belize if I do decide to add it on.

The main objective of this trip will be beach, good eats, good coffee, time in nature, and SPANISH!!

I absolutely love Spanish, and am looking for every chance I can to speak it. I know that in Belize the official language is English, BUT I am considering going there because I've heard they have great beaches. I would also love to hang out on the Caribbean again, it has to be one of my favorite parts of the world.

I've been to Panama and Costa Rica, so I have a litttle bit of experience traveling in Central America. I am advanced level Spanish, and feel comfortable conversing and navigating.

Any recommendations?

Would 14 days be enough time to cover a little bit of Belize and Guatemala? Maybe 5 days in Belize, 10 in Guatemala? Should I just go for Guatemala? Any other destinations that would be just as cool?

A little about me:

* **6’1” | White | Bearded | Tattooed**
* **Kind, intelligent, and respectful**, but also a little blunt (in a fun way).
* Down-to-earth, sarcastic in the best way, and apparently hilarious (or so I’m told).
* A great storyteller who can talk about anything from 80s nostalgia to deep sci-fi theories.
* Big-time coffee lover, Netflix binger, and pub grub enthusiast.
* Life’s too short to be too serious—I like to keep things light, fun, and full of laughs.

I’m an introvert and a bit of a homebody. I’m not big on crowds or chaotic energy, but I *do* enjoy meaningful connections. I’m looking for someone who can understand that, but also help nudge me out of my comfort zone once in a while. Let’s push each other to grow in the best ways.

I have a solid career (yes, I work a lot) and two amazing kids who live with me 50% of the time. I co-parent well with my ex and am **not** looking for a mom for my kids—just someone great to share good times with.

I live a sober lifestyle. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. Not against anyone who enjoys a drink or smokes weed, but cigarettes/hard drugs are a pass for me. If partying every weekend is your thing, we probably won’t vibe.

I’m **clean, hygienic, DDF**, and—humble brag—I might just be the **best-smelling guy you’ll ever meet**. Also, let’s just say I definitely know how to handle myself in the bedroom.

**A quick note:** If you’re not actually ready to chat, or you tend to ghost, that’s totally fine—just please don’t message. And if my pics aren’t your thing, it’s cool to say so and move on—no hard feelings. I’m not perfect, but I make up for it in a lot of other ways. I’m definitely not ugly, either.

**All races and religions are welcome**—I’m open-minded and genuinely appreciate different backgrounds and perspectives.

If you’re up for good conversation, maybe grabbing a coffee, or just seeing where things go, hit me up. **Bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie.**",1,1747941242.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

1ksz5tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1ksz5tr/title_and_link_please/,Title and link please,"I thought my husband was broke. For three years, I paid for everything—rent, groceries, even his morning coffee.

Once, while we were out shopping, I saw a $20 purse I liked. He took one look and said it was too expensive.

Then one day, by sheer accident, I found out he bought his first love a $4 million diamond necklace—for her birthday.

Turns out, he wasn't drowning in debt like he led me to believe. He was actually the heir to a billion-dollar empire.

...

I got home late after a long shift, took a quick shower, and collapsed onto my bed. I was scrolling through my phone when a notification popped up that made my heart stop.

""Popular actress Isabella Montgomery receives a $4 million diamond necklace from a mysterious tycoon for her birthday.""

My hands trembled as I zoomed in on the photo.

You couldn't see his face, just his back, but after three years of marriage, I'd know him anywhere. The dark mole behind his ear gave him away.

It was Ethan. My husband.

Four million dollars. I couldn't even wrap my head around that kind of money.

Just a few days ago, we were out shopping when I spotted a $200 handbag I really liked. Ethan immediately said it was too expensive and gently talked me out of buying it.

I did the math, $200 could buy a ton of tissues or last us weeks in groceries. So I let it go.

Now, I could barely breathe.

Ethan and I met online.

After chatting for a couple of months, we met up, hit it off instantly, and fell hard. On Valentine's Day, he got down on one knee with a soda can tab fashioned into a ring and said he'd buy me a real diamond once he made it big.

I said yes. Not for the diamond, because I loved him.

He told me he was an orphan, raised in a group home. He'd tried starting a business, but it failed, leaving him over a million dollars in debt. So we kept our wedding simple.

We rented a tiny apartment, and I paid the bills. I also covered most of our day-to-day expenses.

To make ends meet, I worked full-time during the day and picked up night shifts waiting tables.

His entire salary went toward clearing his debt.

I remember him once pulling me into his arms and whispering, ""Thank you for giving me a home, Audrey. I've never been this happy.""

He cried as he said, ""Once I pay everything off, I'll buy you a house, a car... I'll give you the life you deserve. I'm so sorry you have to suffer with me.""

I kissed him and told him, ""As long as we're together, I'm already happy.""

I meant every word. Back then, I thought I was the luckiest woman alive.

Ethan was handsome, kind, didn't smoke or drink, and treated me like I was his whole world. Aside from being broke, he was perfect.

I thought if we both kept grinding, we'd get through this.

But now? Now I couldn't stop crying.

Then, right on cue, a text from Ethan lit up my screen.

""Business is good tonight, Audrey. I'm staying out late to make more for the debt. Don't wait up, get some rest.""

He worked as a courier during the day and sometimes picked up gigs as a designated driver at night.

If I hadn't seen that photo, I would've believed every word.

So why was he lying?

I didn't sleep a wink. Ethan never came home.

The next morning, I got ready in a daze and stepped outside. Just as I was about to leave, I froze.

Across the street, I spotted someone I knew too well.

Ethan.

I ducked behind a tree, peeking out as he stepped out of a Bentley. Gone was the sleek suit from the night before, now he was back in the cheap T-shirt and jeans I'd bought him.

A middle-aged man handed him a plastic bag, steamed pork buns and soy milk.

My favorite breakfast.

Just then, another car pulled up. Out stepped the CEO of a big tech firm. My friend worked at his company.

He walked over to Ethan... and bowed slightly.

I blinked, stunned. That man had a reputation, he was powerful, ruthless, respected.

Why was he acting like a junior intern around my husband?

A minute later, Ethan called.

My screen lit up: ""Husband""

Tears blurred my vision. I took a breath and picked up.

""Hey, Audrey. I got you your favorite, steamed buns and soy milk.""

""I had to head in early today. You eat without me, okay?""

His voice sounded so normal. So warm.

""Alright,"" I said softly. ""I'll eat later.""

""I'll cook something nice when you get home,"" he added.

""Okay.""

I hung up and texted my boss to take the day off.

I wasn't going to work today.

I was going to find out who my husband really was.

I camped out at a coffee shop across the street, eyes fixed on our building.

Around noon, Ethan finally came out.

He got into the Bentley. I pulled on a mask and flagged down a taxi, tailing him from a distance.

We stopped at an upscale restaurant, white-glove service, valet parking, the works. The moment the car pulled up, the valet practically sprinted to open the door. Ethan tossed him the keys like he'd done it a hundred times.

I followed at a distance as he disappeared into a private dining room.

Inside, I could see a group of guys already seated, young, smug, dressed in expensive suits. The kind of people who were born into money.

I pretended to be on a call and lingered near the door.

They ordered big, lobster, king crab, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. Dishes I'd only ever seen on YouTube.

Meanwhile, at home, Ethan refused to throw away leftovers and insisted we eat them two days in a row.

Laughter burst out from the private room.

""Ethan, you look hilarious in those cheap clothes. The heir to a fortune dressing like a broke college kid, classic!""

""How long are you gonna keep up this act? Don't tell me you're seriously into that country bumpkin wife of yours?""

Then Ethan's voice cut through:

""Please. Audrey's just a toy. Something to kill time. You think I'd fall for someone like her?""

""I told her I was a million in debt, and she actually believed it. She said she'd suffer with me to pay it off. God, she's the most gullible woman I've ever met.""

They all roared with laughter.

And in that moment... it felt like my heart had been ripped out and stomped on.

Bleeding. Broken. Unrecognizable.

Chapter 2
I thought I was his true love, but I was just his pawn.

Even our happy marriage had been nothing more than an illusion he'd carefully crafted.

Ethan Sinclair wasn't some orphan struggling to make ends meet. His story of going bankrupt and being deep in debt? A complete lie. His family was wealthy, influential.

And then I overheard voices from the private room.

""By the way, I heard Isabella was thrilled when she got the necklace you sent her last night. She even wants to get back with you. Don't you think she'd be heartbroken if she found out you're married?""

""Serves her right! She dumped Ethan to chase her acting career abroad.""

""None of you know the real reason Ethan married that country girl—it was for revenge against Isabella.""

My body froze, my breath catching in my throat.

He didn't love me. I had been nothing but a tool to hurt someone else.

I clutched my chest, feeling my heart crack open.

Isabella Montgomery—his first love. Back then, his parents had disapproved of her acting dreams, so she left him.

Afterward, Ethan decided all women were untrustworthy, so he made a game out of manipulating their emotions, dating one after the other. Finally, he settled on marriage—to get back at Isabella.

But afraid his wealth would attract the wrong type of woman, he hid his identity and chose someone plain and ordinary.

And I was the fool who fell for it.

Isabella was the one who had wronged him, not me. So why had he destroyed my dignity like this? Why had he trampled on my heart?

A suffocating wave of pain hit me. Just as I turned to leave, I heard another voice from inside the room.

""Mr. Sinclair, what if Audrey finds out the truth?""

Ethan's voice dripped with disdain. ""She's too busy working to support me. She doesn't have time to care about anything else. After work, she runs to the market to buy discounted groceries just to cook for me.""

""If she finds out? Doesn't matter. I'll make sure she signs the divorce papers—empty-handed.""

All the color drained from my face.

And then I saw her—Isabella, stunningly dressed and glowing, walking toward the private room. The moment she entered, the room lit up with compliments.

By pure chance, a waiter opened the door to serve the dishes, and I caught a glimpse of Isabella sitting next to Ethan, their gazes locked in an intimate exchange.

She touched the diamond necklace around her neck and smiled coyly. ""I love the necklace. Thank you, Ethan.""

His lips curled into a slight smile. ""As long as you like it.""

How generous he was with his first love—a four-million-dollar necklace, given without hesitation.

Yet, in his eyes, I wasn't even worth a two-hundred-dollar handbag.

I couldn't bear to hear any more. I stumbled out of the restaurant, nearly losing my footing on the steps.

Outside, the tears came—hot and fast, the sobs wracking my body as I finally let myself fall apart.

For three years, I had loved Ethan with everything I had.

I worried about him working too hard, so I'd made nourishing soups to keep him healthy.

I stuck to cheap skincare, saving every penny to buy him nice clothes and shoes—lying that I'd gotten them with online discounts.

And he'd praised me for being clever.

But the truth was, I had been a fool.

By the time I made it home, the night had fallen. Ethan was in the kitchen, cooking.

When he heard me enter, he looked up with that warm smile of his. ""Honey, you're back. Dinner's ready.""

There he was, wearing an apron in our tiny kitchen. It was hard to believe he was the heir to a billionaire fortune.

As he stirred the pan, he chirped, ""The fish was fresh today. The vendor even gave me a two-dollar discount.""

""Oh, and I sold all the cardboard boxes I'd saved up for two weeks—made sixty-eight bucks. After groceries, I still have five left.""

I closed my eyes, the pain in my chest almost too much to bear.

He'd gone to such great lengths to keep up this charade.

The table was set with four dishes and a soup. In the past, I would've rushed to him, calling him the best husband in the world.

But now? All I felt was bitterness.

I remembered what I'd overheard at the restaurant and clenched my fists. Ethan had learned to cook—for Isabella.

Yet, he'd told me he only started after marrying me.

He'd also claimed he grew up unloved, hungry, and bullied—that he wouldn't have survived without charity.

I had felt my heart break for him.

But none of it had been true. Not a word of it.

Not even when he said he loved me.

Tears started streaming down my face.

Ethan set down the dish and hurried over, concern filling his eyes. ""Honey, did something happen at work?""

When I didn't answer, his frown deepened. ""Talk to me. Who upset you? Seeing you cry like this breaks my heart.""

""Once I start making real money, you won't have to work anymore. Just stay home. I'll take care of you.""

He kept calling me ""honey,"" his handsome face filled with worry—as if he actually loved me.

Was he for real? Because all I could think was he was full of crap.

My lips trembled as I asked, ""Ethan, do you love me?""

He smiled tenderly. ""Of course I do. You're the woman I love most in this world.""

I stared into his eyes, thinking of every cruel word I'd overheard in the restaurant—each one a bullet to my heart.

He looked down on me. He saw me as nothing more than a stepping stone to get back at Isabella.

So when he said he loved me, all I felt was disgust.

I moved out of my mother house when i was 19 because my mother is controlling and i believe that she is a narcissists. She always demands me to do things for her even though i need to get my stuff done. My fiance and i have been together for almost 8 years, this is also the time frame i havent been in contact or living with my mother. Life was fine, i was able to become more of an adult. I made mistakes, i learned how to cook, pay bills, etc. Thanks to my fiance he has been my support for this entire relationship. In 2024 i was pregnant with our daughter, 6 months into the pregnancy i decided to tell my family that i was pregnant. They came over to my house that week for my gender reveal, they bought me gifts, we caught up on life, and we were enjoying the day. Unfortunately the place i was living in went up in rent by 600 dollars and we were forced to move out. My father 77, said he was willing to help us out. So we moved in, we slept in a finished basement and my father slept in his room upstairs. His house has 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and a finished basement. He lives alone so he had plenty of space. The first week went well until he started complaining about the mess we were making, like water droplets on the sink, coffee machine not working, floors not sweeped and mopped, etc. Mind you he has never cleaned up his house EVER!!!! The past 5 years he has been living in this house he has not ONCE mopped his floor. Things escalated quickly and my father put his hands on me after an argument about why i exist. Then my fiance got involved and pushed him, leading to my father calling the police, taking us to court, and kicking us out. We were homeless for a month with a baby. After this my fiance contacted my mother about our situation and decided to help us out. Same situation but reverse. My dad is cheap, a hoarder, and extremely introverted. My mother is materialistic, narcissistic, and controlling. I came back to living in the same apartment i left 8 years ago and i expressed to my fiance multiple times ""I NEVER WANT TO LIVE WITH MY MOTHER AGAIN"". This is the reason why. Mind you, my name is still on her lease to her apartment. So she has been using my name this entire time i wasnt living there. She would call me lazy, and b**ch, and demand me to get my life together and listen to what she says. Im a stay at home mother, taking care of a 1 year old, taking care of an apartment, i have 3 side gigs that pay for the things we need, and currently looking for a stable job. On top of that i signed up for a ton of government assistance and rental assistance.  I expressed to her multiple times; You shouldnt be talking to me like im your slave or stop calling my lazy when i clean up after you and your home. She is extremely hard headed and prideful and believe whatever she said everyone must follow what she says. Years of depression, anixety, and mental abuse has come back to me and i didnt know what to do. The assistance i signed up for includes a therapist that comes to the house once a week. The day after mothers day my mother threatened my therapist to not come over anymore cause what i was telling her was a lie. Resoluting in us getting into a physical fight. My entire life both my parents have brought me to my lowest and everytime we argue i always bring up ""Why did you have me in the first place, you guys will love it if i wasnt in the world, and other life ending statements. They both have the same reactions by agreeing, therefore the depression and anxiety. I have support from close friends, my fiance, and seeing my daughter.

Like, actually do it","In 2025, people (especially the younger generations) are searching with their voice, not their keyboard. All modern search engines have a voice mode and most come with AI built in, which also features voice. Social platforms have their own voice features, too, so this isn't something you can ignore.

**In EVERY post:**

* Target long-tail, conversational keywords or question keywords like ""how,"" ""when,"" and ""why"" in your title
* Provide a single sentence (50 words or less)  that specifically answers or provides a solution for your chosen target keyword (You're going for the featured snippet on the SERPs)
* Answer more than one common question about your topic, directly and with a clear stance.
* Be specific when possible, general only when necessary
* Write shorter paragraphs, like 1-2 sentences for most paragraphs
* If you're doing a tutorial post, use numbered lists for your steps

**In general:**

* Prioritize site performance 
* Simplify your site's navigation to help crawlers find the right info on your site
* Use clear CTAs on your store, which will help with queries with purchase-intent
* Make your site mobile-first, or at least responsive for mobile layouts
* Clean up your local SEO so you show up for searches like ""coffee near me""
* Use Schema Markup (structured data), and if you can, customize it for each post
* Pay attention to your post's hierarchy to help search engines and readers: h1 tags (title only, h2 tags (sub-headings), etc.
* Use keyword-rich titles, headings, and links (without keyword stuffing)
* CARE ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY (alt text, clear anchor text for links, image captions, semantic HTML to help with page readers, etc.)

Go the extra mile:

* Create Alexa Skills and Google Actions and equivalents for other voice assistants, related to your business. (Watch: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+create+an+alexa+skill+for+my+business&ia=videos&iax=videos&iai=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlc9A\_6Uz\_t4)

* Conversion Rates (and attribution to voice search queries)
* Bounce Rates (which give you a clue how useful your content is to users)
* Keyword Rankings (These are important to show you where to focus in future posts and edit past posts

I worked at UPS loading trucks for a bit over a year but got a sedentary job in February, and consequently gained weight (and I was overeating while doing the other job). I am currently 216 pounds and would like to cut to 185 or so. I have fasted in the past, up to 6 days water (and black coffee/tea), so I am not totally knew to fasting.

I have been walking a few miles every morning, and adding in some sections of jogging. I am starting the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine tomorrow for strength training. I plan to continue walking every day, but only do walk/jog (and eventually progress to jogging) on the days that I don’t weight train.

I want to feed every 48 hours, after I have done my weight training for the elevated levels of HGH that fasting provides. My idea is I would walk and work out Monday morning, eat 1 meal that day for breakfast and then fast until after my workout Wednesday morning. Repeat for Friday and have Saturday as an option day to eat if I feel like I need it.

I have read that you can only absorb 50 grams of protein in a sitting for the purposes of building muscle, so I have concerns that I won’t get enough.

I was curious what y’all think about autophagy providing protein for me, if my workout/feeding window makes sense, and just any general advice people with more knowledge and experience have.

Not exactly a healthy way, but it suits me for now. My friend, in a veiled way has been shaming me for trying to lose weight, saying that I have a harmonious body and my weight loss method is unhealthy. Yeah, but I can deal with it and I have more than 10 kg to lose. She would ask how hard it was for me to stick to the diet quite often. Then continuing with “and I ate a bunch of McDonald's today”.

One day she came to see me at my part-time job in the café. She instantly said “Your face is so small"" to which I replied “Yeah, I lost a couple of kilos”.Word for word I decided to joke with her and said in a laughing manner “Mary, and you've actually gotten a lil bit fat in the cheeks, then I'll put one spoon of sugar instead of two"" to which we laughed. I closed the coffee shop and we went home. I’m supposed to have two free desserts. I asked if she wanted to take any. She took a swirl with raisins, to which I jokingly said that she did not deserve an almond croissant (since she did not help me close). We hugged and went home.

The next day I send her a screenshot of her image (before closing the coffee shop, we take a report to the owner, and she got into the picture). I (with humor and spelling errors) wrote: ""Finally, this snaky girflriend started to lose weight."" To that she accused me of passive aggression towards her, that I was aggressive towards myself on her behalf, and other psychological nonsense. To which I replied that ""sometimes a banana is just a banana"" and she was offended by my joke. She got angry and said that I was crossing her boundaries and that I can't do that to her. I advised her that she should protect her boundaries where it is really necessary, and not when her friend is joking. She started saying nonsense like “you’re just salty that others can protect themselves too”. She said that I’m just unhappy and angry on a diet and taking it out on her, to which I apologized if my joke seemed offensive to her. She then continued blaming me and I replied that she’s projecting. In fact, she constantly jokes sarcastically about people and she can also go over my boundaries and those of other friends, be rude and sarcastic and judgmental about people she doesn’t know. 
I get a lot of compliments and attention from people and when I acknowledge my beauty she would laugh what always feels so weird as if I’m a creep with overly high self-esteem which is obviously not true and all her compliments always feel fake and plastic. She asks me about my relationship and when I reply that everything is fine, she seems to get upset. This worried me and I simply stopped talking about it with her. By the way she’s divorced and heave a little kid. I’m trying to understand whether I really went too far with jokes and crossed her boundaries or whether she has gone crazy and jealous?

It really got me thinking about how much we're subtly influenced, even when we *think* we're making rational purchasing decisions. The article specifically pointed out the power of associating a product with aspirational beauty and lifestyle, even if the connection to the product itself is tenuous. For example, a famous actress endorsing a specific type of coffee maker, not because she's an expert, but because it fits her perceived image of elegance and success.

One thing that stood out was the discussion of perceived expertise vs. attractiveness.Sometimes, a genuinely knowledgeable expert is more persuasive, but in other scenarios, the aspirational draw of a ""glamour girl"" can be far more effective, especially for products targeting emotional needs like beauty or self-improvement. I'm curious, has anyone here ever consciously bought something specifically as of a ""glamour girl"" endorsement, even if it felt a little silly afterwards? Or conversely, has anyone ever been *turned off* a product by a celebrity endorsement that felt inauthentic?

First, it’s quiet but deadly. At a glance? Just a clean, no-nonsense dress watch.

It’s manual wind, which means it demands a little attention every day. No autopilot here. And yeah, I’m the same way.. I thrive on routine, on little rituals. Morning coffee just so, notebooks arranged just right and a borderline-unhealthy obsession with optimizing my Spotify playlists. The SBGW231 gets it. It’s not for the “set it and forget it” crowd. It’s for the people who notice things.

And let’s talk about that high-polish introvert energy. This isn’t a watch that needs to be seen. It doesn’t care if you recognize it. It’s not here for validation. But if you do know what you’re looking at? Oh, we’re gonna have a great conversation.

I wasn’t my best that day. Had cramps, which brought my mood and energy down. I let her know about it, and that I didn’t wanna cancel so last minute and wanted to meet her since our conversations were so in-depth over text. She felt similarly 

Well after the date the whole thing felt weird. I didn’t know where to place her. It felt like I hurt her feelings or something but I couldn’t tell how or why. I started bracing myself for the slow fade and ghost situation. I mean we were laughing and sharing stories I thought we were being friendly at least 


I haven’t heard from her in about 2 days now. She asked me what games I liked to play and I responded but she hasn’t replied. We’d usually take like 2-3 days to get back to each other but this time feels different 

I asked how she felt about me and the connection today and got this 

9 of wands 
The Devil 
Queen of cups 

So the 9 of wands aligns with what I felt. I feel like maybe I wasn’t as engaging as she expected or something but I really didn’t feel that well. I thought by letting her know she’d understand since we’re both women. I mean she said she wanted to see me again too after we met, so I was hoping I could have another chance to make a better impression when my uterus isn’t attacking me. Definitely I get a guarded energy from her. Hesitant, cautious 

The devil: Okay I’m not sure what this is about. Maybe her insecurities, I can imagine if I accidentally triggered something. The date felt platonic to me as well, and so did our text conversations. So it can’t be any kind of attraction/attachment and she said she was open to all connections…well it never actually came up so. Also I’m not obsessed or something either I promise

Queen of cups: Either she sees me this way, or she feels this way but after a 2 day long silence after meeting I’m not so sure. Then also if she sees me and the connection this way it doesn’t explain the silence. This one is a bit off to me ",4,1747940454.0,Tarotpractices,12,1.0,False

**First Day Encounter:**
On my first day at work, I was looking for my shuttle when I met this guy who was also looking for his. It was his first day at job too , tho not his first job (I had seen him during induction but we didn't talk or even look at each other). 

In those 5 minutes while we were both waiting, he asked me where to find the shuttle. I said it's my first day, he said same. We made small talk - he asked what role and what department I'm in, I asked the same. Nothing like I was attracted towards him at all.

When the driver came and told me to go to the other side to board the shuttle, I quickly said bye to him.

**The Mistake:**
As I was leaving, he said ""tell me your name."" I did, he told me his. Then he asked for my number. I was being dumb, in the rush I gave him my number.

**First Contact:**
He gave a call while I was running to board my shuttle. I didn't pickup because I was in my shuttle. He called me again and said ""hi its [his name]"". I said I will save your number and cut the call.

**The Persistent Texting:**
He texted me next day asking if I'm free and wanna grab lunch. I said I'm little busy. He asked again after one hour. I said I'm having lunch with my colleagues. Then he said ok.

Then yesterday he texted again. I said I'm having lunch with college friends who are in the same company.

**Yesterday's Incident:**
In the evening, he gave a call and asked for chai coffee. I didn't have any work, so I said okay. I thought maybe I judged him wrong.

Overall very bad vibes

I told him that my manager is calling me and left.

**My Dilemma:**
I'm someone who gets influenced easily, but I will never meet him again. The vibes were really bad. I don't wanna block him because if he asks about it in office, it will be very awkward. There could be a scene.

**What I need help with:**
How do you deal with creeps at workplace? I feel trapped because we work in the same office and I don't want to create drama, but his behavior is making me uncomfortable. Any advice on how to handle this professionally while keeping boundaries?

1ksyu19,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1ksyu19/the_signal_from_a_horrifying_dimension/,The Signal From A Horrifying Dimension,"I’m not going to go into too much detail. It’s time I share with you what’s about to happen, and I’m not sure how long I have until the entity discovers our spacecraft once again. But before I do, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alex Carter. I’m part of a top-secret space research facility that many of you aren’t aware of. Only a small handful of humans are aware of our existence, primarily those who are “shadow government” officials from around the world for lack of better terms. I just want to say, I’m truly sorry for what’s potentially going to happen. I can only hope this message makes it back to Earth. I can only pray that the entity doesn’t find our home planet.

To start, I was part of a 12-man crew of astronauts. I don’t know the names of the other eight crewmates, other than the other 3 personnel: Jonathan, Kyle, and Richard. I suppose that’s because I got to work with these 3 men most of the time, hardly interacting with the others, and we were the engineers for the spacecraft. I only knew the commander by his last name: Muller. The craft was essentially named ‘Heaven’s Path’ which was designed for space travel, and with a special purpose: Interdimensional Travel. The reason? This is to discover if Heaven truly exists or not. I believe it does, but I don’t think what we saw was really Heaven. Perhaps it’s because Heaven can never truly be reached, no matter what technology we develop to help us find it. Even our ‘Montauk Drive’ which was the nickname given to our drive system which allows us to travel into other dimensions, can’t reach it.

“Are you sure this baby doesn’t need any more further maintenance checkups?” I asked Kyle. “Negative. Plus, we’ve already done this over a hundred times, and everything’s worked properly.” he told me. “That’s great and all, but the last thing I want is a blow-out once we get into space. All that maintenance checkup, only for the spacecraft to betray our trust.” I spoke.

“It’ll be fine.” Richard told me. “Even Commander Muller gave us the green light that we’re ready for space travel. Even I’m thrilled.” he continued. “I don’t know, man. I get space travel, but Interdimensional Travel?” Jonathan said in a worried tone. Of course, I should’ve shared that same feeling of anxiety, but I guess my child-like curiosity for space travel, let alone travel into other dimensions, got the better of me. I wish I could’ve said ‘No’ and told our commander that the ship still needs maintenance. I wish I had told him that the spacecraft can’t travel in other dimensions. Even though it’s a lie, it would’ve saved us from the trouble we’re in now.

But before that happened, the rest of the crew and I were seated in Heaven’s Path, and we were preparing for launch time. Commander Muller spoke through the comms.

“Communications – check.”

“Auxiliary Systems – check.”

“Launch Thrusters – check.”

“Montauk Drive – check.”

“Life Support Systems – check.”

“Engines – good to go.”

“Everything else is in perfect working condition. No malfunctions are detected in the spacecraft’s systems. We’re ready to begin launch.”

I felt the ship vibrating, indicating that the ship’s propellors were ignited. After a few minutes, I heard the countdown begin.

*10.*

*9.*

*8.*

*7.*

*6.*

*5.*

*4.*

*3.*

*2.*

*1.*

*Launch.*

The launch felt unpleasant, but after a few moments, I was able to sit comfortably in my seat, and the spacecraft stopped vibrating shortly after. As time went by, I realized I was staring into space, seeing the stars and the blackness all around, and our white moon in the distance. We’ve left our home planet, preparing to travel to another dimension in hopes that we would find the realm of Heaven to find God.

I know that to some of you, this wouldn’t make sense. It also makes us sound like we’re just a bunch of zealots on a religious quest to prove to you that God is real. However, the real reason for doing this is because our transmission systems back on Earth, which were designed to pick up signals from both space and other dimensions, managed to pick up a signal that came from another dimension which exists outside of our physical universe.

Think of this as the ‘WOW’ signal, but on steroids. This signal also came with audio and visual transmissions. It showed the face of a human man with a big gray beard and long gray hair. “So what? Space Gandalf?” I jokingly said to myself when I first saw it. But all that changed when we got the audio transmission translated. It only had one word – God. There was even a second visual in it, showcasing a realm which held flying beings and tall, beautiful towers along with a golden-colored sky. “Angels?” I wondered.

Since then, we worked countless hours to try and figure out the source of the signal, suspecting the signal to come from Heaven itself, or perhaps someone in our home world was pranking us. After days of working and countless hours of research, decoding, and cups of coffee, we finally managed to pinpoint the source of the signal. To our surprise and relief, it wasn’t from earth. At that moment, we began to suspect it to come from the one called ‘God’ himself. Perhaps he was sending us that signal to let us know he exists.

Since then, it was decided that we should travel into that dimension and find out with our own two eyes whether he truly is real or not. All things considered, here we were, traveling to space and preparing to travel to that dimension to find out. Jonathan spoke up.

“Commander, the Montauk Drive is fully operational. All systems are working as expected.”

“Good. Power up the drive and let us prepare for launch.” Commander Muller then replied.

That’s when I could hear the drive powering up. Once it finished, the commander spoke up. “On my command.” was what he said before his next words sealed our fates.

“Activate the drive.”

Once the drive was activated, I felt the spacecraft suddenly being pulled in as a vortex made of colorful light formed in front of us. Once we were in, I could see colors, whirls and patterns I’ve never seen before, flowing all around us. I was amazed and mesmerized by the colors and whirls and all their beauty, along with the bizarre patterns and symbol-like bodies that appeared alive. Honestly, I would rather be stuck in there than where we ended up. After several long moments, it was over, and we were through.

Despite this, I still felt the mesmerizing sensations until a few moments later when my sense of awareness came back to our current situation. I could hear shouting and panicking coming from the rest of the crew, especially Jonathan and Richard. The commander was looking on in shock and horror. When I looked out the cockpit window of our spacecraft, I understood why.

“We’re at the source location of the signal, but this doesn’t seem right! Our systems indicate the exact location, what the fuck!?” Kyle screamed. What I had hoped to see was a realm filled with angels flying around those beautiful towers in that golden sky, I instead saw nothingness. Just a pure, empty void.

“Calm down! Are you sure we’re in the correct location!?” the commander asked him. Having calmed down, Kyle regained his composure and spoke up.

“I’m positive, sir. Our scanners also show the same result. Everything is working fine. There are no malfunctions detected with the Montauk Drive.” he explained.

A chill ran through my spine. I began to think the signal that was sent must’ve been eons old. It’s as if the signal had finally been picked up but was meant as a distress signal from God before all else went dark, and no one responded until now, only to be too late.

“I don’t like this place. Let’s leave before I--”

The commander was cut off when he noticed something coming closer to our spacecraft.

“What the hell is that?” he asked. I looked towards the cockpit window. While it’s faint to the naked eye, it was picked up by our scanners. Although, our commander could see it. Once this anomaly got close enough, I could see what appeared to be a massive, crimson red eye. It was surrounded by what appeared to be appendages as if it was an octopus. It looked robotic-like. The fact that this thing was still billions of miles away, yet appearing so close, means that the entity was massive, perhaps 100x bigger than our sun.

“What the hell is that? Is that God? It can’t be. This looks nothing like the man in the image.” Jonathan said, and I concurred. This thing seemed to be something out of a nightmare. Then, it suddenly emitted a bright red glow. What followed next seemed to look like a “forcefield” that came out of the eye, and it was moving from right to left, as if it was scanning us. After having finished its business, something occurred.

*SPEAK.*

I realized that this entity was now communicating with us. It spoke to us in English, but didn’t speak through a mouth. We could hear him in our words with a low-pitched, masculine voice. Then it dawned on me; this thing was speaking telepathically, and we could hear it speak loud and clear. Emphasis on ‘we’ because once I saw Richard, his hand was on his forehead before that guy started asking. “Did he just tell us to speak?” he said. Then, the commander spoke.

“This is Commander Muller of the ‘Heaven’s Path’ starship you see before you. We arrived at this location because we received a signal that came with an audio and visual transmission. But it’s clear that there must have been clerical error in discovering the audio and visual that doesn’t match this one.”

*WHAT MANNER OF AUDIO AND VISUAL DO YOU SPEAK OF?*

The entity spoke again, asking us a question. Commander Muller then looked towards me.

“See if you can transmit the audio and visual to this entity.” he asked.

*NO NEED FOR THAT. I CAN PEER THROUGH YOUR MEMORIES. YOU COME FROM ANOTHER REALM, A PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, AND I KNOW OF THE ENTITY YOU’RE SEEKING. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT I MUST INFORM YOU THAT HE IS DEAD NOW. I HAD DESTROYED HIM AND HIS REALM. WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS ALL THAT REMAINS.*

Another chill ran through my spine.

“Dead!? What do you mean, he’s dead!? How!?” Commander Muller then spoke up.

*I AM MORE ANCIENT AND MORE POWERFUL THAN HE. I AM PRIMORDIAL. I AM ONE OF THE FIRST BEINGS IN ALL OF EXISTENCE. I AM THE HARBINGER OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND YOU HUMANS ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR EXTINCTION. YOU’RE PRIMITIVE, TRIBALISTIC, VIOLENT, AND YOU DO NOT DESERVE REDEMPTION. YOU DESTROY ONE ANOTHER. NOW, I WILL DESTROY YOU.*

At that moment, we were terrified. Commander Muller ordered Jonathan to activate the drive again, so we can escape. However, the entity had other plans.

*I WON’T LET YOU ESCAPE. YOUR SPECIES WILL GO EXTINCT, AND YOU’LL BE THE FIRST TO FEEL MY WRATH.*

Following those threatening words were dark figures forming in our spacecraft. These figures targeted the commander as well as the pilots. One of the figures charged after me, but luckily, Kyle managed to throw his toolkit at it, causing it to dissipate shortly. The figure re-appeared shortly after, indicating that we can’t kill them.

The commander was lifted up in the air, before the figures tore his body in all directions. Blood splattered all over the floor, just before the figures turned their attention towards Jonathan who was visibly powering up the drive and preparing it for activation. Sadly, they got to him before he could hit the switch to activate it. They tore his body apart like they did to Muller. The other crewmates were just as unlucky.

Luck was on my side when none of the figures targeted me. I ran straight to the drive and got it activated just before three of those dark figures grabbed a hold of me and lifted me up in the air, preparing to tear me to pieces. A vortex then manifested, and we went through. I thought I was about to be torn to bits, until the figures suddenly disappeared. I landed hard onto the floor. I’ve been hit with a sudden feeling of relief to finally escape that hellish place.

Shortly after regaining my composure and recovering from the injuries from the fall, I stood up and walked around before slipping on blood and falling again. I managed to pick myself up and sit on a chair to rest. I was relieved to see a few members of the spacecraft still alive after what happened, including Kyle and Richard.

Now? Only 4 of us remain on the ship; Kyle, Richard, myself, and the guy who’s name I won’t get to find out since he’d rather isolate himself. I can’t blame him after what we went through. He seemed to be going mad from what I could tell. I was relieved to see we were back into our physical universe, albeit not anywhere near our home planet. In fact, we’re far from our home galaxy.

Unfortunately, our trouble didn’t end there. We had received a telepathic message from what I presumed to be the same entity. He said the following:

*YOU MAY HAVE ESCAPED, BUT I WILL FIND YOU AND DESTROY YOU. AFTER THAT, YOUR HOME PLANET WILL BE NEXT.*

This left a final chill through my spine, and thanks to that message, we continued flying off. To make things worse, it managed to pinpoint our location. That’s why we’re now flying off, with high hopes that we don’t lead him to our home planet or discover it as the entity keeps track of our position. I’m writing this as a warning. I pray to God that it isn’t heading to our home planet, let alone knowing where it is. I pray to God in hopes that it chases us until we die, and our power and food supply will last for a few more years, so we’ll keep the chase going until these run out. I pray to God because I believe he’s still alive.

However, I fear that even though we’re finally caught and destroyed it, it’s only a matter of time until it reaches our home planet and destroys us all.",1,1747940324.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,0.99,False

The first picture shows a woman who does not resemble our women, wearing clothes similar to those worn by our women, but without the cross, and underneath her is Something like what we use when we sit for coffee But it is what the Sudanese use in northern and eastern Sudan and secondly the men who sit on the ground with her, why did they not bring Christian men to sit with them, or is this a charade that is merely Egyptian-Arab propaganda to put forward the idea that these are the men and these are the women, trying to erase us from existence with their false agendas, these Ottoman fraudsters 

We have recently seen that they are trying to distort the facts and they are also trying to attribute our history and culture to those who want to be Arabs. If you enter any Eritrean restaurant, you will see that they do not display our culture, but rather attribute our culture and food that we invented through our religion to them.

In the second picture you can see the Egyptian woman laughing in their midst, knowing about their project to Arabize our country and send a false image to the world. but believe me, it is impossible if you think that you can do anything to us anymore and you will see a fire bigger than the fire that ignited in Port Sudan.

1ksypkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1ksypkb/huge_improvements/,Huge improvements,"Hello,

I’ve been on my histamine intolerance journey for about three years now, and I’m happy to say I’ve made significant progress. I’ve been able to reintroduce most foods into my diet, with the exception of leftovers and most fermented items (but I can eat moderate amount pepperoni & salami)

Apologies if a post like this has already been shared, but I wanted to contribute what has helped me personally in hopes that it might help someone else.

Here are some of the things that made a big difference for me:

	•	A good gut probiotic: After about six months of consistent use, I noticed a major improvement in how I tolerated foods and in my digestion overall.

	•	A good stomach probiotic: This was a game changer for me. I used to be completely unable to eat avocados, tomatoes, strawberries, bananas, and pineapples. Now I can enjoy them in moderation without any major reactions.

	•	Daily antihistamine: I take 180 mg of Fexofenadine daily, which has helped reduce overall symptoms. Also environmental allergies caused by HI. 

	•	Daily supplements: Magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, D3 with fish oil or alternatives like nuts and hydration powders have all boosted my energy and supported overall wellness (liquid IV).

	•	Hydration: Drinking plenty of water every day has also played a crucial role in keeping symptoms at bay.

	•	D-Lactate free probiotic with probiotic fiber: I took this for about a month and saw noticeable improvements. I would recommend taking it longer than I did. I had to pause due to unrelated health issues but plan to start it again.

Thanks to staying consistent with these habits, I can now drink coffee and enjoy most foods without stressing about reactions like itchiness, hives, flares, twitching, or other symptoms.

Also make sure for the probiotics and hydrations powders will support the histamine intolerance diet. I know there multiple of Probiotics that have ingredients we should not take for an HI person so I suggest doing research. 

Hope this helps someone out there!",15,1747940019.0,HistamineIntolerance,3,1.0,False

Tossed and turned all night long. I got maybe 30 minutes of sleep. Finally got up at 8am with my husband, and I decided to make us breakfast - scrambled eggs and sausage. I added some cheese and bacon on the eggs, then grabbed a lid for the pan, so the cheese could melt while I made my coffee. At this time, I grabbed the bacon bits to put in the fridge and realized I didn't see the cheese. Not in the fridge. Not on the counter. Had to retrace my steps. Found it in the cabinet with my pots and pans. Apparently, I threw it in there when I grabbed a lid. So I ate, drank part of my coffee, and went back to bed for a nap.

  
Got up a bit later, and though I know better, I decided to grab some Q-tips for my OMG ITCHY ears. Upon pulling one out, I saw it didn't have any cotton on the end. I panicked and ran to my husband to look in my ear. ""I think I see something."" We went back to the bathroom, us both shining the light from our phones into my ear, while he holds some tweezers. He couldn't get a good look and said he didn't feel comfortable doing this. So I made a trip up to Urgent Care. The NP comes into the room, checks my ear. NO COTTON. The absolute cackle I loudly cackled. My guess is that there wasn't any cotton on the end to begin with and I didn't notice.

I thought it was a prank but turns out it was from this guy who is a childhood friend of the owner and he had done this (the creep also tried hitting on my sister since the past 1 month) 
I’ve never initiated a conversation with him except for that one time where I was filling out my form and he kept on asking me about my qualifications and and I made it clear that I was not interested in the convo. So that was the only time. And this guy gives me the big creep vibes. Like you can just feel it. And to top that off he stinks a lot like I feel he doesn’t take a bath because he’s got this horrible horrible Body odour( I’m not body shaming him as I’ve also had this issue in the past and i use deo to conceal it) 
And it’s not even like he’s poor he comes in this Scorpio car. So we’ve complained this creep guy to the owner (who technically is his childhood friend) and he kept on asking for forgiveness for him which I’m totally not buying.

We’re here to build an empire, not wipe a loser’s ass. The refs fucked us in Games 2 and 7—OKC didn’t win, they stole it. Jokić’s a goldmine, but this roster’s a landfill. Fix it—champs by ‘27.

1ksyoi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ready_Welder2877/comments/1ksyoi1/the_signal_from_a_horrifying_dimension/,The Signal From A Horrifying Dimension,"I’m not going to go into too much detail. It’s time I share with you what’s about to happen, and I’m not sure how long I have until the entity discovers our spacecraft once again. But before I do, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alex Carter. I’m part of a top-secret space research facility that many of you aren’t aware of. Only a small handful of humans are aware of our existence, primarily those who are “shadow government” officials from around the world for lack of better terms. I just want to say, I’m truly sorry for what’s potentially going to happen. I can only hope this message makes it back to Earth. I can only pray that the entity doesn’t find our home planet.

To start, I was part of a 12-man crew of astronauts. I don’t know the names of the other eight crewmates, other than the other 3 personnel: Jonathan, Kyle, and Richard. I suppose that’s because I got to work with these 3 men most of the time, hardly interacting with the others, and we were the engineers for the spacecraft. I only knew the commander by his last name: Muller. The craft was essentially named ‘Heaven’s Path’ which was designed for space travel, and with a special purpose: Interdimensional Travel. The reason? This is to discover if Heaven truly exists or not. I believe it does, but I don’t think what we saw was really Heaven. Perhaps it’s because Heaven can never truly be reached, no matter what technology we develop to help us find it. Even our ‘Montauk Drive’ which was the nickname given to our drive system which allows us to travel into other dimensions, can’t reach it.

“Are you sure this baby doesn’t need any more further maintenance checkups?” I asked Kyle. “Negative. Plus, we’ve already done this over a hundred times, and everything’s worked properly.” he told me. “That’s great and all, but the last thing I want is a blow-out once we get into space. All that maintenance checkup, only for the spacecraft to betray our trust.” I spoke.

“It’ll be fine.” Richard told me. “Even Commander Muller gave us the green light that we’re ready for space travel. Even I’m thrilled.” he continued. “I don’t know, man. I get space travel, but Interdimensional Travel?” Jonathan said in a worried tone. Of course, I should’ve shared that same feeling of anxiety, but I guess my child-like curiosity for space travel, let alone travel into other dimensions, got the better of me. I wish I could’ve said ‘No’ and told our commander that the ship still needs maintenance. I wish I had told him that the spacecraft can’t travel in other dimensions. Even though it’s a lie, it would’ve saved us from the trouble we’re in now.

But before that happened, the rest of the crew and I were seated in Heaven’s Path, and we were preparing for launch time. Commander Muller spoke through the comms.

“Communications – check.”

“Auxiliary Systems – check.”

“Launch Thrusters – check.”

“Montauk Drive – check.”

“Life Support Systems – check.”

“Engines – good to go.”

“Everything else is in perfect working condition. No malfunctions are detected in the spacecraft’s systems. We’re ready to begin launch.”

I felt the ship vibrating, indicating that the ship’s propellors were ignited. After a few minutes, I heard the countdown begin.

*10.*

*9.*

*8.*

*7.*

*6.*

*5.*

*4.*

*3.*

*2.*

*1.*

*Launch.*

The launch felt unpleasant, but after a few moments, I was able to sit comfortably in my seat, and the spacecraft stopped vibrating shortly after. As time went by, I realized I was staring into space, seeing the stars and the blackness all around, and our white moon in the distance. We’ve left our home planet, preparing to travel to another dimension in hopes that we would find the realm of Heaven to find God.

I know that to some of you, this wouldn’t make sense. It also makes us sound like we’re just a bunch of zealots on a religious quest to prove to you that God is real. However, the real reason for doing this is because our transmission systems back on Earth, which were designed to pick up signals from both space and other dimensions, managed to pick up a signal that came from another dimension which exists outside of our physical universe.

Think of this as the ‘WOW’ signal, but on steroids. This signal also came with audio and visual transmissions. It showed the face of a human man with a big gray beard and long gray hair. “So what? Space Gandalf?” I jokingly said to myself when I first saw it. But all that changed when we got the audio transmission translated. It only had one word – God. There was even a second visual in it, showcasing a realm which held flying beings and tall, beautiful towers along with a golden-colored sky. “Angels?” I wondered.

Since then, we worked countless hours to try and figure out the source of the signal, suspecting the signal to come from Heaven itself, or perhaps someone in our home world was pranking us. After days of working and countless hours of research, decoding, and cups of coffee, we finally managed to pinpoint the source of the signal. To our surprise and relief, it wasn’t from earth. At that moment, we began to suspect it to come from the one called ‘God’ himself. Perhaps he was sending us that signal to let us know he exists.

Since then, it was decided that we should travel into that dimension and find out with our own two eyes whether he truly is real or not. All things considered, here we were, traveling to space and preparing to travel to that dimension to find out. Jonathan spoke up.

“Commander, the Montauk Drive is fully operational. All systems are working as expected.”

“Good. Power up the drive and let us prepare for launch.” Commander Muller then replied.

That’s when I could hear the drive powering up. Once it finished, the commander spoke up. “On my command.” was what he said before his next words sealed our fates.

“Activate the drive.”

Once the drive was activated, I felt the spacecraft suddenly being pulled in as a vortex made of colorful light formed in front of us. Once we were in, I could see colors, whirls and patterns I’ve never seen before, flowing all around us. I was amazed and mesmerized by the colors and whirls and all their beauty, along with the bizarre patterns and symbol-like bodies that appeared alive. Honestly, I would rather be stuck in there than where we ended up. After several long moments, it was over, and we were through.

Despite this, I still felt the mesmerizing sensations until a few moments later when my sense of awareness came back to our current situation. I could hear shouting and panicking coming from the rest of the crew, especially Jonathan and Richard. The commander was looking on in shock and horror. When I looked out the cockpit window of our spacecraft, I understood why.

“We’re at the source location of the signal, but this doesn’t seem right! Our systems indicate the exact location, what the fuck!?” Kyle screamed. What I had hoped to see was a realm filled with angels flying around those beautiful towers in that golden sky, I instead saw nothingness. Just a pure, empty void.

“Calm down! Are you sure we’re in the correct location!?” the commander asked him. Having calmed down, Kyle regained his composure and spoke up.

“I’m positive, sir. Our scanners also show the same result. Everything is working fine. There are no malfunctions detected with the Montauk Drive.” he explained.

A chill ran through my spine. I began to think the signal that was sent must’ve been eons old. It’s as if the signal had finally been picked up but was meant as a distress signal from God before all else went dark, and no one responded until now, only to be too late.

“I don’t like this place. Let’s leave before I--”

The commander was cut off when he noticed something coming closer to our spacecraft.

“What the hell is that?” he asked. I looked towards the cockpit window. While it’s faint to the naked eye, it was picked up by our scanners. Although, our commander could see it. Once this anomaly got close enough, I could see what appeared to be a massive, crimson red eye. It was surrounded by what appeared to be appendages as if it was an octopus. It looked robotic-like. The fact that this thing was still billions of miles away, yet appearing so close, means that the entity was massive, perhaps 100x bigger than our sun.

“What the hell is that? Is that God? It can’t be. This looks nothing like the man in the image.” Jonathan said, and I concurred. This thing seemed to be something out of a nightmare. Then, it suddenly emitted a bright red glow. What followed next seemed to look like a “forcefield” that came out of the eye, and it was moving from right to left, as if it was scanning us. After having finished its business, something occurred.

*SPEAK.*

I realized that this entity was now communicating with us. It spoke to us in English, but didn’t speak through a mouth. We could hear him in our words with a low-pitched, masculine voice. Then it dawned on me; this thing was speaking telepathically, and we could hear it speak loud and clear. Emphasis on ‘we’ because once I saw Richard, his hand was on his forehead before that guy started asking. “Did he just tell us to speak?” he said. Then, the commander spoke.

“This is Commander Muller of the ‘Heaven’s Path’ starship you see before you. We arrived at this location because we received a signal that came with an audio and visual transmission. But it’s clear that there must have been clerical error in discovering the audio and visual that doesn’t match this one.”

*WHAT MANNER OF AUDIO AND VISUAL DO YOU SPEAK OF?*

The entity spoke again, asking us a question. Commander Muller then looked towards me.

“See if you can transmit the audio and visual to this entity.” he asked.

*NO NEED FOR THAT. I CAN PEER THROUGH YOUR MEMORIES. YOU COME FROM ANOTHER REALM, A PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, AND I KNOW OF THE ENTITY YOU’RE SEEKING. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT I MUST INFORM YOU THAT HE IS DEAD NOW. I HAD DESTROYED HIM AND HIS REALM. WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS ALL THAT REMAINS.*

Another chill ran through my spine.

“Dead!? What do you mean, he’s dead!? How!?” Commander Muller then spoke up.

*I AM MORE ANCIENT AND MORE POWERFUL THAN HE. I AM PRIMORDIAL. I AM ONE OF THE FIRST BEINGS IN ALL OF EXISTENCE. I AM THE HARBINGER OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, AND YOU HUMANS ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR EXTINCTION. YOU’RE PRIMITIVE, TRIBALISTIC, VIOLENT, AND YOU DO NOT DESERVE REDEMPTION. YOU DESTROY ONE ANOTHER. NOW, I WILL DESTROY YOU.*

At that moment, we were terrified. Commander Muller ordered Jonathan to activate the drive again, so we can escape. However, the entity had other plans.

*I WON’T LET YOU ESCAPE. YOUR SPECIES WILL GO EXTINCT, AND YOU’LL BE THE FIRST TO FEEL MY WRATH.*

Following those threatening words were dark figures forming in our spacecraft. These figures targeted the commander as well as the pilots. One of the figures charged after me, but luckily, Kyle managed to throw his toolkit at it, causing it to dissipate shortly. The figure re-appeared shortly after, indicating that we can’t kill them.

The commander was lifted up in the air, before the figures tore his body in all directions. Blood splattered all over the floor, just before the figures turned their attention towards Jonathan who was visibly powering up the drive and preparing it for activation. Sadly, they got to him before he could hit the switch to activate it. They tore his body apart like they did to Muller. The other crewmates were just as unlucky.

Luck was on my side when none of the figures targeted me. I ran straight to the drive and got it activated just before three of those dark figures grabbed a hold of me and lifted me up in the air, preparing to tear me to pieces. A vortex then manifested, and we went through. I thought I was about to be torn to bits, until the figures suddenly disappeared. I landed hard onto the floor. I’ve been hit with a sudden feeling of relief to finally escape that hellish place.

Shortly after regaining my composure and recovering from the injuries from the fall, I stood up and walked around before slipping on blood and falling again. I managed to pick myself up and sit on a chair to rest. I was relieved to see a few members of the spacecraft still alive after what happened, including Kyle and Richard.

Now? Only 4 of us remain on the ship; Kyle, Richard, myself, and the guy who’s name I won’t get to find out since he’d rather isolate himself. I can’t blame him after what we went through. He seemed to be going mad from what I could tell. I was relieved to see we were back into our physical universe, albeit not anywhere near our home planet. In fact, we’re far from our home galaxy.

Unfortunately, our trouble didn’t end there. We had received a telepathic message from what I presumed to be the same entity. He said the following:

*YOU MAY HAVE ESCAPED, BUT I WILL FIND YOU AND DESTROY YOU. AFTER THAT, YOUR HOME PLANET WILL BE NEXT.*

This left a final chill through my spine, and thanks to that message, we continued flying off. To make things worse, it managed to pinpoint our location. That’s why we’re now flying off, with high hopes that we don’t lead him to our home planet or discover it as the entity keeps track of our position. I’m writing this as a warning. I pray to God that it isn’t heading to our home planet, let alone knowing where it is. I pray to God in hopes that it chases us until we die, and our power and food supply will last for a few more years, so we’ll keep the chase going until these run out. I pray to God because I believe he’s still alive.

However, I fear that even though we’re finally caught and destroyed it, it’s only a matter of time until it reaches our home planet and destroys us all.",1,1747939949.0,u_Ready_Welder2877,0,0.99,False

This is not my first heartbreak but its the most unusual one and the longest relationship I had. So any of you that have already gone down this road especially with relationships as long as this would be extremely helpful!

So Me \[25M\] and my currently ex-gf \[25F\] have been together for 5+ years. Our relationship has been the most perfect, the most compatible relationship I've ever experienced and compared out there. She was a kind, caring, a bit lazy, not the club person, but very friendly person.

We've been trough our early to mid 20s both of us together. We've been trough long distance (4 months) without a single fight or issue few years ago. We hadn't had any issues with jealousy or stuff like that. We've visited half of Europe together, been on dozen of weekend gateways, trips hiking you name it. We both cooked, binged tv-shows, laughed, loved each other to the max. We had our meow-meows and kisses on the neck until to the very last day. Pushed each others trough rough times, job interviews you name it we did it without any issue. We didn't live together but whenever we would go abroad we split chores without any issues.

In this **5+ years** we had about **10-15** fights 1/3rd from which occurred last year, not huge ones small fights like every relationship has. **All** of these fights were resolved with a **calmly** debatable manner no shouting no screaming nothing. We just sat and discussed them. We didn't hold grudges, no egos when we fought: sometimes once calls first sometimes the other, but we've **never** hold a grudge for more than **1 day.**  
I would say most of this fights or discussion however you call them were initiated by me: most specifically since it was a personality issues that I would mention 1 time and it won't be changed or adapted. After 3 times I would still bring this up and a discussion/fight would come up.

For example:  
I would mention that I have a higher libido and would require more sex than her, and this would go on for 1+ years without changing and I would bring it up again and a fight/discussion in a calmly manner would occur. At the even though I asked for more sex it ended with me accepting less sex.  
or  
I would mention that I would love to be tagged on her Instagram story, she would go on few months post another story of 2 coffee cups on vacation and I would again bring it up.

**BUT** whenever we sat and discussed she would start crying and shaking **EVEN** though we calmly discussed all this without any shouting. I asked if this was her trauma from her family or something she said no.

From the start of our relationship she knew that I would most likely sometime in my life go and study for 2 years abroad, with of course coming back every few months. Whenever we discussed this she told me she is fine and that we go trough it as the first long distance when she was abroad.

Fast forward to this January we had some non-important fight, after which she said and asked me how do I see her in the future to which I replied as a future wife/mother of my children.  
To this **SHE REPLIES** ""I don't think I have the same feeling for the future as you""  
I asked her why:  She said because we had some fights in the past year  
I asked her if she wants to break up she says **NO**, I want to try and solve this and told me to change some personality traits which irritated her. She started asking me why I don't live alone if I have an empty flat to which I replied I am saving for my studies abroad and asked her **if she wants to live together** to which she replied ""**No,** **but we can sleep there more often""** which we already did.

After this I said ok I will do everything on my side to keep this relationship. Those personality traits that she wanted changed: done, no fights at all: done. Love: even more than before.

**The end:**

2 Weeks ago we had some stupid discussion not a fight and I brought up the same thing she brought up in January. She started crying and said she couldn't give me an answer now needs more time. I told her that 4-5 months are enough time for a person to know if they see him in the future, we were not talking about getting married now. To this in crying she replied: ""**Due to the fights we had the past year and even though this 5 months is as perfect as the first 3.5-4 years I think me feelings will never be the same as before the last year"".** I said ok what if we continue perfectly like this for a 1-2 years will you have an answer and she replied in crying I don't think I will still see you in the future. I was broken as hell after this and I said that I feel like a plan B to her and that there is no point in being together if you don't see me in the future after 5 years

I am grieving a lot, I didn't have a stone fall of my shoulders because there were so little negative things about the relationship. We were so mature and caring for our ages. I am trying to understand the main reason behind all this. Was it because I was her first or that I am going to study for 2 years to both which she replied no.

I've eventually given up on trying to find the logic now I am experiencing the grieving and begging phase to try and call her to beg her to try and solve her insecurities or anything just so that we can be together, but the only way for me is to beg and she made it clear that even after 1-2 years more of a perfect relationship, her feelings will never be the same as before.

I would appreciate any help on how to overcome this, especially a person which I saw as a mother to my children, any tips or comforting comments would be honestly of a huge help. Especially what messes with my head is that she was NOT cold a single day from January till today",1,1747939773.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Luckily, my finances have always been in a good place, so this just slows me down more than anything.

The bigger and more serious issue is that I discovered I can't deal with shared walls. I lived in single-family homes my whole life up to this point in a small, LCOL Alabama town. I figured that I'd always been able to tolerate hotel noise perfectly well, so how bad could a condo complex be? My upstairs neighbor stomps with his heel everywhere he goes (which rattles things in my unit) and enjoys playing loud, EDM-style music at random points throughout the day and on Saturdays from 4 PM to midnight. The bass thuds through my walls and is constant at these moments. This is usually accompanied by a wafting smell of cannabis coming down the hallways and into my unit.

It might be different if we both didn't work from home. He goes into the office 1-2 days a week and I try to get as much done on those days as I possibly can because it's incredibly hard to focus with the noise level. He is basically always home at any other given time, as well. There's never a long enough break from him. He won't even answer the door when I knock to try and address the situation, even after leaving a very friendly note that offered to buy him coffee as a thanks for trying to watch his noise level. The one time I managed to catch him in the parking lot he was extremely defensive about his music and said flat-out that he was, ""Going to play my music.""

I guess I just need some help figuring out what the move is. I generally like the area I'm in and the complex feels safe and quiet otherwise. Even with that said, if I thought I could get out of here without incurring a loss, I'd probably do that just to save my mental state. Unfortunately, with the HOA's finances in such poor shape, I don't foresee property values increasing here much in the next two years. There's a rental list I could get on, but only 20 percent of the properties are allowed to be rented out at any given time, so no idea how long it would take.

I would mention that I would love to be tagged on her Instagram story, she would go on few months post another story of 2 coffee cups on vacation and I would again bring it up.

**BUT** whenever we sat and discussed she would start crying and shaking **EVEN** though we calmly discussed all this without any shouting. I asked if this was her trauma from her family or something she said no.

From the start of our relationship she knew that I would most likely sometime in my life go and study for 2 years abroad, with of course coming back every few months. Whenever we discussed this she told me she is fine and that we go trough it as the first long distance when she was abroad.

Fast forward to this January we had some non-important fight, after which she said and asked me how do I see her in the future to which I replied as a future wife/mother of my children.  
To this **SHE REPLIES** ""I don't think I have the same feeling for the future as you""  
I asked her why:  She said because we had some fights in the past year  
I asked her if she wants to break up she says **NO**, I want to try and solve this and told me to change some personality traits which irritated her. She started asking me why I don't live alone if I have an empty flat to which I replied I am saving for my studies abroad and asked her **if she wants to live together** to which she replied ""**No,** **but we can sleep there more often""** which we already did.

After this I said ok I will do everything on my side to keep this relationship. Those personality traits that she wanted changed: done, no fights at all: done. Love: even more than before.

**The end:**

2 Weeks ago we had some stupid discussion not a fight and I brought up the same thing she brought up in January. She started crying and said she couldn't give me an answer now needs more time. I told her that 4-5 months are enough time for a person to know if they see him in the future, we were not talking about getting married now. To this in crying she replied: ""**Due to the fights we had the past year and even though this 5 months is as perfect as the first 3.5-4 years I think me feelings will never be the same as before the last year"".** I said ok what if we continue perfectly like this for a 1-2 years will you have an answer and she replied in crying I don't think I will still see you in the future. I was broken as hell after this and I said that I feel like a plan B to her and that there is no point in being together if you don't see me in the future after 5 years

I am grieving a lot, I didn't have a stone fall of my shoulders because there were so little negative things about the relationship. We were so mature and caring for our ages. I am trying to understand the main reason behind all this. Was it because I was her first or that I am going to study for 2 years to both which she replied no.

I've eventually given up on trying to find the logic now I am experiencing the grieving and begging phase to try and call her to beg her to try and solve her insecurities or anything just so that we can be together, but the only way for me is to beg and she made it clear that even after 1-2 years more of a perfect relationship, her feelings will never be the same as before.

I would appreciate any help on how to overcome this, especially a person which I saw as a mother to my children, any tips or comforting comments would be honestly of a huge help. Especially what messes with my head is that she was NOT cold a single day from January till today",1,1747939670.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’ve always respected her privacy and never dug for details she didn’t want to share. But after a full year of daily ""friendship"", this happened:

When I casually asked, “By the way, what’s your boyfriend’s name?” she replied, “I’m not telling you. Honestly, I don’t even care what your girlfriend’s name is.” That stung. I told her it hurt that she had zero interest in a basic detail of my life and wouldn’t share the same about hers. She said I was making a “big deal” out of nothing, cracked jokes to lighten the mood, and insisted friendship means accepting people “as they are” without keeping a mental checklist.

To me, it feels like:

downplaying my feelings as “overreacting,”

reframing the issue so I seem unreasonable,

joking to dodge a serious talk, and

implying I’m at fault for bringing it up at all.


Am I overreacting to expect a friend to at least know (and share) our partners’ names? Or is it normal for some friends to ignore that kind of detail?

Tooth sensitivity isn’t just annoying. It’s a whole lifestyle. You start eyeing cold drinks like they’re enemies and chewing carefully like your molars might file a complaint.

Many people gravitate towards trying **oral health supplements** in hopes of getting relief. Some aim to fix early damage, others just want to stop that cold jolt mid-chew.

Two names pop up often: [PowerBite](https://theworldhealth.org/powerbite-official) and [ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official). One focuses on **minerals that help restore enamel**, the other is more an **oral probiotic for gum and tooth health**.

If you're wondering which actually works for **restoring tooth enamel naturally**, we tested them both and compiled everything you need to know. Let’s ""chow"" down ...

# 🧾 Comparison Overview

**Category**: Oral Health Supplements → Mineral Dental Support

* 🟩 **PowerBite: ★★★★☆ (4/5)** Strong formulation for enamel repair using calcium carbonate and other natural minerals.
* 🟨 **ProDentim: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)** Primarily a probiotic aimed at microbiome balance, not enamel rebuilding.

# 🧪 Detailed Product Analysis

# 🟩 PowerBite

[PowerBite](https://theworldhealth.org/powerbite-official) is a chewable mineral-based supplement meant for bedtime use. It aims **to remineralize your teeth naturally** with ingredients like **calcium carbonate**.

It's great for people wanting **natural ways to strengthen enamel** without chemical-laden options. The mild mint flavor is subtle but leaves your breath fresher.

PowerBite is designed to **seal microscopic holes in teeth naturally**, helping defend against new decay. You don’t need a dental degree to appreciate that perk.

With **supplements that help remineralize teeth**, consistency is key. After about two weeks, the surface of your teeth should start feeling smoother—less gritty.

It works well for **preventing cavities from worsening naturally**, especially if you’re brushing regularly and not chasing each meal with soda.

While it's not marketed as a miracle, its blend offers a **holistic solution for better dental care**—focused more on mineral support than fancy tech.

# 🟨 ProDentim

[ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) uses probiotics to support oral bacteria balance. It includes strains like **Lactobacillus reuteri** and **Bifidobacterium lactis**, known **probiotics for dental and gum health**.

It’s helpful for people struggling with plaque or frequent gum soreness, but it won’t do much for **healing cavities without dental procedures**.

It lacks **minerals that support strong, healthy teeth**, which makes it weaker if your main concern is enamel repair or **natural enamel restoration**.

People report fresher breath and less gum swelling. It's convenient, but if you’re searching **how to strengthen enamel through minerals**, it won't deliver that.

There are **essential vitamins for stronger teeth** in the formula, but their focus is secondary to the probiotic blend.

For people wanting **chewables that support oral care** without worrying about enamel, ProDentim may still be a gentle daily option.

# 🧑‍🎨 Personal Experience (Told by Dani, My Freelance Photographer Friend)

My friend Dani — a freelance photographer who spends long days out on shoots without easy access to a toothbrush — was the perfect person to test these supplements.

She’s constantly sipping coffee to stay alert on early-morning gigs, and she'd been complaining for months about her teeth feeling rough and overly sensitive.

So I passed her a bottle of each and asked her to try them over the next few weeks. Here’s what she told me.

“I started with PowerBite because I was hoping it might help with the dull, sandpapery feeling on my lower front teeth.

Honestly? After about ten days, I noticed they felt smoother — like freshly polished tile instead of worn concrete. I wasn't expecting that.

Cold drinks didn’t sting anymore either, which was a relief considering I usually live on iced coffee during edits.

Then I switched to ProDentim. It wasn’t bad — my breath felt fresher, especially in the mornings — and the bloating I sometimes get from other supplements didn’t show up here.

But it didn’t touch the enamel sensitivity the way PowerBite did. Also, ProDentim has this chalky finish I wasn’t a fan of. I still used the whole bottle, but I found myself reaching back for the PowerBite halfway through.”

Her verdict? [ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) was fine for the **dental probiotics benefits**, but for her enamel and coffee-heavy lifestyle, [PowerBite](https://theworldhealth.org/powerbite-official) was the one that actually made a difference.

# ✅ Pros and Cons

# 🟩 PowerBite

**Pros**  
🟢 Supports **natural enamel restoration** with mineral-rich ingredients

🟢 Refreshing flavor that avoids harsh aftertaste

**Cons**  
🔴 No support for **sealing microscopic holes in teeth naturally**

🔴 Texture may be off-putting to some users

# 💲 Pricing Options

Only PowerBite really offers the full benefits of **supplements that help remineralize teeth**, which makes it a stronger value overall.

Shipping is free in the U.S. for larger bundles, and both include digital bonuses—mostly about breath care and daily habits.

# 🌐 Where To Try PowerBite or ProDentim

Always buy from the official [PowerBite](https://theworldhealth.org/powerbite-official) or [ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) websites. It’s the only way to access refund guarantees and avoid expired or counterfeit products floating around online marketplaces.

If you're serious about **treating early tooth decay without a dentist**, don’t roll the dice with third-party sellers. Stick to the source.

Not candy-sweet, but herbal and pleasant.

⭐ **Ingredient Transparency** – ★★★★☆  
Probiotics clearly listed, but no **minerals that support strong, healthy teeth**.

⭐ **Value for Money** – ★★☆☆☆  
**ProDentim supports oral microbiome balance** well, but it's not for enamel healing.

# 🧾 Conclusion

If your teeth feel like they're giving up every time you drink something cold, focus on **natural enamel restoration**. [PowerBite](https://theworldhealth.org/powerbite-official) actually helps with that.

[ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) is better suited for folks seeking the **benefits of** **dental probiotics** or managing oral dryness. But it skips the enamel angle almost entirely.

So, **is PowerBite effective for cavities**? It won’t replace your dentist, but it can help your enamel fight back. That’s more than what most supplements manage.

If you’re looking for **top supplements for healthy teeth and gums**, pick based on your biggest need: enamel defense or bacterial balance.

# ❓ FAQ

**1. Can I use both supplements at the same time?**  
Yes. But if you’re focused on **how to strengthen enamel through minerals**, PowerBite alone might be enough.

**2. Are there any known side effects of PowerBite?**  
Nothing major reported. Still, anyone with sensitivities should check the label and speak to a dentist if unsure.

**3. What results do people get with ProDentim?**  
Mostly fresher breath, fewer gum issues, and improved mouth moisture. Less so for enamel strength.

**4. Which is better for long-term oral care?**  
PowerBite is a **fluoride-free enamel repair option**, while ProDentim leans more on gut-mouth balance.

**5. Is this suitable for kids?**  
Neither product is made for children. Best to ask a dentist before sharing.

**6. What’s a good strategy for results?**  
Use the product daily, stick with good brushing habits, and don’t treat supplements as a substitute for regular cleanings.

The damage was exacerbated by the fact that the fire department did not activate the tornado warning alarm. Although the fire department was warned minutes before the tornado hit, the warning was considered ambiguous. 

The confusion is due to area coffee barista Christina Radrick, a 22-year-old college student, who smiled and made eyes at fire department officials, but never outright told anyone to sound the alarm. 

“She kept going on about how important our job is,” said area fire department official Vincent Robinson, ""I guess looking back, she should have said ‘sound the alarm now,’ but I didn’t put it together.

I mean, maybe I'm guilty of it too sometimes, but it's kinda weird, right? I think I read somewhere that it's called 'bystander apathy.' It's like when you're in a crowd, everyone assumes someone else will step up, so nobody does anything. 

I wonder if it's related to some kind of group psychology thing where people don't want to stand out or maybe they're afraid of getting involved for some reason. Is it like people don't want to be the odd one out or is it just convenience? 

I guess it's easier to think ""not my problem"" when others are around, but that kinda sucks for the person needing help. Could be interesting to see how this plays out differently across different cultures or if certain settings make people more or less likely to engage.

Need some real help from the *real foodies* here. A few of my close friends from *Thekkan Keralam* are visiting Kannur this June. Now here’s the problem…

In the past I’ve been flexing Kannur's cuisine like we’re the hidden capital of taste - biriyanis, snacks, seafood, you name it. But now, with reality hitting me square in the face, I’ve realized something painful:

We barely have anything consistent or special left to flex.

Yes, my grandma still makes the best biriyani I’ve ever had, but she’s too old to cook for 4-5 hungry fellas. I can't possibly ask her - and I myself am no kitchen hero.

So now I’m on a mission to find genuinely good *biriyani and authentic Kannur cuisine* \- something that can actually represent our cuisine proudly. But please don’t come at me with overhyped spots or IG-famous letdowns. I’ve been burned too many times.

Here’s a hard no list from me (based on very real trauma):

* Soft Kannur – Mid now, and feels factory-run.
* Ajwa – Just another broiler biriyani in fancy pots.
* MVK (Kannothumchal & Munishwaran) – Gone from decent to dead.
* Sona – I genuinely don’t know why people mention it anymore.
* Omar’s Inn – Average and unreliable
* MRA – Overpriced and not worth it.
* Arafa – Unhygienic and painfully below average.
* Paris – That place has definitely lost its prime.
* Bombay – Total miss.

Also, please avoid suggesting mandhis, shawarmas, and other “Arabian vibes” that feel like *Indian Coffee House coffees*: same base, minor tweaks.

Kannur and Thalassery have one of the richest food traditions in India, but somehow we don’t have even one iconic, reliable go-to place that does justice to our legacy like Kozhikode does.

Help me save face. Any low-key legends, homes-style kitchens, or actually *well-run* biriyani joints...",10,1747938715.0,kannur,17,0.86,False
1ksy5ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fat2Fit/comments/1ksy5ax/face_plump_after_weight_loss_doctors_hate_this/,Face Plump AFTER Weight Loss?! Doctors HATE This Trick!,"Why Your Face Might Look Different After Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------

Weight loss is good, but did you know your face can change? Sometimes, faces look different after losing weight. This happens because you lose fat all over your body, even in your face. About 40% of people worry that their face looks older after weight loss. I will tell you why face changes after weight goes away.

Fat gives face round shape. Less fat makes face look thin. Face can look sunken, like cheeks go inside. Lines on face might show more. This article explain why this happens. It also talk about what you can do. You learn about sunken cheeks. Hollow temples also can happen. We see about fine lines. You can learn how to help your face look good after weight loss.

Nourishing Your Way to a Fuller Face: Diet &amp; Hydration
----------------------------------------------------------

If your face looks thin after weight goes away, food and water can help. Good food and water make skin good. Food has building blocks for healthy skin. Water makes skin full. So, eat good and drink more water. Face become more fuller.

Eat food with good stuff. Healthy fats, proteins, and vitamins are important. Avocado, nuts, and olive oil have healthy fats. Meat and beans have proteins. Fruits and vegetables have vitamins. Water is very important too. It keeps skin plump. Drink water all day. Do not drink too much coffee or soda. They take water away from the body. Good food and water help your face look good after losing weight.

### Key Nutrients and Foods for Skin Elasticity

If you want your face to look good after losing weight, eat the right foods. Foods with healthy fats are good. Think of avocado, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These help your skin stay soft. Protein is important. Eat chicken, fish, beans, and lentils. They have what skin needs.

Fruits and vegetables are important too. They have vitamins. Vitamin C is in oranges and lemons. Vitamin E is in almonds and spinach. Vitamin A is in carrots and sweet potatoes. These vitamins help skin stay strong. Some foods help skin make something called hyaluronic acid. Eat potatoes and almonds for this. These foods help your face look fuller and younger.

### The Crucial Role of Hydration

Water is very important for skin. Did you know skin is like a sponge? When you have enough water, sponge becomes full. Water makes skin plump. If you do not drink water, skin becomes dry. Skin looks thin. So, you should drink water all day.

Keep a bottle of water with you. Drink water even when you are not feel thirsty. Water make skin happy. Avoid soda and juice. They do not help like water. They can make you thirsty. Water is best thing for plump skin. If you want good skin after weight goes away, drink enough water.

Topical Treatments: Skincare for Natural Facial Plumping
--------------------------------------------------------

Creams and lotions can help face look good. They support skin from outside. Choose creams with good things inside.

Hyaluronic acid is good. It brings water to skin. Vitamin C helps skin. Retinoids are also good. But use them gently. Natural oils like jojoba and shea butter keep skin soft. Put cream on face every day. Wash face with gentle soap. Do not use hard chemicals. Creams and lotions can help face look plump after weight goes away.

### Ingredients to Look for in Skincare Products

If you want creams to help your face, check what is inside. Hyaluronic acid pulls water into skin. This makes face look fuller. Vitamin C helps make collagen. Collagen is like a frame for skin. Retinoids help skin make new cells. Use them gently. Peptides tell skin to make more collagen.

Natural oils like jojoba, argan, and shea butter are good. They make skin soft and keep water inside. When you buy creams, read the label. Look for these things. They help your face look good after weight goes away.

### Gentle Skincare Practices

Taking care of face is easy. You want to be gentle. Always put cream on your face. Do this every day. When washing face, use gentle soap. Do not use soap with hard chemicals. Do not rub face too hard.

If you scrub face, do not do it too much. Too much scrubbing is not good. These simple things help keep skin good. They help face look plump after weight goes away. Gentle skincare makes big difference.

Facial Exercises and Massage Techniques
---------------------------------------

Some people do exercises for their face. This might help muscles. If muscles are stronger, face might look better. Massage can also help. It can make blood flow better.

But do not think face exercises work like body exercises. Face is different. Do not expect too much. Face exercises might help a little. Massage might feel good. But they are not same as creams and good food. Do face exercises gently. Do not pull skin too much.

Lifestyle Habits for a Naturally Plumper Look
---------------------------------------------

How you live affects face. Sleep is very important. If you do not sleep enough, skin looks bad. Stress is also not good. Stress makes skin look old. Protect skin from sun. Sun can damage skin.

Do not smoke. Smoking is very bad for skin. Do not drink too much alcohol. Alcohol also damages skin. If you sleep well, manage stress, and protect skin, face will look better. Good habits help face look plump after weight goes away.

### Prioritizing Sleep and Managing Stress

Sleep is like charging your phone. If you do not sleep, phone does not work. If you do not sleep, skin does not work. Skin looks tired. Stress is bad too. Stress makes bad things in body. These bad things damage skin.

Sleep seven or eight hours every night. Find ways to stop stress. You can read a book. You can walk outside. You can talk to friend. When you sleep good and stop stress, skin looks good. Face looks plump.

### Protecting Your Skin from Environmental Damage

Sun is strong. Sun can damage skin. Even when sun is not too bright, it can damage. Always put cream on face that protects from sun. This cream is called sunscreen.

Smoking is very bad. Smoking makes skin old. Alcohol is also not good if you drink too much. Alcohol dries skin. Pollution in air is also not good. Pollution makes skin bad. Protect skin from sun, do not smoke, do not drink too much alcohol, and keep away from pollution. This helps face look good.

Putting It All Together: Creating Your Natural Face Plumping Routine
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To make face look good, do many things. Eat good food, drink water, use creams, sleep well, and protect from sun. If you do only one thing, it does not help too much. You must do all things together.

Do these things every day. Do not stop. It takes time to see face change. Be patient. Do not expect face to change overnight. If you keep doing these things, face will look better after weight goes away.

Conclusion
----------

Weight going away is good thing. But face can change. Do not worry. There are many things to do. Eat good, drink water, use cream, sleep well, and protect from sun. These things help face look good. Be patient. Keep doing these things. Your face will look good and you will be happy.

1ksy4u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ksy4u8/the_last_rain/,The last rain,"i have met this boy in my office he was my only friend he was my best friend. i don't know why 

I met him at work. In a sea of people, he became my only friend. And somehow, my best one.
It was uncanny like meeting a version of myself in someone else. Our thoughts, our views on life, our ambitions everything aligned like mirror reflections. He once confided in me about his plan to quit thus job, to dedicate himself fully to learning German, and to leave India in pursuit of his Master’s degree in Germany. I admired his clarity and courage.
We built a world in Hyderabad that only we knew a world of early morning sunrises, shared silences, and simple joys.
One evening, after work, it started raining. I impulsively asked him if he’d go for a bike ride with me. He agreed without hesitation. We rode through the city in the rain, stopped for Maggie and chai, drenched and laughing. That night, I realized God, I think I’m in love with him.
It was the first rain of the season in Hyderabad, and I was with him. That moment stayed with me.

Our lives changed abruptly. Due to rising tensions between India and Pakistan, our office declared 15 days of work-from-home. We both went to our hometowns. The calls became less frequent. One day, out of nowhere, he called to tell me he'd resigned.
He had to return to the office to submit his laptop and ID, so I went too just to see him one last time.

He was glowing that day. genuinely happy. He was finally chasing his dream, and I was breaking inside.
We had our final cup of chai together at the cafeteria while he waited for his cab. My heart was screaming to tell him how deeply I loved him. But I didn’t.
To him, I was a friend his only friend, he often said but still, just a friend.

It began raining again. We couldn’t find a cab because of it, so we looked for a rickshaw. It felt poetic, almost cruel the rain that had brought us together was now seeing him off.

As he got into the rickshaw, I couldn’t hold back my tears. He looked at me and said, “I’ll miss you.”
I replied, “I’ll miss you too.”
And then he left smiling, happy, unaware of the storm he left behind in me.

After he was gone, everything became a ghost of him the bench we sat on, the cafeteria, the coffee machine, the corridors.
Everything haunted me. Every step felt heavier than the last.

And now, I am trying to move on from something that never really existed .

1ksy41x,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1ksy41x/coffee/,Coffee,"I've been getting two coffees every morning from the corner store. 6:30 the store opens. Get my first coffee. Maple Cinnamon French Toast flavor. I don't like cinnamon but it doesn't really taste like cinnamon.

It's pretty dangerous to go outside - there's ICE and people who can see you through their windows (I'm not sure what they can do, I know what I can do, it doesn't matter if they see me from their place when I'm in my place because it's fine through two windows, one window is a problem), lots of strangers, cops. I know the people who work at the store though, they're pretty safe. I think they might get annoyed when I go twice in quick succession (two coffees every day) though. They probably wish I'd get them both at the same time but then one would get cold.

I found two dollars on the sidewalk while I was going to the store the other day. They were all crumpled up with a very faded paper that I couldn't read which looked like a receipt. I picked them up and then got really worried about them. I threw the receipt in the trash next to the gas pumps when I got to the store and then tried to pay for my $3.22 coffee part with the two dollars cash and part on my card (had no other cash). The clerk told me I couldn't cause there was a card minimum that I wouldn't meet if I used $2 cash. I was pretty sure the bills had microscopic tracking devices on them or something and had been planted on the sidewalk for me to find by bad actors, so I told him that I was just going to give him the cash to keep and I would pay for the coffee full price on my card. He ended up taking it then charging me $2 on card (which I guess was the minimum) and giving me 3 quarters back from the register. I'm a little worried about the 3 quarters too (not as worried as I was about the dollar bills, so I didn't get rid of them, but I did put them in a backpack I don't use, not the one I carry around, so if there are tracking devices, people won't know where I actually am when I'm not at home).

So anyway. Back to the point. Coffee. Sorry about that. I guess this post is getting longer than I intended. I had a therapy session this morning during which I was pretty energetic. I guess I was last week too. She's ended the last two sessions by saying ""I'm glad things are getting better"" which has struck me as odd because that's like, not at all what I said to her? I feel like I said things are not actually going very well. I mean, ok, I said some things are pretty good, I'm doing ok on hygiene and better than usual on apartment upkeep (still miserable by any average person's standards, but good for me). However I am stressed out and worried about stuff and having a lot of upsetting thoughts and not feeling ok about many things. What did she mean ""I'm glad things are getting better""? I kinda feel like maybe she was just paying attention to my energetic vibe rather than the content of what I was saying. My psychiatrist, whom I have actually met with THREE times in the last two weeks, has also mentioned that I seem a little more nervous and fidgety than usual. I'm pretty sure it's cause of the coffee. Possibly exacerbated by recently (\~12 days ago) quitting nicotine - I've read on r/QuitVaping that a lot of people get a burst of energy from stopping (others get really fatigued though).

Caffeine has always affected me strongly but I don't feel as though my two coffees that I've been having recently are really THAT bad. I don't notice any correlation in increased paranoia relating to when I drink them, or a crash some hours after drinking them, or anything like that. Honestly everything - mentally and physically - seems pretty level and consistent 24 hours a day, from the moment I wake up pre-coffee to the moment I go to bed. I HAVE been having a terrible time sleeping, which my fiance has suggested may be due to the coffee, but is it REALLY possible that TWO coffees, the second of which I finish no later than 7:30, maybe 7:40 am latest (yes I drink them pretty fast) is still having the upper effect on me 15, 16, 17, 18 hours later? And that I haven't noticed ANY difference in how I'm feeling throughout the day at ALL to be that strongly affected by it?

So anyone, how does caffeine affect you and any thoughts you have on the above? What is your relationship with coffee?",2,1747938541.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

I have a small house up in the mountains. It’s what I always wanted, though. Well, I used to imagine it with my wife, but I guess you can’t have it all. It hasn’t been bad since she passed. I have a garden. I have time to paint and read. There is endless hiking and exploring, and I get to feel like I’m free.

Things have always been quiet out there. I mean, it’s the woods, so I never hear cars drive by my house. Planes rarely fly overhead. People don’t talk, and I live alone. Bird’s don’t even sing very often. Nothing. In the winter when snow pads the ground, I can hear my own heart beating. I can hear my stomach churning. But you get used to all of that. You stop noticing it. I’ve always been the very quiet and softly spoken type anyway. There’s so many other things to focus on, and I’ve never been the observant type.

I think that’s why it took me so long to notice that things had gotten, well, especially silent. I think they did, at least. It’s hard to tell. Up until recently it was quiet enough most of the time, but when I made coffee you would hear the pot. If I slammed my door a little too loud, I would notice. I don’t know when those noises faded away. It’s not like you really ever think about stuff like the door shutting when you live alone. 

I keep a little bit of company around: my cat Lucy. She noticed things were a little off sooner than I did. She tried to warn me, actually, about the unusual quiet, I think. I’m old, you know. I guess my senses have changed. I sleep more now. I’m lucky she’s around, even if it didn’t do much, when the worst of that uneasy-crawling silence pounced

You know how they say the woods go quiet when something bad is about to happen? Or maybe it’s any set of surroundings-not just the woods-getting totally spooky and empty. I can tell you that it’s true now, but at least for me it’s not like the way you usually hear it. It’s not this abrupt thing that suddenly stuns you, driving you off back into the unsuspecting comfort of noise. No. It’s slow and gradual. It disguises itself with the mundaneness of your surroundings. By the time you realize it’s there, it’s already stifling you. 

Yesterday, I woke up and found scratches on my bedroom door. The only culprit was Lucy, but it was bizarre. She’d been acting strange lately, but she’d never done this before, and it’s not as if I keep her trapped in my room at night. The door is always wide open, so she’s free to leave. Nonetheless, she’d felt the need to scratch at it during the night. She’d really scratched it up too, to the point where I felt I needed to go check on her paws. So, I started my morning off searching for her, and feeling a little uneasy that I couldn’t hear her. She’s a noisy old thing, you know? I figured age must really be getting to both of us now: She didn’t feel like talking, and I was having a hard enough time listening. I tried to ignore that realization.

Looking for her made me feel lonely I guess. I’m not one to get lonely, but I think that’s only as long as it’s self induced. It wasn’t this time. Lucy might have needed me last night, but I couldn’t hear her. It didn’t matter what sort of company I’d facilitated for the two of us. I simply couldn’t be present. 

I did find Lucy eventually. After about ten minutes of wandering around the property and calling for her, there she was, right in the house. She’s an outdoor cat, however she usually stays close in the morning.

Indeed she was home but, rather unusually, asleep in my kitchen. She doesn’t tend to hide out there, and I wondered what drew her in. Maybe it was the dishwasher. The thing runs at night, creating vibrations and sounds and the likes. I assume Lucy found comfort in that. 

To my surprise, she did not react at all as I approached. She’s a skittish cat, and doesn’t tend to have much of an interest in being touched or pet unless it's on her terms. This time, however, only once I touched her did she even start. She lurched suddenly with some sense of being startled and clawed at my arm leaving a firm scratch. I didn’t mind, especially since now I knew she was alive and seemingly well. 

I expected her to bolt, but after her little warning she stayed unusually close. She seemed stressed, if I might try to identify such a feeling in a cat as aloof as Lucy. She was scanning the room and pacing around my legs as if she was on guard. I began to feel uneasy myself, a renewed version of that lonely-anxiety I’d felt upon waking up some twenty minutes ago. I suppose Lucy and I had grown accustomed to each other’s unwavering conviction about our isolated living situations, and so neither of us liked seeing the other so… off.

In an effort to calm my nerves I went to brew a pot of coffee. As I poured out the beans this lingering uneasiness I felt cemented itself into a cold hard reality. Something was very wrong. The beans fell into the pot silently. It’s like someone had dunked my head underwater the moment that first bean touched my kettle. Let me try and be more clear: When you pour out an item, you expect a noise. I think of pouring beans into a pot as a visual sort of thing, but it’s also just as much an auditory thing. In this case, instead of pouring out pattering-bean-noise, I was pouring out silence. Everything became completely stifled in an instance. 

The stifling was nothing like the densely packed snow I appreciated. I wished I could hear my organs and my heart beating. In fact, I wished I could hear anything at all that told me my body was still working. Instead, I suffered in a way that I still find difficult to describe. Maybe the equivalent is if someone turned on a beaming torch in my face and it blinded me. It’s the type of loss of vision you don’t expect, and it burns your eyes. Alternatively, it’s like when your leg falls asleep and you start to move it and notice how it’s all tingly and lost lots of feeling. It was like that for my ears, my head-my whole body; mercilessly having the sensation sucked out of it.

This emptiness was shocking and painful. My ears ached, desperately straining to get some sort of idea of what they should be feeling and hearing. My instincts racked my senses, begging for some kind of impulse or nerve trigger. I screamed. Well, I think I did. I couldn’t hear or feel myself beneath this relentless and oppressive lack of everything.

In those miserable moments, I strained to rationalize: I’ve gotten hard of hearing in my old age. Hell, even my mother lost all her hearing in her later years. Nothing explained this, though, and that was perhaps the hardest for me: The unknowingness; the crushing lack of everything, including an end in sight.

I can’t say how long we rotted like that, minutes? Seconds? Well, it eventually ended. Vibrations that felt like foreign and distant creaks and screams came rushing back in, rattling my whole body. A sort of overwhelming rush of silence, actual normal silence, pummeled my senses. My vision worked well enough I guess, but I felt so disorientated and out of balance I couldn’t help but stumble around and crash against my fridge before slumping to the ground. I caught a glimpse of Lucy having a similar reaction. She was frantically pacing with her mouth agape, her back arched, and her ears strained. 

Indeed the overwhelming destruction of sensation adjusted back towards normalcy in the way your eyes acclimate after a sudden-blinding light. Lucy and I lay there terrified and incapacitated. Two older souls, and as much as it pains me to say, older minds as well, trying to recover from such intensity. 

Lucy wandered apprehensively towards her food, and took a few nervous bites. I dragged myself up after her, and stared into the pot of coffee I’d tried to prepare. I winced just looking at the beans, perfectly still and silent. At that moment, more than anything, certainly far more than usual, I wished for another person. Another voice to help with that silence. I decided then that the least I could do was exercise my own voice. 

It felt immense to simply utter those words. I had to build up courage while fearing some mysterious disaster might befall us if I mustered even the slightest sound. Nonetheless, I called out for Lucy. It came out dull and raspy, like a cylinder of sandpaper being dragged out of my throat and along my tongue. It coughed, but nothing else happened. Lucy perked up and came over. For the briefest moment, I felt relief. She could hear me. I bent down to give her a reassuring pet when the second attack came.

This time, it came from elsewhere, though. It hadn’t occurred to me the first time that this overwhelming sensory devastation had a range and proximity. You could say it came in explosions with seemingly random catalysts. And this second time, the explosion was outside the house, not that we didn’t feel the shockwaves. I screamed again in response. It felt like my voice was being ripped away from my mouth. The noise I created was torn away from me and stifled into oblivion at an aggression and instance far greater than the speed and force of sound. 

I fell to my knees yet again as the shockwave tore through us. Lucy fared worse. She knocked out and with deep concern I could see blood coming out of her ears. A mixture of rage and desperation filled me as I dragged myself towards her and scooped her up. The explosion, which I will call it for now, beat down on us relentlessly. I could just barely keep my wits about me as I hobbled Lucy and I towards the front door. I had to get us out of there.

I burst out into a sunny day, and the explosion ceased. Adjusting back to reality for a second time was very painful. My head pounded and my body felt weaker than ever, but I pushed myself towards my driveway. It was beautiful outside. The serenity felt cruel and misleading. I glanced around with terror, wondering if whatever caused the last explosion was waiting to attack us, but there was nothing except the beautiful trees I knew all too well. The sun warmed my skin. I was deceptively comforted. I felt the urge to tell myself what had just happened was simply a newfound hysteria, onset with my age. Maybe I’d finally cracked. But Lucy. What about her? 

Thank the gods for Lucy, and that I held on to my suspicion anyway. I think both showed me the true nature of the silence and the stillness. The woods were too serene. They were too inviting, after what I had just experienced. I thought back to Lucy scratching at my seemingly safe and protective house last night. We were flies, lulled in and trapped by sweet sticky leaves of a looming-invisible venus flytrap, and it was snapping shut.

Committing to my suspicion, I threw open the driver’s side door and climbed in. I placed Lucy on the seat next to me and took a deep breath. I grit my teeth and started the engine. Immediately, a violent wave of stimulation came crashing into my eardrums. I was ready this time. Well, as ready as I could ever be for something like that, so I fought desperately to keep my hold on some sense of control. I backed my car onto the dirt road that connected my house to the rest of civilization. 

I gunned it forward and the miserable sensory drain worsened. It evolved into into its truer self. It took me further and further into its depths of nothingness, and revealed something far more horrifying than before. It sounded-no, more like it pulsed-nothingness. To my confusion, it pulsed like music. I mean, it was rhythmic. Somehow it was a rhythmic assault of lack that tore into my auditory senses which were desperate for any familiar reception to plug their bleeding, abandoned nerve-endings. It was horrifying how much it reminded me of actual music: Harmonious human-like voices and sounds were coming together, despite being the worst thing I’ve ever heard. It felt as though my soul was being battered, licked, and taunted, only moments away from being wrenched out of my body and annihilated by whatever unnatural anthem assaulted me. 

I reached the third bend from my house, and all at once the explosion stopped. I could hear the sound of my revving engine fade back into existence. I looked around wide-eyed, wondering what had changed. I couldn’t tell at the time, so I just drove for a long time, getting far away. I think I now know why it stopped, though: Lucy. She’d been claimed-digested.

I’m sorry to tell you she passed away. I cried as I buried her at the edge of the woods, and then I ran. I’m staying in a motel as I write to you. I’m afraid to go home, and I’m afraid to tell my kids. They’ll think I’m crazy. Maybe I am. I’m getting old, after all. Even I find it hard to believe those horrific experiences and how I handled them really ever made any sense. Writing out my thoughts, I feel like a buffoon, you know? I feel like you’ll shake your head, and sigh at the apparent delusions of an old, fading man. But I’m doing this anyway, because that haunting-excruciating song has been stuck in my head. It’s relentless.

The miserable echo has worn me down as I rest here in my motel. To be honest, this place feels safe now. It’s been so long since I stayed somewhere cozy and subdued like this. I forgot how beautiful and still even the plainest little motel room could be: The wallpaper is serene, my bed is soft and inviting, and I haven’t had to speak a single word in days.

I don’t think I have it in me this time; to make coffee or get up and paint. I’m all alone now, I’m very-very comfortable, and I just don’t think I can face the music again. I suppose I will embrace the silence, even if it means rotting and digesting in its enticing tendrils…

Whatever, I’m probably crazy, but before I go-however I go-I advise you stay sharp and present when it gets quiet, just in case.",2,1747938515.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I heavily overcooked my stir fry and have been left with a pretty unpleasant dish to try and reheat for the week. I sauteed orange bell pepper, white onion, bok choy, spring onions, and carrots in soy sauce ,white wine vinegar, lime juice ground mustard, ground ginger, powdered garlic, laoganma spicy chili crisp, and about 2 tbsp of sugar. It's pretty heavily overcooked, and I have texture issues so I'm struggling to eat it.

I'm wondering if it's possible to use this in something else, maybe render it into some kind of sauce or use it for roasting meat? I'm open to suggestions. I really don't want to throw it away because I can't afford to throw out that much produce.

My only dietary restriction is that I am lactose intolerant, enough so that even ""low lactose"" cheeses like cheddar and gouda can trigger it.

Now that I finally have a grinder that’s a step up from my old $60 one, I’m looking to enhance my espresso game.

I'm currently using a budget machine — the Dedica EC885. I know it's not the most advanced setup, but so far, I’ve really been enjoying the coffee I’ve been able to make with it. Every cup has been a learning experience, and I’m seeing steady progress.

I tend to prefer medium to dark roasts, and I’m looking for some advice on grind size. Specifically, how should I be adjusting my grind depending on the roast level? I know that I can look at the shot time to guide me (adjusting finer for fast extractions and coarser for slow ones), but I’d like to understand the general principles — for example, do darker roasts typically require a coarser or finer grind?

Also, I’ve heard a lot about burr alignment — is that something I need to worry about right now with a new grinder, or is it more of an advanced step for later on?

If you have any other tips or tricks for someone still new to espresso, I’d really appreciate them. I've already seen noticeable improvement from my first cup to now, and I’m enjoying the learning curve.",5,1747938455.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We all know that each day has its own unique opportunities and gifts, but we often miss them in the rush of daily life. Today, let's talk about how to learn to enjoy each day, find inspiration in ordinary things, and give yourself moments of happiness. This isn't just helpful advice; it's a really important part of our mental and emotional well-being.

Let's start with a simple question: What does joy mean to you? For some, it might be the moment when sunlight peeks through the curtains in the morning. For others, it's the sound of kids laughing or the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Joy is a feeling that comes from inside and can be triggered by the most common things. We often look for something amazing and grand, forgetting that happiness can be found in the smallest details.

The first thing to remember is practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness helps us focus on the present moment instead of worrying about the future or regretting the past. Set aside time each day to just *be*. This could be a morning ritual where you enjoy a cup of tea, really tasting each sip. Or an evening walk where you listen to the sounds of nature and breathe in the fresh air. Try to notice the details: the colors, the sounds, the feelings. Real happiness is often hidden in these moments.

The next step is to allow yourself to dream and set goals. Pay attention to what inspires and makes you happy. Maybe you want to learn something new or go on a trip. Create a list of small and big wishes and work towards making them happen. Each step you take toward your dream will bring joy and satisfaction, turning routine days into an exciting adventure.

Connecting with loved ones is another key part of joy. Share your emotions, celebrate each other's successes, and support each other during tough times. Create traditions together, spend time together—this strengthens your bonds and adds bright colors to your daily life.

Finally, don't forget to take care of yourself. Make time for your hobbies, do things that you enjoy, whether it's reading, drawing, or playing sports. Pay attention to your mental and physical health. Remember, joy starts with you—how you treat yourself and your life.

There's something in every day that can bring a smile to your face. Open your heart to these moments, learn to notice them, and appreciate them. Joy isn't the final goal; it's a way of life. Let each new day be another opportunity for happiness. I believe that each of us can learn to be happy and fill our lives with light and positivity.

Share in the comments what brings joy to your life! Let's make a list together of things that make you happy.",1,1747938278.0,InnerGrowthLab,0,1.0,False
1ksxzl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ksxzl3/losing_my_patience_with_my_4yo_very_easily_lately/,Losing my patience with my 4yo very easily lately,"My 4.5yo is driving me nuts. He has grown out of tantrums and has them pretty much never, but is very clingy and demanding. 
He wakes up every morning around 6-6.30, NEVER later, so on those days when we're home all day feel like prison sometimes. From the moment he wakes up he wants me to be 100% involved in everything. I tried explaining to him a million times that mommy works a lot and needs to drink coffee and just relax in the soffa. He'll go play by himself for 2 mins and then hes back to clinging.

 Every time we are home all day I plan an activity usually after lunch and we spend doing it until evening. Until its time for us to go out and do whatever we planned he will literally ask me around 100 times when we are going, what the time is and if he can check the time on my phone. I spend half of the day with him every time with so much anxiety because i feel so unbealivably pressured. 

We slept over at my friends house a couple of times and in the morning her kids are playing, running around, doing their own thing, coming to their mom here and there for a hug or with some random questions while my son spends every second clinging, asking questions, bothering me and not leaving me alone. I just wanna be fucking able to chill at home sometimes while he does his own thing. Its killing me. 

I feel pressured and anxious because i feel like i need to perform ALL THE TIME for him to be happy, we cant just chill as mom and child, we cant just be and enjoy the moment.
Like when i took him to the pool and i look around at other parents just swimming and having small conversations with their kids while my kid wants to change pools every 2 mins, if we dont do it he will ask quite literally 50 times before we do it, wants me to catch this and throw that, and look at this and look at that, and oh my god i just lose my shit completely sometimes. I cant perform 24/7. I am so exhausted and done with this. Its been 4,5 years of this behaviour and i thought it would get better with age but its never-ending.

I do so much with him, give him so much and not a single thank-you in 4,5 years. As soon as hes gotten what he wants, hes onto asking for another thing. Lately ive been losing my shit so much. 

I picked him up from kindergarden on tuesday, he sees me, walks up to me and says (without even a hello) ""mom i want pancakes when we get home"" His teacher heard and shes like ""mom just arrived! Say hi to mom, ask mom how shes doing instead!"" And im like...yeah thats never happening ever. As soon as i pick him up, the first question is what we are doing next or if we can buy/ eat certain food/toy. 
Never a hug or words of gratitude from him, just demands demands demands. 


I never insulted him in my whole life, never called him a name or hit him, i just end up yelling and lecturing him on these things that are bothering me. I hate myself for yelling but i strongly dont believe anything i tried to teach him calmly in 4,5 years  has worked shit, so i just resort to yelling bc im so desperate to see some growth in him.

Im just fucking tired and i need advice on how to fix this behaviour because sometimes being alone with him feels like 2 invisible hands are holding me around my neck choking me and they dont let go until hes gone to sleep.

I love Islam and learning about it, or even learning arabic from scratch more generally. Any classes, clubs etc I would be interested in going.

This is very confusing to me so would appreciate some support in understanding my brand new Gaggia CP e24.  This is my first fully manual espresso machine.  I had a Bambino which was easy to use but it didn't last long at all.  Died after 4 years and again 8 months after I paid Breville $200 to fix the wand so I decided move away from Breville.  I didn't put a lot of effort into the Bambino once I figured out the right grind size / grind time.   It was pretty much plug and play.   I knew there would be a learning curve adapting to the Gaggia.  I didn't realize it would be this tricky though.

I have OD'd on YouTube videos on the right way to pull a shot and I have tried to follow some of what I have learned but am confused.  Would appreciate some answers to the below questions:

1) Supposedly 18 grams of beans is the standard double shot; however, 18 grams of the bean I am using (Whole Foods 365 Island Blend) yields way too many coffee grounds.  It overflows from the basket (I am using the standard double basket).  Am I doing something wrong? Is it the bean?  I'm grinding at 18 which is pretty fine.  I have a Breville burr grinder. 

2)   I read that 25 - 30 seconds is the ideal brew time.  Does that start when I hit the brew button or when the espresso starts extracting?    I have noticed a long wait time between turning it on and seeing espresso come out of the PF, sometimes 10-15 seconds.

I am not here for small talk or surface level exchanges. I want a connection where we can both show up fully, no pretences, no filters, just real, honest conversations. It is in those moments when we share what is on our minds without hesitation that we begin to really see and understand each other.

I run my own business, which gives me the freedom to shape my days around the things that matter to me. I spend my time running, hiking, working out, baking, experimenting in the kitchen, travelling when I can, and getting bossed around by my pets who are small, furry reminders that I’m not actually in charge. I like the small pleasures in life, a good coffee, a quiet morning, freshly baked bread but I’m just as drawn to the big ones, like chasing a new adventure or throwing myself into something that makes me feel alive.

What I value most in a connection is emotional depth. It is not just about the big conversations, but also the quieter moments where we truly understand each other without saying much. I am drawn to those who appreciate depth in their interactions, those who are open to vulnerability, who are not afraid to dive into meaningful discussions about life, growth, or even the things that make us wonder. People who value curiosity, kindness, and the balance between thinking deeply and enjoying life’s lighter moments.

If this resonates with you, I would love to hear from you. Do not be afraid to make the first move and show that you are up for a meaningful conversation. If this post is still up, I am still here, still looking for something real, grounded, and full of potential.",2,1747938087.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

As someone who's practically living off filtered water, I've had the opportunity to test countless water filters over the past few years. Most recently, the **Waterdrop WD-PF-01A Replacement Filter** caught my attention, and I’ve spent the past few months testing this product within various scenarios. Here's how my experience went, along with a mix of surprises, both good and not-so-great.

**Ease of Installation and Design Practicality**

Setting this filter up was a breeze. If you’re like me, you dread overly complicated installations that turn into mini engineering projects. Thankfully, this one was simple — almost embarrassingly so. It took me a solid five minutes to pop it into my existing Waterdrop Pitcher Filtration System (mine happens to be the WD-PT-05 model, but it works with several others too). The slim design didn’t fight for space in the pitcher, and the filter sat snugly without wobbling. Over time, I noticed the replacement process stayed just as smooth even after multiple uses.

[Ready to buy Waterdrop WD-PF-01A? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://usedwater.com/price/b086zpr3wm/)

**Impressive Filtration Performance**

The performance of this filter honestly surprised me. Right away, I could tell the difference in taste. Before switching, I was using a pretty basic pitcher filter, and I never realized my water had a slightly off, metallic aftertaste until it was gone. The WD-PF-01A eliminates PFAS, PFOA, chlorine, fluoride, and even those subtle “off flavors.” I conducted some fun experiments with my family (and yes, they rolled their eyes at me). We did a side-by-side taste test with unfiltered tap water, and everyone unanimously agreed that the filtered water tasted cleaner.

Additionally, this filter’s efficiency is backed by testing from third-party laboratories, reassuring the skeptic in me that this wasn’t just a placebo effect. Knowing it tackles microscopic impurities made me more confident in using the water not just for drinking, but also for coffee brewing and cooking.

**Highlights**

- Excellent filtration of PFAS, PFOA, chlorine, and even invisible particles
- Improved water taste clarity right after installation
- Quick installation that doesn’t require extra tools or expertise
- Certified by external testing to ensure contaminant removal

**Drawbacks**

I’ll admit something here: I am picky when it comes to practicality, and this filter has a couple of areas to consider. Let’s start with longevity. While it’s marketed as filtering up to 200 gallons (about three months for average households), heavy users might find themselves replacing it a bit earlier. My family went through the 200 gallons surprisingly fast since we use filtered water for everything short of bathing. Not ideal if you’re trying to save on replacements.

I also noticed the price might feel higher compared to some basic generic filters, though the performance and confidence in third-party certifications justify it if you prioritize clean water.

- Heavier usage depletes the filter faster than expected
- Upfront cost is higher for budget-conscious users

**Long-Lasting Durability and Economic Usage**

One of the biggest appeals for me was the product’s promise of reducing plastic waste. Since each filter replaces over 1600 single-use 16oz water bottles, you can really feel like you’re doing your part for the environment. However, this claim only stands strong if you aren't going through replacements too quickly. In my testing, the estimated lifespan was fair but didn’t exceed my expectations.

Beyond just the numbers, I also didn’t notice any significant issues like clogging throughout usage. The water flow stayed consistent at its promised 0.4 gpm rate, so there was never an annoying lag while filling a pitcher or bottle.

**Competing Brands**

When putting the Waterdrop filter against its competitors like Brita or PUR, there were clear differences. For instance, Brita offers similar basic filtration at a potentially lower entry price, but it often doesn’t handle PFAS or fluoride specifically. PUR, on the other hand, excels in contaminant removal but tends to have slower flow rates in comparison. 

Waterdrop balances these elements nicely by combining a fast flow rate with high-quality filtration technology like advanced activated carbon fiber (ACF). On the downside, Brita’s filters are more widely available in grocery stores, whereas I had to order the WD-PF-01A online, making replacement planning a necessity. Nonetheless, if water purity is your top priority, this filter outshines both competitors.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of overall cost-effectiveness, this filter stands out despite the slightly higher upfront investment. What you’re paying for is peace of mind—knowing your water is healthier for both you and your appliances (goodbye weird mineral buildup in the kettle). Breaking down the cost over its lifespan, it’s a small price to pay for the convenience and solid filtration power.

1ksxu1j,https://i.redd.it/oizpbf2okd2f1.jpeg,"""Dolphining"": A Term My Fiancé Coined for How My ADHD Brain Jumps Topics","So my fiancé came up with a term for something my ADHD brain does, and honestly, it fits so well I wanted to share it in case it resonates with anyone else.

He calls it “dolphining.”

Here’s what it looks like from the outside:  
We’ll be talking about something — let’s say coffee — and then seemingly out of nowhere, I’ll say something like “We should go to the farmer’s market this weekend.” He’s confused because, to him, the topics feel totally unrelated.

But here’s what actually happened in my brain (aka *underwater*):

* Coffee...
* Starbucks...
* Oh, we should visit the original Starbucks in Seattle...
* Last time we were in Seattle we went to that farmer’s market...
* We should go to the farmer’s market.

It’s like my thought dolphin *pops out of the water* at the coffee conversation, dives deep through all those mental connections, and *surfaces again* at the farmer’s market… but since no one else sees the “underwater” part, it looks random or disconnected.

To me, the logic is perfectly clear — it just doesn’t always translate well in real-time conversation. 

We’ve both started using this term now, and it’s helped us communicate way better. When it happens he will say, ""umm...okay, dolphining, take me on the journey.""

So after the whole thing we went to get some coffee at 'BABA JI SHAKES'  (sorry too broke for starbs). There were a bunch of gym dudes over there having Baba Ji ka mashoor protein shake and literally checking us out, one even commenting something about my face. Already dressed in my 5th grader outfit, i started feeling a bit conscious since that market is legit known for spotting your school mutuals and stuff like that.

So we were walking having our baba ji hazelnut cold coffee and my bestie spots a guy and immediately starts rushing me forward so my blind ahh doesnt spot him but alas! I see the guy staring at us and getting a bit conscious and i squint my eyes and immediately recognise him. MY FAILED SITUATIONSHIP FROM 2 MONTHS AGO! and idk why im so fkin stupid, I immediately see him and go ""OMG HI!! DIDNT EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE""

He was like ""You live here?"" I was like ""ummm no, i live nearby"" then he goes ""this is so unexpected.""

A little context: This guy approached me in a fest and I found him cute so we started talking, but here's the thing even after getting approached, I made the fkin plan to meet and have some coffee together but he cancelled cuz he had some documentation work in his college. Now since I already asked once and he bailed on me, it was supposed to be him asking me out for coffee again or atleast make up for that but he legit ghosted me kind of and would occasionally like my stories on instagram. So we didnt meet after the fest which was almost 3 months ago.

Coming back, I say ""Yeah totally unexpected since im supposed to leave Delhi in 2 days!"" He goes ""What why?"" And guys. Guys. Guess what I did. I go ""haha yeah meri intern lag gayi 😝🤟"" YES I LEGIT HIT 😝🤟 this emote in his face multiple times smh. He goes ""You were in final year??"" Wow great way of calling me old!!! I say ""No i'm in 2nd year"" and etc etc small talk. Since it was getting awk, i was like ""We were supposed to meet but you ditched me"" 🤦‍♀️ and he goes "" Uhh vo actually uhh i didnt ditch you what happened was ehh uhh ahh"" And i point to my friend and go ""Even she thinks you ditched me right?"" And she just nods her head. Bro i said this like twice and thinking back I must have come across as so desperate.

He's lowkey kinda cute and taller than me which is new cuz well I'm pretty tall myself, usually all guys are same height as me, not that I have something for tall guys but well he looked good and me? I was in my barbie pink tshirt 🙏

I've already talked about this with my friends but omg what are the odds!!! Crazy damn. I dont leave my house much and when I do this happens. And he cant even contact me on insta now since I deactivated it to 'Lock in' and took Amitabh Bacchan style pratigya to only activate it again AFTER I'm back from my internship.

TLDR: I wore my “pink princess” tee and PJs (no combing involved) just to help my bestie print her lab file, but she dragged me along to meet her BF after. I agreed only for a coffee bribe. While sipping cold coffee and dodging mutuals, I unexpectedly ran into my *failed fest situationship* who had ghosted me after canceling our coffee plan months ago. I awkwardly greeted him, accidentally dropped a 😝🤟, reminded him (twice) that *he ditched me*, and now I feel like a desperate barbie in a pink tee while he stood there tall and cute. I barely go out and of course, this is what happens when I do. Wild. (tldr chat gpt se likhwaya h)",0,1747937788.0,TeenIndia,5,0.33,False

1ksxs5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1ksxs5a/my_boyfriend_cheated_on_me/,My boyfriend cheated on me.,"So, I’m a chill girlfriend, I have basic rules in the relationship like no emotional or physical cheating of course. But other than that I don’t really care how my boyfriend spends his time. He recently went to the club with his boys, some girl found him attractive and he acted on it and took her number down. 

Not just that, but came home and messaged her and messaged her again the next morning asking her to grab coffee only three hours before seeing me. He also stalked her on Instagram, and sent her a request on LinkedIn as they both work in the same firm apparently. 

He told me nothing happened in the club, and I found out before they could even meet, but I find it hard to believe. I don’t understand why he did what he did because we just moved in together a month ago and everything seemed going well for us. 

After this, I have downloaded hinge and was talking to some people which he found out and was t happy about. But it was more of revenge for me more than anything else like finding someone new. We have also slept together and currently still live together. I will be moving out soon but I can’t seem to move on from him or this situation. Any advice?",14,1747937729.0,makemychoice,17,0.82,False

1ksxrod,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ksxrod/im_m28_questioning_leaving_a_long_term/,Im M28 questioning leaving a long term relationship with F28,"Any advice on how to move on? 

I M28 have been with my gf F28 for roughly 10 years and I ended the relationship. So many positives about this relationship, get along, both fit in well with each families, grew up together, went to college together, very supportive, everything you would expect a relationship to have we had a lot of it. 

Where the issues started was when we moved in together (shocker right? Lol) at this point we were already together for 6ish years. We have different intimacy levels me being on the high end and her on the low end. This is the area where the most improvement was I have to give credit. Communication issues, her saying she was fine when shes clearly not, I would at times either say things politely or abruptly issues and she would just shut down and not communicate only thing she would say is “i dont know”. Something she admits she always has done. We are both messy people, where I wanted/was changing that on my end. She never had an issues, dirty plates and cups all over the place, Something I never did. Stacks of clothes in her hamper almost touching the ceiling, leaving wet clothes in the washing machine for days then when I would go and do mine I am met with funky funk smell. Her car had trash and empty coffee cups shoved in the side of the door and back seat filled with boxes and junk from her job. Everytime I got in she had to move trash of the passenger seat so I could sit down. Everywhere I went there was a mess. I unfortunately developed a “gotta be on her ass” about everything attitude for the years we lived together. I am an always on time person while she is a last min scrambling person which all this now I realized how/why my anxiety was always up in the place. She would say “im leaving at 4:45 from work” i would then start dinner. 5:30 comes along and she said just now leaving. This would happen all the time for years and I would get so frustrated I could not trust her time management. 

I absolutely contributed to some toxic behaviors which at the end I throughly and deeply talked about and apologized for. Somethings Im having a hard time forgiving myself. When she did something wrong her “apologies “ we given with and eye roll and a huff and puff. She said I was not future oriented but I told her all these issues how can you bring a kid into this? When we cant keep up with ourselves? Her spending was an issue too while im a saver. 

Reading this the answer is so obvious but when you have a long history together and loved each other, had fun and great times. Its hard to move on. A lot is fear of the unknown, fear if I made the right choice. I question it every day. She said she wanted to change and be better for years, knew what she needed to do but never did. I miss this person. Im sure “time heals all”.  Any advice how to move on? Especially from anyone who left a young long term relationship?

1ksxrgu,https://i.redd.it/1s7ybtg5kd2f1.png,I made some changes to my setup,"For those who saw my last photo of the setup, the setup wall was gray and the others were white, but I made a mistake and had to paint both of them white, which was paint I already had here. However, in the near future I will return it to gray, but in a lighter tone. I made this piece of furniture to place the coffee maker at the bottom of the table, Before, it was on the back of my chair and that sometimes got in the way a bit, so I decided to put it below the table so it's easier to make a coffee after a break from gaming or work. I changed the keyboard, sold my Logitech Pro X60 and got this EPOMAKER tide65, painted its frame matte black and changed the keycaps apart from the switches. I also changed the mousepad Extended from ROG and I got this Logitech G240, I removed the Logitech logo to make it cleaner. I hope you like this result. And with that you have more ideas if your setup is in a small room. ",49,1747937684.0,Minimal_Setups,4,0.99,False
