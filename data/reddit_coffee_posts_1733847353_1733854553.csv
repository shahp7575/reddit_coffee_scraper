This is probably going to sound like such a dumb question, but I want to be sure I'm getting my husband the right thing for home his espresso setup. His thing is iced mochas, so I want to get him a quality chocolate syrup. His favorite coffee shop uses ghirardelli, but when i look online to buy some, it all says 'chocolate sauce'. Is this the same thing as syrups for coffee? ",1,1733854219.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1hb82z4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hb82z4,“Modern” Apartment Design Help,"Hey everyone!

Here are some photos of our space as it stands. Ultimately I’m feeling a bit lost on a handful of things and would love your input. 

General Likes: We’re after that mid-century, modern, eclectic style that I know is probably overdone. Warm tones (especially with landlord gray floors and all white paint) are a big thing for us and we HATE the big light

Living Room: I feel like the couch may be too big, but it has to stay. Needing some help with rug ideas (how it should look, style recommendations, etc (and no shag/high pile since we’ve got cats). A proper coffee table would be nice, but I’m worried about how to fit one. Would also love some ideas about what to do with the wall behind the couch. Gallery wall? 3 big pieces? We’d also like some ideas for more lighting, but ultimately we’re a bit short on space. Christmas decor is not permanent either. 

Kitchen: Any ideas would be great. Would love to get some under-cabinet lighting eventually. Picture of the trees on the island doesn’t need to stay / can be moved. 

Bedroom: This is our least-decorated space. We’re getting a light brown duvet to replace the Walmart grey comforter already. The Bedframe has to stay for now (but can change eventually), and we’re getting matching nightstands eventually (lighter wood, rattan front). Would love some ideas for wall art above the bed and wherever else. You think the space needs. Could replace media console if needed, too. 

Office: we feel pretty good here, but any ideas are welcome!

Bathrooms: Both bathrooms feel good to us as they are. We’d love lamp ideas because the mirror light is too bright (and cool in temp) to leave on when it’s evening, but candles are too dim. Any ideas or recommendations are welcome !!

That just about covers it. Thank you all so much!! I can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with, thank you so so much!",1,1733854176.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

WOW (and a few first thoughts / questions),"It took me a while to win over the wife who wanted none of this wheel business in our house, but she finally let me get in on the fun. After considering many options, I settled on Fanatec's system, despite having never really tried one before. What attracted me was the ability to use a wheel on all platforms (I am a cross console gamer) and the constant recommendations I could read about the difference with the more standard, cheaper models. 

So I went ahead a purchased a Grant Turismo DD 8nm (thank you Black Friday!) alongside a ClubSport Formula V2.5 X and a load cell pedal system.

Despite reading about it all, I wasn't ready for how amazing the experience is. I've only played GT7 so far (planning to get some Forza 7 and F1 24 action next), and my set up is really rudimentary (playing on a coffee table, from the couch - I know...) but DAMN! 

The force feedback is so strong with some cars of the fastest cars, I feel like I'm fighting my wheel in some corners and can definitely feel my shoulders/trapezoids after an hour of racing. The level of feedback in the wheel is just something else, and I want to do nothing else than switch on and race. I'm completely rediscovering my game so far - I have to give credit to Sony who allow this wheel to be as compatible as possible with the platform (eg the LEDs work and most of the buttons are mapped, unlike Xbox). 

Some things I've observed:

- it is taking me a while to get used to the load cell break. A lot less physical feedback here than I expected, but I'm already sensing the difference after a handful of hours of play. I do wish it was a little more loose with my set up as it's hard to press sitting on the couch (and with the pedals on a carpet, allowing to slide more easily). I've found some hacks to keep the pedals in position at least, and I can sense that it'll require me a few more hours. But I may purchase an alternative resistance for the kit - I'm just a little intimidated by removing the current one, apparently it's not super easy. I do wish Fanatec offered different options at purchase though, this one feels overly stiff.

- I'm curious how people typically use their pedal. Personally I'm finding using only my right foot for both acceleration and breaking works much better, like I would on a normal car, but I've seen a few people using alternate ones (I don't use the clutch). This also pushes me to keep the clutch pedal for balance, even if I don't use it.

- because of my living room set up, I need to tidy up and put everything back hidden from view when I switch off. I am a little worried about connectors getting overused though. I found a way to keep the power plug plugged in at all times, and only needing to switch the USB when switching platforms (which is fairly rare so far as I tend to focus on one game at a time). But the pedals have to be disconnected every time. If anyone has advice on this, I'd be curious.

- regarding the alcantara handles, I've read a few people saying they need to use gloves to preserve the texture. Personally I've not experienced much wear and tear on alcantara wheels in my cars, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad, but curious what others have experienced? (I adore the build quality of this wheel btw, it's absolutely stunning - I'm really glad I went for that upgrade instead of the based Gran Turismo wheel, or even the McLaren).

All this to say, I'm in love and once you go DD, I can't imagine myself ever going back! It was pricey but worth every penny.",1,1733853922.0,Fanatec,0,1.0,False
1hb7z7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hb7z7n/vs1_diamonds_key_notes_and_expert_tips_for/,VS1 Diamonds: Key Notes and Expert Tips for Diamond Buyers,"VS1 diamonds represent the clarity threshold where visual perfection becomes virtually guaranteed, with a 99% eye-clean rate across all sizes under 2 carats. Market analysis shows that these diamonds command a 10-20% premium over VS2 grades while selling for 10-30% less than VVS2, positioning them at an optimal intersection of quality and value.

A good 1.00 carat with G color and VS1 clarity is sold for $4,700, while a VS2 is sold for $3,800, around a 20% difference. For a VVS2, we’ll need to pay around $5,200 for a good diamond, which is a 10% difference that gives you the same visual as the naked eye. Alternatively, we can invest the same money on a VS1 with a better cut that shows stronger brilliance and sparkles.

This premium guide provides sophisticated strategies for navigating the VS1 market, including investment considerations, shape-specific value analysis, and expert methodologies for maximizing returns in this guaranteed-excellence clarity grade.

# Bottom Line

VS1 diamonds offer an excellent balance of quality and value for most buyers. Here's what you need to know:

* Eye-clean appearance: Most VS1 diamonds have no visible inclusions to the naked eye, especially in sizes under 2 carats. Choosing a VS1 can help you have the peace of mind that you’ll get a clean diamond with no visible flaws.
* Cost-effective choice: Significantly cheaper than higher clarity grades (VVS, IF) while maintaining a flawless look.
* Versatile option: Suitable for various jewelry types and diamond shapes.
* Cut matters: A well-cut VS1 diamond can mask minor inclusions effectively, hiding the inclusions under the sparkles of the diamond.
* Recommended Vendors: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

* Buyers who prioritize the prestige of owning the highest clarity grades

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Excellent value for money
* Eye-clean in most cases
* Wide availability in various shapes and sizes
* High brilliance and sparkle potential

Cons:

* May show inclusions in larger sizes
* Not as rare as higher clarity grades

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: A well-cut VS1 diamond will outperform a poorly cut higher clarity diamond.
2. Use high-quality images: Shop from retailers offering 360° videos and 20x magnification.
3. Consider shape: Brilliant cuts (round, oval) hide inclusions better than step cuts (emerald, asscher).

1. Check for eye-cleanliness: Ensure the specific VS1 diamond you're considering is eye-clean.
2. Compare prices: VS1 prices can vary widely. Shop around for the best value.
3. Get certified: Always buy a diamond with a reputable lab certificate (GIA, AGS).

# FAQ

Q: What does VS1 mean?  
A: VS1 stands for ""Very Slightly Included 1"". It's a clarity grade indicating minor inclusions difficult to see under 10x magnification.

Q: Are all VS1 diamonds eye-clean?  
A: Most VS1 diamonds are eye-clean, especially under 2 carats. However, always check specific diamonds.

Q: How much can I save choosing VS1 over VVS?  
A: Savings can be significant, often 10-20% or more, depending on other factors.

Q: Is VS1 good enough for an engagement ring?  
A: Yes, VS1 is an excellent choice for engagement rings, offering a balance of quality and value.

Q: Can I see the difference between VS1 and Flawless diamonds?  
A: Generally, no. To the naked eye, a well-cut VS1 diamond will look identical to a Flawless diamond.

Remember, while VS1 diamonds offer great value, always consider the specific stone and your priorities when making a purchase.

I admittedly haven’t always been the best about maintenance and cleaning, and despite this, it never let me down with daily use.

Until this morning.

When trying to brew, I got the dreaded two orange blinks before returning to solid white and refusing to brew. I descaled it. I ran 4 cleaning cycles with just water. I cleaned meticulously and made sure the top part could spin and wasn’t stuck (it wasn’t stuck to begin with). I used cotton swabs to clean around the pod holder part. No dice. After about an hour of effort, I made 4 attempts to brew, wasted 4 pods, and gave up and drove to Starbucks.

I feel pretty fortunate that I even got 5 years out of this machine, but I definitely won’t be replacing it with another Vertuo Next. I’m leaning towards Pop+, though the Plus seems to have its pros as well. I have a ton of Vertuo pods (recently ordered 90 more on a Woot! deal) and occasionally brew 7.77 coffees, so I won’t be going OL.

From something as simple as enjoying a new book, getting news that my lease renewal will include a very small rent increase (as opposed to a gigantic, unaffordable one), going on a trip last minute with coworkers to volunteer on a really interesting project, etc., I suddenly feel really anxious and sick like something bad is going to happen. 

I've also been extremely attached to my therapist for over a year, and the last few days I haven't been feeling the longing I'm used to feeling. It's almost like things going well makes me feel like my world is spinning out of control and will crash at some point.

One example I keep going back to is that I have to get a repair done on my bathtub, and I'm too scared to tell my landlord because I'm afraid of getting into trouble. I'm a 32 year old woman. I have money in savings so that even if I have to pay for a repair, it's fine. (the issue is that part of the coating on the tub is peeling).

i come from a very strict family. half chinese ako, dad ko lang yung pure chinese but my mom is the stereotypical ""nakaahon sa hirap"" na pilipina. i experienced both the low and high life. imagine how hard my life was as the only ""impure"" chinese child in a very traditional family. 

this year, i am being forced in a marriage with someone who's twice my age. for context, i am 20 years old. i have plans of going to law school. i am a consistent honor student. charming with good physique. in short, the perfect trophy wife. 

i have no prejudice whatsoever for the huge age difference in relationships (unless pedophile) but this guy really is beyond my imagination. 

don't get me wrong, i gave him a chance to prove himself. but he was just utterly disgusting. he'd ask me out to go on clubs (not even a coffee date), he'd send photos of his lap with the caption, ""waiting for you"", and would often say dirty jokes which in his *defense* were just purely for fun. there was a time na he told me, ""if i could just marry u and turn u into a gold statue, i'd have unlimited bragging rights"". my insides wanted to pop. 🙂 

i feel so hopeless. i tried everything with my family but they just won't hear me out. i have so much ahead of me & i really can't afford to lose all that just to satisfy someone's greed.

kung sino pa yung inexpect ko na makakatulong sakin. it sucks to hear words such as ""just give in, you can never live a different lifestyle"". it made me realize how they only treated me good bc i was a convenience for them.

I step out of the shower feeling refreshed. The hot water felt amazing and I ended up spending a bit more time under its flow than I had intended. To be honest, I had lost all track of time until I heard my pad begin to chime from the bathroom counter. Well not quite chime actually it was a sound collage of animals and insects from around Grampy’s ranch: crickets, sheep, ducks, geese, chickens, alpacas, and an elk at the end. I flipped the water off and stepped out of the shower to press the speaker button and was immediately greeted by the deep, gruff, and warm voice of my grandfather which called to mind the smell of bourbon and cigars as always.

“So your pad ain’t broke then,” He immediately remarked plaintively

I felt a half second of confusion before it dawned on me that I had promised to call him as soon as the shuttle touched down. I winced as a lance of guilt speared my heart, knowing all too well that he had probably waited up by his pad for hours, “Hello, Grampy. I just woke up and got out of the shower,” I told him in an apologetic tone, “A lot of things happened pretty quick yesterday and I lost all track of what I was supposed to be doing, I’m sorry.”

“Hmph,” The old man gave a huff of annoyance before begrudgingly asking, “where they good things at least?”

“uh\~ yeah,” I replied, smiling as I ran back through everything that had happened the previous evening.

“Really?”

I chuckled at the disbelief in his voice, “Yes, Grampy,” I giggled a confirmation as I thought back to how embarrassed Tolva had looked that morning.

“Well… Then I suppose I can forgive you,” the old man remarked with an almost begrudging sigh, but I could recognize the underlying happiness in his voice quite clearly, “So this… friend of yours, he’s treating you right?”

I laughed at that. The very idea of Tolva doing anything else seemed absurd even though we had only known each other in-person for less than a day, “That he most certainly is. He’s so, so sweet, Grampy. He spent weeks putting himself through a homemade- uh, what do they call it? Conditioned Fear Response Deprogramming? Just so that I wouldn’t have to have fear be the first thing I saw on his face when we met,”

That got a chuckle from Grampy, “Hmm… Well I still have my doubts about them leaf lickers, but that boy sounds like he might just have his head on straight after all,”

“Grampy, I promise you he’s wonderful,” I insisted with another giggle as I toweled off

That got a much more suspicious sounding, “Hrmmm,” out of the old man followed swiftly by an even more suspicious, “Not *too* wonderful, I hope?”

I laughed at that, having to cover my mouth to avoid snorting as I giggled, “GRAMPY! NO! Nothing like that!”

“There better not be,” He replied in a stern voice

“Grampy, I’ve only been here for less than a day! How *easy* do you think your granddaughter is?” I demanded teasingly

The old man sputtered a moment at that, “Well, I just need to be sure of these things,”

“Ok, Grampy” I laughed as I got slipped on a black and gray sports top followed by a matching pair of shorts that came to just above my knees

“Anyway, I called you let you know that I sent you a few things I noticed that you had missed when you were packing,” Grampy informed me matter-of-factly after clearing his throat

“Aww, thank you, Grampy! You’re the best!” I replied happily as I tied my hair up in a ponytail

“Hehe, well I’d better be after sticking around this long,” He played it off coolly, but I know that it meant the world to him when me and my big sis said things like that, “Anyway, I’ll let you get back to it, but make sure you call me tonight!”

“I will, Grampy. Love you,”

“I love you too Sweet Pea, bye-bye now,”

“Bye-bye, Grampy” I replied sweetly as I pressed end call. I stood there for a moment with a small smile on my face and a warm, happy feeling in my chest. Hearing from Grampy always reminded me just how blessed I was to have him.

I took one last look over myself to make sure I hadn’t missed anything before grabbing my bag off the floor and slinging over my shoulder as I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, pad in hand.

“Alright Tolva, I’m do-” I stopped mid sentence as I found the black Venlil looking very sheepish *(hehe)* in the midst of a call of his own.

“I TRIED CALLING YOU 34 TIMES YOU BIG DUMB, STUPID, SPEH HEAD! I DON’T CARE IF YOU ‘ACCIDENTALLY TURNED YOUR PAD ON SILENT’, HOW COULD YOU NOT THINK TO CALL ME!?”

I bit my lip and spun on my heel heading back down the hall as I heard what I’m pretty sure was Helin verbally tearing Tolva into a little pieces

“I THOUGHT YOU DIED! I THOUGHT IT ATE YOU- YOU- YOU-”

I opened the door at the far end of the hall and stepped inside quickly as I heard Helin’s voice breakdown into what sounded a lot like sobbing. I closed the door behind me and let out a low whistle as I looked around the bedroom I found myself standing in.

*RIP, Tolva. RIP.*

The room was a decent size, to the right and centered under a window was a nice big bed that had just enough room around its sides for me to walk around it comfortably. Straight ahead of me was an appropriately sized vanity and I found myself questioning where all of this otherwise over-sized furniture had come from.

*Was this also made for Arxur? Do… Do Arxur need vanities?*

I giggled as the image of a crocodile wearing lipstick intruded into my mind unbidden and I shook my head to rid myself of it.

I saw that there was a closet to my right and I walked up to it and opened it up. It was empty save for a number of hangars, as I suspected it would be, but it was a pretty good size and I was sure I’d have no problems at all getting all my clothes in it. In fact, why don’t I do that right now.

I spent a few minutes hanging up all my clothes and as the warmth from the shower faded away I went ahead and threw on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt over what I was already wearing.

Clothes put away, I turned my attention to the bed. I walked up to it and pressed down on it experimentally before flopping face first onto it.

*Mmmm… comfy.*

It was a delight to find that it was just the perfect firmness for me.

I laid on my belly with my arms out at my side for a few minutes before rolling over onto my back and lifting my pad up to kill a few minutes browsing the net. I scrolled idly through a plethora of videos, none particularly catching my eye until I spotted a “Venlil carrot reactions” compilation.

*What? Carrots?*

I tapped the video curiously, I just couldn’t imagine what would be so interesting about a Venlil reacting to trying a carrot for the first time. Was it especially tasty to them?

As the video played I became increasingly confused. None of the clips even went long enough to show them actually *trying* the carrot but yet every single one of them fell over backwards, turning just as orange as the carrot, when it was unexpectedly held out for them or placed upon a plate.

*The fuck? Ok, I gotta know what this is about. Hm? Oh, comments are disabled. Ok, let’s search Venlil Carrots. Wha? Disable safe search to see results??? Ok, what the fuck is this?*

I frowned and pulled up a picture of a carrot on my pad and headed towards the living room.

Thankfully, Tolva had already finished his conversation with his sister and was just sitting there with a slightly downcast expression.

“Are you ok, buddy?” I asked with concern as I gently placed a hand on his shoulder

“Apart from hurting all over and feeling like a terrible brother?” He asked with a heavy sigh, “Yeah, I’m fine,”

“Do you want me to bring you somewhere? To see Helin or-”

“No, no. She’s at work again today. She works pretty much all day when Phyli and Gylen aren’t home.” He explained, sounding a little down.

“Well uh… hmm… is there... anything I can do for you to make you more comfortable?”

Tolva gave a weak smile and shook his head, “nope, I’m fine. Uh, the food was great by the way. Thank you” he blushed a little and I smiled as I flicked my eye to the large stack of empty wrappers and the quarter empty cider jug sitting on the coffee table.

“I See… Say, can I ask you something kind of weird?”

He tilted his head and looked up at me curiously, “uh, I guess?”

“So have you heard of a carrot?”

“The translator tells me it’s a vegetable,” Tolva remarked with a small hint of confusion, “Why?”

“Well, I was wondering what you thought about them?”

Tolva shrugged “I’ve never had nor seen one… wh-why?”

I held up my pad and turned the screen towards him and he immediately went wide eyed and orange as can be, even jumping back a little and falling across the couch with apparent shock, “Br-brahk, WHAT THE SPEH, ELANOR!?”

I myself jumped a little at his completely unexpected and inexplicable reaction. I quickly turned the screen back towards myself to make sure I hadn’t somehow flicked onto some old hunting photo, but nope, it was still just a carrot sitting on a plate.

“Wh-what? What’s wrong?” I asked with both worry and confusion as I looked it up and down twice over, “It’s just a carrot, what’s so scary about it?” I was now feeling kind of bad but I didn’t understand at all what was wrong.

“THAT’S A CARROT?!?!” Tolva demanded with disbelief.

I turned the screen back towards him with a confused expression, “y-yeah?”

He slowly sat back up straight, wincing and holding his midsection as he did so before scrutinizing the photo with a deep frown which slowly faded away before he finally gave a deep, very, very relieved sigh, “O-oh… I… I see, it’s… it’s just a tuber”

“Tolva, what- eh, what was that all about?” I asked as he calmed himself before explaining, “I saw a video of people show their Venlil friends carrots and they all reacted really strongly but I didn’t under stand why so I wanted to ask you. I still don’t understand what’s wrong with carrots,”

Tolva nodded slowly, turning more orange than I had ever seen. So orange I wondered if maybe he might be having problems with his blood pressure, “It… It looks like… uh… erm…” he sputtered and hesitated as he tried and failed to explain himself, “it uh… well… it… at first glance it looks like… uh, that is… it resembles a… a certain part of a male Venlil,”

My eyes went wide as I looked backed at the picture of the carrot and he bleated loudly, “DON’T LOOK AT IT SO CLOSELY AFTER I SAID THAT!” he shouted frantically and looked like would keel over of pure embarrassment any second.

Well now I certainly understood and felt just awful for having done that. He must have thought I was showing him a freshly harvested Venlil pizzle! Oh god, those poor Venlil who suddenly had one dropped on their plate with no warning! That’s so cruel!

I felt my face go red and I quickly closed the picture, covering my face with my free hand as I groaned with embarrassment, “I’m so sorry, Tolva! I-I didn’t realize! God, I-I had no idea!”

He took a few steadying breaths as he also had his face buried in his paws, “Stars, I-I thought… Brahk, wh-who makes a tuber that looks like that!”

I shook my head and took a deep breath of my own, “God, I… sheesh, I’m sorry. I- oh…” I frowned and murmured, “I guess that explains why searching ‘Venlil Carrot’ asked me to disable safe search to continue,”

“OH STARS, ELANORSTOPPLEASEIBEGYOU!” Tolva pleaded with a whining bleat.

“R-right, sorry.” I mumbled, turning red as beet as I grabbed my bag off the floor.

I set the bag on the coffee table and sat down the couch cushion on the far end from where Tolva was and dug out a plastic half-gallon thermos and gave it a vigorous shake before popping the cap off and quickly chugging down the contents in one go. It was… unpleasant to the say the least. Grainy, thick, gritty, almost sandy even in a strange and very unpalatable way. It tasted vaguely nutty with the small hint of the cinnamon I added to it making it ever so slightly more palatable.

“What… what was that?” Tolva asked hesitantly as he peeked out from behind his paws.

I lowered the thermos and looked over at him and saw he was wearing a look that seemed to be equal parts curiosity and concern and was still very much a distinct shade of orange.

“Breakfast,” I told him with a chuckle, “It tastes… god awful, not going to lie. Terrible taste, worse texture. *But* it’s the best way for me to get the stupid amount of nutrients my body needs.”

“I… I see,” He murmured skeptically, “and that’s… your whole breakfast?”

“Uh, yeah. Pretty much,” I replied with a shrug, “I get it out of the way first thing in the morning,”

Tolva made slight ‘hmm’ adjacent sort of sound that I’m pretty sure meant dissatisfaction, but he didn’t raise any further objections.

I couldn’t help but smile a little at his clear discontent with the quality of my breakfast. It reminded me of Grampy who had likewise voiced no end of complains since I had started making terrible protein and vitamin smoothies my breakfast a few years ago. I scooted down the couch a little closer to him and very gently reached over and patted his head, “so,” I began with a smile, “you said that you wanted to hang out and watch movies, right?”

Tolva visibly perked up hearing this, even trying to sit up a little straighter though that was abandoned following a pained wince, “Yes! I watched all the movies you sent me and I loved them all! Which one did you want to watch?”

I blushed a little and fidgeted, “well… I… uh… I was thinking about how you said that you wanted to try hiking, right?”

Tolva nodded with a curious tilt of his ears

“Well\~” I tapped a few things on my pad and the large TV screen across from us blinked to life with a view down a very familiar forest trail.

“Hello, Tolva!” I flinched as I heard my own cheery voice come through the set’s Speakers rather suddenly.

“Neliv said that I could only send ‘UN approved video media’ to you, so that means that if you’re watching this then I didn’t chicken out at the last second and tell the shuttle pilot to turn around, good job me!”

Tolva’s right ear flicked back and forth between slightly pointing forward towards the TV set and angling right in my direction. I realized that this was the Venlil equivalent of him looking back and forth between me and the set and the look of wonder I saw on his features made my face grow warm with fresh embarrassment.

“Anyway! Time for the big reveal!” The perspective of the camera turned to the right and looked down over a vast green valley nestled between tall rolling, rocky hills that quickly ascend to the base of mountains. At the center of this valley was a huge three story lodge-style home that could only be described as a rustic mansion, “This is Grampy’s Farm! Specifically this is the Montana ranch. It’s the place I spent most of my childhood,”

Tolva’s rectangular pupils became almost square as his bugged a little at what he was seeing, “That’s… that’s all your grandfather’s!?”

I nodded, blushing furiously, “y-yeah, It’s -”

I was cut off by my own insufferably joyful voice with a well memorized explanation, “It’s 15,000 acres, 10,500 of which were purchased by my great grandfather when the state put the land up for auction to cover a budget deficit in 2034! He outbid everyone because he didn’t want this beautiful nature to be disturbed for the sake of making some awful resort or making it into some kind of ultra-wealthy mansion neighborhood. The original 4,500 acres, which is the grassy valley you see down there with the actual house on it, has been in my family since 1807!”

“W-wait then, if that valley is only 4,500\~” Tolva actually turned his head slightly towards me as he opened and closed his mouth a few times to try and find the words to express his thoughts, but seemed to fail utterly.

“Anyway, I wanna take you on a trip through my favorite trail so let’s go!”

Tolva watched with rapt attention as the home video took us through a long trail that wound through the forest before breaking through onto a rocky hillside at the base of one of the mountains which surrounded the valley giving us a wonderful view over the forest before the trail dipped back into it. In the video I stopped periodically to talk about the things around me, wild berries, different kinds of trees, animals I saw and the tracks and markings left behind by animals that had come through before me.

“A Zurullan?” Tolva wondered curiously, “What’s one doing out-”

“You might think that’s a Zurullian,” I interrupted on the TV, now making me blush as I realized I had mispronounced the species’ name, “Well let’s start by backing off a bit more first… ok, so that’s a Brown Bear cub. And where there’s a cub, there’s almost definitely a mama bear nearby and we most assuredly *don’t* want her to think I’m a threat to baby bear.”

“Brown Bears can vary quite a bit in size, but I’m pretty sure that’s a Grizzly. We can expect mama to be in the ballpark of 300lbs and they can be up to 8 feet tall when they rear up on their hind legs,” I giggled in the video, “That might not sound like much on paper compared to me, but they have 3 inch claws and run up to 35 miles per hour! They are also incredibly strong and powerful creatures so- oh! There she is, there’s mama! I’m going to step back a little more and wait for them to clear the trail.”

Tolva gasped as the huge mass of brown fur lumbered out of the woods and sniffed around the ground and the air, looking around for any signs of trouble. The little black Venlil trembled and shook, going still as he could in the tense moments before the bear and her cub wandered off of the trail and disappeared into the trees again.

I paused the video with an amused smile as Tolva let out the breath he was holding with a paw placed over his chest, “That… that was… was…”

I giggled, “Beautiful? Terrifying? Majestic?” I suggested

“Y-yeah,” he muttered as he took a few more deep breaths to calm himself

I patted his head reassuringly, “good thing it’s just a video, right?”

“Y-yeah,” he murmured, turning a dull shade of orange, “h-how were you not scared?”

“Oh I’ve been in similar situations before,” I explained, looking back towards the still image of the trail, “I knew that as long as I kept my distance, I wasn’t really in any danger. Though, it does help that I was armed in that video,” I added with a chuckle

Tolva nodded slowly, “I-I guess that makes sense,” he said a little quietly as his thoughts seemed to wander somewhere.

Before I could ask what he was thinking about there was a \*Bing-bong\* from the entryway which drew my attention with a little surprise, “uh- oh! I bet it’s rest of my stuff!”

I stood and took a step towards the door but was stopped by a hasty bleat from Tolva, “W-wait, your mask!”

“Oh! Right,” I blushed as I looked around for it a moment before I turned and spotted it on the coffee table.

Once I had it firmly affixed to my face I continued to the door and looked at the little video screen next to it. I was a little surprised to find that it wasn’t a Venlil that was waiting for me but Thomas.

“A mechanic, greeter, and delivery man?” I asked with a smile as I opened the door.

He laughed and nodded, “Yep! Well, at least for the heavy stuff anyway,” He chuckled, “Guess that’s the one good thing about having a human around that everyone seems to agree on,”

I noticed then that he was wearing an exoskeleton: a bright orange and yellow apparatus that consisted of worn braces connected by broad but flat metal bars that hugged the outside of his arms and legs with powered servos at the ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, and elbows. I recognized the model immediately as it was manufactured by OuterLift – a company which happened to be owned by my family.

“Just… just how heavy is it?” I felt a small twinge of confusion and concern as I had no idea what among my things could possibly be so heavy to warrant something like that.

“How heavy? Too damn heavy!” Thomas laughed as he thumbed over his shoulder at a box truck parked on the street, “From the manifest it looks like pretty much an entire home gym plus your stuff from the station and bunch of stuff from earth,”

“A… Gym? Stuff from- oh! It must be from Grampy!” I chuckled, “I guess that makes sense, but uh… gimmie a moment to try and figure out where all that will go, yeah?”

“Take your time,” Thomas chuckled, “I got plenty of my own to spare!”

I chuckled too and gently let the door close before hurrying down the hall. I checked the first door on the left and discovered another bedroom which was similar to the one at the end of the all albeit with much more ‘normal’ sized furniture. Checking the second one I found a carpeted room which was empty save for a standing lamp in the far corner. Perfect.

I hurried back to the front door and over the next twenty minutes or so me and Thomas got all of the stuff from the truck unloaded. He certainly wasn’t joking about the amount of stuff, it really was entire brand new home gym and then some. As we wrapped up I offered him a glass of water which he graciously accepted, taking a moment to look around as we both stood with our masks off.

He was actually pretty handsome in a very… square sort of way. Square jaw, square cheeks, square brow, and a square nose. But it was well proportioned and his hazel eyes were complimented by the light tan of his freckled face which was only broken by a thin light line across his upper nose which appeared to be an old scar.

“Well, certainly looks like you got better digs than I did,” he joked before he noticed Tolva sitting on the couch and paused slightly with a surprised look, “So… did he come with the place or is he something you brought from home?”

Tolva blushed a deep orange, “Hello, Mr. Thomas.”

“Hey, Tolva. I never would have guessed that *you* were the Venlil that Elanor was here to see,” he laughed before nodding to me, “You’ve certainly got a good taste in friends, Elanor. I’m a little jealous,”

“Well too bad, you can’t have him,” I teased, sticking my tongue out at him

“Darn, guess I’ll have to keep shopping around,” He laughed.

Our banter about him made Tolva grow a deep orange and he fidgeted bashfully as both Me and Thomas giggled.

“Oh yeah, your new pad still working alright, Tolva?” Thomas asked with a curious tilt of his head.

Tolva nodded, “Yes sir, Mr. Thomas.” He replied, “Thank you for helping me order that, Dema was having a hard time getting it in through his usual suppliers.”

“Dema?” I asked curiously

Thomas nodded, “Yep, probably one of the friendliest little Venlil you’ll meet here. Apparently he came in as the IT support for the local exterminator’s guild, but to my understanding he pretty quickly became the town’s ‘tech guy’ even before the guild went belly up. Now he runs an electronics shop. Pretty much the one-stop-shop for the colony’s tech needs.”

“I… wouldn’t have thought a former exterminator would be friendly,” I remarked thoughtfully, “But that’s good to know,”

Thomas chuckled, “I never would have guessed it either, but he’s a good sort,” He then downed the glass of water I had offered him and set the empty glass on the counter before putting his mask back on, “welp, I gotta get going. It was good talking to you again Elanor, and good seeing you Tolva! Oh, Make sure you give your sister a call later, ok? Poor thing has been absolutely out of sorts today.”

Tolva’s ears drooped and he turned a little orange again, “I-I will,”

He laughed as he walked to the door, “There’s a good lad! Anyway, I’m off, bye!”

I waved goodbye as I closed the door behind him and turned back to Tolva, “Well, I’m going to go look at what my Grampy sent and then I’ll be right back and we resume where left off, ok?”

Tolva perked up, “Ok!”

I quickly located the box that I had set aside, it was long and rectangular, perhaps six feet long and two feet wide with a gray plastic exterior held shut by four latches and a padlock. I looked the padlock over and smiled as I saw a sticker depicting a Sweat Pea on the back of it. I quickly spun the dial this way and that as I entered my birthday and the lock popped open with a click.

I flipped the latches and opened the lid to reveal a number of smaller boxes inside. One I recognized right away, a cylindrical package containing my hat which I had quite genuinely forgotten on the front counter when I had left for the spaceport. I opened it up and smiled as I pulled out the chocolate brown Stetson Sturgis. It was a well worn but beautiful hat my great grandfather had bought me shortly before he passed when I was only seven and I had countless fond memories wearing it.

I opened up the next box curiously and immediately felt my face go beet red.

*Really Grampy?*

Both of the Venpals I had purchased were inside: a Mini-Ven and a Venbig, both modeled after Tolva. I shook my head and giggled as I put lid back on that box and moved onto the next.

Snacks, treats, extra clothes, and all manner of other odds and ends were present, including an extra supply of the vitamin supplements I took to keep myself healthy without having to pig out on massive meals everyday.

Grampy’s thoughtfulness always made me smile and his chronic over-preparedness made me chuckle a little. I opened the last box and instantly my good mood was gone. Wide eyed, I snapped it shut and looked around to make sure no one else had seen.

*Oh my god, Grampy!*

I hastily dug out my pad and called Grampy.

“Sweet Pea? Is it already evening there? I know the days were short but-”

“GRAMPY!” I interrupted, “WH-WHY DID YOU SEND THAT!?”

“Mind your volume, young lady,” Grampy scorned with a scoff, “I already told you, I sent some things that you forgot,”

“I DIDN’T FORGET *THOSE* I LEFT THEM ON PURPOSE, YOU KNOW I CAN’T HAVE THEM HERE!” I shouted as I paced back and forth in a panic

“*Volume*, Sweet Pea,” Grampy repeated a little more forcefully and I took a deep breath to calm myself before continuing.

“Grampy, how did you even get that through customs!? You’re going to get me in so, so much trouble!”

“Ha! Have some faith your Grampy’s wiles,” The old man chuckled, “I did some talking with that Neliv fellow and had some arrangements made”

“Neliv agreed to- ugh,” I groaned and leaned against the wall, rubbing my temples with my free hand, “Ok, ok… If Neliv agreed I guess I can figure out… something.”

“I hardly see what the problem is, dear. You need to be safe,”

“The problem is that these Venlil here aren’t like the SC representatives you’ve met, Grampy! Most of of them have only ever seen at most one human, and he’s… well, a very personable sort. We’re still scary predators to them!”

“pah, all the more reason for you to protect yourself,” Grampy remarked dismissively, before his voice took on a harder edge, “I swear to the heavens if one them flamethrower wielding maniacs crawls out of some gutter to try and roast you, you’d better put them down or so help me I’ll see that colony strangled!”

“Grampy\~” I whined before giving a heavy sigh. I knew it was pointless to argue about this with him so I just begrudgingly let it go for now.

“I just want you to be safe, Sweet Pea,” Grampy insisted forcefully

“I know, Grampy. I appreciate it,” I sighed again and shook my head. I was about to say goodbye when a thought occurred to me, “Hey Grampy, OuterLift makes medical exoskeletons too, right?”

“Well technically no,” The old man replied thoughtfully, “There was a model intended to aid people with disabilities in partaking in outdoor activities, but it was too niche and was discontinued perhaps five or six years ago, why?”

“Do you think it’d be possible to have a new one of those made, but adapted to a Venlil?” I asked curiously

“Wait, is this for that friend of yours?” Grampy asked suspiciously, “that’s a hell of a big request for someone you just met,”

“Grampy, he’s been a very good friend to me so far and… and he really wants to try hiking and camping but you remember what I said right? he’s got an especially weak body,” I pleaded

The old man chuckled warmly, “Well I’m proud of you for trying to help a friend. I’ll get their R&D on it,” He paused and thoughtfully added, “Depending on how it works out, maybe this could be a big hit with those knock-knees of theirs.”

I smiled broadly, “Thank you, Grampy,”

“You’re always welcome Sweet Pea. I’ll talk to you later now though, I gotta attend a few things. And don’t you think for a minute this covers your phone call before bed, little lady,”

I chuckled, “Of course, Grampy, I’ll talk to you later. Love you,”

“Love you to, Sweet Pea,”

I clicked the phone off and smiled for a few moments before another heavy groan settled in.

“Wh-what was that about?”

I jumped a little with a startled \*ah!\* which in turn made Tolva flinch with a \*Beep!\* of surprise.

Tolva took a half second to calm himself while he leaned against the door frame before sputtering, “S-sorry, I f-forgot that you uh-”

“Binocular vision, I know,” I chuckled with a shake of my head, “Sorry for scaring you,”

“What? No!” Tolva stiffened a little, “*I’m* sorry for scaring *you!*” he insisted.

“Well we’re both sorry for scaring each other, alright?”

Tolva blushed a little and nodded, “ok, I’ll settle for that,”

“So... what’s up?” I asked in an awkwardly forced sounding casual tone

“I- uh… I wanted to know that all the shouting was about. Just wanted to make sure everything was ok,” Tolva replied shyly

“I uh…” I hesitated as I debated whether or not to tell the truth.

*Trust your friends!*

*But-*

*Trust. Your. Friends!*

“Grampy… Grampy sent me one of my guns,” I said with a heavy sigh

“A GUN!?” Tolva exclaimed, jumping back a little. He immediately collapsed backwards against the wall of the hallway with a thunk as the shock from the tiny hop buckled his legs like wet little noodles.

“Tolva!” I gasped as I hurried forward. I knelt down and picked him, I didn’t even put him back on his feet, I just cradled him one arm like he was a baby as I used my other hand to gently pat the back of his head and make sure there was no blood. Between my fussing and the way I was holding him he went orange as… uh, an orange – and covered his face with his little paws.

“Are you ok?” I asked softly as I gently stroked the side of his head, his ears felt quite hot with how much blood was rushing to them.

“Y-Yes I’m f-fine,” He managed with a whine.

I considered setting him down, but I noticed the slight tensing and relaxing of the muscles just above his tail as he tried and failed to wag the appendage and just gave him a gentle smile instead, “You’re very warm,” I cooed softly

He blushed even more and kept his face hidden behind his paws, but he did lean into my shoulder a little, “You’re… very gentle,” he said quietly after a few moments

*Awww my gawd. I adore you so much! So cute! So sweet!*

I cleared my throat a little and gently nuzzled the top of his head, pausing a moment as a strange thought occurred to me, “you smell like corn chips,” I remarked

He looked up a little confused by my sudden observation, “I… do?”

“yep,” I confirmed as I nuzzled him again with a giggle, “And… sun baked soil.”

He tilted his head slightly, but I manged to dodge the raised ear this time, “Is that… good?”

“Yeah. You smell… hmm… comfy, I guess. Reminds me of a warm summer day,”

His ears stood straight up and he made a small, and I assume involuntary, \*beep!\* before he hid back behind his paws, “That’s so weird!” he whined though again I could feel his tail fighting to wag.

I giggled some more before drawing pensive, “So… you guys really have *no* sense of smell *at all*?”

He peeked up and nodded, “y-yeah. I mean, sometimes we can taste something in the air if its really strong – and some Venlil are a lot better at it than others – but we don’t have noses or anything.”

I thought about that for a second, “Then, hypothetically, if there was some kind of chemical spill or if… if a pup had a bit of an accident, how would you know?”

“Uh, pretty much every room has olfactory sensors. It’s part of the fire safety code,” Tolva explained, “light posts have them on them too,”

I nodded, “ah, so that’s how it works… good to know.”

“umm… Elanor?”

“Yes, Tolva?”

The little venlil in my arms seemed to hesitate a moment, “C-can I see it?”

I blinked dumbly a few times, “See… what?” I asked, feeling my face go a little red as I recalled the carrot incident.

“the… the gun?”

*Ah, right.*

I hesitated. This felt way too much like a small child asking to look at a gun but I knew that Tolva and I are the same age so… ugh, “I… I guess? Can I ask why?”

Tolva shrugged, “I’m just curious… I’ve never seen one. I know that the wildlife management officers have them, but I’ve never gotten a look at one,”

I nodded slowly and pensively as I debated a moment longer before walking over to the box in question and opened it up with my free hand.

“Whoah… it’s… it’s just like in the movies,” he muttered as he took in the nickle plated revolver which recessed into a bed of black foam to hold it in place. Along side it in the box was my hunting knife with a handle made from the antler of the very first elk I hunted. I was admittedly glad to see the knife as it was practically a security blanket for me, but I was also a little terrified to see the gun as I could only imagine would come of it getting out that I was armed. Especially if those ‘Predator Watch’ wackos found out.

“Can… can you do the thing? The spiny thing?”

The absurd question pulled me out of my thoughts and I laughed, “Yes, yes I can.” I said as I reached down and picked up the weapon. I opened the cylinder to ensure it was empty before gently closing it against my leg.

I spun the gun around my index finger forward then backwards then forwards again then I turned my wrist and spun it sideways before gently tossing it up in the air and catching it, spinning it backwards once more before depositing it into the box again.

“whoah,” Tolva let out a small bleat of wonder, the boxy pupil of his right eye felt like it was boring directly into my soul and I felt my face go warm as I blushed under his gaze.

“I uh… I do something called cowboy action shooting with my Grampy once a year,” I offered bashfully, as I suddenly felt very, very embarrassed by the whole thing from my showing off to the way I was holding Tolva and down just how close he was at the moment.

*I’m not… babying him, right?*

“That was so cool!” Tolva exclaimed suddenly with a happy bleat and a wiggle of his ears, “*You’re* so cool!”

I went even more red and he laughed.

I've been getting by with my old Barratza Virtuoso+ which was acceptable for espresso but didn't have fine enough tuning to really dial it in. I mainly drink my espresso with milk so it helps mask minor deficiencies.

I saw the terrible grinder that my parents were using and I ended up giving them my Virtuoso and buying myself an Encore ESP in hopes of getting my espresso a bit more dialed in. I am really struggling with this. All I get is absolutely terrible extremely bitter shots no matter what variable I change. I am using fresh beans from one of my favorite local roasters. It's the same beans they use to make some of the best espresso in their shop that I've ever had. Here are my notes:

* Anything lower than a 19 on the grinder just chokes the machine and I get maybe 1-2g out after 30+ seconds. The ""espresso range"" is supposed to max out at 20.
* Lowering the dosage doesn't seem to make much difference.
* One click up and it goes way too fast. One click down and it chokes. This is the same behavior I had on my old grinder.
* I've tried different tamping techniques and going significantly lighter seems to make little difference.
* I have a WDT tool and I use it.
* I have tried different temp settings and have not noticed much difference. 
* The last shot I just pulled yielded 36g out of 17g of coffee in 25 seconds. That's the closest I've gotten to the 1:2 target in \~30 seconds but it still tasted terribly bitter and would have been completely undrinkable without milk.

There has to be something I'm missing here. Any advice is appreciated.",1,1733852973.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We did, we had an amazing time, we slept together and she stayed for 24 hours. Now she is being distant. What is going on?

More detail - My ex and I have known each other for 4 years. For the first year we dated, for two we lived together and had as what I would can only describe as my dream relationship. She has told me she felt the same. Our last year we found ourselves in a terrible on-off again situation. She moved out after our first ""break up"" but about a month later we were sleeping together again which started a chain reaction of on for 3-4 weeks and then off for 3-4 weeks.

Finally we got together properly and and some consistency for about 4 months. We ended up having a really stupid argument, felt pretty disconnected for a couple weeks after and she called it off.

Ok I learned my lesson, this time I went straight into NC and said fine it isn't meant to be... even though deep down I love her almost unconditionally at this point and would still like to marry her if we could sort our shit out.

After 4 months of absolute NC, she reached out with a super random question about my dog. I responded politely but didn't push the convo. Over the next several days she pushed and pushed and eventually, I suggested we meet for a coffee.  She jumped on the opportunity and a couple days later we were on a date.

We both had an amazing time, re-connected and felt the spark which led us back home where we hooked up and spent the entire next day together cuddling.

Over the next few days she continued to reach out but the conversation started to slow and dry up. Now she has gone cold again. I am travelling over the next few weeks for work so I won't be able to suggest another meet up. What do I do next if I want her back? My hunch is to keep doing what I have been doing. I am convinced she is a fearful avoidant and I have heard they can do something called ""positive pullback"" when they feel confused. The best way to respond is by doing literally nothing.

Any advice is wanted!

P.S. - I already know that I should prob consider moving on and that this doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. I am in therapy and working on myself to navigate what is best for me. SO I am not looking for advice on leaving... more so advice on what to do with her if I'd like her back.",1,1733852903.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

","I broke up with my ex in April because he said he had too many responsibilities and couldn’t prioritize our relationship. He admitted that I didn’t deserve how he treated me in the final phase of our relationship and that he couldn’t give me the care and attention I deserved. The breakup left me heartbroken and miserable, especially since he acts cold when we meet each other at a coffee shop or in group settings with friends.

To heal, I decided to change my look and take a month-long trip. After returning, I meet him at a coffee shop by chance , and we ended up talking for hours. He complimented my new look and seemed much friendlier, even going out of his way to show he remembers small details about me. He buys me my favourite  sweets in any  occasions, looks at me the same way he did when we were together, and acts warm and attentive when we meet by chance or in group outings . Also , He seems jealous when I mention another guy's name and tries to make me feel jealous in return. He goes out of his way to stand out when I’m around in a group setting and often appears stressed. . However, he hasn’t mentioned anything about our past relationship or expressed his feelings directly.

His behavior is confusing : does he still have feelings for me but isn’t ready to express them because he’s dealing with challenges about his future , work and studies ? Or is he just trying to stay friendly to maintain harmony in our friend group?

I’m unsure how to act when we’re in the same place. I haven’t fully moved on, and being around him reminds me of the heartbreak and disappointment I felt when he left. Am I overthinking his actions, and is he just treating me as a friend? How should I handle myself when we’re in the same space?

By the way, some of our friends say he’s just being friendly, while others notice his actions and believe he still shows interest. What really makes me think he still has feelings are the way he looks at me. Am I being delusional? Is it possible to overthink and imagine things that aren’t there? i really need help ",1,1733852856.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Picture this: it’s dusk, and we’re wandering a quiet city street we’ve never seen before. The kind of place where cobblestones echo with stories and soft light spills from shuttered windows. There’s no set destination—just us, sharing thoughts, laughter, and half-serious dreams of what we’d do if this moment lasted forever. We stop at a little café, where the coffee is warm and the conversation is even warmer. The world feels infinite, but for now, it’s just the two of us—and that’s more than enough.

I’m here searching for someone who dreams of moments like these. Could that be you?

# About Me

I’m a quiet soul with a curious mind—a writer, future vinyl collector, and lover of golden hours. My passions range from creating playlists that feel like soundtracks to discovering hidden hiking trails and catching fleeting beauty with my camera.

I thrive on deep conversations, small joys, and moments that linger in your memory long after they’ve passed. While I enjoy solo pursuits like gaming or reading, my greatest happiness comes from shared experiences and meaningful connections.

I’m looking to start with friendship—something genuine and unforced, like the first chapter of a great story. Maybe it evolves into something more, but for now, I’d love to connect and see where the pages lead us.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who is kind, thoughtful, and curious—a woman who dreams big, appreciates life’s quirks, and values honesty. You don’t need to have it all figured out (who does?), but you should have a desire to share your world while exploring a new one together.

Whether it’s collaborating on a project, swapping music recommendations, or planning spontaneous adventures, I’m looking for a partner who is ready to dream, build, and laugh along the way.

# What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things—the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love or how the world feels quieter under a blanket of stars. Loyalty is my foundation. I show up for the big moments and the small ones, believing that consistency and care are the cornerstones of a great connection.

I’m also a romantic in the best way: someone who leaves sweet notes, remembers your favorite things, and turns ordinary days into something a little magical.

*If this resonates, let’s swap stories, playlists, or dreams. Whether it’s the start of a friendship or something more, let’s see where our chapter together takes us.*

Leaves me on read now since I left the job we both worked at.


Hey guys I just honestly want some advice. I feel like I’m making something out of nothing. 

I’m honestly a little nervous to post this cause I don’t know if he (let’s call him John 31M) is on here or if anyone I used to work with is on here. And I don’t want this to come back to him. 

I also want to state I have left the company that we both worked at over a month ago (found something else closer to home and higher pay) 

I thought this measly crush would go away as soon as I left but honestly I really miss him.  I’ve never had, in my opinion, a connection like I do with him. I could have a serious conversation and joke and banter with him so easily. I also never found him intimidating like everyone else we worked with. 

For context I should mention John is someone in  a high position. Basically overlooked the dept I worked in. 

Anyways on to the story 

I met John when I was hired on at my old company over a year ago. When I met him I didn’t think much of him. Honestly he wasn’t someone I would normally go for. But as time passed and we talked;  I grew to like him. We bonded over a game we both like to play and some places we had visited in the past and shared like for drinking coffee. 

I also think my other coworkers had a hand in me developing feeling for John. I’m normally a person who is clueless as hell if someone likes me, and I normally don’t notice it. 

Some of my coworkers would point out to me that as time passed and I grew more comfortable in my job and the work environment. That anytime John and I talked that we would always flirt and poke fun at each other. It was honestly something at first that I blew off thinking it was BS. But when my coworkers kept mentioning that we would do that or that John would check in with me more than anyone. I could also say things ( like call him out on things he promised to do and never did) and no one else would. Once I started thinking about it I  started to pay attention I guess a bit more. 

I did start to notice that if I was having a rough day John would check in with other coworkers making sure I was alright or he would ask me directly. He also would sometimes try and crack a joke to make me laugh or one time put cookies on my desk. There were other instances where in all honesty it just made me just feel happy and safe. I’ve never felt so calm around someone as I do with him. 

We always kept it professional and friendly and never hung out outside of work. Only thing I would do is occasionally text him on a new restaurant I found and tell him to go and check it out. (I know not very professional of me) I did ask him if I was doing anything out of line or said something that he was uncomfortable to please tell me, and I would correct it. He, on more than one occasion, would say that I was fine. 

Well near the end of me leaving I was informed by several coworkers that John was not able to attend my going away party (that he helped planned). He apparently was very upset that the other person who planned it. Set the date of the party on a day where john had other plans. John gave the other person crap but they informed John that the day he was free was a holiday and could not plan a going away party that day. My other coworkers informed me that when they talked to John about how he was not able to attend, apparently he looked very upset and disappointed, they said they never seen him look that sad. I was sad but understood he had prior engagements he needed to go to. I messaged him on it saying I heard he was not able to attend. He responded that he had to go to another engagement but he would be in office that day to say goodbye. 

The last day of my employment there. John decided to get me coffee (his favorite drink) from my favorite coffee place and a gift card to there. I was stunned and asked what this was. He responded a going away gift. 
He said it his favorite drink but he got it from where I liked cause he knew I preferred that coffee place. 
I told him thank you and he didn’t have to. 

He looked at me and he looked really sad and said “I know” 
Mind you he has never don’t that for someone that has left the company prior to me. 

When he was about to leave for the day, he came over to talk to me and say goodbye. 

He mentioned that again he was sorry he wouldn’t make it to the party. 

One of my coworker (let’s call her Cindy) chimed in saying well you guys could get a drink. 

John then turned and looked at me and said “or maybe we could get some crepes” 

( long story short, I had messaged him on a restaurant that specialized in crepes and asked if I can keep him on standby (as it was near his home location) if I need to go the ER,( basically of sugar overload) he responded back only if he got to go with me. I offered for him to tag along on a certain day and he responded he could not that day. I had told him “one day I would get you to have crepes with me”. And basically forgot all about it as I thought it would never happen) 

So for him to remember that I was like “oh shit! Yes, you do owe me that. But you are gonna have to be the one to plan it as I would have to work around your schedule” 

He told me he wasn’t sure as he is horrible at planning and I just said ok well let me know when. I left it at that. 


I honestly (and probably stupidly) thought that maybe we would’ve talked or hung out since I’ve left. 


I have reached out a couple times either just checking in with him but have received no response (I assumed he was either busy or I annoyed him) . When I made a surprise visit to say hi to my old coworkers I purposely didn’t go to say to him as I didn’t want to bug him. 

John found out from my old manager that I was there and came out to talk for a bit and say hi. 

When I asked him about the no response. He said that he is awful at responding and busy. 

Since my surprise visit I haven’t messaged him. And I have received nothing from him. 


So honestly I just need someone of common sense to let me know if I should give up or just wait.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: July 13, 2139*

======

*By the stars, oww. Why did I think walking across town was a good idea? Ugh. Stupid brahking Predator Watch. Stupid brahking legs.*

I groaned a little as I shifted and settled into my bed, my lower body ached terribly but at least I was warm and comfy. I dunno how long I laid there in between sleep and wakefulness before I registered the powerful thumping in my left ear, but I felt a small twinge of concern when I did. My heart definitely shouldn’t be beating so hard that I could hear it.

*Speh, did I… Did I mess myself up with that power-walk? Stars, I hope I didn’t. I don’t want to have spend time in the clinic that I could spend with Elanor… Wait… Elanor?*

My eyes shot open as I realized I had no memory of getting home after chatting with Elanor on her couch. Sure enough, I found that I wasn’t curled up in my bed but was in fact laying on top of Elanor’s firm, warm abs with the side of my head pressed right up against her soft chest. Immediately I felt my whole body burn with the heat of an unprecedented bloom.

*Stars she’s so big… and warm… firm… and soft…*

I jerked a little as I shook off the sleep that threatened to take hold again. I tried to sit up, but the arm that Elanor had over my mid section may as well have been a fallen tree. Worse, the movement sent a wave searing pain through my legs, making me produce and involuntary and loud bleat.

“Huh? Wha-” Elanor stirred slowly, smacking her lips together a few times and yawning wide with her face scrunched up before shaking her head and blinking her eyes open. She blearily looked around a few heartbeats before her emerald green eyes settled on me with momentary confusion followed by surprise and concern, “Tolva? A-are you ok? You’re all orange again,”

Her voice was a bit gravely and husky, I assume because she just woke up, but the concern was unmistakable and I felt my bloom somehow deepen as I looked up into her green eyes, “I-I’m fine,” I said in what I hoped was a reassuring tone, but even if it was, the pained bleat I made as soon as I tried to move my legs most certainly overrode any reassurance my voice could offer.

“What’s wrong? W-was I holding you to tight? Here let’s sit you up and-”

“N-No!” I exclaimed a bit louder than I had intended and I hastily flicked a >sorry< with my tail, wincing as the movement sent another lance of pain down my legs and lower back “I’m just… hurting from the walk yesterday.”

Maybe saying that was a mistake because Elanor’s brow furrowed into an expression that… well, I had no idea it was possible to look so profoundly sad without proper ears or a tail.

“I’ll be fine,” I reassured her hastily, “really. I just need to take it easy for a paw… maybe two, and then I’ll be good as new! Promise.”

She made a low, whining sound for a moment before sighing with obvious discontent, “Alright… do… you want me to take you home or\~”

She let her voice trail off and I quickly filled in with my answer and a painful half-wag of my tail before deciding to give up on moving it for the time being, “All I’d do at home is lay around alone and watch movies on my pad. I’d much rather hang out together with you and chat while watching movies,”

She smiled gently hearing that and softly patted the top of my head, “That sounds lovely… but first I’d like to take a shower and get a bite to eat,”

I nodded, wondering what exactly a breakfast would look like for her. It would have to be huge, right? Would… would there be meat? No, no, where would she even get it? It’s not like her bags were full of meat, that would be ridiculous!

“Anyway… Let’s see if I can\~” Elanor’s voice trailed off into a low whistle and she shifted under me a little.

I was about to question what she was going to do when she partially rolled over, momentarily wedging me between her and the back of the couch before she scooted away, letting me slip off of her and onto the couch cushions directly.

She was laughing as she scooted fully off of the couch and onto the floor. She sat up and looked over at me with a very warm smile and a giggle. The early morning light coming in from the large window now behind her painted her in a beautiful array of oranges and reds that made the loose, untamed strands of hair from her bedhead appear as a glowing halo of light around her. Gosh humans sure can be pretty once you get past their freaky *(and also kinda pretty)* eyes.

She laughed again before reaching up and poked the end of my snout again, making me bloom as I realized just what exactly I had been thinking.

“That was quite the noise you made, are you alright?” She asked, still giggling

Noise? What noise? “I-I made a noise?”

She laughed some more and shook her head, “Yeah, something between a ‘woah’ and a sheep’s ‘bah’, like, like ‘Waaaah!’ or something,”

I turned even more orange and fought the urge to hide behind my paws, “I-I’m fine” I murmured

Elanor tilted her head slightly and gave me another small but oh-so-warm smile. She reached up and gently rubbed the side of my head, right at the base of my ear. My breath hitched a little and I felt a shiver run down my entire back all the way to the tip of my tail as her huge, but incredibly gentle and warm hand idly caressed me.

*Oh my stars how does that feel so good?*

My half-lidded eyes got another giggle from Elanor and her low voice rumbled sweetly, “Is there anything I get for you before I hop in the shower?”

“I-I’m good,” Almost before I had finished saying it, my stomach objected to the statement with a loud rumble.

*Oh right, I haven’t since… uh… wait, did I eat yesterday?*

Elanor chuckled and got onto her knees before reaching over for the bag she had plopped down beside the couch. I heard the sound of the zipper being unzipped and then what sounded like plastic crinkling against plastic for a moment before several things were set on the coffee table. The first was a large handful of… of… bags of dried meat? Wait, did she actually have meat in her bags!?

I blinked dumbly a few times as I was certain that my eyes must just be sleep fogged, but nope… that’s… that’s just vacuum sealed bags of meat.

Before I could question what she was looking for – and what the heck else she had in her bag – she made a triumphant “ah-ha!” and held up a large handful of smaller vacuum sealed bags which each contained a perhaps two by five inch bar of… something dark but colorful. Each one had a strip of adhesive tape on it with a handwritten note but I couldn’t quite make out what it said.

“I made these for you!” Elanor said cheerily as she sat back down, “Homemade fruitleather bars! Don’t worry I double, triple, and quadruple checked that there wasn’t anything in it that would give you any trouble. I even sent a video of me making them to Neliv to make extra sure,”

“Fruit...leather?” I winced as my tail tried to give an uncertain flick to accompany my ear’s confused >what?<

“Fruit that’s been boiled, mashed, and laid out in the oven on a really low heat overnight to dry out!” She explained excitedly, “I made a ton with different kinds of berries and fruit from around my Grampy’s house. My mom loved it you see, so there’s all kinds of fruit trees tucked away here or there that he planted just for her.”

I felt a small twinge of worry and hesitation as she tore open one of the sealed packages, splitting it open half way before holding it out to me. The excitement and hope she somehow wore so incredibly brightly despite not having the proper anatomy to convey them was enough to guilt me into reaching out a paw and taking the package from her. I again hesitated, filling in the moment with a “thanks,” that hopefully didn’t sound too uncertain before opening my mouth and taking a small nibble of the bar.

I had read a little about humans before deciding to get on that forum to talk to one. Mostly I just skimmed the empathy test summaries and read the back summary of the exchange program pamphlet. One note I had seen repeated by many people, not just Venlil either, was how monumentally superior their culinary prowess was. I had my doubts of course. But I saw in that moment how incredibly, unbelievably foolish I was to doubt the conclusions of the peers.

The *explosion* of flavors on my tongue. Sweet, tart, pleasantly acidic, balanced with an almost hidden bitterness, underlying earthy tones, and a not-spicy but just pleasantly warm after taste.

“Wow… I’m glad you liked it I guess?” I was snapped out of my wide eyed speed-tour of Flavortown by a very amused sounding Elanor.

I blinked a few times and looked down at the bar in my paws and- no wait, why is the wrapper empty?

*Where did it go? Oh speh, did I drop it?! Where is it!? I want another bite!*

I looked around, raising my paws and looking at the cushions and peering over the edge of the couch much to the amusement of Elanor who was rolling on the floor laughing. Despite the pain it caused I let my tail make an annoyed thump against the side of the couch.

*Don’t just laugh at me, help me find it!*

She laughed even more, to the point that she bumped her head against the leg of the coffee table with a dull \*thunk\* and a laughter filled “ouch,”

“What’s so funny?” I demanded as I looked down over myself. Had I dropped the sticky bar onto my wool?

“I’m- I’m sorry. Oof, ok… hehe, yeah,” She gently prodded my belly with one of her very large fingers, “if you’re still looking for where it went, you should check in there!” She said before she started laughing again.

*Check in- wait… did… no, I only took a small nibble! I most certainly did not eat the whole thing! R-right?*

“Well I guess that the ‘raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, with cinnamon’ is a big hit at the very least,” Elanor giggled as she put the dried meat back into her bag and set out a large stack of more vacuum sealed bags, “That leaves the ‘apple, pear with cinnamon’, ‘peach and gooseberry with lemon’, and ‘currant, plumb, elderberry’ for you to try. Don’t worry, I made a whole pan of each so there’s plenty more of each kind,”

I stared at the pile in wonder and almost didn’t notice as Elanor placed something into my paws. Looking down I saw I was holding a tall glass jar with a screw on lid, inside was a somewhat cloudy amber liquid with little particles of… something floating in it. It certainly didn’t *look* appetizing and almost looked like a jar of-

*Nope! Not finishing that thought.*

I’m not sure if my apprehension shown on my features or if Elanor just predicted my uncertainty, but she chuckled as she stood and stretched, “It’s apple cider. Non-alcoholic. It’s like unfiltered apple juice with some added cinnamon,” She explained.

I whimpered as I slowly, agonizingly, rose to a sitting position. My legs, lower back, and my abdomen all ached awfully from the minor exertion and I took a few slow deep breath as I waited for the pain to settle into a tingling burn.

Once I had stabilized myself a bit, I looked at the jar I was holding hesitantly before unscrewing the lid to give it a try… nope, I said *unscrewing* it to- hrm… ***UNSCREWING*** it to-

“Oh my gosh, I’m sorry,” Elanor reached down and grabbed the jar with one hand and the lid with the other. A seemingly gentle turn and the metal lid unsealed with a pleasing \*pop\*, “Ah, looks like you loosened it for me,” she joked playfully

I felt my ears start to grow warm with embarrassment but that was quickly forgotten by scent of spiced fruity goodness. I quickly took a sip and was surprised by the taste. It was… sharp? Uh… sweet for sure, but there was an acidic sharpness to it. It was almost harsh and burned a little in a way? But rather than being unpleasant the sensation felt soothing and warming. Especially that lingering after warmth that I assumed had to be Cinnamon as it was similar to what was in that wonderful little bar.

I flicked my ears thoughtfully and made sure to keep an eye on the jar to ensure its contents didn’t suddenly disappear like the bar had, “It’s odd… but good. Really good.”

Elanor smiled and gently patted my head, “I’m glad you like it” she said as she picked up her other bag and walked off down the hall, “I should be back in uh… 20 minutes?” she called as I heard a door open and then close.

“Ok,” I called after her as I looked at the wonderful fruity breakfast options before me with excitement.

My photos are not blurred. I opened the app right before my tour in Europe/Middle East. These are men I met, matched with, or we traumatized each other.

Starting in America:

American #1: Afghan guy (35) who took me to lunch and we hit it off - so I thought. Never heard from him again 

American #2: Sudanese guy (31) who I didn’t meet but spoke with over the phone. Was super nice but he has a restraining order on his ex wife. I’m scared.

American #3: Iranian guy (47) who drove 9 hours to meet me but said he was going to make the drive anyways for something else. He surprised me with my favorite perfume, flowers, and a hand written note. We went to hot pot and he berated the waiter which made me uncomfortable. I tried to make a clean getaway as he dropped me off at my brothers place and he came face to face with my brother. He introduced himself and invited himself in and told offensive jokes for 2 hours. Ironically, he cut me off for not being “warm.”

Now let’s go to the matches when I visited different parts of Europe:

Norway guy #1: Lebanese (31) he lovebombed me: I’ll do this and spoil you and you’ll never have to work etc before we even met. When it was time to meet, he gave me an address……to his house. I blocked him

France #1: Moroccan (39) he was very intense and we met up for coffee. He talked about himself for 45 minutes before I was finally able to get a word in. He got mad I interrupted him. We didn’t talk again.

Sweden #1: Afghan (32) a doctor who’s photos were blurred. I’m not a shallow person but he didn’t want to share his photos until we got to know each other. When he finally did, I realized he wasn’t my type physically. Before I could reject him, he asked if I was still “pure” despite being divorced. I blocked him.

UK (London): Pakistani (32) we matched and spoke over learning Arabic. He was funny but would get angry if I didn’t pick up the voice calls on Muzz despite being in the middle of something. “If I call you, you answer.” Didn’t work out.

UK (London): Bengali (38) we didn’t meet but we messaged. I was in London during the storm and asked him about the possibility of flights being canceled as I was worried about getting home. He said “who cares? Do I seem like the type to baby you?” Blocked him 

UK (London): Afghan (37) guy who was in the same part of London and was pushy about meeting up. He said he’s going to have an early dinner with his family first then meet me for coffee (I am a late coffee drinker) or lassi. I didn’t eat so I was looking for a place to eat. By the time I did, he was done with dinner. I asked if he wanted to keep me company while I ate and he said no. An hour later, I asked which coffee house and said he rather we “chill and drive” around London. Blocked him immediately the second I saw the world chill.

UK (London): Afghan/pakistani (47) he wanted to meet the day I flew in and I was jet lagged so I asked if we could meet the following day. He agreed, I took a nap, and woke up to 15 missed muzz calls. His messages asked why I played him since he cleared his day for me. He was bad at listening.

Let’s go to the Middle East and Turkey:

Turkey #1: Kurdish guy (35) who was very handsome. He spoke English well via the app. We met at taksim square for coffee and we spoke through a translator. I had chemistry with google translate. 

Kuwait #1: Kuwaiti guy (34) made racist comments about me being Afghan. 

UAE: Afghan/Turkish (34) guy who I matched with. We talked on video call before meeting up. We have a second coffee date planned soon. Looks promising ❤️

# The Why? 🤔

Running a node is like having VIP backstage passes to the Bitcoin network! You're not just watching the show – you're helping run it! Plus, you get that warm fuzzy feeling of supporting decentralization (and who doesn't love that?).

# The How? 

1. Grab Bitcoin Core from [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org) (the OG spot!)
2. Find a cozy 500GB+ storage space
3. Download the blockchain (warning: make some coffee, this'll take a while!)
4. Configure your settings (port 8333 is your new BFF)

# Pro Tips! 

* Get a solid internet connection (your Netflix binges can wait!)
* Consider hardware solutions like Umbrel
* Join node communities for support

# Level Up! 

  
Once you're running, explore staking opportunities through different platforms to make your node work harder than a coffee barista during morning rush!  
  
Remember: You're not just running software – you're becoming part of Bitcoin history!

Any advice on this situation would be much appreciated. I want to know if I actually have a case before moving forward. If I’ve missed something important please just ask me. 

I work for a brand new business that opened before the summer. I was employed for them opening on a 16 hour contract, and they were aware of the limited days I could work due to me being a student. I did a lot of overtime at first. 

My probation is up and so my employment should be “secure”. It’s in my contract that I have to give a month’s notice of any change in availability. They only have about 5 staff members. 

The issue:
 
They hired two new members of staff, one is the bosses friend who just needed a job, the other was to offer more flexibility in scheduling as we’re open 7 days a week. These two are still on probation and their employment subject to change. 

3 weeks after the new hires I was pulled into the office to say “multiple people’s” hours are being cut as we don’t have as many customers as we used to. This was essentially effective immediately (for the next rota coming out, rota is weekly). 

I fought this, asked for clarification on why my hours were cut and was given none. I asked to at least be given a months notice and was told no. My brother who is a manager looked at my contract and said I’m entitled to a months notice. 

I have not verbally agreed to or signed ANYTHING. this all happened 2 weeks ago. Since then I’ve noticed I’m actually the only person whose hours has been cut (I can access shop schedule) and some people are in fact getting overtime. 

The only two reasons I can think of are: 

1. I am possibly leaving this summer for 4 weeks, I have given plenty of appropriate notice that this may happen, but they still have a right to deny me if they want obviously. 

2. They are actually struggling, and seeing as im a childless student I think they think I “need money less” or won’t fight as hard. 

Now, I work for a coffee shop, and I have been praised constantly for my attitude and work ethic. I also worked 7 days a week for a month to cover my bosses wedding for her. So this has nothing to do with my performance. I live in Northern Ireland. 

I want to know if this is work place discrimination, and if I do have a case, will it be worth it financially? I’m also just genuinely upset over this situation as my boss treated me like family. ",0,1733851323.0,LegalAdviceUK,12,0.17,False
1hb6xzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hb6xzt/wibta_if_i_told_my_husband_to_return_all_my/,WIBTA if I told my husband to return all my birthday presents he bought,"My (26F) birthday was yesterday. My husband (29M) hasn't done anything for my birthday nearly the entire time we've been together. January 30th will be 7 years since we first got together. I cut him some slack in the first few years because he was adjusting to my personality from the other colorful girly girls he always dated. I'm an anime dweeb and a casual gamer. I'm relatively simple and think almost completely with logic and hardly ever get emotional.

I don't have many things that I'm passionate about or that I even like, but when there is something that matters to me I don't shut up about it. I'm a collector meaning if there's something I like then I own at least one piece of merchandise that represents it. 

My husband decided for once that he was going to surprise me for my birthday with a cake and presents. Only two had come in and the rest were still on the way he said the rest would just be Christmas. That's not the world ender here. I opened the first gift and it was a Black Butler coffee cup. I wasn't too bothered because I like to collect cups with anime on them. The next one was a cosplay jewelry and pin set to Black Butler. I'm allergic to cheap metals I get itchy break out into hives that quickly turn into pus pockets, so I can't even wear any of them on occasion. He then mentioned everything he bought was for this same anime. I've never really cared for BB, multiple reasons.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting because of Postpartum Depression or if I have reason to be as upset as I am. I was blown away and furious with the fact I've been with him for nearly 7 years and he acts like he doesn't know me at all. In my fury I logged into his Amazon to see what all he ordered and I was even more upset by seeing the items. There were the 2D acrylic lights (i never owned these on purpose i thought the idea just looked kinda dumb((voiced this a lot)).) A blanket (he or the kids will steal and ruin just like every blanket I've had) a hoodie (that's the wrong size and he and his friends will steal like they always have) and a small scroll poster. (I've bitched about tiny posters over the years especially when I ordered one on accident)

I've given up everything for him and the kids. I try to be as black and white about things as possible because I hate guessing games. I haven't said much about any of it to him outside of I don't like that anime and he gives me shit that it's the thought that counts. I didn't see any thought given to any of this.

AITA and just too high strung about this?",1,1733851314.0,AmItheAsshole,42,0.57,False

Burnt out on dating apps, a little worn out from past relationships that didn't go the distance, and struggling to encounter many cool single gals at the places I hang out at (gym, art studio, coffee shop, thrift store, etc. - places you'd hope would work lol). I still try to strike up convos or have flirtatious interactions, but not a lot shaking loose... I'm just feeling down about my prospects as I get older.

There's a lot of super negative stuff out there like ""you get the scraps"" or ""once they're done having fun they'll pick you for security"" or ""everyone has baggage at this age""... I don't want to feel that way going into dating in my 30s. My favorite dating experiences have been the ones where we both just have fun with it. There's no ""what can you do for me?"" or ""where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" or ""I'm on a clock here"" about it. Just fun, hormones, and getting to know someone, y'know? 

After that phase I have enjoyed building more mature relationships, so it's not that im just looking for hookups. I want a longterm partner and I want to be crazy about her. Not comprise because choices and time are drying up. I also really don't love the idea of ending up alone!

And Karan was literally humiliated coz he didn't take a stand for himself when Shilpa backstabbed him...
But the same thing happened when Eisha nominate with Rajat, even he didn't take a stand for himself... So Rajat is keeping his bond above the rift... Then isn't KV doing the same by choosing to not pick a fight with Shilpa!!

And on the same lines... shouldn't Vivian be called out for his hypocrisy?... Coz he did not take a stand for himself after being nominated by his brother...

If VD and the criminal are justified in their actions and are not seeking sympathy... Why is KV being held convicted in the same ground?.. If the reasons for the former are justified isn't the reason for the latter justified too...

I work for a brand new business that opened before the summer. I was employed for them opening on a 16 hour contract, and they were aware of the limited days I could work due to me being a student. I did a lot of overtime at first. 

My probation is up and so my employment should be “secure”. It’s in my contract that I have to give a month’s notice of any change in availability. They only have about 5 staff members. 

The issue:
 
They hired two new members of staff, one is the bosses friend who just needed a job, the other was to offer more flexibility in scheduling as we’re open 7 days a week. These two are still on probation and their employment subject to change. 

3 weeks after the new hires I was pulled into the office to say “multiple people’s” hours are being cut as we don’t have as many customers as we used to. This was essentially effective immediately (for the next rota coming out, rota is weekly). 

I fought this, asked for clarification on why my hours were cut and was given none. I asked to at least be given a months notice and was told no. My brother who is a manager looked at my contract and said I’m entitled to a months notice. 

I have not verbally agreed to or signed ANYTHING. this all happened 2 weeks ago. Since then I’ve noticed I’m actually the only person whose hours has been cut (I can access shop schedule) and some people are in fact getting overtime. 

The only two reasons I can think of are: 

1. I am possibly leaving this summer for 4 weeks, I have given plenty of appropriate notice that this may happen, but they still have a right to deny me if they want obviously. 

2. They are actually struggling, and seeing as im a childless student I think they think I “need money less” or won’t fight as hard.

Not too long after this conversation my partner talks to me about how she has really gotten feels for a co-worker. Shared lunches and meeting for coffee on off days. It felt off and we had discussions about this and that it was agreed to maintain a friendship only. At some point feelings of love were expressed between my partner and the co-worker. There are many hindrances currently in place that would stifle any further growth if my partner decides that they really want our relationship to be open. Meaning a lot would have to change not just in our relationship but also for the would be metamour. It's currently in an unknown space right now.

I (27f) have been having a hard time figuring out the cause of my symptoms, which have been present for about 3 years episodically. I’ve been to several docs including a GP, neurologist, and infectious disease specialist. My symptoms include:

1. Bilateral paroxysmal paresthesias of my entire lower body, from the bellybutton down. Not along any particular dermatome and usually starts soon after I start walking after sitting/lying down for a while. Resolves after a minute or so, and I haven’t been able to identify any other triggers like stress, clothing, etc. this happens a few times a month, sometimes more. 
Saw a neurologist about this and had an MRI of my head and thoracic spine, neither of which had abnormalities that could explain my symptoms. Normal neuro exam BUT:

2. Positive Chvostek sign 
Really thought this was the answer about the paresthesias. Went for blood tests after this and my calcium, PTH, magnesium, B12 were all within normal ranges, which really surprised the neurologist. Only abnormality was a vitamin D deficiency. Started taking vitamin D and magnesium supplements but still Chvostek positive from time to time

3. Occasional PVCs
This doesn’t happen often, but I have felt arrhythmias now and then over the past year and have been able to record PVCs on my Apple Watch. Asked a cardiologist about it but he didn’t seem concerned, so I didn’t follow up 🤷‍♀️ figured maybe I was missing some electrolytes or just drank too much coffee. It happens maybe 5-15 times in a day for a few days and then resolves. 

4. Fatigue
Honestly hard to say if this is due to a health condition or just the fact that I’m in grad school, but I used to be very active and energetic and for the past several years I don’t think I’ve felt rested once. I also feel more easily fatigued when exercising. 

5 Eye pain
Might just have sensitive, dry eyes but including in case it’s related. My vision is great but I have constantly achy, sometimes stinging eye pain and conjunctival injection. I do look at screens quite a lot but my classmates don’t have the same issue. 

No major health conditions, but I do have psoriasis. No significant family history for autoimmune conditions. I’m not overweight, don’t smoke, drink alcohol occasionally with friends. No kids and no gynecological issues to my knowledge. No STDs. Had to get a full health check for my school a year ago and everything was normal. Also had a chest x ray a few weeks ago for a prolonged cough after a viral infection, and it was also normal.

I’m not sure what to do from here. Do I see an endocrinologist? Rheumatologist? Any ideas why I could have electrolyte abnormalities but normal PTH?

I tried to pick the best of the options available but among other things, there was no sugar-free coffee creamer, no low fat cheese for my omelettes, and no turkey breast or carrots to snack on. There was a lot of ribs, hamburgers, and hot dogs, By some miracle, I used up all my daily and weekly points, but only went over by seven points.

I returned home and did a weight-in the next morning: three pounds lost! How? The only thing that makes sense is I did a tremendous amount of walking. All the distances are long: airport gate to pick up area; parking garage to hotel room; hotel room to casino; stroll on the Las Vegas Strip; and just walking around the casinos. I never put much effort into walking before, but now I'm planning a daily walk to turbo-charge my weight loss.",4,1733849860.0,weightwatchers,1,1.0,False
1hb6cji,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1hb6cji/how_much_spare_money_do_you_have_a_month/,How much spare money do you have a month?,"Hi everyone,

I'm just wondering how much 'spare' money people have per month and what you would consider tight, ok and doing well? 

So this is after all bills, after petrol, food shop, credit cards and also after weekend money spent with family. I've got a wife and 2 kids and budget for us to spend £200 a weekend on takeaway, going for a coffee, drink, whatever it may be. 

After all this, as a family, we have, on paper (spreadsheet) Just over £500 a month left. 
But this is easily spent on anything like birthday or Christmas gifts or whatever is happening each month. 

So next year hoping to pay off credit cards and that will give us between £100-£400 a month back as they are paid off. 

As I'm sure everyone would, I'd like to live and just be able to afford to do things and buy things without money being tight, so wondered anyone had a target they aim for to achieve this.

>A little bit of background info- he is retired now, but isn't much of a traveler and doesn't like to really go out. He just wants to sit at home... but he loves game shows and the New York Yankees. A the start of this year he had a heart attack and found out he was diabetic. He has since changed his diet, and thankfully the diabetes has gone away, but he still remains with a restricted diet. I say this because he used to love gifts with little snacks and sweets and he can't really have those things anymore.

>He used to love a cup of coffee in the morning but since the heart attack he can only have decaf, so I was considering getting a nice decaf coffees gift set? Maybe with some snacks in there but I'm not really sure what goes well with coffee that will fit a diabetic and heart conscious diet?

Rent is $1450 and there is tons of street parking and also options to rent a spot behind the building.  
  
It is near the Union Pacific North Metra line (5 minute walk), about a 15 minute walk to the CTA Purple Line, and about 10 minute drive from I-94 (Old Orchard exit). It is along the Central Business District so there's coffee shops, cute boutiques and great dining options around! There are also CTA & Pace bus stops.  
  
The building is vintage, and the unit is well-maintained. It has tons of storage, hardwood floors and an exposed brick wall that runs along the living room. There's also tons of windows in the main living area (3 south and 3 west facing) which is great for plants haha. All of my neighbors are nice and keep to themselves, which is really all you can ask for!  
  
You will need to pay for electric and wifi but other essentials like water/gas/recycling are covered. There is laundry in the basement of the building ($1.25 for washer, $1 for dryer) and you also will have a storage unit down there! The heat is provided by baseboard radiators and I have an AC unit that I can leave behind if someone wants it! There isn't a dishwasher in my unit.  
  
I had a co-signer while I lived here so the landlord is comfortable if you would like to use one.  
  
If you're interested please send me a message and I can answer any additional questions and send over photos!  
  
Cats and small pets are okay! I think you can ask the landlord about smaller dogs, we also have a large grassy area directly next to the building 🙂

As I approach my first month on Zep (tirating up next week 😱) I find myself more conflicted than ever. 

Backstory: I've been fat my whole life, and no matter how much i worked out or how active i was I didn't lose weight, it was never the goal but I still was surprised it never happened. I destroyed my metabolism in high school living off of coffee and chewing gum because I didn't eat breakfast and school lunch was gross (i'm 29 now). 

Now, especially over 2020 I found myself falling in love with fat liberation, I have and always will believe that fat people deserve access, empathy, and non judgemental care. This year when I was meeting with an endo I mentioned that I had been working out 3-4 times a week, doing strength training and even wanting to become a power lifter, but it's wild to me that doing all of that, I put on muscle but didn't lose weight or even change in size that much. he suggest zep since i made it very clear I wasn't interested in weight loss surgery. He explained what zep did, the risks associated with it if I had a family history of thyroid cancer (I don't) and I said I'd be willing to give it a shot (no pun intended).

Now, all these people in my community I've come to know and respect make videos about how ozempic is basically forcing people into ED's or posts misconstruing the facts (like the cancer risk, despite it being incredibly low and only happened with rodents). They are so judgemental and they are so mean to people defending it in the comments. There's just such a lack of empathy from both sides.

It freaks me out because then I'm immediately feeling guilty or like I did something 'wrong'. My ""why"" so to speak for doing this in the first place is to correct my frankly, fucked up, metabolism but also the world is so unkind to fat people, and I don't feel confident attitudes or accessible features (like wider airplane seats, better seating options etc) are going to change significantly in my lifetime. 

If i have the opportunity to make MY life a little easier to go through, why wouldn't I do that? so it's just hurtful. I'm still all for fat liberation and I always will be, I just feel torn. 

  
TLDR: i've been active in the fat liberation community for years and since starting zep i've gotten so much more sensitive to the harsh criticisms people make about GLP-1s, despite being well meaning are starting to feel misinformed. ",18,1733849518.0,Zepbound,19,1.0,False

Last year, I discovered a unique trading strategy based on philosophical concepts. It's complex, but I've seen promising results, despite some temporary setbacks. Essentially, I use Nietzsche's concepts to predict market movements.

My ex-girlfriend (29F) broke up with me about a year ago, claiming she couldn't handle the stress of my trading lifestyle We've remained civil and occasionally grab coffee to catch up. During our last meet-up, she seemed concerned about some offhand comments I made about my trading. I didn't think much of it at the time. The problem is, she's apparently been keeping tabs on my financial situation through mutual friends.

Last week, she texted asking if we could talk. She came over, and it turned out she had spoken to her new boyfriend (34M), who works in finance, about my situation. She showed me some calculations he had done and the numbers didn't look great, which makes sense because they're missing a lot of key information.

I tried explaining that my strategy is more nuanced than traditional metrics can capture. Yes, I've had to take on some debt, and yes, my current win-loss ratio might not look impressive. But I'm confident this is just a phase in a larger process. 

I told her she was being incredibly disrespectful and that she had no right to judge my financial decisions. I explained that I'm actually working on a book about my trading method and that I'm in talks with a major publisher (my ex-girlfriend's father knows someone in publishing).

My ex had the nerve to say she was worried about me and that she just wanted to help. Her boyfriend offered to give me free financial advice. I told them both to leave and never contact me again about my finances.

Here's where I might be the asshole: I got pretty heated and told my ex that she was probably just jealous that she gave up on me right before my big break. I also told her she's trying to sabotage my success because she regrets leaving me, and I somewhat suggested that her new boyfriend felt threatened by my greater financial knowledge despite being self-trained and younger than him.

Some of my friends think I overreacted and that my ex and her boyfriend were just trying to help. But I feel like they massively overstepped and disrespected my intelligence and autonomy.

So, am I overreacting? Or was I right to tell them to mind their own business?",3,1733849464.0,AmIOverreacting,15,0.71,False

My (33f) boyfriend (34m) says he doesn't need anything and I don't need to get him anything but it would obviously be weird if I didn't... the thing is he has literally everything.

And without him actually telling me what he wants/needs I am lost..  
He just bought a house that he's been renovating for the past few months and we are moving into the house next month. He has talked about wanting a coffee station on a specific area of the counter, he's not necessarily passionate about fancy coffee but does like a strong cup of jo in the morning.  
Do you think he would be happy with a nice espresso machine?? I just want to get him something that he'll be happy about. I've considered things for his hobbies but a lot of them are summer hobbies and would like it to be something he could use sooner than that.

I’ve been doing the work recently. Three months ago I left my incredibly stressful job of six years to start my own business. Since then, I’ve been prioritising my mental and physical health. It’s going well, I’m eating a lot better, losing weight, going for regular walks and feeling a lot better for it. 

However, over the last couple of weeks I’ve had this I’ve had this nagging desire for intimacy. Not sex, just spending time with and being close to someone. Whether that’s watching a film, listening to music or nattering about anything and everything, I honestly don’t mind. I’ll even read your favourite book to you if you’d like.

I can’t host but I’d be happy to get a hotel somewhere convenient. I travel for work quite frequently, too - mainly to London, Birmingham, Farnborough, Oxford and Northampton. If you’re anywhere near those places then we might be able to work something out too.

I’ve done this before and appreciate that not everyone wants to start cuddling with a complete stranger straight off the bat. As such, I would welcome either a period of messaging or meeting up for a coffee/other before taking things further to put each other’s minds at ease and hopefully remove some of the awkwardness. 

If cozying up with some snacks in front of a film or emptying our heads of idle chit chat before falling asleep in one another’s arms appeals, then it would be lovely to hear from you.

I just cannot stand my one SSV who constantly tells me to hurry tf up on every task I'm ever given even though I'm already working at the pace I'm currently able to, doesn't give clear instructions and then gets mad at me abt it, and ""coaches"" and lectures me on the smallest things like changing a garbage can when its not completely full while I was changing most of the cans front of house ANYWAY and i THOUGHT it was full, and going back and forth ""Too Often"" to get materials. AND when I ASK something, i dont fucking want a ""you tell me"", just fucking tell me so I can date the fucking chai.

There was also a time when I was working as fast as I could on bar and am constantly told that I'm not making enough connections during peak (like every few fucking minutes, even tho i greet them and call their names) But I'm still getting used to it and trying to get recipes right and am not the best at multi tasking...Is this just how it works here or am I going insane. Cuz it feels like I'm working with my father atp lmao. Everyone else tells me I'm doing really well as a new partner and really the only negative feedback I get is from this SSV. 

Also this is a side thing (not from this SSV), but I'm still unreasonably pissed at being pulled aside and being told I'm not allowed to write on top of the lids (i was trying to distinct the drinks for the customer) because ""the customers are paying a lot for the drink and it makes it look Messy"". Like it's a fucking $3 drip coffee and I'm trying to make their lives easier by making a clear marking for what coffee is what...

>I've never really bought my dad a proper Christmas or birthday gift before (he's born on Christmas day), but I actually got my first job recently so I really wanted to get him something to show I appreciate him. He's a single dad, and I'm the eldest child and likely the only one getting him a gift, so I really want it to be something he enjoys.

>**About him:** He's 54, about to be 55. He's a real foodie, and a great cook, but has more kitchen utensils than I know exist. He's also a real intellectual, legitimately one of the smartest people I know. He loves to read, but he already has a large pile of books he's meaning to read. A dry, sarcastic sense of humor. He wears things out easily because he has a very physical job, but he replaces them so often it's possible he'd buy a new wallet or pair of shoes or whatever else before Christmas. He works a lot, and I also don't have a lot of free time between school, internships and work. He loves coffee, spices, not a big fan of lotions and body care sets, but if it is a very nice one he may enjoy it? He listens to music a lot.

>I'm stumped. I usually don't struggle with gifts, but I really need some advice. As a teenage girl, I unfortunately have no idea what the average middle-aged man may like.

>Any advice appreciated, thanks in advance!

My (33f) boyfriend (34m) says he doesn't need anything and I don't need to get him anything but it would obviously be weird if I didn't... the thing is he has literally everything. He has a ton of hobbies.. fishing, hunting, snowboarding, backcountry touring, boating... but hes the type of person that just gets what he needs when he needs it. And without him actually telling me what he wants/needs I am lost..  
He just bought a house that he's been renovating for the past few months and we are moving into the house next month. He has talked about wanting a coffee station on a specific area of the counter, he's not necessarily passionate about fancy coffee but does like a strong cup of jo in the morning.  
Do you think he would be happy with a nice espresso machine?? I just want to get him something that he'll be happy about. I've considered things for his hobbies but a lot of them are summer hobbies and would like it to be something he could use sooner than that.  
Any other suggestions are welcome!

Set it up day 1, pulled a great shot, was thrilled! Day 2 got a little worse and now on Day 3, I'm struggling heavily. Should've bought training beans as opposed to Blue Bottle, but whatever.

Here's my issue: On Day 1, the stock double espresso grind settings (time and coarseness) meant the grounds were barely overfilling the portafilter. Shots pulled an appropriate amount. Now, without ever touching the setting, the grounds are reaching the top of the dosing funnel and shots are barely pulling.

This has resulted in double shots pouring out and being 1/4 of what they should be and single's being barely anything. Liquid comes out around the 8-10 sec mark so that's ok, it's just that barely any comes out.

I've rinsed the portafilter, run cleaning cycles, tried nearly everything, thinking it was clogged. I then tried grinding for just 10 seconds and this produced a shot that was too large. Maybe it's somewhere in between?

Now I believe, for whatever reason, the machine is grinding far too much coffee. Has anyone experienced this or have solutions? Should I factory reset?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become an increasingly popular cosmetic dental procedure. It's common for people to seek a dazzling smile that exudes confidence and charm. The transformative effects of teeth whitening are often visible immediately after the procedure, leading many to share their ""before and after"" experiences. By highlighting these changes, we can better understand the appeal and benefits of this treatment.

Before diving into the details, let’s look at the common reasons people decide to undergo teeth whitening:

- Desire for a brighter smile
- Improvement in self-esteem
- Enhancement of appearance for events or photographs
- Removal of stains caused by coffee, wine, and tobacco

The ""before"" stage often presents a variety of concerns. Stains caused by years of consumption, natural aging, or poor dental hygiene can leave teeth looking dull and discolored. Many individuals feel self-conscious about their teeth's appearance, leading to hesitation in social situations or covering their mouths when they smile. It’s important to note that you are not alone in these feelings; many people share similar experiences before deciding on teeth whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
After undergoing teeth whitening treatment, the change is often dramatic. Most clients report a significant improvement in their teeth color, typically ranging from two to eight shades lighter. This noticeable shift can greatly enhance the overall look of a person's smile.

### Transformative Benefits of Teeth Whitening

The benefits extend beyond just aesthetics. Here are some transformative effects you may experience post-treatment:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Heightened Confidence:** A bright smile can positively affect how you perceive yourself, boosting your self-esteem in both personal and professional settings.
- **Youthful Appearance:** Whiter teeth are often associated with youth and vitality, making individuals feel younger and more attractive.
- **Positive First Impressions:** A sparkling smile can create a lasting impression in social interactions, aiding in both personal and professional relationships.
- **Encouragement for Good Hygiene:** After whitening, many people become more dedicated to maintaining their dental hygiene. This often results in routine visits to the dentist and a more profound understanding of proper oral care.

### Different Methods of Teeth Whitening

When it comes to teeth whitening, various methods can yield impressive ""before and after"" results:

- **In-Office Whitening:** Performed by a dental professional, this method uses stronger bleaching agents for immediate results, often within an hour.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many individuals opt for at-home whitening trays and strips. While results may take longer to achieve, they can still provide noticeable changes.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some choose DIY methods like baking soda or activated charcoal. While these options may lighten teeth over time, they are generally less effective than professional treatments.

Individual results can vary based on the method used, initial teeth condition, and adherence to post-treatment care. It's crucial to choose the method that best suits your lifestyle and desired outcomes.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Care Following Teeth Whitening

To maintain the newfound brightness of your smile, consider the following tips:

- Avoid food and drinks that can stain teeth, such as coffee, red wine, and dark sodas for at least 24-48 hours post-treatment.
- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- Consider regular touch-up treatments, especially if you consume staining substances frequently.

Understanding the transformative effects of teeth whitening is essential for anyone considering this cosmetic procedure. Many individuals can attest to the positives observed in their ""before and after"" experiences, highlighting not only visible changes but also emotional benefits. As the desire for a radiant smile continues to grow, engaging in professional dental care becomes a worthy investment.

With the right information and commitment to post-care, you can achieve a bright smile that turns heads and garners compliments. Embracing the changes can lead to a more confident and fulfilling life.

Comparing At-Home Teeth Whitening Methods vs. Professional Treatments
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that many people explore to enhance their smiles. When considering options, you often encounter the choice between at-home teeth whitening methods and professional treatments. Understanding the differences can help you make a more informed decision about which option is best suited for your needs.

At-home teeth whitening methods provide convenience and flexibility. They come in various forms, such as whitening strips, gels, or trays. These products are available over-the-counter and can be used in the comfort of your home. Some common at-home options include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Strips:** Thin strips coated with a whitening gel that you apply directly to your teeth for a specified period.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Contains abrasives and mild chemicals that gently remove surface stains, although they may not significantly change the tooth color.
- **Whitening Trays:** Custom-fitted trays filled with a bleaching solution that you wear for a few hours or overnight.
- **Whitening Pens:** Portable pens filled with bleaching gel, allowing for on-the-go application.

One of the main advantages of at-home whitening is affordability. These methods are generally less expensive than professional treatments. You can often find effective products at your local pharmacy or online, making them easily accessible. Additionally, at-home treatments can be less time-consuming since they allow you to incorporate whitening into your daily routine.

However, there are some downsides to consider. Results may take longer to achieve compared to professional treatments, and the effectiveness can vary from person to person. Some users report sensitivity or gum irritation, especially with products that contain hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, it’s essential to follow instructions carefully to avoid uneven whitening or damage to your enamel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
On the other hand, professional teeth whitening treatments, typically offered by dental practitioners, provide faster and possibly more noticeable results. These treatments are usually more potent and can effectively address deeper stains or discoloration. Professional options include:

- **In-office Whitening:** A concentrated whitening solution is applied to your teeth. Often, a special light or laser enhances the bleaching effect, leading to quicker results.
- **Take-home Kits from Dentists:** Custom trays and a stronger whitening gel prescribed by your dentist for at-home use under professional guidance.

Choosing a professional treatment has multiple benefits. The most significant advantage is the expertise of a dental professional who can evaluate your oral health and recommend the best approach. They can also monitor the process to optimize results while minimizing potential side effects. Furthermore, the results from professional whitening can last longer than those from at-home methods, saving you from frequent touch-ups.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Despite the benefits, professional whitening can be substantially pricier than at-home methods. The cost varies depending on the treatment chosen and your location but can typically range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars. Some individuals may find this expense hard to justify, especially if they're on a tight budget.

To summarize the differences:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Cost:** At-home methods are generally cheaper, while professional treatments can be significantly more expensive.
- **Effectiveness:** Professional treatments tend to be more powerful, yielding quicker, more noticeable results.
- **Convenience:** At-home methods offer flexibility, allowing you to fit whitening into your schedule.
- **Expert Supervision:** Professional treatments provide the guidance of a dental expert to enhance safety and outcomes.

Ultimately, the choice between at-home teeth whitening and professional treatments depends on your budget, time constraints, and personal preferences. If you're looking for convenience and cost-effectiveness, at-home options might be suited for you. However, if speed and expert guidance are your priority, investing in professional whitening may yield the best results.

Before making your decision, it’s wise to consult with your dentist. They can provide insight into your specific oral health needs and help you select the most effective whitening method for achieving your desired smile.

### Conclusion

Understanding the transformative effects of teeth whitening goes beyond just a cosmetic change; it can boost your confidence and enhance your overall smile. Many individuals who have undergone whitening treatments experience a significant change in how they perceive themselves both socially and personally. Those “before and after” photos serve as a testament to this dramatic transformation, showcasing that achieving a radiant smile is an attainable goal.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
When it comes to choosing between at-home whitening methods and professional treatments, the results can vary widely. At-home kits offer convenience and affordability, making them an appealing option for many. However, professional treatments often guarantee more dramatic results in a shorter timeframe, thanks to advanced technology and expert supervision. Whether you opt for the ease of at-home whitening or the effectiveness of a dental professional, both avenues present unique benefits that cater to different needs and preferences.

Ultimately, the decision hinges on your whitening goals, budget, and desired results. Understanding the advantages and limitations of each option can help you make an informed choice. No matter which route you pursue, the journey to a brighter smile is rewarding, promising not just a visual uplift but also an increase in self-esteem. So, take the leap and embrace the possibilities that come with a whiter, brighter smile. Your “before and after” story could be just around the corner, waiting to be shared with the world.

1hb62e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hb62e9/the_friend_i_told_my_crush_about_now_admits_that/,"The friend I told my crush about now admits that he also has feelings for my crush, idk what to feel","

I (22F) told my close friend, C (22M), about my long-time crush, who also happens to be my best friend, R (22M). Two years ago, I confided in C about my feelings for R. He was incredibly supportive and seemed happy for me, even though I was being all sappy and in love. R and I have a long history—we were classmates in middle school, and we’ve stayed close all the way through college.  

At the time, C never pushed me to confess to R, and I wasn’t planning to either. I didn’t want to risk ruining the friendship R and I had. Fast forward to now—my feelings for R are still very strong, but I’ve been content with how close we are as friends. Besides, we’re both super busy with academics.  

This summer, we had our clinical duties in the countryside. Both C and R were in the same cluster, and since we’re all part of the same group of friends, we usually hung out together. During this time, C and R became really close.  

Last month, C told me he had something to reveal but that he wanted to wait until graduation because he thought I’d be shocked. He seemed so happy when he mentioned it, so I pestered him, asking if he was seeing someone or liked someone. It took him a week before he randomly admitted that he liked R.  

He was giddy as he told me this, but I was too stunned to speak. C said he wasn’t sure when his feelings started, but he knew they were real. He even asked me what he should do about them. I didn’t know how to respond because, as far as I know, I’m also in love with R. The way he spoke made it seem like he’d completely brushed off the fact that I’ve had feelings for R for so long.  

I felt this weird pang in my chest, but I kept reminding myself that if I felt bad about this, maybe I was being a bad friend. Still, it’s been bothering me ever since. I started piecing together little moments—like when C would insist on taking R to coffee shops that the two of us used to visit.  

Last month, I gathered all our friends together to celebrate my birthday. We had some drinks, and C ended up getting drunk. By the time we were going home, he disappeared. I panicked because I was supposed to drive him home, but when he finally picked up an hour later, he was crying. He told me he had to leave because he was on the verge of confessing to R.  

Hearing him pour his heart out like that hit me hard. I felt a sharp pain in my chest as he talked about how in love he was and how he wanted to express his feelings. It hurt, but I didn’t say anything.  

Now, I can’t shake this feeling. When I see C interacting with R, I just want to go silent and avoid talking to him. He still speaks about R to me often, but what hurts the most is that he doesn’t even acknowledge that I’m still in love with R.

1hb612r,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1hb612r/help_my_great_grandmother_has_dementia_and_i_am/,HELP! My great grandmother has dementia and I am scared of her!,"First off I want to apologize if any of this sounds insensitive, as I have been dealing with it over a year and have reached a breaking point.

So over the past year I have been dealing with my 92 year old great grandmother and she ended up moving into our house. I had to adapt to this change however she is nothing but nasty and rude. She constantly tries to start arguments with my grandmother who took her in even though her mother was abusive emotionally and a negligent parent. I am in university but have been home due to mental health issues and I'm reaching a breaking point. 

She constantly forgets everything within 10 minutes you say something. ""We have an eye appointment at 1pm"" then a couple minutes later she is like ""what do we have to do?"" Then she started accusing people of using her mouth wash, says her pink diamond ring went missing yet for the record she has never owned a pink diamond and we had to sell mostly all of her stuff since we couldn't bring it all as she lives out of province. 

Recently she has started to become very agitated and if she is corrected she snaps. She forgets to take her pills and then proceeds to snap at me for letting her know she was about to throw out her pill since she didn't recognize it. Benefit of the doubt though but she has really bad eyesight and one would assume she needs to go to the doctor's for her eyes and we have set up many appointments but God forbid she leaves the house. She makes up any excuses to not see a doctor or eye specialist and it's getting on my nerves. How in the world do I tell my Grandma to just make her go so I stop hearing her complain.

My Grandma says she can't just make her go and yet she is the power of attorney. She also has not called up any nursing homes and hasn't got her diagnosed yet since now we were informed the process can take up to 6 months. I can't live like this anymore and I'm scared of her becoming violent.

She has started this new habit where she scoffs down cereal like it was alcohol and she was about to have a field amputation. I have never seen someone eat so fast and she has diabetes. I watched her eat 4 bowls of cereal in one day and 5 coffees so we go through milk like crazy and it makes me wonder if she is forgetting how much she has had. 

I also found out that whenever she sees me cook for the family for dinner she eats half if not less than her plate. Yet if she sees my grandmother cook she eats the plate clean. I felt like I was going mad because I know my cooking is good so I decided to trick her by making one of the common meals I make but made sure she wasn't around. Sure enough after telling my grandmother my test she backed me up saying she cooked it. My great grandmother proceeded to scoff down the porkchop I had made and even tried to eat parts of leftover meat off the bone because it was so good. Then my Grandma said it was my recipe and that she used it and she looked like she had a stick up her ass.

Now here is the really scary part and that is she is hearing music now at night. She complains about it and apparently she has been woken up in the night and can't sleep because it keeps playing. She becomes aggressive when my grandmother explains she can't hear it when she woke her up one night. I didn't know this but this has been happening about once or twice a month in the last couple months and now it has been 3 times this week 2 nights in a row it happened as well. She says that it was coming from my room for some reason even though I was sleeping. Thankfully my grandmother was sleeping in the basement that night at the television or else I would have been in deep trouble.

I am scared because one night I stayed up late studying in my room and I heard her come down into the basement. I could tell it was her because she clicks every single light since she doesn't know what one to use. All I remember was freezing and keeping quiet then apparently she went upstairs to go wake my grandmother where she normally sleeps. For the record no music was involved in my studying.

I am scared for my safety and I genuinely don't know why she has picked me to single out right now. Last year she grabbed my shoulders and dug her nails into them and now that she is hallucinating I don't know what to do. I have been nothing but nice to her through passing conversations I just don't talk to her a lot due to mismatching topics of interest. I also found out her hallucination in regard to the music is only one song played on repeat.

How do I deal with this and what precautions should I be taking? What has worked for you and have you also experienced this? Please help I'm desperate as I just want to feel safe in the place I live.

1hb60o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brampton/comments/1hb60o9/initiative_man_is_looking_for_a_job/,Initiative man is looking for a job!,"Good day to you all, dear redditors.
Moved to Canada (Mississauga) a year ago and have been struggling finding a job this whole time. 
At this point I'm more than well familiar with a struggling job market.
One of the things related to it is a big competition, which partially is associated with an overall big amount of applicants to open positions, and scammy/incompetent hiring managers that are biased towards hiring their friends, relatives, or other folks based on their nationality, and not overall competence.
Personally, I've been trying to show initiative while applying to suitable positions, like personally reaching out to hiring managers and owners, and overall trying to maximize a chance of my application to be seen, but it still doesn't feel like enough.

Now let me say a few words about this country:

One of the things I've personally dreamt of is to adopt fully Canadian norms, values, and culture. Becoming a part of this Wonderful society was a dream I never thought to become a reality though. Man, to think that Sum 41 (my all time favorite music band) , Wolverine (marvel), and X mansion (from X-Men movies) are all about canada is just mind-blowing to me.
The other thing (that is currently debatable) is genuine kindness,politeness, and adequate behaviour of Canadians.
Sure I've stumbled across a few crackheads yelling incoherently in public transport, and people that have nothing in common with canadians (besides their status maybe), but I personally don't associate those with Canada, at least because Canadian values are Not about that.

Now about me: 
I'm 29 years old man of many talents. Had been living by myself since 17 (Family struggled with lack of resources, mother thought it would help me get on financial feet faster if I was in conditions where no one could help me. We rarely speak since) so I'm a quite self-reliant person. 
Fluent in 4 languages and have experience acting as a translator/interpreter/proofreader.
Good with computers and IT stuff overall. Have a life long experience using Microsoft word, excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and recently learnt to use SharePoint as well.
Spent most of my life acting as an audio engineer though, recording,mixing,composing,producing - spent almost 10 years doing it, to the point where in last 3 years (before moving to Canada) I literally lived in a record studio. Also, worked as an audio visual technician on a music stage. So anything related to software (managing, not coding) is something I'm really good at. 
Another thing to mention is my experience in customer service and administration.
It's rooted in fact that I've rarely had people in my life to simply fix whatever I needed to be fixed, so I had to learn to do it myself. I have a good knowledge in determining people's needs/issues, analyzing them (comparing to existing possible solutions/offers), and offering the best possible answer aiming at objective solution. Also, the fact that I'm multilingual opens a possibility to approach a wider demographic of clients.
.At this point I feel like I wrote too much, but I'll leave it be...
Have experience in coffee preparation (worked with coffee machines, know how to steam milk and all that, obviously know how to do same things using modern machines that automize these processes) and bartending/hookah preparations. Also, relatively good at cooking and very good at making pancakes (kind of obsessed with them).
Overall, I'm a very assisting, and supportive person and like to help people. 
Been told to have a talent to unintentionally positively influence people around, and known  as a very fast learner.
My last position was an office admin (a temporary job in Toronto) where I've been managing spreadsheets, helping with minor IT related tasks, managing printers and other PC related devices, and overall was a Go-to guy.

By creating this post I was hoping to get in touch with people interested in knowing a workaholic person like me, or at least connecting for networking reasons (finding friends sounds awesome too, since I've already learnt that Toronto's a place of lonely people and am quite alone most of the time).

During the start of our relationship, I felt like he love bombed me - he used to leave little notes and snacks at my work table, used to bring me coffee in the morning, drive me to my home whenever he is free and texts me every moment of the day. 

I immediately fell in love. Despite the age gap, he was the perfect guy. We had great sex in the first few months of our relationship, we would do it as much as we could - then came the 7 month mark. 

He just stopped initiating sex, we stopped having steamy make out sessions. He still drives me home every time, buy me my morning coffee and texts me when he can. Most of the reasons I fell inlove with him was still there.

However, the passionate sex isn’t. 

I tried to open it up to him, asking if he still finds me attractive or if I can still make him go hard. However, he kept on insisting that he is tired. Months would pass by with no sex. Just kisses on the cheeks when we say goodbye. 

I feel like he is losing interest. ",1,1733848863.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False

I am desperate!,"So over the past year I have been dealing with my 92 year old great grandmother and she ended up moving into our house. I had to adapt to this change however she is nothing but nasty and rude. She constantly tries to start arguments with my grandmother who took her in even though her mother was abusive emotionally and a negligent parent. I am in university but have been home due to mental health issues and I'm reaching a breaking point. 

She constantly forgets everything within 10 minutes you say something. ""We have an eye appointment at 1pm"" then a couple minutes later she is like ""what do we have to do?"" Then she started accusing people of using her mouth wash, says her pink diamond ring went missing yet for the record she has never owned a pink diamond and we had to sell mostly all of her stuff since we couldn't bring it all as she lives out of province. 

Recently she has started to become very agitated and if she is corrected she snaps. She forgets to take her pills and then proceeds to snap at me for letting her know she was about to throw out her pill since she didn't recognize it. Benefit of the doubt though but she has really bad eyesight and one would assume she needs to go to the doctor's for her eyes and we have set up many appointments but God forbid she leaves the house. She makes up any excuses to not see a doctor or eye specialist and it's getting on my nerves. How in the world do I tell my Grandma to just make her go so I stop hearing her complain.

My Grandma says she can't just make her go and yet she is the power of attorney. She also has not called up any nursing homes and hasn't got her diagnosed yet since now we were informed the process can take up to 6 months. I can't live like this anymore and I'm scared of her becoming violent.

She has started this new habit where she scoffs down cereal like it was alcohol and she was about to have a field amputation. I have never seen someone eat so fast and she has diabetes. I watched her eat 4 bowls of cereal in one day and 5 coffees so we go through milk like crazy and it makes me wonder if she is forgetting how much she has had. 

I also found out that whenever she sees me cook for the family for dinner she eats half if not less than her plate. Yet if she sees my grandmother cook she eats the plate clean. I felt like I was going mad because I know my cooking is good so I decided to trick her by making one of the common meals I make but made sure she wasn't around. Sure enough after telling my grandmother my test she backed me up saying she cooked it. My great grandmother proceeded to scoff down the porkchop I had made and even tried to eat parts of leftover meat off the bone because it was so good. Then my Grandma said it was my recipe and that she used it and she looked like she had a stick up her ass.

Now here is the really scary part and that is she is hearing music now at night. She complains about it and apparently she has been woken up in the night and can't sleep because it keeps playing. She becomes aggressive when my grandmother explains she can't hear it when she woke her up one night. I didn't know this but this has been happening about once or twice a month in the last couple months and now it has been 3 times this week 2 nights in a row it happened as well. She says that it was coming from my room for some reason even though I was sleeping. Thankfully my grandmother was sleeping in the basement that night at the television or else I would have been in deep trouble.

I am scared because one night I stayed up late studying in my room and I heard her come down into the basement. I could tell it was her because she clicks every single light since she doesn't know what one to use. All I remember was freezing and keeping quiet then apparently she went upstairs to go wake my grandmother where she normally sleeps. For the record no music was involved in my studying.

I am scared for my safety and I genuinely don't know why she has picked me to single out right now. Last year she grabbed my shoulders and dug her nails into them and now that she is hallucinating I don't know what to do. I have been nothing but nice to her through passing conversations I just don't talk to her a lot due to mismatching topics of interest. I also found out her hallucination in regard to the music is only one song played on repeat.

How do I deal with this and what precautions should I be taking? What has worked for you and have you also experienced this? Please help I'm desperate as I just want to feel safe in the place I live.

Hi Reddit. This is long but I'll try to keep this as simple as possible.

2014, My husband was offered a job in a new state, a we bought a new house in that state in the summer. It's a two story house, except it has an underground basement/shelter in the event of a tornado. (We live in a state where this is actually a possibility) All I know is that it is at least 110 years old.

We have two children, a 3 year old girl and 6 year old boy. Our boy has recently been diagnosed with autism. It is not severe, but it's been the biggest struggle of my life. My husband has been wonderful though throughout it all and he is a great human being. We are both agnostic. I have never belonged to a religion nor have I ever believed in ghosts or the supernatural. I feel bad about it now but I have actually before in the past openly mocked people who believe in the supernatural. I never thought I'd admit this but now I believe in the supernatural. Please hear me out on this.

Something very odd has been happening in my house and as of right now I have been unable to find believable explanations for many things.

But let me start from the beginning I guess.
When we moved in, it was obvious the house was very old and needed work done on it. Since moving in we have fixed it up a lot. It barely resembles how it looked like when we first moved in. From the summer of 2014 until January of this year, I witnessed nothing out of the ordinary. Neither did my husband. However, there is one thing that may or may not be noteworthy. and that is the dreams. Since moving in both me and my husband have experienced horrifying dreams around the beginning of each month. (The first 6/7 days) I myself am not used to nightmares, normally I rarely dream and when I do I can't remember it or it is just a stupid dream about nothing in particular. My husband however claims he has always had bad nightmares and doesn't really think it is that weird. He also takes sleeping pills often. I do not.

By the encouragement of my therapist, I have catalogued these dreams, both mine and the ones my husband tells me about, for about five months now. In that time, Here are the dreams we have had:

• The most common repeating dream for me: waking up in the middle of the night to our tv being on in our bedroom, with a newscast warning of a tornado coming very soon. My husband and I hear a storm outside. Obviously in this dream both me and my husband know that we must jump out of bed, gather our children and supplies, and run to the basement. However, when we are running to our children's room, where we THINK their rooms are, we do not find them. After looking, we find my boy in a bathtub upstairs, our girl in a closet. Our boy screams how he just woke up in the bathtub. We grab our kids and run to the kitchen for supplies. Our kitchen is completely empty. There is nothing in the kitchen. We run to the basement. When we run to the basement there is a dead body in it. The dead body is my husband. At this point I look at my husband Jim (the one standing next to me, not dead) and he says ""Michelle I am really sorry. I have never been real. I do not exist. Goodbye."" Then I wake up.

My husband's most common dream: Waking up in the middle of night, rolling over and seeing me dead with a knife through my chest and I am screaming. After seeing this he immediately gets called into work. For whatever reason my husband throws my body into our bathtub and tells me he will be right back. He then goes to work. Only to find that the building where he works is no longer there. It is at this point that in the dream he completely forgets who he is or where he is, how to get home. He then wakes up.

Other dreams we have had: -Our children dying in horrific ways. -One of us finding out that the other has never actually existed. (We have both had these dreams) 

- Phone calls from dead relatives asking us over and over why did we move into the house, when are we moving out (both of us have this dream)

- Waking up covered head to toe in blood (my dream) - having another baby named James, our autistic boy kills James (both of us have had this) -Waking up to someone with an ax cutting an arm off (my husband's dream) - I'm in the kitchen cleaning and preparing for a visit from my husband's family, when I suddenly realize that I am in our old house, the old kitchen. I freak out. I have no idea how I got there. I call my husband and he picks up. Asks me where have I been, the police have been looking for me for two years. I tell him that somehow I am in our old house. He says that's impossible, the house burned down years ago. I wake up.

Anyways, there are many others, but those are the most common. These dreams happen in the first 6-7 days of each month.
Now to what I have actually seen and experienced in REAL life.

Since January of this year:

• Several unexplained phone calls from an unknown number. I'd say this has happened about 15-20 times since January of this year. Phone rings at 4 pm, you pick up the phone and it is a lady on the other end screaming for help, saying the tornado is coming and she needs help, her baby is hurt, where do we live. After the first time receiving this phone call, we called the police, who haven't been much help. They have been unable to tell us anything except that the calls are sometimes coming from New York and sometimes from California. That makes no sense to me. I don't know anyone in Cal. I have never been to NY. Neither has my husband.

• Our tv, our ceiling lights, our fans, our washing machine/dryer, the night light in my baby girls room, they all turn on and off completely on their own. My husband notices this, says it is creepy but probably because the house is so old. He becomes annoyed with me whenever I bring it up.

• Many things have disappeared. Towels, forks, spoons, toys, three of my purses, bathroom items such as face wash, shampoo, soap. Old coins from my husband's coin collection, pictures and their frames, sometimes frames are left behind. Socks, pens, pencils. An entire chair. My husband says we just need to look harder, we will find them. Probably the children took them. I've searched everywhere...

-Both my husband and I, and several people who have been in our house for long periods, lose track of time A LOT while in the house. the scariest moments :

• one day I was pouring cereal, I started to feel very weird. I put the milk down, it was 9 am. I sit in a chair and breathe slowly, tell myself I just need to eat something and I'll be okay. I'm staring at the table trying to focus in my breathing. The next thing I know I hear the baby crying for me and I jump up and start walking to her room when I notice the time reads 12:32 pm. My husband has experience similar episodes, says it is probably bc of his medication.

• This is something that happened with my friend and I: For weeks we had been planning for her to visit me one day (I rarely see her). We had been talking about her bringing her little boy Austin over to play with my son. The day finally comes for her visit and I completely forget she was supposed to come. She rings the doorbell and I open the door and suddenly remember and feel embarrassed. I let her in and we go to the kitchen. I start feeling very weird again and so does my friend. I have one hand gripping the edge of my sink, my friend is sitting at the table. The next thing I know I hear my baby crying again and I look at the time on the stove. HOURS have gone by and I start freaking out. I suddenly remember my friend was supposed to bring her son. I ask her where her son is. She looks at me for a long time and starts crying, saying she forgot she had a child. She jumps up and runs out of the house saying she has no idea where her baby is. Luckily when she got home her son was in his room still sleeping. I tell my husband and he says the stress has probably been getting to both of us lately.

Okay, now for the scariest moment that has ever happened to me that has prompted me to conclude that my house is haunted:

A few weeks ago I wake up to a completely black figure standing in my door way pointing at my window. I start screaming thinking it is an intruder. Obviously my husband wakes up and I scream ""someone is in the house"" and he grabs the rifle we keep in our bedroom, checks our whole room. Tells me to stay in the room with our other gun, which is a handgun. I'm laying in bed honestly shocked, thinking I am dreaming. I'm thinking to myself I've never used a gun before. Suddenly there's a loud knock coming from the window, I see the black figure again and start screaming. My husband suddenly bursts into the room, flips the light on, I look at the window the black figure is gone. My husband is violently shaking and crying saying the baby is gone. We call the police and search the whole house. We find our girl in a closet.

Just like in my dreams. She was in a closet... There is currently a police investigation going over what happened that night, but so far no leads, and there was no evidence of a break in.

Since that night I have been struggling with depression, my husband and I have been fighting more and more. He doesn't believe the house is haunted, he says hurtful things like I need to see a doctor, I'm just stressed, I shouldn't be acting like a child, I need to be reasonable otherwise the children will get scared. Reddit I have no idea what to do, where to go from here, what to say to my husband to get him to believe. Something is going on in this house and I cannot stand living here any longer. I feel like I haven't slept in years. I'm constantly anxious. I'm nervous about by marriage, my son's autism. My son keeps asking me why do I let the bad people in the house. He asks me if I have seen the bad man. He asks me ""what happened to my brother James?""

To clarify once more I do not have another son named James.

Reddit any advice is welcome. Am I crazy?

**tl;dr:** I believe my house is haunted. my husband does not believe so. I feel depressed and I can't take it anymore.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all your responses so far. I appreciate everyone's helpful input. I have never experienced mental issues, so I am more inclined to believe that this may be a gas leak or some poisoning. Also extreme stress and lack of sleep. But still, some things are not explainable by a gas leak or stress or lack of sleep. I showed my husband and the responses. We have decided to gather some of our things and move in to a hotel room until we sort everything out. Find some answers... I'll keep you all updated.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**doublenut**

>There was a story once about someone suspecting very strange intruder-ish things on a regular basis and sounding crazy, it turns out he was suffering chronic CO poisoning.

>Look at things like CO and lead plumbing, mold and other things that can mess you up.

**OOP**

>>I haven't considered leaks, gases. I'll look into it.

**syncopacetic**

>Everyone is talking about carbon monoxide and that sounds totally reasonable to me, but why the hell did her friend forget her baby before she even arrived to the house??

>Edit: unless the friend arriving and everything to do with it was a dream/hallucination...

**lollappaloosa**

>>Right?!? I'm guessing it was a hallucination (much like the post from a couple months ago, the OP hallucinated her husband cheating on her right in front of her and her friends at a BBQ that her friends confirmed she didn't have; can't remember the outcome of that one). Even if the house was leaking gas (or ""haunted"") that wouldn't affect the friend before she came over!

**OOP**

>>>To clarify:

>>>My friend experienced the episode as well, not just me, and I spoke to her face to face over coffee the other day at Starbucks and we talked about the incident. according to her, she had been feeling weird that whole day, then suddenly remember she was supposed to go to my house for some reason. She said her thoughts were very jumbled and she felt very weird, kept forgetting what day it was. When she came to my house she says she had zero thoughts about her child. Completely forgot about her boy and that she was supposed to bring him. Until hours later when we both snapped out of the episode when my baby girl started crying. So yeah... Maybe THAT was a gas leak, maybe not. She swears by it and I believe her.

Through its global portfolio of companies and its venture studio, CULT provides investors with unprecedented exposure to the most innovative start-up, private or early-stage cultivated meat, cell-based dairy, and other cultured food companies around the world (including chocolate, honey, seafood).

Any investment comes with risk but I see a lot of mitigation with the additional benefits and flexibility packed into this investment. Many companies have a single device or magic trick they are selling – if I use a roulette betting analogy – for many companies you have a single chip to place on a roulette board (out of 38 possible outcomes). For CULT, I see a stack of chips covering more of the board.

**Here’s why:**

**Early products in the Pet Space**: They currently have 4 skus in the pet food space – with others in development. Their differentiator is using proprietary nutritional yeast; premium products that are better for your pets. They are early and in the awareness stage. Don't minimize the pet space - Kevin O'Leary's biggest % winner on Shark Tank was in the pet space [https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinolearytv/video/7258112917327842603](https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinolearytv/video/7258112917327842603)

**The Cellular Agriculture space:** Projected to go to $370B by 2030. The fact that beef prices today are unaffordable to many people – this new technology is welcome to tackle a sustainability challenge for the planet/population. They are starting in the pet space because it’s a much shorter regulatory pathway before tackling any human consumption. And don’t think pet food is tiny – 30% of the meat supply goes to pet food. FDA approval to be the first pet food brand in North America to sell products with cell agri meat would drive this stock to nose bleed levels.

**No longer a question of “if” but “when”:** Countries around the world are becoming more accepting of this technology. It’s revolutionary. It’s disruptive. It’s doesn’t happen overnight. Just last week there was regulatory approval for cultivated foie gras ([https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cult-food-science-applauds-regulatory-approval-of-cultivated-foie-gras-and-breakthrough-in-cost-parity-for-cultivated-chicken-897656103.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cult-food-science-applauds-regulatory-approval-of-cultivated-foie-gras-and-breakthrough-in-cost-parity-for-cultivated-chicken-897656103.html)). This could have the potential to reduce food insecurity and maybe fewer opportunities for animal diseases to evolve and infects humans. Internal combustion engine car companies hated the idea of electric vehicles disrupting their space – but now they are retooling plants and offering electric options to their customers (or they’ll lose them).

**Portfolio appreciation:** Their investments in 18 companies want to disrupt plenty of food types: honey, milk, oysters, chocolate, eggs, beef, coffee, seafood, collagen, gelatin. Not a one trick pony. Their last earnings showed up to 250% value appreciating in these holdings.

**Scarcity of investment:** CULT is uniquely positioned as having the first mover advantage. It is the ONLY publicly traded company of its kind in North America.

**CEO:** It’s not his first rodeo. He led the top performing IPO globally of 2020 and shares went from 25 cents to $9.50 and at its peak and hit \~$1B market cap. A 3,700% ROI for investors that got in on the ground floor and exited at the peak. Unfortunately, that particular company didn’t live up to its valuation in the end but for those investors that got in on the ground floor and exited at the penthouse their biggest challenge today is deciding between Lamborghini and Ferrari.

**In the news:** There is no doubt the cellular agriculture space is now going to be in the news due to the tragic events of last week based on the actions of a high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate that had a very active social media presence (i.e. the person of interest in the UHC CEO tragedy) – the bulk of which was promoting cellular agriculture as a food revolution. People are now combing through his X account where he posted many times about this and you can bet this will be on every news network where they will dissect every post and word where he compared the cell agri space to solar power and EV batteries. I am not saying he is right, nor am I on his side - I am simply saying this guy will be studied like a guinea pig and on every news channel around the world for his every utterance and this will undoubtedly bring awareness to this tech as he championed this in his social media.

Currently stock is up and fluctuating between a gain of 28% and 42% since my post last month. The stock price is still so cheap it limits downside and offers huge upside potential. Please do your own DD – this isn’t investment advice.",1,1733848608.0,Canadapennystocks,4,0.67,False

This would be my first coffee machine - I mostly drink latte's or frothy milk-based coffee drinks, but can occasionally like an expresso. Would getting a Philips 5500 be suitable for me? Or is there anything better for my requirements? 

Also is there anything else I should be aware of before buying the Philips 5500? Thanks

1hb5u36,https://www.reddit.com/r/DementiaHelp/comments/1hb5u36/help_me_she_is_crazy/,Help me! She is crazy!,"So over the past year I have been dealing with my 92 year old great grandmother and she ended up moving into our house. I had to adapt to this change however she is nothing but nasty and rude. She constantly tries to start arguments with my grandmother who took her in even though her mother was abusive emotionally and a negligent parent. I am in university but have been home due to mental health issues and I'm reaching a breaking point. 

She constantly forgets everything within 10 minutes you say something. ""We have an eye appointment at 1pm"" then a couple minutes later she is like ""what do we have to do?"" Then she started accusing people of using her mouth wash, says her pink diamond ring went missing yet for the record she has never owned a pink diamond and we had to sell mostly all of her stuff since we couldn't bring it all as she lives out of province. 

Recently she has started to become very agitated and if she is corrected she snaps. She forgets to take her pills and then proceeds to snap at me for letting her know she was about to throw out her pill since she didn't recognize it. Benefit of the doubt though but she has really bad eyesight and one would assume she needs to go to the doctor's for her eyes and we have set up many appointments but God forbid she leaves the house. She makes up any excuses to not see a doctor or eye specialist and it's getting on my nerves. How in the world do I tell my Grandma to just make her go so I stop hearing her complain.

My Grandma says she can't just make her go and yet she is the power of attorney. She also has not called up any nursing homes and hasn't got her diagnosed yet since now we were informed the process can take up to 6 months. I can't live like this anymore and I'm scared of her becoming violent.

She has started this new habit where she scoffs down cereal like it was alcohol and she was about to have a field amputation. I have never seen someone eat so fast and she has diabetes. I watched her eat 4 bowls of cereal in one day and 5 coffees so we go through milk like crazy and it makes me wonder if she is forgetting how much she has had. 

I also found out that whenever she sees me cook for the family for dinner she eats half if not less than her plate. Yet if she sees my grandmother cook she eats the plate clean. I felt like I was going mad because I know my cooking is good so I decided to trick her by making one of the common meals I make but made sure she wasn't around. Sure enough after telling my grandmother my test she backed me up saying she cooked it. My great grandmother proceeded to scoff down the porkchop I had made and even tried to eat parts of leftover meat off the bone because it was so good. Then my Grandma said it was my recipe and that she used it and she looked like she had a stick up her ass.

Now here is the really scary part and that is she is hearing music now at night. She complains about it and apparently she has been woken up in the night and can't sleep because it keeps playing. She becomes aggressive when my grandmother explains she can't hear it when she woke her up one night. I didn't know this but this has been happening about once or twice a month in the last couple months and now it has been 3 times this week 2 nights in a row it happened as well. She says that it was coming from my room for some reason even though I was sleeping. Thankfully my grandmother was sleeping in the basement that night at the television or else I would have been in deep trouble.

I am scared because one night I stayed up late studying in my room and I heard her come down into the basement. I could tell it was her because she clicks every single light since she doesn't know what one to use. All I remember was freezing and keeping quiet then apparently she went upstairs to go wake my grandmother where she normally sleeps. For the record no music was involved in my studying.

I am scared for my safety and I genuinely don't know why she has picked me to single out right now. Last year she grabbed my shoulders and dug her nails into them and now that she is hallucinating I don't know what to do. I have been nothing but nice to her through passing conversations I just don't talk to her a lot due to mismatching topics of interest. I also found out her hallucination in regard to the music is only one song played on repeat.

How do I deal with this and what precautions should I be taking? What has worked for you and have you also experienced this? Please help I'm desperate as I just want to feel safe in the place I live.

I decided to give him another chance, so I wouldn't feel like a quitter. I went and had a talk with his assistant and he was a lot calmer after that, if a bit passive aggressive at first.

Today he told me that next week I'm going to give my driving test. I asked him if I'm really ready for it and he said that we've had 8 lessons already and we need to get it over with. That... doesn't sound encouraging. I drive well, for the most part, but my spatial awareness is bad and I have ADHD and I feel like I don't notice things as much as I should. I drive too close to cars that are parked to the right, I don't always know how close to a traffic light I need to stop and I also do stupid things like use the wrong turn light. He also said that I drove perfectly last on Friday but today I would probably fail. I was distracted today, it's true. I didn't have enough coffee and I took muscle relaxants last night and I think they were still in effect because I felt like a zombie.

Anyway, the obligatory lessons by law are 20 (or 25, I'm not sure). I went in prepared to suck at driving and having to do all of them and then pay for extra classes, too. It seems absurd that he'd think I'm ready so soon. We'll have another 3 classes, I think, this week and I might get PTO from work so I can fit in one on Monday, too, because the test will be Tuesday - Thursday, not sure yet. I kinda want to feel like he thinks I can pass the test and get excited but my anxiety and general tendency to think the worst of myself tells me that this is a huge mistake. Like, how the fuck am I going to give the test already, this is absurd!",4,1733848442.0,drivinganxiety,10,0.84,False

>My parents have been absolute pillars of support to my family over the past year, and I really want to give them something that shows how much we appreciate them. My budget is far lower than what they deserve, in both money and time. Bluntly, I'm exhausted and hardly getting through each day, so I don't have a lot of extra energy to expend on the kind of gift they really deserve. Any ideas for something that will reflect how much we appreciate them that I can obtain before Christmas? Open to unconventional and creative ideas, especially ""experience"" gifts, but reiterating that I have very limited energy and time for DIY.

>They are in their early 60s and love travel and camping. They have an eye for design and enjoy quality products and investment pieces over gimmicky stuff. They enjoy food and all kinds of drinks, both at home and out. They are involved and devoted grandparents to my kids and, as previously mentioned, fantastic parents. Happy to answer any follow-up questions about their interests and preferences if needed!

I've caught myself at a not so high weight, and have already lost 44lbs to get back down to the size I'm used to. I'm now 131lbs, and I'm looking to lose about 10lbs-ish more. I'm also 5'7"" if that helps!

I do have PCOS and have had it since I was 14yrs old. I also have Celiac's Disease so I'm eating a high protein diet (or higher than my normal) by replacing my Starbucks with Slate coffee cans and my regular snack with a protein greek yoghurt. I also will have access to a swimming pool for exercising, and I basically just swim until I can't and I float and then swim again, but I have to wait til it's warm enough to use. 

I'm most familiar with going on long, day long hikes - but I'm looking to start practicing some home exercises that would target my abdomen in order to help me achieve a flatter stomach, and then others that would help build up my hips/glutes while trying to keep my calves and such more slim. I did a lot of running, so they're kind of more muscular than anything else already. 

Currently all I do are squats + planks of different varieties, donkey kicks, fire hydrants, and using stairs or incline walks. I've made more of an effort to be happy and outgoing again, like climbing a tree for the first time in seven years the other week, since being active is the best way to get anything further done with my weight.

I want to do IF as well, but what length would be most effective for me with my PCOS?

Thank you anyone for your input!! I'm primarily just seeking the names of exercises to do so I can build my confidence (ass), after this crazy year of losing all that weight and feeling relatively the same about myself :)

EDIT: I'm mostly (only) familiar with my BMR, TDEE, and recommended water + protein intake! I've been in a deficit for a while in order to lose the 44lbs :) ",0,1733848374.0,WorkoutRoutines,5,0.5,False

I've always had mental health issues but life got pretty bad for me (and many others) during this time. I became an alcoholic on top of already being a stoner and gained 30ish pounds while I also transitioned from a very active job to a more office-based job. 

Last year I figured my shit out, got some help, and I've been (mostly) sober for a year now. Well, clean from most substances.... except caffeine. 

I've been a pot-a-day guy for 15 years and most of my fast food consumption was related to cheap coffee stores like timmies or mcdongers. The idea of still being addicted to something became deeply uncomfortable, so I decided to kick my final substance dependency out the door so I can start out fresh and keep getting my life back on track (and maybe save a bit of money). So a week ago, I dropped it for good while limiting myself to one cup of green tea in the morning and herbal tea throughout the rest of the day.

My body is going wild. Here are the things that are happening:

* I'm sleeping almost 2x as much as I used to. I've been firmly in bed at 7:30pm and I'm averaging at least 10 hours of sleep after years of 5-6 hours of sleep
* I'm super hungry ALL of the time, yet I can only eat half of what I'd normally eat before until I feel full (which is good since I need to lose weight)
* Energy levels are through the shitter, which is to be expected for the time being
* My motivation is way up and I can't explain it. I'm bad for sitting at home doing nothing and being a bit of a nobody, but I'm suddenly as motivated as ever to pick up old hobbies, exercise, and eat better
* The headaches are pretty bad at night but I've been sleeping through the worst of it
* I'm thirsty AF. I rarely just sit down and drink water unless I'm active, but I just cant get enough of water now. This water stuff is pretty good!

Coffee is obviously ridiculously popular and I'm not suggesting people quit drinking it, but it made the most sense for me. 

Here's to a healthier future for myself!",14,1733848231.0,CasualConversation,11,0.89,False

In the case of a larger more leafy cut, I can't seem to get a mountain to hold to save my life! I can't help but think there's a slight technique I'm doing wrong because a lot of cebadors I've seen online don't seem to have this issue. 
I've tried packing my wet mate with a large spoon instead of my bombilla and have gotten slightly better results but still find the mountain just slowly drowns regardless (total non-issue as I'm drinking the whole thing anyways, it just really bothers me for some reason. At worst i just find myself going through more yerba because I end up making a fresh batch as it lost its fantastic sabor too early)
My only other guess is that I need to put more yerba initially to give it a larger base, but I feel my water to leaf ratio is way off and I have to refill after about two sips and usually still have the same issue after maybe two refills.
Any suggestions? Should I go as far as coffee-grindering my larger cuts?

Assuming you’re decently educated and have an actual career for a job then imo you can support yourself just fine. 

The issue is that people are overspending. It’s so funny when people go on vacations and trips four times a month, eat out every single day, etc, then complain about the cost of living being too high. Like it’s not a choice you made. 

It reminds me of a YouTube clip of mark cuban or some billionaire saying you can make Starbucks coffee for 50 cents at home. People got mad because the ‘rich’ was saying it, but he was objectively saying the truth. 

Even for low tier jobs like fast food’s McDonalds. Well for starters the pettiness in me wants to scream ""THAT BAD JOB IS YOUR OWN FAULT"" but that’s another topic for another day. 

A lot of the issues (not all) but a lot, seems to stem from personal choice. 

I saw a documentary a while back about a poor mother struggling with food stamps working at fast food, but then it was revealed she had 5 different children from 5 baby daddies. 

So girl knew she was barely afloat solo (with bad spending habits), then decided to get knocked up not once, not twice, but FIVE TIMES IN A ROW. 

I can hear the screams in the comments already, but imo there’s personal responsibility at play in most cases which I feel like goes overlooked.

","Dearest reader,

I'm sending you this letter because I saw you lurking on reddit again and wanted to say hi. Specifically to you though, not the other people reading this. No those other people are cool, but I'd rather be avoiding my job today with you. Plus they wouldn't understand our lame humor anyway. And our overly sarcastic way of speaking, even though it doesn't translate well through text. Rarely does it translate well through text.

I know I know, you said you were busy today. You have all those things on your to do list, you should really be focusing right now, and plus you didn't really sleep all that great last night. I get it. But all I'm saying is, take a break for 5 minutes. I know you haven't had enough water yet today, so relax for a sec. I'll even pick you up something for that little coffee shop near by. The aesthetically pleasing one that has just-okay over priced coffee but the place is such a nice vibe and you feel like it's a small victory whenever you can spend money at a local shop instead of going to Starbucks again this week. Yea that place!

We could talk about your day, or your week if you want. Did you wanna vent about that thing your co-worker said that you don't care about anymore but you still care about for some inexplicable reason? Or I could talk if you just want to listen.

But I'm gonna run to the coffee shop now, but remind me. What did you want me to pick you up again?

1hb5jnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hb5jnj/cult_food_science_is_up_to_a_42_gain_since_my/,$CULT Food Science is up to a 42% gain since my post last month,"**What is $CULT (CSE) / CULTF (OTC) / LNO (FRA):** It is the first publicly-traded company of its kind in North America, pioneering the investment, development, and commercialization of cellular agriculture technologies and products. Through its global portfolio of companies and its venture studio, CULT provides investors with unprecedented exposure to the most innovative start-up, private or early-stage cultivated meat, cell-based dairy, and other cultured food companies around the world (including chocolate, honey, seafood).

Any investment comes with risk but I see a lot of mitigation with the additional benefits and flexibility packed into this investment. Many companies have a single device or magic trick they are selling – if I use a roulette betting analogy – for many companies you have a single chip to place on a roulette board (out of 38 possible outcomes). For CULT, I see a stack of chips covering more of the board.

**Here’s why:**

**Early products in the Pet Space**: They currently have 4 skus in the pet food space – with others in development. Their differentiator is using proprietary nutritional yeast; premium products that are better for your pets. They are early and in the awareness stage. Don't minimize the pet space - Kevin O'Leary's biggest % winner on Shark Tank was in the pet space [https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinolearytv/video/7258112917327842603](https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinolearytv/video/7258112917327842603)

**The Cellular Agriculture space:** Projected to go to $370B by 2030. The fact that beef prices today are unaffordable to many people – this new technology is welcome to tackle a sustainability challenge for the planet/population. They are starting in the pet space because it’s a much shorter regulatory pathway before tackling any human consumption. And don’t think pet food is tiny – 30% of the meat supply goes to pet food. FDA approval to be the first pet food brand in North America to sell products with cell agri meat would drive this stock to nose bleed levels.

**No longer a question of “if” but “when”:** Countries around the world are becoming more accepting of this technology. It’s revolutionary. It’s disruptive. It’s doesn’t happen overnight. Just last week there was regulatory approval for cultivated foie gras ([https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cult-food-science-applauds-regulatory-approval-of-cultivated-foie-gras-and-breakthrough-in-cost-parity-for-cultivated-chicken-897656103.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cult-food-science-applauds-regulatory-approval-of-cultivated-foie-gras-and-breakthrough-in-cost-parity-for-cultivated-chicken-897656103.html)). This could have the potential to reduce food insecurity and maybe fewer opportunities for animal diseases to evolve and infects humans. Internal combustion engine car companies hated the idea of electric vehicles disrupting their space – but now they are retooling plants and offering electric options to their customers (or they’ll lose them).

**Portfolio appreciation:** Their investments in 18 companies want to disrupt plenty of food types: honey, milk, oysters, chocolate, eggs, beef, coffee, seafood, collagen, gelatin. Not a one trick pony. Their last earnings showed up to 250% value appreciating in these holdings.

**Scarcity of investment:** CULT is uniquely positioned as having the first mover advantage. It is the ONLY publicly traded company of its kind in North America.

**CEO:** It’s not his first rodeo. He led the top performing IPO globally of 2020 and shares went from 25 cents to $9.50 and at its peak and hit \~$1B market cap. A 3,700% ROI for investors that got in on the ground floor and exited at the peak. Unfortunately, that particular company didn’t live up to its valuation in the end but for those investors that got in on the ground floor and exited at the penthouse their biggest challenge today is deciding between Lamborghini and Ferrari.

**In the news:** There is no doubt the cellular agriculture space is now going to be in the news due to the tragic events of last week based on the actions of a high school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate that had a very active social media presence (i.e. the person of interest in the UHC CEO tragedy) – the bulk of which was promoting cellular agriculture as a food revolution. People are now combing through his X account where he posted many times about this and you can bet this will be on every news network where they will dissect every post and word where he compared the cell agri space to solar power and EV batteries. I am not saying he is right, nor am I on his side - I am simply saying this guy will be studied like a guinea pig and on every news channel around the world for his every utterance and this will undoubtedly bring awareness to this tech as he championed this in his social media.

Currently stock is up and fluctuating between a gain of 28% and 42% since my post last month. The stock price is still so cheap it limits downside and offers huge upside potential. Please do your own DD – this isn’t investment advice.",11,1733847768.0,pennystocks,6,0.93,False

1hb5ixe,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1hb5ixe/workin_at_a_deli_pretty_much_cured_me/,Workin at a deli pretty much cured me ,"So for context, I am a 20 year old male who used to have brutal social anxiety.
For years it was nothing but pain and agony in school. I remember consistently having to leave the classroom to get a drink or to go to the bathroom so I could see how sweaty and sick I looked. I’m not kidding, I thought I was going insane. 
Senior year I decided to make a change. I wasn’t going to let anything or anyone stop me. Even if I am a scary or awkward person I don’t care, I will be who I want to be and I will come out on top. Even if I become a bad person it’s better than being nervous all the time. 

At this time, for most of high school, I had very few close friends. Zero actually.  I had friends but they didn’t actually want to do anything after school or hang out. I went to class parties which wasn’t that bad but it would still cause me a lot of anxiety. Rolling up to a girls house for a party practically gave me a heart attack every time. Walking through those doors was like entering the colosseum where I would be performing something awkward for everyone else’s pleasure. This was my mindset from about 7th grade to the beginning of senior year. 

Fast forward to senior year and I suddenly clicked with a few of my friends. I grew closer in my friendships and started to look forward to the future.
Towards the end of senior year my anxiety went way down. By this point I had intentionally made about 6-7 very close friends whom I didn’t know that well. Graduation was hard. I go to a private Christian school where their ceremony is extremely extravagant and drawn out. I was on the spot for about 2 minutes but surprisingly, I felt relaxed. I felt powerful and giant in front of the crowd, because in that moment, I didn’t care a single thing they were thinking. They were there to watch ME, and they couldn’t leave. I enjoyed graduation, and for the first time, I enjoyed the attention I received. See this is the key part that clicked for me, I saw the attention being on me as a positive. Sure, negative attention can cause anxiety, but most people with social anxiety are PREPARING for negative attention, it’s not usually a response to something that’s already happened.

After graduation I decided to take a gap year and stack money for school, and to find out some of my passions. I took a job at a deli where I would be dealing with customers for 8 hours straight. The first two-three days were the hardest of my life, but I got through it. There were times where I was the only employee running the department when everyone else was on break and here I was managing everything and talking to customers like it wasn’t a problem. I never would have even considered this a possibility when I was in junior year of high school. Getting orders wrong isnt that uncommon, since I take orders over a hundred times a day. But when I do, I don’t feel and anxiety or panic. I don’t care. I learn from my mistake and move on, because I’m more important than that. I’m more important than caring about the thickness of Swiss cheese. I thought I was a defective human. I can now have quality interactions with people I’ve never met and I usually make the first interaction. It’s awesome. As for friends we meet up a few times a week and stay in touch all the time. They have been so supportive and I really think they are a crucial part in solving my problem. 

Some tips I can give you: You have to start making close friends if you don’t have any. Having people you can call or go to the gym with, or sit down for lunch with is incredibly important and introversion isn’t a valid excuse for not trying to make friends. Be intentional and you won’t be as anxious. 

Stop drinking coffee. Brutal I know, but I won’t lie that was a big factor in this. I am 77 days decaf. I tried a monster about a week ago and some of the nervousness came back. It’s poison. 

In the last year I’ve taken a girl to prom, danced in front of everyone, given speeches, made close friends, and cleared away my social anxiety. Sometimes I can’t believe it. ",6,1733847716.0,socialanxiety,2,0.8,False

For context, I’m planning to leave this job soon, so the fact that we work together won’t be an issue in the long term. Here’s the background:

1. Our dynamic so far:

When I first asked her if she’d like to hang out outside of work, she mentioned that she tries to keep things strictly friendly with colleagues but she likes to meet anyway. Since then, we’ve been spending more time together outside of work – grabbing coffee, going for walks, and even going out for dinner together.

Our interactions are mostly light and fun, but we’ve also had deep conversations. She’s opened up to me about personal topics, like how her ex manipulated her, and she’s mentioned she struggles to trust men. Despite this, I feel like she enjoys spending time with me.

She remembers small details about what I say, maintains good eye contact, and seems comfortable. However, there’s very little physical contact – something I haven’t initiated much either.



2. Mixed signals:

She has told me about other men hitting on her. Sometimes it feels like she’s just making conversation; other times, I wonder if she’s subtly hinting that I need to act faster.

When we’re together, she doesn’t seem in a rush to leave. At one point, after a date, we talked outside her place for a long time until I was the one to end it.



3. Recent developments:

I was looking forward to Party next saturday, which seemed like a great chance to make a move. Unfortunately, she’s canceled. This feels like a big missed opportunity, and now I’m questioning how to proceed.

I don’t want to push her, especially given her trust issues, but I also don’t want her to think I’m only interested in friendship 



4. My concerns:

I’ve been patient because I know she needs time to trust, but I feel stuck. I worry that waiting too long will put me in the “friend zone.”

At the same time, I don’t want to come on too strong and risk ruining the connection we’ve built.

Since I plan to leave this job soon, I feel like this is a window of opportunity to see if there’s potential between us.




What I’d like advice on:

How do I show her I’m interested romantically without pressuring her?

Would it be better to wait until after the holidays to ask her out again, or should I try to set something up now?

Should I take her talking about other men as a sign to act or just casual conversation?

Any tips on how to gauge her feelings or create opportunities for something more to happen?


Any insight would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in adapter!",0,1733847571.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

(The last time it went wrong  I had three sores in a row for almost a month so I’ve been doing really well). But hi! I’m back here again.

I read this post that said to immediately clean your mouth and do salt water rinses almost every hour after biting your lip/cheek etc. So I did and I thought it was going pretty well, I even thought it was about to heal normally but then it turned into a sore anyway 😭 I’m not sure if it was gonna turn into a sore anyway or if I irritated it with something (maybe coffee?).

I hate how for some people biting their mouth is no big deal. To me/us it means days of discomfort. I also have this mouth guard for sleeping that I can’t wear which means I will also get a tense jaw for the next couple of days. Crossing my fingers it’s gone by Christmas. And crossing my fingers even more I will chew slowly for the next few months 😭",3,1733847378.0,CankerSores,0,1.0,False
