1lsg791,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1lsg791/ca_california_lawmakers_side_with_landlords_to/,CA - California lawmakers side with landlords to kill renter eviction relief - From CalMatters,"Sen. [Aisha Wahab](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/aisha-wahab-165437) implored her colleagues to think of hospitalized patients and struggling families as she pitched a proposal to give tenants a full two weeks to pay their past due rent before their landlords could start the eviction process.

“This is a very small ask from the state of California,” Wahab, a Democrat representing the Fremont area, recently [told her fellow lawmakers](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=1695&f=e7d8da7de4e38d154c3fdedbdc9467d7). “(It’s) very small to allow people 14 days to either ask for family members and loved ones to give them money to stay housed, to ask their cities or any of the other nonprofits that help people with rental assistance stay housed, or to even be able to wait for their check.”

Despite Wahab’s pleas, her [Senate Bill 436](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260sb436) failed to advance out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee last week.

It was the latest example of progressive Democrats’ struggles to add protections for California’s 17 million renters, despite lawmakers otherwise taking aggressive steps this year to address the state’s housing and homelessness crises.

Just this week, after a decade of failed efforts, Gov. Gavin Newsom [signed legislation](https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/06/ceqa-urban-development-infill-budget/) to reform the state’s signature environmental law to stop activists from using it to block housing construction. The proposal easily passed the Senate and Assembly, despite angering the state’s influential environmental groups.

But when it comes to giving tenants more power and easing some of the nation’s highest rents, California voters and the 120 senators and Assembly members who represent them have largely balked.

Last fall, California voters [decisively shot down](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/11/california-election-results-prop-33-rent-control/) a rent-control initiative that would have allowed local governments to block landlords from raising rents. A more aggressive [rent-control measure](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab1157) never received a hearing this spring in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, even though it was authored by San Jose Assemblymember [Ash Kalra](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/ash-kalra-100938), the committee chair.

Another bill to [limit fees](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab1248) landlords can charge tenants on top of monthly rent was held until at least next year, despite the author being San Francisco Assemblymember [Matt Haney](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/matt-haney-165453), the chair of the Assembly Housing Committee.

The stalled bills were a remarkable display of how difficult it is for lawmakers to pass rental protection measures since committee chairs usually are influential. Wahab chairs the Senate Housing Committee. 

Her measure, which would have extended the start of the past due eviction process from three days to two weeks, is the latest setback for the Legislature’s 10-person legislative Renters’ Caucus, which counts Wahab and Haney as members.

**Renter protections divide Democrats**

What makes the death of Wahab’s bill especially unusual is that it happened during a committee hearing in public view and featured Democrats joining Republicans to shoot it down. [As CalMatters reported](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/12/failed-bills-california/), most legislation killed in the California Legislature dies quietly behind the scenes, without a vote. It’s also [rare for Democrats to vote “no”](https://calmatters.org/digital-democracy/2024/04/california-democrats-no-votes/) on a fellow Democrat’s bill.

The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s debate highlighted the tensions between the Democratic supermajority’s progressive and more moderate members on rental protections.

Downey Assemblymember [Blanca Pacheco](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/blanca-pacheco-165430), an attorney, said [she used to represent landlords](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=272&f=c660a7920cd75d4ca5d05e629d165850) in eviction proceedings, and said the current three-day rule is just the start of an “eviction process can easily take two months, three months, four months.”

“I worry about these mom and pop landlords,” [she said](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=337&f=c660a7920cd75d4ca5d05e629d165850). “I worry about these seniors who are going to have a hardship because they rely on this money for their expenses, for their mortgage, for whatever they need. And we’re putting them in a very bad situation.”

Kalra, the committee’s chair, is also an attorney, but he saw things from the renter’s point of view. 

“They’re renters because a lot of those in the previous generations were able to buy homes 30, 40, 50-plus years ago that are completely unaffordable now,” [he said](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=123&f=bee4c5e0f33ed0ab6fa34a7d87f25eb6). “Was that their fault (previous generations) were able to do that? Absolutely not. Is it their fault that they now can rent those properties out for a handsome sum? Absolutely not, but that’s the reality of the situation we’re in.”

Noting that [Consumer Affairs](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/moving/best-states-for-renters.html) recently ranked California as one of the worst states for renters, [he said](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=182&f=bee4c5e0f33ed0ab6fa34a7d87f25eb6) the proposed extra 11 days “actually allows the problem to be resolved before you even get to that (eviction) process, which is to everyone’s benefit.”

Landlord advocacy groups and other critics of the bills also note that California already has among the strongest state renter protection laws in the country.

**Landlords and bankers spend big**

The bill needed seven votes to pass. It got six. Kalra voted for the measure, joining five other Democrats on the committee, including [Isaac Bryan](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/isaac-bryan-165440) of Culver City and [Alex Lee](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/alex-lee-162481) of Milpitas, both members of the renters caucus. 

Pacheco cast a “no” vote, one of only seven times she’s done so in 2,271 voting opportunities so far this year, according to the [Digital Democracy database](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/). 

The three Republicans on the committee also voted “no.” Two Democrats, [Diane Papan](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/diane-papan-165423) of San Mateo, and [John Harabedian](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/legislators/john-harabedian-187422) of Pasadena, didn’t vote, which counts the same as voting no.

The death of the eviction relief measure also points to the David vs. Goliath-sized discrepancies in the political spending between renters’ and landlords’ advocates.

The bill’s supporters included around two dozen legal aid, social services and renters’ advocacy organizations, but those groups have spent next to nothing on state politics, according to the Digital Democracy database. 

Opposing the bill were some of the state’s biggest political spenders from the business industry, including the California Chamber of Commerce and various landlord, banking and building associations. In total, those groups have given at least $13.7 million to legislators since 2015.

Wahab said in a written statement that landlords’ “money still speaks the loudest,” despite tenant advocates who represent millions.  
  
“Companies that benefit from keeping protections weak for tenants have billions of dollars to fund an army of lobbyists in the Capitol every single day,” she said. “That same machine mobilizes at the drop of a hat to pump millions into elections – even in districts during the legislative process – to scare and intimidate policymakers into voting their way, shaping the playing field long before a bill even gets a hearing.”

During the hearing, Kalra urged his colleagues to remember that just because renters are less politically active than landlords, lawmakers should not forget their plight.

“They don’t show up to your community coffees; they don’t have time to send letters in,” [he told his committee](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259492?t=307&f=bee4c5e0f33ed0ab6fa34a7d87f25eb6) moments before its members killed Wahab’s bill. “They’re trying to survive, and I think we need to also have that in the front of our mind as we consider these kinds of policies.”

The legislative session hasn’t been a complete bust for tenant-minded lawmakers – or for Wahab. Her [Senate Bill 681](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260sb681), which includes new tax credits for renters, was tucked into a [budget-related housing bill](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab130) the governor signed Monday.

The advocates pushing for Wahab’s eviction relief measure also hope it comes back later this session, which is a possibility – albeit a slim one – since members of the judiciary committee voted to grant the proposal “reconsideration,” meaning it can be resurrected later if lawmakers choose. They almost never do.

No college, no friends, no self-respect I feel invisible, broken, and sometimes I want to hurt myself just to feel something","I’m 21. I’ve spent the past few years preparing for the Indian premedical entrance exam (NEET).
And I failed.
Again.
And again.

Year after year, I told myself, “One more chance.”
And with every failure, something in me cracked  not just academically, but emotionally, mentally, spiritually. I gave up everything — friends, joy, music, peace  chasing a dream that never came true.

Now I’m here, 21, and still haven’t started college. While people my age are making memories, degrees, careers… I’m sitting in silence, wondering if I even matter anymore.

And the worst part?
I don’t have anyone to talk to.
I’ve lost almost all my friends over the years. People who once laughed with me now don’t even text. I sit in rooms with classmates, but I feel like a background object — someone they notice only when they need something.
They don’t ask. They order.
They don’t say “let’s go out”. They make plans without me.
They don’t see me.
I’m invisible.

The other day, I asked a guy I considered a friend if he wanted to go for coffee. He said no. Later, someone else asked him and he said yes instantly. That tiny moment shattered something in me.

It wasn’t about the coffee.
It was about the reality that no one actually wants me around.

And this isn’t one isolated moment. It’s a pattern.
Years of it.

People talk down to me.
They exclude me.
I’m the “nice guy” who always gets treated like shit  disrespected, walked over, ignored.

Sometimes, I just want to scream.

Other times…
I think about hurting myself.
Not to end it. But just to feel something again.
Because the loneliness? It numbs you.
You stop feeling human. You stop believing you're worth kindness.

There are moments I wonder if I disappeared  would anyone even care?

I’ve tried so hard to be good to others. I speak kindly. I support people even when I’m falling apart. But I’ve never received the same back. Not once.

I’ve lived years without love, without real connection, without respect.
And I don’t know how much more I can take.

But deep inside, there’s a voice  the only one left whispering:

Don’t give up yet. There’s still more to your story.



So I’m here, writing this.
Not for attention. Not for pity.
Just so someone out there might say the words I’ve been dying to hear:

You’re not invisible. I see you. I care that you exist.



Because right now, I don’t believe anyone does.


To anyone reading  don’t worry

I’m not in immediate danger. I just needed a place to speak honestly, without being shut down.
I’m holding on  barely but I’m here.

1lsg6q6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsg6q6,Details By Level (Powers Club Part 1-Totally Zero Owls Here),"Powers Club, I posted about the greenhouse previously [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GothamKnights/comments/1kpus1a/small_details_i_like_part_7_the_powers_club_green/) 

There are so many owls here in this building, the whole place is basically screaming “The court is real my dudes”.

A lot of repeating items on this level, paintings, books, plants and animal heads (rich people hunting HA).

But I like that one of the first things you see is a book with a literal Owl on it. Did Bruce’s death make them less subtle? I think it’s implied in the game they become more overt in making their actions noticeable but you don’t really see it until after they’re found out.  
(Also I really like the coffee rings on the desk, I wish the DC animated movies had this amount of detail) 

Now there are lots of painting that constantly show up from the get go BUT some of them are ONLY in court related levels, this one in the third picture however is an important one because it’s actually a photo on the [Belfry evidence board](https://www.reddit.com/r/GothamKnights/comments/1loi9jr/belfry_evidence_part_1_langstrom_to_blackgate/) (picture 10).  
That woman has been on the evidence board for a couple days in gameplay term, is she a killer? Was she killed the same way Langstrom was? Did she get out on appeal? 

So you get to the centre of the building (which is a gorgeous design I love it) and the two guards, who are not court members from the sounds of it, pace the room, one of them will randomly start taking photos of the place like a fan girl. 

The next section is once again filled with cool artwork that repeats, and the room to the left is owl central quite frankly, I couldn’t include all of them because that would be extremely boring. 

There’s also a little attic with lots of cool stuff including a letter to Thomas Wayne, more paintings, a gun, books [(including a book in the Belfry)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GothamKnights/comments/1l31lir/small_details_i_like_part_19_belfry_files/). ",1,1751739083.0,GothamKnights,0,1.0,False

By 3 PM, we wrapped up at the planetarium and headed to a nearby spot for some good food. As an unplanned bonus, we dropped by Tree Park to unwind, chat, and just enjoy each other’s company. We wrapped it all up the classic way — at a local tea kada with tea and coffee before heading home.

It genuinely felt like going back to school — that nostalgic, time-travel vibe surrounded by excited school kids on their own trips. Made the whole experience extra special!

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  DOWN TO the last day, even the last hour now. I’m an old man, lonely and unloved, sick and hurting and tired of living. I am ready for the hereafter; it has to be better than this.  
  
  I own the tall glass building in which I sit, and 97 percent of the company housed in it, below me, and the land around it half a mile in three directions, and the two thousand people who work here and the other twenty thousand who do not, and I own the pipeline under the land that brings gas to the building from my fields in Texas, and I own the utility lines that deliver electricity, and I lease the satellite unseen miles above by which I once barked commands to my empire flung far around the world. My assets exceed eleven billion dollars. I own silver in Nevada and copper in Montana and coffee in Kenya and coal in Angola and rubber in Malaysia and natural gas in Texas and crude oil in Indonesia and steel in China. My company owns companies that produce electricity and make computers and build dams and print paperbacks and broadcast signals to my satellite. I have subsidiaries with divisions in more countries than anyone can find.  
  
  I once owned all the appropriate toys—the yachts and jets and blondes, the homes in Europe, farms in Argentina, an island in the Pacific, thoroughbreds, even a hockey team. But I’ve grown too old for toys.  
  
  The money is the root of my misery.  
  
  I had three families—three ex-wives who bore seven children, six of whom are still alive and doing all they can to torment me. To the best of my knowledge, I fathered all seven, and buried one. I should say his mother buried him. I was out of the country.  
  
  I am estranged from all the wives and all the children. They’re gathering here today because I’m dying and it’s time to divide the money.  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  I HAVE planned this day for a long time. My building has fourteen floors, all long and wide and squared around a shaded courtyard in the rear where I once held lunches in the sunshine. I live and work on the top floor—twelve thousand square feet of opulence that would seem obscene to many but doesn’t bother me in the least. By sweat and brains and luck I built every dime of my fortune. Spending it is my prerogative. Giving it away should be my choice too, but I’m being hounded.  
  
  Why should I care who gets the money? I’ve done everything imaginable with it. As I sit here in my wheelchair, alone and waiting, I cannot think of a single thing I want to buy, or see, or a single place I want to go, or another adventure I want to pursue.  
  
  I’ve done it all, and I’m very tired.  
  
  I don’t care who gets the money. But I do care very much who does not get it.  
  
  Every square foot of this building was designed by me, and so I know exactly where to place everyone for this little ceremony. They’re all here, waiting and waiting, though they don’t mind. They’d stand naked in a blizzard for what I’m about to do.  
  
  The first family is Lillian and her brood—four of my offspring born to a woman who rarely let me touch her. We married young—I was twenty-four and she was eighteen—and so Lillian is old too. I haven’t seen her in years, and I won’t see her today. I’m sure she’s still playing the role of the grieving, abandoned yet dutiful first wife who got traded in for a trophy. She has never remarried, and I’m sure she hasn’t had sex in fifty years. I don’t know how we reproduced.  
  
  Her oldest is now forty-seven, Troy Junior, a worthless idiot who is cursed with my name. As a boy he adopted the nickname of TJ, and still prefers it to Troy. Of the six children gathered here now, TJ is the dumbest, though it’s close. He was tossed from college when he was nineteen for selling drugs.  
  
  TJ, like the rest, was given five million dollars on his twenty-first birthday. And like the rest, it ran like water through his fingers.  
  
  I cannot bear to recount the miserable histories of Lillian’s children. Suffice to say they’re all heavily in debt and virtually unemployable, with little hope of changing, so my signing of this will is the most critical event in their lives.  
  
  Back to the ex-wives. From the frigidity of Lillian, I ran to the steamy passion of Janie, a beautiful young thing hired as a secretary in Accounting but promoted rapidly when I decided I needed her on business trips. I divorced Lillian and married Janie, who was twenty-two years younger than I was and determined to keep me satisfied. She had two children as fast as she could. She used them as anchors to keep me close. Rocky, the younger, was killed in a sports car with two of his buddies, in a wreck that cost me six million to settle out of court.  
  
  I married Tira when I was sixty-four. She was twenty-three and pregnant by me with a little monster she named Ramble, for some reason that was never clear to me. Ramble is now fourteen, and already has one arrest for shoplifting and one arrest for possession of marijuana. His oily hair sticks to his neck and falls way down his back, and he adorns himself with rings in his ears, eyebrows, and nose. I’m told he goes to school when he feels like it.  
  
  Ramble is ashamed that his father is almost eighty, and his father is ashamed that his son has silver beads pierced through his tongue.  
  
  And he, along with the rest of them, expects me to sign my name on this will and make his life better. As large as my fortune is, the money won’t last long among these fools.  
  
  A dying old man should not hate, but I cannot help it. They are a miserable bunch, all of them. Their mothers hate me, so the children in turn have been taught to hate me too.  
  
  They are vultures circling with clawed feet, sharp teeth, and hungry eyes, giddy with the anticipation of unlimited cash.  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  THE SOUNDNESS of my mind is of great issue now. They think I have a tumor because I say weird things. I babble on incoherently in meetings and on the phone, and my aides behind my back whisper and nod and think to themselves, Yes, it’s true. It’s the tumor.  
  
  I made a will two years ago and left everything to the last live-in, who at the time paraded around my apartment in leopard print panties and nothing else and, yes, I guess I’m crazy about twenty-year-old blondes with all the curves. But she later got the boot. The shredder got the will. I simply got tired.  
  
  Three years ago I made a will, just for the hell of it, and left everything to charities, over a hundred of them. I was cursing TJ one day, and he was cursing me, and I told him about this new will. He and his mother and his siblings hired a bunch of crooked lawyers and ran to court in an attempt to have me committed to an institution for treatment and evaluation. This was actually smart on the part of their lawyers because if I’d been judged mentally incompetent my will would have been void.  
  
  But I have many lawyers, and I pay them a thousand dollars an hour to manipulate the legal system in my favor. I was not committed, though at the time I was probably a bit off my rocker.  
  
  And I have my own shredder, one I’ve used for all the old wills. They’re all gone, eaten by a little machine.  
  
  I wear long white robes made of Thai silk, and I shave my head like a monk, and I eat little, so that my body is small and shriveled. They think I’m a Buddhist but in reality I study Zoroaster. They don’t know the difference. I can almost understand why they think my mental capacity has diminished.  
  
  Lillian and the first family are in the executive conference room on the thirteenth floor, just below me. It’s a large room, marble and mahogany, with rich rugs and a long oval table down the center, and it’s now filled with very nervous people. Not surprisingly, there are more lawyers than family members. Lillian has a lawyer, and so does each of her four children, except for TJ, who has brought along three to show his importance and make certain all scenarios are properly counseled. TJ has more legal problems than most death row inmates. At one end of the table is a large digital screen which will broadcast the proceedings.  
  
  TJ’s brother is Rex, age forty-four, my second son, currentl  
y married to a stripper. Amber is her name, a poor creature without a brain but with a large fake chest, who, I think, is his third wife. Second or third, but who am I to condemn? She’s here, along with the rest of the current spouses and/or live-ins, fidgeting nervously as eleven billion is about to be divided.  
  
  Lillian’s first daughter, my oldest, is Libbigail, a child I loved desperately until she left for college and forgot about me. Then she married an African and I erased her name from my wills.  
  
  Mary Ross was the last child born to Lillian. She’s married to a doctor who aspires to be super-rich, but they are heavily in debt.  
  
  Janie and the second family wait in a room on the tenth floor. Janie has had two husbands since our divorce many years ago. I’m almost certain she is living alone at the moment. I hire investigators to keep me posted, but not even the FBI could keep track of her bed-hopping. As I mentioned, Rocky, her son, was killed. Her daughter Geena is here with her second husband, a moron with an MBA who is just dangerous enough to take a half a billion or so and masterfully lose it in three years.  
  
  And then there’s Ramble, slouching in a chair on the fifth floor, licking the gold ring in the corner of his lip, fingering his sticky green hair, scowling at his mother, who had the gall to appear here today with a hairy little gigolo. Ramble expects to get rich today, to be handed a fortune simply because he was sired by me. And Ramble has a lawyer too, a hippie radical sort Tira saw on television and hired right after she laid him. They’re waiting, along with the rest.  
  
  I know these people. I watch them.

He’s been my gofer for almost thirty years now, a round homely little man in a white waistcoat, meek and humble, perpetually bent at the waist as if bowing to the king. Snead stops before me, hands clasped at the belly, as always, head cocked to one side, drippy smile, and says, “How are you, sir?” in an affected lilt he acquired years back when we were staying in Ireland.  
  
  I say nothing, because I’m neither required nor expected to respond to Snead.  
  
  “Some coffee, sir?”  
  
  “Lunch.”  
  
  Snead winks with both eyes and bows even deeper, then waddles from the room, his trouser cuffs dragging the floor. He too expects to be made rich when I die, and I suppose he’s counting the days like the rest of them.  
  
  The trouble with having money is that everybody wants a little of it. Just a slice, a small sliver. What’s a million dollars to a man with billions? Give me a million, old boy, and you’ll never know the difference. Float me a loan, and we’ll both forget about it. Wedge my name in the will somewhere; there’s room for it.  
  
  Snead’s nosy as hell and years ago I caught him picking through my desk, looking, I think, for the current will. He wants me to die because he expects a few million.  
  
  What right does he have to expect anything? I should’ve fired him years ago.  
  
  His name is not mentioned in my new will.  
  
  He sets a tray before me: an unopened tube of Ritz crackers, a small jar of honey with the plastic seal around the lid, and a twelve-ounce can of Fresca, room temperature. Any variation and Snead would be fired on the spot.  
  
  I dismiss him, and dip the crackers in the honey. The final meal.  
  
  TWO  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  I SIT and stare through the tinted glass walls. On a clear day, I can see the top of the Washington Monument six miles away, but not today. Today is raw and cold, windy and overcast, not a bad day to die. The wind blows the last of the leaves from their branches and scatters them through the parking lot below.  
  
  Why I am worried about the pain? What’s wrong with a little suffering? I’ve caused more misery than any ten people.  
  
  I push a button and Snead appears. He bows and pushes my wheelchair through the door of my apartment, into the marble foyer, down the marble hall, through another door. We’re getting closer, but I feel no anxiety.  
  
  I’ve kept the shrinks waiting for over two hours.  
  
  We pass my office and I nod at Nicolette, my latest secretary, a darling young thing I’m quite fond of. Given some time, she might become number four.  
  
  But there is no time. Only minutes.  
  
  A mob is waiting—packs of lawyers and some psychiatrists who’ll determine if I’m in my right mind. They are crowded around a long table in my conference room, and when I enter, their conversation stops immediately and everybody stares. Snead situates me on one side of the table, next to my lawyer, Stafford.  
  
  There are cameras pointing in all directions, and the technicians scramble to get them focused. Every whisper, every move, every breath will be recorded because a fortune is at stake.  
  
  The last will I signed gave little to my children. Josh Stafford prepared it, as always. I shredded it this morning.  
  
  I’m sitting here to prove to the world that I am of sufficient mental capacity to make a new will. Once it is proved, the disposition of my assets cannot be questioned.  
  
  Directly across from me are three shrinks—one hired by each family. On folded index cards before them someone has printed their names—Dr. Zadel, Dr. Flowe, Dr. Theishen. I study their eyes and faces. Since I am supposed to appear sane, I must make eye contact.  
  
  They expect me to be somewhat loony, but I’m about to eat them for lunch.  
  
  Stafford will run the show. When everyone is settled and the cameras are ready, he says, “My name is Josh Stafford, and I’m the attorney for Mr. Troy Phelan, seated here to my right.”  
  
  I take on the shrinks, one at a time, eye to eye, glare to glare, until each blinks or looks away. All three wear dark suits. Zadel and Flowe have scraggly beards. Theishen has a bow tie and looks no more than thirty. The families were given the right to hire anyone they wanted.  
  
  Stafford is talking. “The purpose of this meeting is to have Mr. Phelan examined by a panel of psychiatrists to determine his testamentary capacity. Assuming the panel finds him to be of sound mind, then he intends to sign a will which will dispose of his assets upon his death.”  
  
  Stafford taps his pencil on a one-inch-thick will lying before us. I’m sure the cameras zoom in for a close-up, and I’m sure the very sight of the document sends shivers up and down the spines of my children and their mothers scattered throughout my building.  
  
  They haven’t seen the will, nor do they have the right to. A will is a private document revealed only after death. The heirs can only speculate as to what it might contain. My heirs have received hints, little lies I’ve carefully planted.  
  
  They’ve been led to believe that the bulk of my estate will somehow be divided fairly among the children, with generous gifts to the ex-wives. They know this; they can feel it. They’ve been praying fervently for this for weeks, even months. This is life and death for them because they’re all in debt. The will lying before me is supposed to make them rich and stop the bickering. Stafford prepared it, and in conversations with their lawyers he has, with my permission, painted in broad strokes the supposed contents of the will. Each child will receive something in the range of three hundred to five hundred million, with another fifty million going to each of the three ex-wives. These women were well provided for in the divorces, but that, of course, has been forgotten.  
  
  Total gifts to the families of approximately three billion dollars. After the government rakes off several billion the rest will go to charity.  
  
  So you can see why they’re here, shined, groomed, sober (for the most part), and eagerly watching the monitors and waiting and hoping that I, the old man, can pull this off. I’m sure they’ve told their shrinks, “Don’t be too hard on the old boy. We want him sane.”  
  
  If everyone is so happy, then why bother with this psychiatric examination? Because I’m gonna screw ’em one last time, and I want to do it right.  
  
  The shrinks are my idea, but my children and their lawyers are too slow to realize it.  
  
  Zadel goes first. “Mr. Phelan, can you tell us the date, time, and place?”  
  
  I feel like a first-grader. I d  
rop my chin to my chest like an imbecile and ponder the question long enough to make them ease to the edge of their seats and whisper, “Come on, you crazy old bastard. Surely you know what day it is.”  
  
  “Monday,” I say softly. “Monday, December 9, 1996. The place is my office.”  
  
  “The time?”  
  
  “About two-thirty in the afternoon,” I say. I don’t wear a watch.  
  
  “And where is your office?”  
  
  “McLean, Virginia.”  
  
  Flowe leans into his microphone. “Can you state the names and birthdates of your children?”  
  
  “No. The names, maybe, but not the birthdates.”  
  
  “Okay, give us the names.”  
  
  I take my time. It’s too early to be sharp. I want them to sweat. “Troy Phelan, Jr., Rex, Libbigail, Mary Ross, Geena, and Ramble.” I utter these as if they’re painful to even think about.  
  
  Flowe is allowed a follow-up. “And there was a seventh child, right?”  
  
  “Right.”  
  
  “Do you remember his name?”  
  
  “Rocky.”  
  
  “And what happened to him?”  
  
  “He was killed in an auto accident.” I sit straight in my wheelchair, head high, eyes darting from one shrink to the next, projecting pure sanity for the cameras. I’m sure my children and my ex-wives are proud of me, watching the monitors in their little groups, squeezing the hands of their current spouses, and smiling at their hungry lawyers because old Troy so far has handled the preliminaries.  
  
  My voice may be low and hollow, and I may look like a nut with my white silk robe, shriveled face, and green turban, but I’ve answered their questions.  
  
  Come on, old boy, they’re pleading.  
  
  Theishen asks, “What is your current physical condition?”  
  
  “I’ve felt better.”  
  
  “It’s rumored you have a cancerous tumor.”  
  
  Get right to the point, don’t you?  
  
  “I thought this was a mental exam,” I say, glancing at Stafford, who can’t suppress a smile. But the rules allow any question. This is not a courtroom.  
  
  “It is,” Theishen says politely. “But every question is relevant.”  
  
  “I see.”  
  
  “Will you answer the question?”  
  
  “About what?”  
  
  “About the tumor.”  
  
  “Sure. It’s in my head, the size of a golf ball, growing every day, inoperable, and my doctor says I won’t last three months.”  
  
  I can almost hear the champagne corks popping below me. The tumor has been confirmed!  
  
  “Are you, at this moment, under the influence of any medication, drug, or alcohol?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Do you have in your possession any type of medication to relieve pain?”  
  
  “Not yet.”  
  
  Back to Zadel: “Mr. Phelan, three months ago Forbes magazine listed your net worth at eight billion dollars. Is that a close estimate?”  
  
  “Since when is Forbes known for its accuracy?”  
  
  “So it’s not accurate?”  
  
  “It’s between eleven and eleven and a half, depending on the markets.” I say this very slowly, but my words are sharp, my voice carries authority. No one doubts the size of my fortune.  
  
  Flowe decides to pursue the money. “Mr. Phelan, can you describe, in general, the organization of your corporate holdings?”  
  
  “I can, yes.”  
  
  “Will you?”  
  
  “I suppose.” I pause and let them sweat. Stafford assured me I do not have to divulge private information here. Just give them an overall picture, he said.  
  
  “The Phelan Group is a private corporation which owns seventy different companies, a few of which are publicly traded.”  
  
  “How much of The Phelan Group do you own?”  
  
  “About ninety-seven percent. The rest is held by a handful of employees.”  
  
  Theishen joins in the hunt. It didn’t take long to focus on the gold. “Mr. Phelan, does your company hold an interest in Spin Computer?”  
  
  “Yes,” I answer slowly, trying to place Spin Computer in my corporate jungle.  
  
  “How much do you own?”  
  
  “Eighty percent.”  
“And Spin Computer is a public company?”  
  
  “That’s right.”  
  
  Theishen fiddles with a pile of official-looking documents, and I can see from here that he has the company’s annual report and quarterly statements, things any semiliterate college student could obtain. “When did you purchase Spin?” he asks.  
  
  “About four years ago.”  
  
  “How much did you pay?”  
  
  “Twenty bucks a share, a total of three hundred million.” I want to answer these questions more slowly, but I can’t help myself. I stare holes through Theishen, anxious for the next one.  
  
  “And what’s it worth now?” he asks.  
  
  “Well, it closed yesterday at forty-three and a half, down a point. The stock has split twice since I bought it, so the investment is now worth around eight-fifty.”  
  
  “Eight hundred and fifty million?”  
  
  “That’s correct.”  
  
  The examination is basically over at this point. If my mental capacity can comprehend yesterday’s closing stock prices, then my adversaries are certainly satisfied. I can almost see their goofy smiles. I can almost hear their muted hoorahs. Atta boy, Troy. Give ’em hell.  
  
  Zadel wants history. It’s an effort to test the bounds of my memory. “Mr. Phelan, where were you born?”  
  
  “Montclair, New Jersey.”  
  
  “When?”  
  
  “May 12, 1918.”  
  
  “What was your mother’s maiden name?”  
  
  “Shaw.”  
  
  “When did she die?”  
  
  “Two days before Pearl Harbor.”  
  
  “And your father?”  
  
  “What about him?”  
  
  “When did he die?”  
  
  “I don’t know. He disappeared when I was a kid.”  
  
  Zadel looks at Flowe, who’s got questions packed together on a notepad. Flowe asks, “Who is your youngest daughter?”  
  
  “Which family?”  
  
  “Uh, the first one.”  
  
  “That would be Mary Ross.”  
  
  “Right—”  
  
  “Of course it’s right.”  
  
  “Where did she go to college?”  
  
  “Tulane, in New Orleans.”  
  
  “What did she study?”  
  
  “Something medieval. Then she married badly, like the rest of them. I guess they inherited that talent from me.” I can see them stiffen and bristle. And I can almost see the lawyers and the current live-ins and/or spouses hide little smiles because no one can argue the fact that I did indeed marry badly.  
  
  And I reproduced even more miserably.  
  
  Flowe is suddenly finished for this round. Theishen is enamored with the money. He asks, “Do you own a controlling interest in MountainCom?”  
  
  “Yes, I’m sure it’s right there in your stack of paperwork. It’s a public company.”  
  
  “What was your initial investment?”  
  
  “Around eighteen a share, for ten million shares.”  
  
  “And now it—”  
  
  “It closed yesterday at twenty-one a share. A swap and a split in the past six years and the holding is now worth about four hundred million. Does that answer your question?”  
  
  “Yes, I believe it does. How many public companies do you control?”  
  
  “Five.”  
  
  Flowe glances at Zadel, and I’m wondering how much longer this will take. I’m suddenly tired.  
  
  “Any more questions?” Stafford asks. We are not going to press them because we want them completely satisfied.  
  
  Zadel asks, “Do you intend to sign a new will today?”  
  
  “Yes, that is my intent.”  
  
  “Is that the will lying on the table there before you?”  
  
  “It is.”  
  
  “Does that will give a substantial portion of your assets to your children?”  
  
  “It does.”  
  
  “Are you prepared to sign the will at this time?”  
  
  “I am.”  
  
  Zadel carefully places his pen on the table, folds his hands thoughtfully, and looks at Stafford. “In my opinion, Mr. Phelan has sufficient testamentary capacity at this time to dispose of his assets.” He pronounces this with great weight, as if my performance had them hanging in limbo.  
  
  The other two are quick to rush in. “I have no doubt as to the soundness of his mind,” Flowe says to Stafford. “He seems incredibly sharp to me.”  
  
  “No doubt?” Stafford asks.  
  
  “None whatsoever.”  
  
  “Dr. Theishen?”  
  
  “Let’s not kid ourselves. Mr. Phelan knows exactly what he’s doing. His mind is much quicker than ours.”  
  
  Oh, thank you. That means so much to me. You’re a bunch of shrinks struggling to make a hundred thousand a year. I’ve made billions, yet you pat me on the head and tell me how smart I am.  
  
  “So it’s unanimous?” Stafford says.  
  
  “Yes. Absolutely.” They can’t nod their heads fast enough.  
  
  Stafford slides the will to me and hands me a pen. I say, “This is the last will and testament of Troy L. Phelan, revoking all former wills and codicils.” It’s ninety pages long, prepared by Stafford and someone in his firm. I understand the concept, but the actual print eludes me. I haven’t read it, nor shall I. I flip to the back, scrawl a name no one can read, then place my hands on top of it for the time being.  
  
  It’ll never be seen by the vultures.  
  
  “Meeting’s adjourned,” Stafford says, and everyone quickly packs. Per my instructions, the three families are hurried from their respective rooms and asked to leave the building.  
  
  One camera remains focused on me, its images going nowhere but the archives. The lawyers and psychiatrists leave in a rush. I tell Snead to take a seat at the table. Stafford and one of his partners, Durban, remain in the room, also seated. When we are alone, I reach under the edge of my robe and produce an envelope, which I open. I remove from it three pages of yellow legal paper and place them before me on the table.  
  
  Only seconds away now, and a faint ripple of fear goes through me. This will take more strength than I’ve mustered in weeks.  
  
  Stafford, Durban, and Snead stare at the sheets of yellow paper, thoroughly bewildered.  
  
  “This is my testament,” I announce, taking a pen. “A holographic will, every word written by me, just a few hours ago. Dated today, and now signed today.” I scrawl my name again. Stafford is too stunned to react.  
  
  “It revokes all former wills, including the one I signed less than five minutes ago.” I refold the papers and place them in the envelope.  
  
  I grit my teeth and remind myself of how badly I want to die.  
  
  I slide the envelope across the table to Stafford, and at the same instant I rise from my wheelchair. My legs are shaking. My heart is pounding. Just seconds now. Surely I’ll be dead before I land.  
  
  “Hey!” someone shouts, Snead I think. But I’m moving away from them.  
  
  The lame man walks, almost runs, past the row of leather chairs, past one of my portraits, a bad one commissioned by a wife, past everything, to the sliding doors, which are unlocked. I know because I rehearsed this just hours ago.  
  
  “Stop!” someone yells, and they’re moving behind me. No one has seen me walk in a year. I grab the handle and open the door. The air is bitterly cold. I step barefoot onto the narrow terrace which borders my top floor. Without looking below, I lunge over the railing.  
  
  THREE  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  SNEAD WAS two steps behind Mr. Phelan, and thought for a second that he might catch him. The shock of seeing the old man not only rise and walk but also practically sprint to the door froze Snead. Mr. Phelan hadn’t moved that fast in years.  
  
  Snead reached the railing just in time to scream in horror, then watched helplessly as Mr. Phelan fell silently, twisting and flailing and growing smaller and smaller until he struck the ground. Snead clenched the railing and stared in disbelief, then he began to cry.  
  
  Josh Stafford arrived on the terrace a step behind Snead, and witnessed most of the fall. It happened so quickly, at least the jump; the fall itself seemed to last for an hour. A  
man weighing a hundred and fifty pounds will drop three hundred feet in less than five seconds, but Stafford later told people the old man floated for an eternity, like a feather whirling in the wind.  
  
  Tip Durban got to the railing just behind Stafford, and saw only the body’s impact on the brick patio between the front entrance and a circular drive. For some reason Durban held the envelope, which he had absently picked up during the rush to catch old Troy. It felt a lot heavier as he stood in the frigid air, looking down at a scene from a horror film, watching the first onlookers move up to the casualty.  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  TROY PHELAN’S descent did not reach the level of high drama he had dreamed of. Instead of drifting to the earth like an angel, a perfect swan dive with the silk robe trailing behind, and landing in death before his terror-stricken families, who he’d imagined would be leaving the building at just the right moment, his fall was witnessed only by a lowly payroll clerk, hustling through the parking lot after a very long lunch in a bar. The clerk heard a voice, looked up at the top floor, and watched in horror as a pale naked body tumbled and flapped with what appeared to be a bedsheet gathered at the neck. It landed on its back, on brick, with the dull thud one would expect from such an impact.  
  
  The clerk ran to the spot just as a security guard noticed something wrong and bolted from his perch near the front entrance of Phelan Tower. Neither the clerk nor the guard had ever met Mr. Troy Phelan, so neither knew at first upon whose remains they were gazing. The body was bleeding, barefoot, twisted, and naked, and exposed with a sheet bunched at the arms. And it was quite dead.  
  
  Another thirty seconds, and Troy would have had his wish. Because they were stationed in a room on the fifth floor, Tira and Ramble and Dr. Theishen and their entourage of lawyers were the first to leave the building. And, therefore, the first to happen upon the suicide. Tira screamed, not from pain nor love nor loss, but from the sheer shock of seeing old Troy splattered on the brick. It was a wretched piercing scream that was heard clearly by Snead, Stafford, and Durban, fourteen floors up.  
  
  Ramble thought the scene was rather cool. A child of TV and an addict of video games, he found the gore a magnet. He moved away from his shrieking mother and knelt beside his dead father. The security guard placed a firm hand on his shoulder.  
  
  “That’s Troy Phelan,” one of the lawyers said as he hovered above the corpse.  
  
  “You don’t say,” said the guard.  
  
  “Wow,” said the clerk.  
  
  More people ran from the building.  
  
  Janie, Geena, and Cody, with their shrink Dr. Flowe and their lawyers, were next. But there were no screams, no breakdowns. They stuck together in a tight bunch, well away from Tira and her group, and gawked like everyone else at poor Troy.  
  
  Radios crackled as another guard arrived and took control of the scene. He called for an ambulance.  
  
  “What good will that do?” asked the payroll clerk, who, by virtue of being the first on the scene, assumed a more important role in the aftermath.  
  
  “You want to take him away in your car?” asked the guard.  
  
  Ramble watched the blood fill in the mortar cracks and run in perfect angles down a gentle slope, toward a frozen fountain and a flagpole nearby.  
  
  In the atrium, a packed elevator stopped and opened and Lillian and the first family and their entourage emerged. Because TJ and Rex had once been allowed offices in the building, they had parked in the rear. The entire group turned left for an exit, then someone near the front of the building yelled, “Mr. Phelan’s jumped!” They switched directions and raced through the front door, onto the brick patio near the fountain, where they found him.  
  
  They wouldn’t have to wait for the tumor after all.  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  IT TOOK Joshua Stafford a minute or so to recover from the shock and start thinking like a lawyer again. He waited until the third and last family was visible below, then asked Snead and Durban to step inside.  
  
  The camera was still on. Snead faced it, raised his right hand, and swore to tell the truth, then, fighting tears, explained what he had just witnessed. Stafford opened the envelope and held the yellow sheets of paper close enough for the camera to see.  
  
  “Yes, I saw him sign that,” Snead said. “Just seconds ago.”  
  
  “And is that his signature?” Stafford asked.  
  
  “Yes, yes it is.”  
  
  “Did he declare this to be his last will and testament?”  
  
  “He called it his testament.”  
  
  Stafford withdrew the papers before Snead could read them. He repeated the same testimony with Durban, then placed himself before the camera and gave his version of events. The camera was turned off, and the three of them rode to the ground to pay their respects to Mr. Phelan. The elevator was packed with Phelan employees, stunned but anxious to have a rare and last glimpse of the old man. The building was emptying. Snead’s quiet sobs were muffled in a corner.  
  
  Guards had backed the crowd away, leaving Troy alone in his puddle. A siren was approaching. Someone took photographs to memorialize the image of his death, then a black blanket was placed over his body.  
  
  For the families, slight twinges of grief soon overcame the shock of death. They stood with their heads low, their eyes staring sadly at the blanket, organizing their thoughts for the issues to come. It was impossible to look at Troy and not think about the money. Grief for an estranged relative, even a father, cannot stand in the way of half a billion dollars.  
  
  For the employees, shock gave way to confusion. Troy was rumored to live up there above them, but very few had ever seen him. He was eccentric, crazy, sick—the rumors covered everything. He didn’t like people. There were important vice presidents in the building who saw him once a year. If the company ran so well without him, surely their jobs were secure.  
  
  For the psychiatrists—Zadel, Flowe, and Theishen—the moment was filled with tension. You declare a man to be of sound mind, and minutes later he jumps to his death. Yet even a crazy man can have a lucid interval—that’s the legal term they repeated to themselves as they shivered in the crowd. Crazy as a bat, but one clear, lucid interval in the midst of the madness, and a person can execute a valid will. They would stand firm with their opinions. Thank God everything was on tape. Old Troy was sharp. And lucid.  
  
  And for the lawyers, the shock passed quickly and there was no grief. They stood grim-faced next to their clients and watched the pitiful sight. The fees would be enormous.  
  
  An ambulance drove onto the bricks and stopped near Troy. Stafford walked under the barricade and whispered something to the guards.  
  
  Troy was quickly loaded onto a stretcher and taken away.  
  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
  TROY PHELAN had moved his corporate headquarters to northern Virginia twenty-two years earlier to escape taxation in New York. He spent forty million on his Tower and grounds, money he saved many times over by being domiciled in Virginia.  
  
  He met Joshua Stafford, a rising D.C. lawyer, in the midst of a nasty lawsuit that Troy lost and Stafford won. Troy admired his style and tenacity, and so he hired him. In the past decade, Stafford had doubled the size of his firm and become rich with the money he earned fighting Troy’s battles.  
  
  In the last years of his life, no one had been closer to Mr. Phelan than Josh Stafford. He and Durban returned to the conference room on the fourteenth floor and locked the door. Snead was sent away with instructions to lie down.  
  
  With the camera running, Stafford opened the envelope and removed the three sheets of yellow paper. The first sheet was a letter to him from Troy. He spoke to the camera: “This letter is dated today, Monday, December 9, 1996. It is handwritten, addressed to me, from Troy Phelan. It has five paragraphs. I will read it in full:  
  
  “ ‘Dear Josh: I am dead now. These are my instructions, and I want you to follow them closely. Use litigation if you have to, but I want my wishes carried out.  
  
  “ ‘First, I want a quick autopsy, for reasons that will become important later.  
  
  “ ‘Second, there will  
be no funeral, no service of any type. I want to be cremated, with my ashes scattered from the air over my ranch in Wyoming.  
  
  “ ‘Third, I want my will kept confidential until January 15, 1997. The law does not require you to immediately produce it. Sit on it for a month.  
  
  “ ‘So long. Troy.’ ”  
  
  Stafford slowly placed the first sheet on the table, and carefully picked up the second. He studied it for a moment, then said for the camera, “This is a one-page document purporting to be the last testament of Troy L. Phelan. I will read it in its entirety:  
  
  “ ‘The last testament of Troy L. Phelan. I, Troy L. Phelan, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby expressly revoke all former wills and codicils executed by me, and dispose of my estate as follows:  
  
  “ ‘To my children, Troy Phelan, Jr., Rex Phelan, Libbigail Jeter, Mary Ross Jackman, Geena Strong, and Ramble Phelan, I give each a sum of money necessary to pay off all of the debts of each as of today. Any debts incurred after today will not be covered by this gift. If any of these children attempt to contest this will, then this gift shall be nullified as to that child.  
  
  “ ‘To my ex-wives, Lillian, Janie, and Tira, I give nothing. They were adequately provided for in the divorces.  
  
  “ ‘The remainder of my estate I give to my daughter Rachel Lane, born on November 2, 1954, at Catholic Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a woman named Evelyn Cunningham, now deceased.’ ”  
  
  Stafford had never heard of these people. He had to catch his breath before plowing ahead.  
  
  “ ‘I appoint my trusted lawyer, Joshua Stafford, as executor of this will, and grant unto him broad discretionary powers in its administration.  
  
  “ ‘This document is intended to be a holographic will. Every word has been written by my hand, and I hereby sign it.  
  
  “ ‘Signed, December 9, 1996, three P.M., by Troy L. Phelan.’ ”  
  
  Stafford placed it on the table and blinked his eyes at the camera. He needed a walk around the building, perhaps a blast of frigid air, but he pressed on. He picked up the third sheet, and said, “This is a one-paragraph note addressed to me again. I will read it: ‘Josh: Rachel Lane is a World Tribes missionary on the Brazil-Bolivia border. She works with a remote Indian tribe in a region known as the Pantanal. The nearest town is Corumbá. I couldn’t find her. I’ve had no contact with her in the last twenty years. Signed, Troy Phelan.’ ”  
  
  Durban turned the camera off and paced around the table twice as Stafford read the document again and again.  
  
  “Did you know he had an illegitimate daughter?”  
  
  Stafford was staring absently at a wall. “No. I drafted eleven wills for Troy, and he never mentioned her.”  
  
  “I guess we shouldn’t be surprised.”  
  
  Stafford had declared many times that he had become incapable of being surprised by Troy Phelan. In business and in private, the man was whimsical and chaotic. Stafford had made millions running behind his client, putting out fires.

I am trying to fast today for Ashura & am just wondering if anyone feels sad while fasting? I am not hungry or that thirsty but am thinking the lack of caffeine is making me feel sad. I had to sleep again for a while after Fajr because I was so tired without any caffeine. I do have managed clinical depression & was reading fasting can make that worse possibly.

  “Why not?” Darrin asked, absently adjusting his holster as he leaned back against the wall and took a sip of his coffee.  
  
  Trevor blinked up at him. “Because I hate you. Was I not clear about that?”  
  
  “No,” Darrin said, lightly blowing on his coffee before he took another small sip, “you were quite clear about that.”  
  
  “Then why are you wasting my time with this bullshit?”  
  
  He pointedly looked around the small holding room that security had thrown Trevor in over two hours ago. “Do you have somethi  
ng better to do?”  
  
  “Seethe,” Trevor bit out.  
  
  “You know that I can make this whole thing go away, don’t you?” he asked casually, not mentioning that he’d already done that or that Trevor was free to go since that would take away his leverage.  
  
  “I’d rather become Bubba’s bitch,” Trevor informed him, which of course made him sigh heavily as he shook his head, wondering why the bastards in his family had to make things so difficult.  
  
  “You know that I’ll never miss a payment,” he pointed out, hoping to talk some damn sense into his cousin.  
  
  Trevor snorted at that. “It’s not about the money.

Then what’s it about?”  
  
  “Did I not mention that I hated you?” Trevor asked with a disgusted shake of his head, taking another sip of water.  
  
  “But you love Marybeth,” Darrin pointed out.  
  
  Trevor looked up and met his gaze head on, “So do you.”  
  
  “Never said that I didn’t.”  
  
  “But, you’ve never told her.”  
  
  He actually had…  
  
  But since he’d been drunk and had mistaken her roommate for her, who’d sort of flipped out when she’d realized that he was in love with Marybeth, he decided that it was probably one of those things that shouldn’t be mentioned.  
  
  Ever.  
  
  “I don’t need to tell her.”  
  
  Trevor chuckled, shaking his head in wonder. “You’re hoping that the Bradford curse will do the work for you.”  
  
  “Maybe,” he said with a shrug.  
  
  “It’s not going to work.”  
  
  “It just might.”  
  
  Trevor muttered something as he put his cup down. “The curse is bullshit. It’s not going to work.”  
  
  “Then explain Zoe,” he said as he placed his cup of coffee on the table.  
  
  “She begged me to marry her and I just didn’t have the heart to turn the poor thing down,” Trevor said with an exaggerated sigh and a sad shake of his head.  
  
  “Didn’t she lose a bet?” he asked with a frown.  
  
  “You bastard!”  
  
  “Just sell me the house,” he said, hoping to get this over with so that he could hunt Marybeth down and start the long process of convincing her that this was a great idea.  
  
  “Not happening.”  
  
  “Yeah, it really is.”  
  
  “I’ll sell the house to Marybeth, but not to you!”  
  
  “That’s really not going to work for me,” he pointed out.  
  
  “Because she’ll be able to kick you out?” Trevor guessed, shaking his head in disgust.  
  
  “Exactly.”  
  
  “I’m not selling you the house,” Trevor said firmly.  
  
  “Oh, but I think you will,” Darrin said, pushing away from the wall as he reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone. “Unless you want Zoe to see what you were doing last night,” he said, holding the phone out to his cousin so that he could see the damning picture in all its glory.  
  
  “You…bastard!”  
  
  “It sure would be a shame if Zoe found out that you were throwing away the lunches that she packed for you everyday,” Darrin explained as he returned the phone to his back pocket.  
  
  Trevor narrowed his eyes on him. “You’ll regret this one day, you son of a bitch!”  
  
  “Probably,” he agreed with a careless shrug as he headed for the door. “But look on the bright side, you just stopped yourself from becoming Bubba’s bitch.”  
  
  “He would have been gentle!” his cousin yelled after him, making him chuckle as he headed towards the waiting room, preparing for the fight of his life.  
  
  Less than a year later…  
  
  She never should have agreed to come on this trip, she realized as she turned over onto her side and blinked away another tear as she listened to the Bradford boys talking and laughing around the fire.  
  
  At least if she’d stayed home she’d be able to lounge around in her pajamas, eating junk food and watching Lifetime movies while she wallowed in self-pity. Instead, she was stuck on this trip, forcing herself to smile and laugh at jokes while pretending that she wasn’t dying inside. Maybe she should just tell them that she wasn’t feeling well and get a ride into town, she thought even as she dismissed the idea. She didn’t want to talk about it and if she told them that she wasn’t feeling good, they’d gang up on her until she told them what was going on.  
  
  Sighing, she rolled over onto her other side, trying to find a comfortable position on the old, lumpy sleeping bag that Darrin had dug out of his parents’ garage. After a few more turns, groans and sighs, she decided to steal Darrin’s sleeping bag and use it as a mattress. Sitting up, she reached over to do just that when she heard a twig snap close by.  
  
  “I’m fine,” she muttered as she grabbed her sleeping bag and threw it on top of his.  
  
  “Then come out and join us,” Darrin said as he unzipped the large net window at the back of the tent.  
  
  “No,” she simply said as she sat on top of her mattress, laid back and closed her eyes.  
  
  “You want to tell me what’s wrong?” he asked, not exactly surprising her that he’d realized that something was wrong, but she’d kind of been hoping that he’d just assumed that she was upset about Malcolm.  
  
  “No,” she said, rolling over onto her side, facing away from him and hoping that he’d just take the hint and go away.  
  
  “I know that you’re not upset about that prick, so tell me what’s going on?” he asked just as she registered the feel of his fingertips tracing a line down her neck, leaving a path of goose bumps behind.  
  
  “He wasn’t a prick,” she admitted with a grumble.  
  
  Malcolm had been a nice guy, sweet, kind, considerate and had apparently been falling in love with her, something that she’d warned him against. Unfortunately he hadn’t listened. While she’d been hoping for something casual to pass the time, he’d been imagining a life together filled with children, puppies and a white picket fence.  
  
  “Maybe not, but he wasn’t the right guy for you,” he said softly as he continued caressing her cheek.  
  
  Hating the way that she reacted to him, she reached up and brushed away his touch. “I’m tired, Darrin,” she said, pointedly closing her eyes, hoping that he’d just leave her alone so that she could continue to wallow in self-pity.  
  
  “I see,” he murmured.  
  
  “Good. Then go away.”  
  
  “I will...just as soon as you complete the dare I just gave you,” he murmured, sounding thoughtful as she lay there, frowning and wondering what he was talking about.  
  
  “You didn’t dare me,” she pointed out as she rolled over onto her back.  
  
  “I didn’t dare you to go skinny dipping?” he asked, sounding thoughtful as she immediately sat up and headed for the tent flaps, all while praying that she made it in time before he could dare her to take a dip in the ice cold lake that she’d been avoiding since they’d arrived earlier this afternoon.  
  
  She’d just managed to grab hold of the zipper standing between her and freedom when the large bastard sealed her fate with four simple words, “I double dare you.”  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “You. Bastard!”  
  
  “How’s the water?” he asked, shooting her a smile and a wink as he threw another log on the fire.  
  
  “I hate you!” she hissed as she continued to slowly make her way into the ice-cold lake as he took his time setting up their mini camp.  
  
  “You love me and you know it,” he reminded her as he walked over to the fallen log and grabbed the rolled up sleeping bag that he’d hidden earlier.  
  
  “Hate! I hate you!” she snapped around chattering teeth.  
  
  “That’s just the freezing cold water talking, sweetheart,” he said as he rolled out the sleeping bag in front of the roaring fire.  
  
  “No, this is,” she bit out, sounding triumphant and letting him know that he was about to get a taste of his own medicine, but he’d been expecting it. “I double dare you to get your ass in here.”  
  
  “I see,” he muttered, making sure to sound appropriately put out as he kicked off his shoes and pulled off his clothes.  
  
  “I hope you freeze your balls off, you sick bastard!” she hissed through a clenched jaw as he tossed his boxers aside and stepped into the cold lake.  
  
  “Shit,” he hissed as he forced himself to keep going, wishing that he’d come up with something else to help take her mind off that asshole.  
  
  “This was a dumb dare,” she muttered as he joined her.  
  
  He chuckled as he reached for her, pleased when she wrapped her arms around him and held on, most likely trying to steal the last of his body heat, but at the moment he didn’t care. “I’d imagined this going a little b  
it differently,” he admitted, deciding that telling her that he’d actually planned a romantic midnight picnic for two by the lake probably wouldn’t be in his best interest, not when the admission would cause her to shove him away and storm off.  
  
  “You lose your dare privileges for two weeks for this bullshit,” she announced as she wrapped her legs around him and tightened her hold around his shoulders.  
  
  “Fine,” he said, deciding not to argue, not when she was in his arms like this.  
  
  “And you’re doing my laundry for a month after this,” she informed him as she buried her face against his shoulder.  
  
  “Will it count if I drop it off at a Laundromat?” he asked as he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her shoulder before he could stop himself.  
  
  “It depends,” she mumbled against his shoulder.  
  
  “On what?” he asked, closing his eyes as he prayed for control.  
  
  “On whether or not you’re willing to splurge for the good softener,” she mumbled, making him chuckle as he tightened his arms around her.  
  
  “You’re a greedy little thing,” he said distractedly as he moved back in the water, needing to do something to take his mind off of just how good it felt to have her in his arms like this.  
  
  “You already knew this,” she muttered as she reached up and gently trailed her fingers through his hair.  
  
  He sighed heavily as he kissed her shoulder. “True,” he agreed, closing his eyes as he moved through the water, enjoying the fact that he could hold her like this without worrying about some prick trying to come between them.  
  
  This time he wasn’t going to wait for the right time to tell her how he felt. This time he was going to tell her that he loved her before some other asshole could come into the picture and force him to wait again. He couldn’t stomach the idea of sitting back and watching as some other asshole held her when he knew with every fiber of his being that he was supposed to be the one holding her in his arms. He swallowed hard, dreading her reaction even as excitement tore through him.  
  
  “I need to tell you something,” he said even though he had absolutely no idea how to tell her that he was in love with her, not after all this time.  
  
  She shifted in his arms and sighed heavily. “If it’s something that’s going to depress me, I’d rather you kept it to yourself.”  
  
  “It’s not depressing,” he promised her, although he was pretty sure that he would find it depressing if she rejected him.  
  
  “Okay,” she said, pulling back so that she could look up at him as her fingers continued to toy with his hair, “tell me.”  
  
  He opened his mouth to tell her that he loved her, that he wanted to be with her, wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, to have children with her, but he couldn’t find the right words. He’d practiced this in his head a hundred times a day for years, but now that he had her in his arms and another asshole was out of the picture, he couldn’t figure out what he was supposed to say to make her take a risk on him, on them.  
  
  “What is it?” she asked, shifting her hand away from the back of his head so that she could cup his jaw. “Darrin? Are you okay?”  
  
  “I…,” he started to say only to end up shaking his head with regret, because no matter what he said or did, he was going to fuck this up and probably lose her.  
  
  So instead, he kissed the top of her head and told himself that this wasn’t the right time.  
  
  Chapter 1  
  
  Present Day  
  
  It must be Saturday, she realized with a sigh when she felt Darrin press another kiss against the back of her neck and his large body curled up behind hers, pressing the abnormally large erection, that she was ninety-nine percent positive was the result of an accident involving radioactive waste, against her bottom as his arm wrapped around her. There really was no better way to wake up, she thought as she settled back against him, reached down and-  
  
  “Ow! Son of a bitch!” Darrin yelped, jumping off the bed in record time as she took her time sitting up and climbing off the bed.  
  
  She groaned softly as she stretched her arms over her head, noting the way the bastard paused in rubbing the back of his hand to watch her. With a roll of her eyes and a chuckle, she headed for the bathroom, throwing over her shoulder, “Get the hell out.”  
  
  “No,” he grumbled around a loud yawn as he stumbled back towards her bed and threw himself across it.  
  
  “Then you better have breakfast ready when I get out,” she said, absently noting that he was wearing black boxers, her favorite.  
  
  Pathetic, she thought with a sigh and a smile as she walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind her. She used the bathroom, brushed her teeth and had just stepped in the shower when she heard the bathroom door open behind her.  
  
  “You have your own apartment,” she reminded him.  
  
  “But I like yours better.”  
  
  “Too bad,” she said, tilting her head back and closed her eyes as she allowed the water to pour over her hair.  
  
  When she heard the sounds of the shower curtain being pulled back she smiled. He was such a persistent bastard.  
  
  “Don’t even think about it.”  
  
  With a chuckle, he released the curtain. “What do you want for lunch?” he asked, making her frown.  
  
  “What happened to breakfast?’  
  
  “It ended about two hours ago,” he said sounding amused while she stood there, shoulders sagging and muttering, “Damn it!”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “I have a date at one that I forgot to cancel,” she said, opening her eyes and grabbing the bottle of shampoo, resigning herself to a nice relaxing bath tomorrow morning after she got home instead of a leisurely shower now.  
  
  “You don’t sound too happy about it,” he noted, sounding hopeful.  
  
  Because she hadn’t been looking forward to this date. He was her brother’s accountant or something like that, not that she really cared, because she already knew that it wasn’t going to work out. According to her brother, his friend was in his early thirties, funny, smart and ready to settle down and start a family. In other words, he wasn’t for her.  
  
  “Jake,” was all she needed to say to make him understand.  
  
  With a chuckle, he said, “Oh, I see.”  
  
  She just bet he did, she thought as she heard the bathroom door click shut behind him. For a minute, okay, maybe a second, she considered going after him and stopping him, but then she realized that it really was for the best. Besides, this way she’d be able to meet Zoe and kids earlier than planned.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “What do you want?” Darrin demanded as soon as he ripped the front door open.  
  
  “I, um,” the man standing on his front step said, looking a little unsure of himself, “I’m here to see Marybeth?”  
  
  “Do you have an appointment?” Darrin asked as he folded his arms over his chest, giving the confused man a good look at the gun he’d shoved in the front of his pants.  
  
  “Umm,” the man said, glancing down at the gun, “her brother arranged a date for us. I’m supposed to pick her up at one.”  
  
  “She’s just finishing up with her last client,” he said, leveling a glare on the much smaller man.  
  
  “A client? Jake told me that she was a painter.”  
  
  “Are you a cop?” Darrin asked in his sternest tone, the one he’d honed to perfection over the years.  
  
  “A cop?” the other man repeated, noticeably swallowing as he shifted nervously. “No, I’m not a cop.”  
  
  “Good,” Darrin said approvingly with a firm nod. “Did Jake tell you to bring cash for your donation?

“Donation?”  
  
  “She requires a three hundred dollar cash donation, per hour.”  
  
  “I……,” the guy gave his head a little shake before he asked, “Are you saying that she’s a hooker?”  
  
  Darrin just stared at him.  
  
  “Jesus!” the guy gasped, stabbing his fingers through his neatly combed hair.  
  
  “Do you have the money or not?” he asked, hoping to speed this thing up so that he could get back upstairs and convince Marybeth to crawl back in bed with him for a few hours. He’d rather use the time to try to convince the stubborn woman that she was madly in love with him, but he was too fucking exhausted to do anything more than pass out.  
  
  He’d been working too many extra shifts and not just for the overtime, but to earn more vacation days. For every eight-hour shift he worked, he earned an hour of vacation time. So far he’d earned an additional six weeks of vacation time this year. Add that to the five weeks of vacation time that he’d earned last year, and the four he earned the year before that and he was going to have plenty of time to help his cousin and her husband out when the time came.  
  
  If it came….  
  
  Three years later, Connor and Rory were still trying to get their project off the ground. They were aiming high, very high, and they needed to raise an insane amount of money to get their project going, but Darrin had faith that they were going to do it. They were going to turn Rory’s dream into a reality and when they did, he was going to be there for them.  
  
  Every Bradford was.  
  
  “I’m sorry, but there must be some mistake. I’m looking for Marybeth Dawson,” the man said, sounding hopeful that this had all been a mistake and bringing him back to the problem that he needed to take care of so that he could catch up on some sleep.  
  
  “She prefers to be called Caramel Butter,” he said, giving the guy a knowing smile and just to fuck with his head, a wink.  
  
  “Caramel…..Butter……..,” the guy repeated back slowly, making Darrin feel kind of bad. The guy looked decent enough. It wasn’t his fault that Marybeth was his, had been since they were little kids even though the stubborn woman refused to accept it. He opened his mouth to explain things to the guy only to end up shaking his head in disgust.  
  
  “Listen,” the guy said, licking his lips nervously as he glanced around, “I only have fifty bucks on me, but I can hit an ATM and be back here in ten minutes.”  
  
  Typical, he thought as he reached back and pulled his badge out. “Run,” he simply said.  
  
  “Oh, shit!” the guy said, stumbling back. “I’m gonna go now.”  
  
  “You do that,” Darrin said, shoving his badge back in his pocket and sighed in disgust.  
  
  He was going to have a word with Jake, he decided as he threw the lock on the front door, walked back in her apartment and dragged his ass back upstairs.  
  
  “Did you get rid of him?” Marybeth asked as he walked into her bedroom, not sounding terribly upset that he’d ruined her date, which of course pleased him.  
  
  “Yeah, he went running,” he said, smiling when he spotted her curled up in bed beneath the covers.  
  
  “Did you pull your badge out?” she asked teasingly as he pulled his gun free and placed it on the bureau next to her Bradford Construction baseball cap. He shoved his pants off as he made his way towards the bed.  
  
  “Had to,” he said, pulling the covers back so that he could join her.  
  
  “You couldn’t have just told the guy that I wasn’t interested?” she asked, snuggling back against him.  
  
  “I wouldn’t have to if you just told your brother that we’re together,” he said, pressing a kiss against the back of her neck.  
  
  “That would be lying,” she said, groaning softly as he wrapped his arm around her and cupped her bare breast.  
  
  “Would it?” he asked, pressing a kiss against her bare shoulder as he gently squeezed her large breast.  
  
  “Yes,” she said, turning her head so that she was looking back at him as she pressed her bottom against his erection, reminding him that he hadn’t had her since yesterday morning just before he’d left for his shift, “it would.”  
  
  He released his hold on her breast and reached down between them. He reached inside his boxers and pulled his eager cock out. He watched as she licked her beautiful pink lips as he gripped his cock and aimed seconds before he pushed inside her warm, wet core.  
  
  “Fuck,” he groaned as he moved his hand out of the way so that he could slide deep inside her.  
  
  She gasped as she went ahead and licked those beautiful lips of hers, driving him out of his fucking mind. He reached up and pushed a strand of her black hair out of the way as he leaned down and brushed his lips against hers. “We can do this for the rest of our lives,” he pointed out as he moved his hand down her arm, over her breast, making sure to brush his palm over the large brown nipple that he loved to devour with his mouth, and down her soft stomach until he was tracing her wet slit.  
  
  “This is only temporary,” she reminded him as she spread her legs to give him better access.  
  
  He decided that it would probably be for the best if he didn’t remind her that they’d been doing this for over six years as he found her clit and gently teased it with his fingertip. He slowly pulled back, loving the way that she moaned as she reached down and gripped his hand to keep it right where it was while he pushed back inside her.  
  
  “I could fuck you all day,” he said against her lips, knowing exactly what that would do to her.  
  
  She moaned as her grip tightened around his hand. He deepened the kiss as he continued to slowly thrust inside her, his finger matching the rhythm of his thrust as he took his frustration out on the infuriating woman that refused to put him out of his fucking misery and marry him.  
  
  “My turn,” she said, allowing him one last thrust before she pulled away slowly, making him groan as his cock slid free.  
  
  After six years, he knew what she wanted and had no problem giving it to her. He brushed his lips against hers one last time before he moved back and sat up. He reached over and cupped her ass as she rolled over onto her stomach. By the time that she raised her ass up in the air he was already moving behind her and entering her.  
  
  Leaning over her, he pressed a kiss against her spine, on her shoulder and on her neck as he pulled back and slid back inside her. She felt fantastic, absolutely fucking fantastic, he thought as he placed his hands over hers and entwined their fingers.  
  
  “Move in with me,” he said, pushing inside her only to pull back quickly, hoping that it was enough to distract her into agreeing to his plans.  
  
  “No,” she said, panting as she turned her head in silent demand.  
  
  Chuckling, because honestly this woman was going to be the death of him, he leaned down and gave her what she wanted as he slowly pulled out, groaning against her mouth as he noted how wet she was, and pushed back inside. She was so damn stubborn, but that was okay, because he would do whatever it took, no matter how long it took, to have her.  
  
  “Then spend the day with me,” he said against her mouth, noting the exact moment that she went still beneath him.  
  
  “Ummm, I can’t,” she said quickly as she tried to entice him with a wiggle and a kiss that had him groaning and forcing himself to remain still, because he knew without a doubt that she was hiding something from him.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “On your back,” Darrin whispered, pressing a kiss just below her ear and making her wince.  
  
  Damn it!  
  
  He knew!  
  
  “This is fine,” she said quickly, daring a glance behind her, wondering if she could make it to the door before he could stop her.  
  
  “On. Your. Back,” he whispered again, stressing every word and letting her know that there was no escape.  
  
  Not for her.  
  
  “This is good for me,” she said, sounding hopeful.  
  
  “You have ten seconds, Marybeth.”  
  
  “I’m not hiding anything,” she lied, squeezing her eyes shut as she swallowed nervously.  
  
  “Why don’t I beli  
eve you?” he asked as he slowly pulled out until the tip was at her entrance.  
  
  “Because you have trust issues,” she pointed out, discreetly pushing back and trying to force him back inside in an attempt to distract him and because she’d been enjoying herself damn it!  
  
  “Marybeth,” he said sighing her name heavily as he pulled out the rest of the way and flipped her over onto her back.  
  
  Before she could even consider trying to argue her way to freedom, he was running his very talented tongue between her slit. “Oh, God…”  
  
  “What’s going on, Marybeth?” he asked as he leisurely licked her.  
  
  “Ummmm, nothing,” she mumbled, licking her lips hungrily as she tried to resist him.  
  
  “Try again,” he said, settling more firmly between her legs, getting comfortable, which was not a good sign.  
  
  It meant that he was planning on stretching this out for as long as it took to get what he wanted. She couldn’t do this. Not after the last time. She’d barely survived. She also hadn’t been able to talk for two days after that since the bastard hadn’t stopped until long after she’d lost the ability to scream his name.  
  
  “Please, Darrin,” she said, moaning his name as she spread her legs and reached down to run her fingers through his hair as he continued to lick her out.  
  
  “Tell me what I want to know,” he said, pausing to flick the tip of his tongue over her clit.  
  
  “N-nothing,” she said, licking her lips hungrily as she tried to roll her hips and force his tongue inside her, but the bastard wasn’t having that.  
  
  He kept her hips on the bed and kept leisurely licking her, hitting all the right spots and driving her out of her mind, but it wasn’t enough to send her over the edge.  
  
  “Just tell me what I want to know, Marybeth.”  
  
  “There’s nothing to tell!”  
  
  A long, drawn out sigh was his response as he tilted his head and gently suckled her clit, momentarily robbing her of her ability to breathe. She closed her eyes and tried to think of something, anything else to distract herself from what he was doing, but he refused to grant her a reprieve. He flicked his tongue over her clit before he traced a path down to her core and slid his tongue inside her.  
  
  “There’s nothing!” she practically cried even though he hadn’t asked her another question. At this point it wasn’t really necessary, because they both knew that he would keep going until she told him what he wanted to know.  
  
  He felt so damn good….so…good……..  
  
  “Please, Darrin!” she begged, moaning and whimpering when he kept licking her, bringing her to the edge and-  
  
  Pulling back to trace her slit again.  
  
  “You…son of a bitch!” she said, gasping and trying to shift away from him.  
  
  She couldn’t tell him where she was going.  
  
  She just couldn’t.  
  
  “Oh, God!” she screamed, her back bowing off the bed as he slid his tongue back inside her and brought her right back to the edge. Just as she felt her orgasm building to the point of no return he pulled back.  
  
  “I hate you!” she gasped, releasing her hold on his hair to reach back and grab the headboard in a useless attempt to pull away from him, but he wasn’t letting her go.  
  
  “No,” he simply said, “you don’t.”  
  
  No, she really didn’t, but at moments like this she really wished that she did.  
  
  “I can stop this at any time,” he said, pulling back just far enough to gently blow cool air on her over-sensitized clit.  
  
  “Then stop it now!”  
  
  “Not until you tell me what I want to know,” he said, leaning back in to press a kiss between the two spots that craved his attention the most.  
  
  “I can’t!”  
  
  A lick.  
  
  “Tell me.”  
  
  “No!”  
  
  Another long, leisurely lick had her licking her lips and moaning, as her body was once again brought to the edge only to leave her groaning as he moved away, leaving her on the cusp of a powerful orgasm. Her body trembled as he started all over again, she couldn’t take this, couldn’t do this. He’d find out eventually. She knew that he would. It had been useless to try and keep this from him and foolish.  
  
  When she felt his tongue slowly move between her slit, she gave in, unable to take anymore.  
  
  “I’m meeting Zoe,” she admitted before releasing a moan of pleasure as he rewarded her with a finger.  
  
  “Where?” he asked, sliding his thick finger inside her as he slowly moved up her body.  
  
  He continued to lazily finger her as he slowly kissed his way to one breast where he took her nipple between his lips and suckled. When he pulled back, he allowed his teeth to gently slide over her nipple, earning a gasp of pleasure.  
  
  “Where are you meeting her?” he asked as he moved up her body the rest of the way and smoothly removed his finger, replacing it with his hard shaft. He slid inside her as he kissed her cheek.  
  
  “At an agreed upon location?” she said, hoping that it would be enough to get him to finish what he’d started and forget about what she’d said, but unfortunately, for her, it wasn’t.  
  
  “Where?” he asked, kissing her other cheek as he slowly pulled back until the tip of his cock was the only thing left inside her and stayed that way.  
  
  He wouldn’t…….  
  
  Oh, God, who the hell was she kidding? He would definitely start this torture all over again if that’s what it took to make her talk. When he sighed heavily and moved to pull the rest of the way out, she quickly wrapped her arms and legs around him, desperate to keep him where he was.  
  
  “An amusement park!” she rushed out, uncaring at the moment that she’d just sealed her fate.  
  
  He chuckled as he pushed back inside her. She started to sigh in relief when the bastard took her by surprise and suddenly pulled out.  
  
  “What are you doing?” she asked, making a mad grab for him as he started to kiss his way back down her body.  
  
  “Getting started on your punishment.”  
  
  “Oh no,” she mumbled even as she managed to turn over, scramble off the bed and-  
  
  Scream in pleasure when he caught up to her and took her to the floor where he dished out her punishment for the next two hours.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “Still not talking to me?”  
  
  “Rot in hell,” Marybeth said, taking a sip of her soda as she walked away from him.  
  
  “Come on,” Darrin said, quickening his pace to catch up with her, “you know that you’re happy that I came.”  
  
  “No, not really,” she said with a tiny shake of her head as she walked past the games lined up on either side of them.  
  
  “You’ll have more fun with me,” he pointed out, wondering if she was still pissed that he’d told Trevor about Zoe’s betrayal.  
  
  She shot him a glare as she kept walking, probably hoping that he wouldn’t notice that she was walking away from all the fun rides. “How exactly am I supposed to have more fun with you when I came here to have fun with the kids?”  
  
  “Because you hate children,” he decided to remind her.  
  
  “No, I don’t,” the stubborn woman said as he reached down and relieved her of her soda.  
  
  He chuckled as he finished off her soda and tossed it in a trashcan as they walked past it. “Yes, you do.”  
  
  “Then explain why I invited them this weekend instead of you?” she asked, cocking an eyebrow in challenge.  
  
  “Simple, you don’t like going to places like this by yourself and,” he said, grinning because he simply couldn’t help himself, “because you knew that I would dare you to get your beautiful ass on one of the rollercoasters.”  
  
  “You bastard!” she gasped, quickening her pace until she was almost running through the crowd, but she couldn’t run fast enough to get out of earshot before he took it to the next level.

1lsfwvz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsfwvz,"Finished my first booknook, with some customizations: Sea Breeze","The first booknook I ever saw was on Xmas holidays in Montpellier, France, last year, in a small shop. It was the Garden House by Rolife. I liked it, but not enough to buy it for 40+ EU, so I googled other versions, went by looks and availability in Germany (where I live), and ended up ordering Sea Breeze.

Only after finishing the left half I found this subreddit and had my suspicions confirmed that I had unwillingly picked a really hard one. But it was so much fun to assemble!

Today, I finished it! I have made some small changes to flowerpots and decorations and a big one: It kept bothering me that the Bookstore sign was mirrored in the mirror, which imho killed the illusion that the path went on past the corner. I fixed that.

I'm so happy I have found this community, because everyone I told about my project irl confirmed that it was indeed very cute but also stated that they'd never ever have the patience to make one themselves - to the point that I started feeling like a weirdo. Can anyone relate?

Anyway, I'm hooked now and have two new projects lined up already: Abbey Library (yes, I know about the 300+ books) and Arcade Dating.

Thanks for all the tips and tricks and links I have found here, they helped a lot!

I've also uploaded a video to imgur:

1lsfwjk,https://i.redd.it/oare54nhh3bf1.jpeg,Your headcanons for when tang shen would be alive and a mom for the turtles part. 2,"It's just like the last one, I'm just going to get straight into it. (Thank you for @RedHatchet03 for inspo) Also, if you don't agree on something or anything, it's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. 

1. When Raph got with Mona lisa, she was a little weirded out at first and not really understanding, considering she wants her sons (especially her favorite one) to have the best of the best. She wants her sons to be with the most gorgeous, educated, loving and understanding girls.
She would always see how her sons made fun of their relationship, saying it's weird, etc.
But, when she saw how happy Raph is, she quickly accepted Mona into the family and even started calling her daughter. And whenever, Leo or Donnie or Mikey decided to make of fun Raph and Mona ever, they would have a slipper in their way.

2. She would teach Leo the traditional tea ceremonies and how to make and serve matcha. She would have all of stuff needed that she took with her from Japan and would teach him how to pour, froth, etc. When April first came to the lair, Leo made her tea ceremony to welcome her. On the topic of tea, Tang shen and Leo would often have tea breaks when she comes back from work and before he and brothers go to patrol or a mission, to calm and relax their nerves.  It's a tradition they always do, even if it's a rest day or a weekend.

3. She does her boys gift baskets on their mutation day and valentine day, as gift giving is one of her love languages. She always makes sure to get them stuff that I'll use or be extremely happy with, like her getting Leo a space heroes blanket or getting spicy sour gummies for Mikey.

4. She has nicknames for them. Raph, for example. One of his many nicknames, is gyoza. He had chubby cheeks as a kid (because tang shen would feed him too much) causing his head to be shaped like the specific food. She would call him gyoza, and she would pinch his cheeks and say she would eat him up. Now, he lost all his cute cheeks due to him exercising alot and his daily activities of punching the dummies and push ups, but she still calls him gyoza because he'll forever be her little baby turtle. She is the only one as well who can call him Raphie without getting punched or screamed at.

5. Whenever the boys would finish a big mission, like the finale of season 1, she would make a HUGE spread of their favorite foods. They would come to the lair, with smell of the food hitting their nostrils, and they would see the kitchen island/table with their favorite foods all hot and ready to be eaten. Of course, they would all sleep on the table, struck with a food coma after the amount they have ate.
6. Mikey's cooking skills and palate taste are very diverse and better. Since tang shen was the one who taught him how to cook, and she would cook and get foods of all types of cuisines. So now, that Mikey's older, he knows what food taste great and what doesn't pair well. 

7. She once found mutagen when she was once on her way home from work, during the mutagen hunt. She casually found it in a dumpster when she was throwing out her coffee cup. She picked up the canister, call the boys to meet her up and just gave it to them, telling them she just found it. The boys were blow away since they have looking for new canisters for the past 3 weeks. 

8. When she first started working and got her first paycheck, she bought the boys something they always wanted to have but never got due to them needing to save the money for ""better things"". Pizza. They have always seen the ads on her phone, and they always wanted to try it, but never got the chance. Safe to say pizza became a staple in the household. 

9. When Donnie wouldn't sleep or had a stressful day,  she would read the whole dictionary. Yes, the WHOLE thing, and she would do this many times, even as a young man or his teens, she would still do this, especially in stressful moments like when he had to do the retro mutagen for April's father. She would tell him the same old scientific jokes, with a huge smile and slide into the bed with him and read him the dictionary. 
TS: ""So a coke and a diamond were on a date, and coke told diamond she looks different than her profile picture, she responded by saying she's been under a lot pressure!"" 

10.  Once she pulls out the slipper, the turtles are done for. Even when they got older, they would immediately run away and scatter, trying to hiding places. Some would go into their shells, but overall, they cannot escape for long. For the slipper hits and returns to his owner.

11. She often forgets that the turtles aren't her actual sons. One time, Mikey cooked a delicious dish, and everyone at the table were complimenting him. Tang shen told him, it runs in her family and in his blood so he should be very proud of himself. No one said word until Donnie asked, ""Wait, aren't we your adopted sons?"" Tang shen just blushed and rubbed her neck.

12. She makes the boys speak Japanese whenever the April and Casey aren't around. She wants them to be fully fluent and confident of their culture. She often makes them read or write something Japanese once a week. Mikey and Donnie are the best ones at reading , while Raph is into more writing since he can take his take and write anything, and Leo's great at both.

I’m a pretty easygoing 30 year old guy who’s just as down for spontaneous adventures as I am for a laid-back night in with good food and better company. I'm 6’0"", white, blonde (yep, like my username), wear glasses, usually clean-shaven but giving the summer beard experiment a go right now. Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

1lsfuby,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsfuby,I (M) went on a date from Bumble today and this how it is going 🥴,"Me (M27) and her (F23) matched around 3 days back. Initially we had small talks with replies from both sides hours from the previous one. Finally, we got to talk a bit in a flow yesterday, and I asked her out. 

Fast forward to today, went out on a date with her. We met around 3pm and went out for a drive. She has a lovely little Labra, so we took it along as she couldn't leave it behind alone.
We spent around 3 hours driving around, stopping for around an hour in between as she wanted to have coffee. 

After almost 3 hours, went back to her place. No electricity at her place since last night. So spent an hour outside in the balcony talking. 
Then finally when the electricity came back, we went inside. 
She asked if I wanted to have coffee, since I had mentioned earlier I have cold coffee in the evening everyday. I said yeah sure. She said she felt like having cake. I thought ok she'll order a couple of pastries along with the cold coffee. 

Then she placed the orders on Swiggy, she put my number on the order and when I asked, she did it cash on delivery. Like ofcourse.

40-45 minutes later, the order comes and guess what, she had ordered a half Kg cake from one of the premium bakeries, for just two people FFS! And the cold coffees were not alone, she had ordered two burgers as well (which she didn't say, but ok, fine).
Then, she asked that the delivery guy has the UPI scanner, can you pay. ₹1150 for just this stuff, no offer to even split. I didn't make much of a fuss, thinking it would've taken this much anyway if she asked me to take her to a restaurant. But still kinda shocking.

A few hours later, she asks this on WhatsApp. Mind you this is just the first time we met and hadn't even been freakin' 12 hours after first meeting.
She also puts this on her bio on Bumble after we met. 
She had asked earlier on chat (hopefully joking) if I could get her a MacBook, as she didn't have one for work. I jokingly asked what would I get in return, she said Jo bhi maango (whatever you want). She then mentioned that she has just one rule, that she wants loyalty.

Context here: She lost her dad was about a year back and she is still studying. So struggling financially.

Looks like she is just desperate to get into a relationship so that she can get a guy who can take care of her expenses, take her shopping regularly and be a driver to take her to the hills for trips on weekends.

Seems like a major red flag.

I’ve been on liraglutide for a month now. transitioned off metformin (which I was taking for PCOS) so that I’m only on lira at the moment. I’m currently at 10 units and take it before bed to help with the nausea.

The second week was rough when I was transitioning from 4 units to 8. I had intense nausea, sweating, headaches, and even some noticeable hair loss. It got so bad at one point that I had to leave work because I couldn’t think clearly. Thankfully, things have improved since then!

What’s puzzling me is that, even though the food noise has significantly decreased (which I’m grateful for!), I haven’t lost any weight—if anything, I’ve gained. I’m drinking plenty of water, and I take MiraLAX to stay regular, but the scale hasn’t moved in the direction I’d hoped.

For context, due to severe food allergies, my diet consists of meat, fruit, and white rice. I don’t eat vegetables or dairy, and I avoid processed or ultra-processed foods. If I want something bubbly, I go for Diet Coke, and I have coffee in the mornings with stevia or Splenda. Other than naturally occurring sugars in fruit and the carbs from rice, I don’t consume sugar.

I’m feeling a little flustered and would really appreciate any tips, insights, or encouragement. Has anyone else experienced something similar early on with liraglutide?

5/29 - it felt like the rt side of my throat and nasal passage was dry.                               

5/30 - Felt a little tired. Made it daily appointments. Around 6:00pm that evening I decided I would rather watch tv in bed (which I never do unless I’m sick), had a bath, got in bed, very tired, couldn’t sleep, around 12:00am my body started to shake uncontrollably. I had to get back into a hot bath to stop the shaking. I was awake all night feeling like i did when I first had Covid, from yrs ago. Every joint in my body felt like it was going to crumble, right down to my wrist and fingers. Temp 101.7

7/1 - Tested Positive for a Covid this morning at home.  Woke up from about a 2 hour sleep, Temp 101.8, took Advil, extreme fatigue, sore throat, headache (very full head/pressure) Slept off and on, drinking water and gatorade, warm baths to help shaking, heat pads and ice hats (bc I have migraine) Severe joint pain, muscle aches (it was a very deep ache, felt like my bones aches), my shin bone hurt no idea why, this went on for a couple of days. Vomited bc I coughed so hard i gagged. 
**very weak and breathless 

7/2 - 12:00am still awake off and on, sweating through clothing, temp 101.8, taking Advil and Tylenol, coughing (felt dry like I needed to cough something up) sneezing, lots of nose blowing, head still hurting, sneezing, cough turns a little wet, muscles ache periodically, throat feels swollen. Drinking water, warm tea, gatorade, popsicles, seem to have a small appetite. **very weak & breathless 

7/3 - Fever is gone, joint pain is low to non existent, very thirsty, lots of coughing, sneezing, nose blowing, feel dehydrated, head still feels full and I have a pressure headache, took Advil or Tylenol (?), body aches in hips and thighs, slept most of the day, throat feels swollen to swallow. Called Dr for an inhaler, definitely helped to open airway. **very weak and breathless 

7/4 - Slept late, coughing, sneezing, head is foggy, dizzy, weak and breathless, able to eat and bathe, lower body aches every now and then, do not need Advil or Tylenol, throat not as swollen, cough is wet and productive (now that I have the inhaler), sneezing has stopped, sinuses still full but productive.  Took a baby aspirin, bc I’ve been down for so long and dehydrated (or it feels like it), drank a lot of water. 

7/5 - Slept until noon, sinuses not as full, occasional ache in my hips and thighs, wet cough, head a little foggy, throat no longer swollen, no need for Advil or Tylenol, drinking coffee, tired, chest still feels like it needs a little more opening up. 

I will add more as the days go on. I should note, the week prior to testing positive my 2 family members thought they had “colds” and were fine around day 3-4. I also had rt ear pain (sharp) 4 days prior to testing positive, a long with a dry feeling where my sinuses meet my throat, but only on the rt side. ",1,1751738136.0,COVID19positive,1,1.0,False

  ""I'll race you to the corner, Ellen!"" Annemarie adjusted the thick leather pack on her back so that her schoolbooks balanced evenly. ""Ready?"" She looked at her best friend.  
  
  Ellen made a face. ""No,"" she said, laughing. ""You know I can't beat you —my legs aren't as long. Can't we just walk, like civilized people?"" She was a stocky ten-year-old, unlike lanky Annemarie.  
  
  ""We have to practice for the athletic meet on Friday—I know I'm going to win the girls' race this week. I was second last week, but I've been practicing every day. Come on, Ellen,"" Annemarie pleaded, eyeing the distance to the next corner of the Copenhagen street. ""Please?""  
  
  Ellen hesitated, then nodded and shifted her own rucksack of books against her shoulders. ""Oh, all right. Ready,"" she said.  
  
  ""Go!"" shouted Annemarie, and the two girls were off, racing along the residential sidewalk. Annemarie's silvery blond hair flew behind her, and Ellen's dark pigtails bounced against her shoulders.  
  
  ""Wait for me!"" wailed little Kirsti, left behind, but the two older girls weren't listening.  
  
  Annemarie outdistanced her friend quickly, even though one of her shoes came untied as she sped along the street called Østerbrogade, past the small shops and cafés of her neighborhood here in northeast Copenhagen. Laughing, she skirted an elderly lady in black who carried a shopping bag made of string. A young woman pushing a baby in a carriage moved aside to make way. The corner was just ahead.  
  
  Annemarie looked up, panting, just as she reached the corner. Her laughter stopped. Her heart seemed to skip a beat.  
  
  ""Halte!"" the soldier ordered in a stern voice.  
  
  The German word was as familiar as it was frightening. Annemarie had heard it often enough before, but it had never been directed at her until now.  
  
  Behind her, Ellen also slowed and stopped. Far back, little Kirsti was plodding along, her face in a pout because the girls hadn't waited for her.  
  
  Annemarie stared up. There were two of them. That meant two helmets, two sets of cold eyes glaring at her, and four tall shiny boots planted firmly on the sidewalk, blocking her path to home.  
  
  And it meant two rifles, gripped in the hands of the soldiers. She stared at the rifles first. Then, finally, she looked into the face of the soldier who had ordered her to halt.  
  
  ""Why are you running?"" the harsh voice asked. His Danish was very poor. Three years, Annemarie thought with contempt. Three years they've been in our country, and still they can't speak our language.  
  
  ""I was racing with my friend,"" she answered politely. ""We have races at school every Friday, and I want to do well, so I—"" Her voice trailed away, the sentence unfinished. Don't talk so much, she told herself. Just answer them, that's all.  
  
  She glanced back. Ellen was motionless on the sidewalk, a few yards behind her. Farther back, Kirsti was still sulking, and walking slowly toward the corner. Nearby, a woman had come to the doorway of a shop and was standing silently, watching.  
  
  One of the soldiers, the taller one, moved toward her. Annemarie recognized him as the one she and Ellen always called, in whispers, ""the Giraffe"" because of his height and the long neck that extended from his stiff collar. He and his partner were always on this corner.  
  
  He prodded the corner of her backpack with the stock of his rifle. Annemarie trembled. ""What is in here?"" he asked loudly. From the corner of her eye, she saw the shopkeeper move quietly back into the shadows of the doorway, out of sight.  
  
  ""Schoolbooks,"" she answered truthfully.  
  
  ""Are you a good student?"" the soldier asked. He seemed to be sneering.  
  
  ""Yes. ""  
  
  ""What is your name?""  
  
  ""Annemarie Johansen. ""  
  
  ""Your friend—is she a good student, too?"" lie was looking beyond her, at Ellen, who hadn't moved.  
  
  Annemarie looked back, too, and saw that Ellen's face, usually rosy-cheeked, was pale, and her dark eyes were wide.  
  
  She nodded at the soldier. ""Better than me,"" she said.  
  
  ""What is her name?""  
  
  ""Ellen. ""  
  
  ""And who is this?"" he asked, looking to Annemarie's side. Kirsti had appeared there suddenly, scowling at everyone.  
  
  ""My little sister. "" She reached down for Kirsti's hand, but Kirsti, always stubborn, refused it and put her hands on her hips defiantly.  
  
  The soldier reached down and stroked her little sister's short, tangled curls. Stand still, Kirsti, Annemarie ordered silently, praying that somehow the obstinate five-year-old would receive the message.  
  
  But Kirsti reached up and pushed the soldier's hand away. ""Don't,"" she said loudly.  
  
  Both soldiers began to laugh. They spoke to each other in rapid German that Annemarie couldn't understand.  
  
  ""She is pretty, like my own little girl,"" the tall one said in a more pleasant voice.  
  
  Annemarie tried to smile politely.  
  
  ""Go home, all of you. Go study your schoolbooks. And don't run. You look like hoodlums when you run. ""  
  
  The two soldiers turned away. Quickly Annemarie reached down again and grabbed her sister's hand before Kirsti could resist. Hurrying the little girl along, she rounded the corner. In a moment Ellen was beside her. They walked quickly, not speaking, with Kirsti between them, toward the large apartment building where both families lived.  
  
  When they were almost home, Ellen whispered suddenly, ""I was so scared. ""  
  
  ""Me too,"" Annemarie whispered back.  
  
  As they turned to enter their building, both girls looked straight ahead, toward the door. They did it purposely so that they would not catch the eyes or the attention of two more soldiers, who stood with their guns on this corner as well. Kirsti scurried ahead of them through the door, chattering about the picture she was bringing home from kindergarten to show Mama. For Kirsti, the soldiers were simply part of the landscape, something that had always been there, on every corner, as unimportant as lampposts, throughout her remembered life.  
  
  ""Are you going to tell your mother?"" Ellen asked Annemarie as they trudged together up the stairs. ""I'm not. My mother would be upset. ""  
  
  ""No, I won't, either. Mama would probably scold me for running on the street. ""  
  
  She said goodbye to Ellen on the second floor, where Ellen lived, and continued on to the third, practicing in her mind a cheerful greeting for her mother: a smile, a description of today's spelling test, in which she had done well.  
  
  But she was too late. Kirsti had gotten there first.  
  
  ""And he poked Annemarie's book bag with his gun, and then he grabbed my hair!"" Kirsti was chattering as she took off her sweater in the center of the apartment living room. ""But I wasn't scared. Annemarie was, and Ellen, too. But not me!""  
  
  Mrs. Johansen rose quickly from the chair by the window where she'd been sitting. Mrs. Rosen, Ellen's mother, was there, too, in the opposite chair. They'd been having coffee together, as they did many afternoons. Of course it wasn't really coffee, though the mothers still called it that: ""having coffee. "" There had been no real coffee in Copenhagen since the beginning of the Nazi occupation. Not even any real tea. The mothers sipped at hot water flavored with herbs.  
  
  ""Annemarie, what happened? What is Kirsti talking about?"" her mother asked anxiously.  
  
  ""Where's Ellen?"" Mrs. Rosen had a frightened look.  
  
  ""Ellen's in your apartment. She didn't realize you were here,"" Annemarie explained. ""Don't worry. It wasn't anything. It was the two soldiers who stand on the corner of Østerbrogade—you've seen them; you know the tall one with the long neck, the one who looks like a silly giraffe?"" She told her mother and Mrs. Rosen of the incident, trying to make it sound humorous and unimportant. But their uneasy looks didn't change.  
  
  ""I slapped his hand and shouted at him,"" Kirs  
ti announced importantly.  
  
  ""No, she didn't, Mama,"" Annemarie reassured her mother. ""She's exaggerating, as she always does. ""  
  
  Mrs. Johansen moved to the window and looked down to the street below. The Copenhagen neighborhood was quiet; it looked the same as always: people coming and going from the shops, children at play, the soldiers on the corner.  
  
  She spoke in a low voice to Ellen's mother. ""They must be edgy because of the latest Resistance incidents. Did you read in De Frie Danske about the bombings in Hillerød and Nørrebro?""  
  
  Although she pretended to be absorbed in unpacking her schoolbooks, Annemarie listened, and she knew what her mother was referring to. De Frie Danske—The Free Danes—was an illegal newspaper; Peter Neilsen brought it to them occasionally, carefully folded and hidden among ordinary books and papers, and Mama always burned it after she and Papa had read it. But Annemarie heard Mama and Papa talk, sometimes at night, about the news they received that way: news of sabotage against the Nazis, bombs hidden and exploded in the factories that produced war materials, and industrial railroad lines damaged so that the goods couldn't be transported.  
  
  And she knew what Resistance meant. Papa had explained, when she overheard the word and asked. The Resistance fighters were Danish people—no one knew who, because they were very secret—who were determined to bring harm to the Nazis however they could. They damaged the German trucks and cars, and bombed their factories. They were very brave. Sometimes they were caught and killed.  
  
  ""I must go and speak to Ellen,"" Mrs. Rosen said, moving toward the door. ""You girls walk a different way to school tomorrow. Promise me, Annemarie. And Ellen will promise, too. ""  
  
  ""We will, Mrs. Rosen, but what does it matter? There are German soldiers on every corner. ""  
  
  ""They will remember your faces,"" Mrs. Rosen said, turning in the doorway to the hall. ""It is important to be one of the crowd, always. Be one of many. Be sure that they never have reason to remember your face. "" She disappeared into the hall and closed the door behind her.  
  
  ""He'll remember my face, Mama,"" Kirsti announced happily, ""because he said I look like his little girl. He said I was pretty. ""  
  
  ""If he has such a pretty little girl, why doesn't he go back to her like a good father?"" Mrs. Johansen murmured, stroking Kirsti's cheek. ""Why doesn't he go back to his own country?""  
  
  ""Mama, is there anything to eat?"" Annemarie asked, hoping to take her mother's mind away from the soldiers.  
  
  ""Take some bread. And give a piece to your sister. ""  
  
  ""With butter?"" Kirsti asked hopefully.  
  
  ""No butter,"" her mother replied. ""You know that. ""  
  
  Kirsti sighed as Annemarie went to the breadbox in the kitchen. ""I wish I could have a cupcake,"" she said. ""A big yellow cupcake, with pink frosting. ""  
  
  Her mother laughed. ""For a little girl, you have a long memory,"" she told Kirsti. ""There hasn't been any butter, or sugar for cupcakes, for a long time. A year, at least. ""  
  
  ""When will there be cupcakes again?""  
  
  ""When the war ends,"" Mrs. Johansen said. She glanced through the window, down to the street corner where the soldiers stood, their faces impassive beneath the metal helmets. ""When the soldiers leave. ""  
  
  2. Who Is the Man Who Rides Past?  
  
  ""Tell me a story, Annemarie,"" begged Kirsti as she snuggled beside her sister in the big bed they shared. ""Tell me a fairy tale.

  
 Annemarie smiled and wrapped her arms around her little sister in the dark. All Danish children grew up familiar with fairy tales. Hans Christian Andersen, the most famous of the tale tellers, had been Danish himself.  
  
  ""Do you want the one about the little mermaid?"" That one had always been Annemaries own favorite.  
  
  But Kirsti said no. ""Tell one that starts with a king and a queen. And they have a beautiful daughter. ""  
  
  ""All right. Once upon a time there was a king,"" Annemarie began.  
  
  ""And a queen,"" whispered Kirsti. ""Dont forget the queen. ""  
  
  ""And a queen. They lived together in a wonderful palace, and—""  
  
  ""Was the palace named Amalienborg?"" Kirsti asked sleepily.  
  
  ""Shhh. Dont keep interrupting or Ill never finish the story. No, it wasnt Amalienborg. It was a pretend palace. ""  
  
  Annemarie talked on, making up a story of a king and queen and their beautiful daughter, Princess Kirsten; she sprinkled her tale with formal balls, fabulous gold-trimmed gowns, and feasts of pink-frosted cupcakes, until Kirstis deep, even breathing told her that her sister was sound asleep.  
  
  She stopped, waited for a moment, half expecting Kirsti to murmur ""Then what happened?"" But Kirsti was still. Annemaries thoughts turned to the real king, Christian X, and the real palace, Amalienborg, where he lived, in the center of Copenhagen.  
  
  How the people of Denmark loved King Christian! He was not like fairy tale kings, who seemed to stand on balconies giving orders to subjects, or who sat on golden thrones demanding to be entertained and looking for suitable husbands for their daughters. King Christian was a real human being, a man with a serious, kind face. She had seen him often, when she was younger. Each morning, he had come from the palace on his horse, Jubilee, and ridden alone through the streets of Copenhagen, greeting his people. Sometimes, when Annemarie was a little girl, her older sister, Lise, had taken her to stand on the sidewalk so that she could wave to King Christian. Sometimes he had waved back to the two of them, and smiled. ""Now you are special forever,"" Lise had told her once, ""because you have been greeted by a king. ""  
  
  Annemarie turned her head on the pillow and stared through the partly opened curtains of the window into the dim September night. Thinking of Lise, her solemn, lovely sister, always made her sad.  
  
  So she turned her thoughts again to the king, who was still alive, as Lise was not. She remembered a story that Papa had told her, shortly after the war began, shortly after Denmark had surrendered and the soldiers had moved in overnight to take their places on the corners.  
  
  One evening, Papa had told her that earlier he was on an errand near his office, standing on the corner waiting to cross the street, when King Christian came by on his morning ride. One of the German soldiers had turned, suddenly, and asked a question of a teenage boy nearby.  
  
  ""Who is that man who rides past here every morning on his horse?"" the German soldier had asked.  
  
  Papa said he had smiled to himself, amused that the German soldier did not know. He listened while the boy answered.  
  
  ""He is our king,"" the boy told the soldier. ""He is the King of Denmark. ""  
  
  ""Where is his bodyguard?"" the soldier had asked.  
  
  ""And do you know what the boy said?"" Papa had asked Annemarie. She was sitting on his lap. She was little, then, only seven years old. She shook her head, waiting to hear the answer.  
  
  ""The boy looked right at the soldier, and he said, All of Denmark is his bodyguard. ""  
  
  Annemarie had shivered. It sounded like a very brave answer. ""Is it true, Papa?"" she asked. ""What the boy said?""  
  
  Papa thought for a moment. He always considered questions very carefully before he answered them. ""Yes,"" he said at last. ""It is true. Any Danish citizen would die for King Christian, to protect him. ""  
  
  ""You too, Papa?""  
  
  ""Yes. ""  
  
  ""And Mama?""  
  
  ""Mama too. ""  
  
  Annemarie shivered again. ""Then I would too, Papa. If I had to. ""  
  
  They sat silently for a moment. From across the room, Mama watched them, Annemarie and Papa, and she smiled. Mama had been crocheting that evening three years ago: the lacy edging of a pillowcase, part of Lises trousseau. Her fingers moved rapidly, turning the thin white thread into an intricate narrow border. Lise was a grownup girl of eighteen, then, about to be married to Peter Neilsen. When Lise and Peter married, Mama said, Annemarie and Kirsti would have a brother for the very first time.  
  
  ""Papa,"" Annemarie had said, finally, into the silence, ""sometimes I wonder why the king wasnt able to protect us. Why didnt he fight the Nazis so that they wouldnt come into Denmark with their guns?""  
  
  Papa sighed. ""We are such a tiny country,"" he said. ""And they are such an enormous enemy. Our king was wise. He knew how few soldiers Denmark had. He knew that many, many Danish people would die if we fought. ""  
  
  ""In Norway they fought,"" Annemarie pointed out.  
  
  Papa nodded. ""They fought very fiercely in Norway. They had those huge mountains for the Norwegian soldiers to hide in. Even so, Norway was crushed. ""  
  
  In her mind, Annemarie had pictured Norway as she remembered it from the map at school, up above Denmark. Norway was pink on the school map. She imagined the pink strip of Norway crushed by a fist.  
  
  ""Are there German soldiers in Norway now, the same as here?""  
  
  ""Yes,"" Papa said.  
  
  ""In Holland, too,"" Mama added from across the room, ""and Belgium and France. ""  
  
  ""But not in Sweden!"" Annemarie announced, proud that she knew so much about the world. Sweden was blue on the map, and she had seen Sweden, even though she had never been there. Standing behind Uncle Henriks house, north of Copenhagen, she had looked across the water—the part of the North Sea that was called the Kattegat—to the land on the other side. ""That is Sweden you are seeing,"" Uncle Henrik had told her. ""You are looking across to another country. ""  
  
  ""Thats true,"" Papa had said. ""Sweden is still free. ""  
  
  And now, three years later, it was still true. But much else had changed. King Christian was getting old, and he had been badly injured last year in a fall from his horse, faithful old Jubilee, who had carried him around Copenhagen so many mornings. For days they thought he would die, and all of Denmark had mourned.  
  
  But he hadnt. King Christian X was still alive.  
  
  It was Lise who was not. It was her tall, beautiful sister who had died in an accident two weeks before her wedding. In the blue carved trunk in the corner of this bedroom—Annemarie could see its shape even in the dark—were folded Lises pillowcases with their crocheted edges, her wedding dress with its hand-embroidered neckline, unworn, and the yellow dress that she had worn and danced in, with its full skirt flying, at the party celebrating her engagement to Peter.  
  
  Mama and Papa never spoke of Lise. They never opened the trunk. But Annemarie did, from time to time, when she was alone in the apartment; alone, she touched Lises things gently, remembering her quiet, soft-spoken sister who had looked forward so to marriage and children of her own.  
  
  Redheaded Peter, her sisters fiance, had not married anyone in the years since Lises death. He had changed a great deal. Once he had been like a fun-loving older brother to Annemarie and Kirsti, teasing and tickling, always a source of foolishness and pranks. Now he still stopped by the apartment often, and his greetings to the girls were warm and smiling, but he was usually in a hurry, talking quickly to Mama and Papa about things Annemarie didnt understand. He no longer sang the nonsense songs that had once made Annemarie and Kirsti shriek with laughter. And he never lingered anymore.  
  
  Papa had changed, too. He seemed much older and very tired, defeated.  
  
  The whole world had changed. Only the fairy tales remained the same.  
  
  ""And they lived happily ever after,"" Annemarie recited, whispering into the dark, completing the tale for her sister, who slept beside her, one thumb in her mouth.  
  
  3. Where Is Mrs. Hirsch?  
  
  The days of September passed, one after the other, much the same. Annemarie a  
nd Ellen walked to school together, and home again, always now taking the longer way, avoiding the tall soldier and his partner. Kirsti dawdled just behind them or scampered ahead, never out of their sight.  
  
  The two mothers still had their ""coffee"" together in the afternoons. They began to knit mittens as the days grew slightly shorter and the first leaves began to fall from the trees, because another winter was coming. Everyone remembered the last one. There was no fuel now for the homes and apartments in Copenhagen, and the winter nights were terribly cold.  
  
  Like the other families in their building, the Johansens had opened the old chimney and installed a little stove to use for heat when they could find coal to burn. Mama used it too, sometimes, for cooking, because electricity was rationed now. At night they used candles for light. Sometimes Ellens father, a teacher, complained in frustration because he couldnt see in the dim light to correct his students papers.  
  
  ""Soon we will have to add another blanket to your bed,"" Mama said one morning as she and Annemarie tidied the bedroom.  
  
  ""Kirsti and I are lucky to have each other for warmth in the winter,"" Annemarie said. ""Poor Ellen, to have no sisters. ""  
  
  ""She will have to snuggle in with her mama and papa when it gets cold,"" Mama said, smiling.  
  
  ""I remember when Kirsti slept between you and Papa. She was supposed to stay in her crib, but in the middle of the night she would climb out and get in with you,"" Annemarie said, smoothing the pillows on the bed. Then she hesitated and glanced at her mother, fearful that she had said the wrong thing, the thing that would bring the pained look to her mothers face. The days when little Kirsti slept in Mama and Papas room were the days when Lise and Annemarie shared this bed.  
  
  But Mama was laughing quietly. ""I remember, too,"" she said. ""Sometimes she wet the bed in the middle of the night!""  
  
  ""I did not!"" Kirsti said haughtily from the bedroom doorway. ""I never, ever did that!""  
  
  Mama, still laughing, knelt and kissed Kirsti on the cheek. ""Time to leave for school, girls,"" she said. She began to button Kirstis jacket. ""Oh, dear,"" she said, suddenly. ""Look. This button has broken right in half. Annemarie, take Kirsti with you, after school, to the little shop where Mrs. Hirsch sells thread and buttons. See if you can buy just one, to match the others on her jacket. Ill give you some kroner—it shouldnt cost very much. ""  
  
  But after school, when the girls stopped at the shop, which had been there as long as Annemarie could remember, they found it closed. There was a new padlock on the door, and a sign. But the sign was in German. They couldnt read the words.  
  
  ""I wonder if Mrs. Hirsch is sick,"" Annemarie said as they walked away.  
  
  ""I saw her Saturday,"" Ellen said. ""She was with her husband and their son. They all looked just fine. Or at least the parents looked just fine—the son always looks like a horror. "" She giggled.  
  
  Annemarie made a face. The Hirsch family lived in the neighborhood, so they had seen the boy, Samuel, often. He was a tall teenager with thick glasses, stooped shoulders, and unruly hair. He rode a bicycle to school, leaning forward and squinting, wrinkling his nose to nudge his glasses into place. His bicycle had wooden wheels, now that rubber tires werent available, and it creaked and clattered on the street.

1lsfqbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Professional_Web9156/comments/1lsfqbl/it_came_with_the_rain/,It Came With The Rain,"Hello my name is Marcus, and if you’re reading this, I’m dead. If I had to guess how you found me, I’d imagine it was self-inflicted, probably with a gun, same as my dad. Part of me feels *compelled* to tell my story. Whether that be *that* thing or just the regrets of a man facing his own mortality this is as good a place as any. I’ve always been “followed” by this thing I call the Gallow. It’s large with a body similar to a giraffe’s with some notable differences. Its skin is the same color as a drowned corpse, a sick pale deep blue, and It's bloated like one too. It has a neck that twists into a hanging noose, and it only appears when it rains.

I think the best place to start is my heritage. I was born into a family with a long history of dying suddenly and with little to no explanation as to what could cause it. The Gallow is most likely the cause, but I don’t think it’s malicious, it just *exists*. It has this *miasma* around it, an aura that brings a painful feeling of emptiness that you feel in your soul. I’ve always been able to perceive its existence but it only really started to guide me after my 10^(th) birthday.

For the first 9 years of my life, I had only seen the creature in passing, but never closer than a mile away. That changed on my 10^(th) birthday. It was an oppressively sunny day in the middle of July; I felt the sweltering heat beat down onto my head as a bead of sweat crawled its way down my neck. It wasn’t just hot it was *humid* and, while the sky was clear it still *felt* like it was going to rain. I looked down towards the cake in front of me, my priorities set on not letting the dessert my parents had gone through the trouble of obtaining become a victim of bad weather. I looked up towards my father and could tell from his thousand-yard stare aimed into the deep blue abyss resting just above the clouds that he himself had a similar worry. He looked back toward me, his eyes pleading forgiveness for a decision he hadn’t made yet. He walked towards me, asking if I wanted to continue the rest of the celebration inside. My mother, bless her heart, asked him what he meant. The only response she received was that same worried stare into space as if he was waiting for something, something *important*. Worried and getting agitated my mother began to push him for details, details my father didn’t have but wouldn’t have given regardless. During my mother’s angered pleas for an answer the sky went dark, it went from noon to midnight in a matter of seconds.

It began to rain so my dad went to get the birthday cake, he had said that, “it was the least he could do for the Birthday Boy” as he then ran outside grabbing the cake that now resembled something closer to melted plastic than edible food. He knelt down after placing the cake onto the counter, giving me this look I’ll never forget, the same look an old pet has when it’s fought for as long as possible but it knows that its time is up. He gently pushed down on my soaked head forcing rain water out of my hair and down onto my face. “I love you buddy, remember that.” He walked upstairs after that, claiming that he was just tired and wanted to take a warm shower and get some much-needed sleep. He never got to take that shower. Shortly after he went upstairs, I noticed the Gallow outside our front door. I heard the ear-piercing ring of a gunshot shortly after that. Weird thing is it wasn’t the noise that *truly* scared me; it was the *silence.* If someone survives a gunshot, you’ll *know* they’ll scream in pain or *something.* It’s the silence that scares you. I remember the sound of rain fighting back the deafening ring of Tinnitus. It felt wrong, something was off. Obviously, I was worried about my dad and followed my mom upstairs to check on him. In his room the scene you’d expect was there. The *smell* still sticks with me, a mixture of gunpowder, burnt flesh, and petrichor from the newly formed hole in the roof, allowing a steady trickle of rain into our home and baptizing my father’s body in a melancholic light.  

My mother collapsed after that, and while I couldn’t see my dad’s head, I *could* see my dad’s limp hand with his wedding ring still attached and I followed the shape of his arm all the way up to the tattoo he had gotten the year before of both me and my mother. I guess I should thank whatever powers that be. I was lucky enough not to go through the trauma of seeing the wound itself.

It wasn’t raining the day of the funeral, but the sky was overcast. For as good of a man as my father was, it wasn’t reflected in the attendance to his service. I stood near my mother grabbing onto her dress as she sobbed silently trying to hide the pain she was going through from me. I remember thinking the flowers on his grave were evil. Like they were mocking me whilst dragging my father into the dirt with them.

After the funeral my mother grew distant, she’d try to be a good parent at times but she’d always look at me and say the same thing. “I can’t. You look *just like him*. I’m Sorry.” Eventually she neglected me enough that the neighbor called CPS on her. I haven’t seen her sense the day I was taken away. I think that day was the first time that I *really* paid attention to the Gallow. I remember as clearly as I could driving away. I saw my mother standing in the door and as we traveled further, I saw the bloated sickly noose wrap around my mother’s neck, guiding her back inside.

After that the Gallow would appear every so often. Mostly on rainy days but, sometimes I would feel its gaze on the back of my neck. Thankfully back then I had *friends,* I had *school*, I had *distractions.* When I graduated, I felt lost for the next year of my life. I was adrift in the ocean of life and followed the current to wherever it took me. A long time later I had finally found my calling, I went to trade school to become a plumber. It wasn’t the most glamorous job but the money was good and I was happy that what I did would help someone *directly*. I remember it was around the time I finished school that the Gallow started appearing directly again. Now that I think about it, it was the same time I began dating. I can’t tell you how many dates I went on. Despite all of the people in my life, I never felt more alone. Then I met her, Morta. I had gone to a hockey game at the local college and we just happened to have seats next to each other. I remember that it was, ironically, a rainy day. The ice rink was as busy as it was on any other day, and bad calls had been made. Of course, Morta & I thought it was bull shit so we, more than a couple of drinks deep, began to slam on the glass, yelling at the team’s manager. We were kicked out into the freezing cold that night. To be honest it’s a miracle we didn’t get charged with public intoxication. Either way we exchanged numbers and got coffee the next day. Shortly after that we started dating. Life was good. Rainy days were less frequent after that.

The Gallow returned on the same day I went to the hospital for the first time. It was the first thing I saw when I woke up. My eyes opened hesitantly as if they knew what the day would hold and were trying to give me just 5 more good minutes. That was the closest I had ever seen it too. Opened up the curtains and there it was. The noose staring me in the eyes and, for a second, I could swear I heard the voices of my parents. Needless to say, it was a *terrific* start to the day. I did my morning routine all the time feeling like shit. I Brushed my teeth, spat out the toothpaste and saw blood dripping down into the sink. I wiped my nose, *it was bleeding*. I remember thinking, “that’s not good.” Before collapsing into unconsciousness.

“There's a tumor in your brain, and it’s metastasized.” The Doctor furrowed his brow trying to keep a straight face for my sake. It can’t be easy to break that kind of news to people. “So, what can *we* do, doctor?” Morta was holding back tears but was gripping my hand, the look on her face said, “you can *try* to take him from me, but I won’t let you.” The doctor, who had just pushed the wave of despair that came with telling us the first bit of news, glanced away, debating whether he should lie or break the hearts of his patients once more. “If- “he coughed, covering up how shaken his voice had sounded. “If you had come sooner, we could have done *something.*” Morta gave the doctor a puzzled look, saying “Don’t say what you’re about to say.” “The cancer is too advanced, at this point the only thing we *could* do is chemotherapy but that would only stave off the process for another month.” I cleared my throat drawing attention back to myself. “How long?” the doctor exhaled deeply. “4 months, 5 at most.” I stood up, grabbed my jacket, thanked the doctor and made my way with Morta to my car. She looked worse off than me. You’d think she’d just been drained of all her blood with how pale she was. “Are you okay?” she looked angrily back at me. “You’re asking me? if *I’m,* okay?” I realized how silly that was but I wasn’t about to back down now. “Yeah so.” She relented, relaxing her arms and sinking into the car seat. “Oh, I'm just *peachy*. My boyfriend is going to die and he asked me if *I* was ok.” She punched the dashboard and broke down into tears. I took her into my arms. “Yeah, neither am I.” As those words left my lips, I saw Gallow's grotesque head hanging down outside the parking garage we were in. It wasn’t *malevolent* though it was almost comforting, as if it were saying, “you don’t have to suffer anymore, it’ll be alright.” After that we just headed home.         	After the visit to the doctor Morta took time off from her job and I told my boss the situation, he just sent back the message. “Well, it’s a shame to lose ya. I just want you to know we’re all rooting for you in the last few days. I’ll make sure you're paid out for the rest of the year by Friday. Goodbye.” I’m not ashamed to say that made me cry. Probably more than when my dad died. I took the money to use for a vacation. Mortar and I decided that the next 5 months would be 5 months seeing the world. The first stop? London, I always wanted to see big ben.

We arrived on what was possibly the only sunny day in British history, we went to some museums, got food at local pubs and ended the night in a 5-star hotel. Morta ran her fingers up my chest. I quickly intercepted them their way downwards and held them in my hand. “You know, all things considered? This isn’t the worst way to spend a night.” Morta smiled weakly at me. It was far later than she was used to being up and she was *clearly* fighting off sleep. “You know maybe seeing big Ben was what you needed to kick cancer’s ass.” She was joking but I could tell that she wasn’t ready to give up hope. I let out a small chuckle as I saw her drift into unconsciousness. “Yeah, maybe.” I walked out onto the balcony of our hotel room and looked out into the distance as it began to drizzle. I heard my father’s voice again. “She’s a great girl.” I turned around to see the figure of my dad with his neck being held in place by the noose of the Gallow which was now closer than it had ever been before. “Yeah, if it was different I’d marry her, start a family.” My father’s face looked at me concerned. “you’re not going to marry her? You know she’d say yes in a heartbeat.” I stared off at the streets of London, looking for something in the streets that hadn’t been there for a long time. “Nah, the ceremony would take time, time that I don’t have. Plus, I know the answer, that’s good enough for me.” my father shrugged patting me on the back. “For what it’s worth. I’m proud of you.” The streets began to blur as my eyes flooded with emotions I didn’t think I was brave enough to face. Without words I turned quickly to my dad and hugged him, my neck brushing up against the almost leathery skin of the Gallow wrapped around his neck like a brace.

We woke up knowing that our time in London had passed, so we had to take a train. If I had to say goodbye it was going to be in the city of romance. On the train ride Morta was holding onto my arm while looking outside, it was raining of course and the Gallow was off in the distance slowly moving in tandem with the train still somehow keeping pace. Morta’s grip tightened and she looked terrified. “It’ll be okay, I’m not going anywhere.” She looked up at me then back outside whilst saying under her breath, “you better not.” I looked outside as we approached the stop and we could see Paris in the distance.

We had gotten our fill of food during our day out on the town. We visited the Louver and Morta pointed to the Mona Lisa and said, “can you imagine how sad it would be? To be stuck in the same pose for years? Not able to move or rest at all?” I looked towards the painting. The woman depicted was long dead but somehow, I felt that same emotion Morta had given to the painting. I gently moved my arm into Morta. “Well, if I was stuck like that, I’d have to piss *really bad.*” Morta laughed heartily and we left the louvre to wander the streets for a while longer. Some heavy rainfall came suddenly and we took cover. As I looked around, I was startled to see the Gallow mere feet away from us. Even stranger than the distance it was from me, was Morta’s reaction. I remember the one thought I had at that moment. “Please don’t see it, not you not now. Let it be a lightning bolt, let it be some creepy guys, just don’t let it be *that*” I swallowed heavily. “Morta?” she forced herself to look away from it and towards me. I knew in that minute my worst fear had come to light. “You see it, don’t you?” she nodded slowly. “How long have you been able to see it?” she slowly brought her gaze to mine the rain covering her face but tears were all too apparent falling from her skin. “Sense London, it looked like you talked to it and even hugged someone it had with it.” She saw it, she saw it and there was nothing I could do to stop it. “I’m sorry, we’ve got to go” She looked confused, “what? What do you mean?” I didn’t want to run out of time but if I waited any longer it could cause the worst. “It’s time to go home.”

We arrived at the airport and sat in the waiting area. “Sit here I’ll go get the flight ready.” Morta nodded at me as I walked away from her and towards the flight desk. I looked the flight attendant in the eyes. Her painted-on smile masking the fact she’d rather be at home. “One ticket to the United States, one way.” She nodded and prepared the necessary paperwork. I walked back towards Morta and handed her the ticket. “Ok when is our flight?” This part hurts. It *still* hurts. “*Your* flight is in 2 hours.” Morta looked puzzled. “We have to talk to Morta.”

“We’re breaking up here, our relationship is over.” She looked enraged. Rightfully so I had just broken her heart, *again.* “What do you mean.” I stiffened my upper lip. “Our relationship is over, thank you for staying with me until the end, have a great life. Start a great family, *without me.*” she began to tear up. “What do you mean?” I grabbed her Shoulders tightly. “I’m breaking up with you, I Still love you, I just, want you to move on, okay?” she looked even more pissed at me. “NO NOT OK. We went on this romantic vacation, we did things we wanted to do, and now what? You leave?” I felt the hot wash of shame flood over me as I struggle to find the words to say. “I’m sorry” I turned away before she could convince me I was wrong. I heard her screaming from behind me. “FINE LEAVE, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.” I didn’t look back, if I did, I wouldn’t have been able to do what came next.

The rain was damn near typhoon levels now. The Gallow leaned over, extending the noose attached to its neck as if it were a mother lending a hand to her child to lead them through a parking lot. I took the noose by the hand and followed closely. It took a few hours and by the time we arrived it was past dark the rain hadn’t let up. “A Motel?” The Gallow let go of my hand signaling to me that it had taken me through the journey and it was up to me to step through the door in front of me. I walked up stairs with the room key I had rented, I felt bad for the maid but there wasn’t much I could do at that point.

That leads to the present the Gallow is nowhere to be seen. The rain is still downpouring and I don’t think it will stop. Morta, if this makes it back to you somehow, I love you. To anyone else reading this expecting some deeper message or a happy ending, I’m sorry. I just finished taking my “medicine” and I’m starting to feel tired. It wasn’t a gun; Guess I *am* different from my dad. Well to whoever reads this goodnight, I’m going to bed.",1,1751737887.0,u_Professional_Web9156,0,1.0,False

I wanted to check in and share a bit about my journey so far. I’ve been on liraglutide for a month now. transitioned off metformin (which I was taking for PCOS) so that I’m only on lira at the moment. I’m currently at 10 units and take it before bed to help with the nausea.

The second week was rough when I was transitioning from 4 units to 8. I had intense nausea, sweating, headaches, and even some noticeable hair loss. It got so bad at one point that I had to leave work because I couldn’t think clearly. Thankfully, things have improved since then!

What’s puzzling me is that, even though the food noise has significantly decreased (which I’m grateful for!), I haven’t lost any weight—if anything, I’ve gained. I’m drinking plenty of water, and I take MiraLAX to stay regular, but the scale hasn’t moved in the direction I’d hoped.

For context, due to severe food allergies, my diet consists of meat, fruit, and white rice. I don’t eat vegetables or dairy, and I avoid processed or ultra-processed foods. If I want something bubbly, I go for Diet Coke, and I have coffee in the mornings with stevia or Splenda. Other than naturally occurring sugars in fruit and the carbs from rice, I don’t consume sugar.

I’m feeling a little flustered and would really appreciate any tips, insights, or encouragement. Has anyone else experienced something similar early on with liraglutide?

Thank you so much 💛

It went out this morning and my husband relit it for me and in an hour the entire candle melted into a puddle. For context, he has been doing insanely well in those categories after he did a blood magic spell last month. He inherited 50k from an estranged uncle who passed and booked two huge modelling gigs that pay 10k and 5k. The spell I did I cleansed a bowl and my body with incense, did a salt ring around and added cinnamon, basil, coffee grounds, rose petals, and seven bay leaves. I held the bowl and visualized me walking into my first day at my dream job, winning 10k in the lottery, and getting random money via e-transfer. Do you think something was changed about the spell when it was relit? Thank you in advance to anyone who has the time today to answer I know it may be a silly question.

I’m (22M) in a new city for work where I moved few weeks ago, and had a date with a beautiful girl (21M) who studies at a university where I work. We chatted a bit, during which she apologised for her slow responses which were due to work. We planned a date at a cafe she wanted to explore and decided to walk right after.

We were on time. I did the right thing to ask for consent before hugging her, which she refused and settled for a handshake. I held the door for her and paid for coffee which she let me. We chatted well.

I always made eye contact, smiled, and we talked about work, life, college - asking her meaningful questions, complimenting on genuine things such as when I learned she got a competitive research fellowship (I said you must’ve worked very hard for it and she smiled widely on that and said thanks). But the thing is, everytime I’d talk, she’d look down, away, fidget with her fingers and say things like “that’s great, or that’s cool”. She didn’t really do what I did about seeing and capturing- what Matthew hussey talks about.

Eventually we took a walk, talked about music and favorites shows and things like that. It somewhat aligned but not fully. I told her cool things about how I like to listen to and do fusion music - one that brings together western and Indian songs (she’s white, I’m Indian). And at the end, she said she had a piercing appointment to go to, and said it was nice meeting you. I said that too and said we should do it again sometime, are you comfortable sharing contact info. And she said “we can keep talking over hinge”.

I am very sad. I am in a new city for the first time post college and I haven’t dated much. Which is why every date matters to me a lot. unfortunately I don’t meet too many people due to which this was very important but she from the very beginning seemed very shy and anxious with NO fault of mine. I am a very soft guy who respects boundaries like every man should. I made good conversation, almost no awkward silences and we chatted a good bit.

I feel like crying. Honest to god, I did everything that is right. I was genuine and I feel hurt and broken.

I am not just looking for advice but also for thoughts and am also just sharing this to understand what more experienced daters think. My mom said she is probably very shy and new to dating and doesn’t trust men in general. So I wouldn’t take it personally. But I’m scared if she’s not interested in me. But then why the hell did she go on the date, let me pay, carry the conversation well?

I am likely reading too much into it and am scared. Later when I was walking back home I accidentally ran into her, asking her if she’s actually her from the back. And she said oh hi, and I said, “I’m actually just walking back home. Have a good one” and she said “you too”, before heading in. I don’t want her to think k I followed her because we took different paths at first.

I am very sad. Please talk to me someone 😭🙏",1,1751737626.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on a breakup I went through and everything that's happened in the three months since. It's been a confusing ride, and I’m struggling to understand what’s really going on.  
*I’ll be updating this thread over time, so stay tuned if you’re interested.*

# Background

Me (M33) and my ex (F27) broke up at the end of March after a 4-year relationship. The breakup was described as “**mutual**” though she was the one who officially ended things. I also had my own concerns, but it still hit hard.

# Her Reasons for the Breakup:

* **Lying about where I was / who I met:** These were never meant to hurt her. I didn’t cheat or flirt with anyone, but my anxiety made me hide things because I feared how she’d react. She eventually found out and said it broke her trust completely.
* **Not showing up during her COVID illness:** She wanted me to sleep beside her when she was sick, saying, *“It should be worth getting COVID because I need you emotionally.”* I told her I couldn’t risk getting sick due to work. She felt abandoned and said she never truly forgave me.
* **Spicy photos of my ex on an old iPad folder:** I had totally forgotten about them, but when she found them, she was furious. I admitted I didn’t realize they were still there, but it deeply affected her trust.
* **Living situation conflict:** She wanted to move closer to the city for university, but I hesitated due to high costs. I suggested she move temporarily, and we’d get a place together after she graduated. She saw this as abandonment and said, *“If you don’t move with me, you’re saying I’m not worthy enough.”*
* **Sexual boundary incident:** She has a history of sexual abuse, and I always tried to be cautious and respectful. But once, I missed a signal and didn’t stop when I should’ve. She cried, told me I crossed a boundary, and said she struggled to forgive me afterward.

# My Reasons for the Breakup:

* **Lack of respect for my needs and boundaries:** She often responded to my vulnerability with sarcasm or dismissive comments like, *“Oh, you’re such a victim. How about working on yourself first?”*
* **She kept a “pros and cons” list about me:** Every little mistake I made got added to this mental list. I always felt I was being weighed and judged, never able to truly “reset” or move forward.
* **Couldn’t accept constructive criticism:** Any time I brought up issues, she’d flip it around and blame me.
* **Checked my devices regularly:** After the iPad incident, she frequently went through my phone. I didn’t mind giving her my passcode, but the constant suspicion was exhausting.
* **Relied on external validation:** She would consult friends and family about our fights. It always felt like she needed others to confirm that I was the “bad guy.”
* **Emotional distance:** I never felt like I could truly reach her emotionally. She often shut down or drank wine instead of opening up to me.

**Emotional Dynamics**

I’m anxiously attached, so I’ve struggled a lot with the breakup. She, on the other hand, said she emotionally checked out long before it ended. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells. She rarely took accountability and blamed everything on me, saying things like, *“I literally can’t be happy unless you change.”*

Criticizing her was nearly impossible—she’d say, *“If you mess up, it’s your job to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”*

That said, she was also deeply loving at times—supportive during tough periods, wrote me love letters, and we shared strong physical intimacy until the end.

**After the Breakup**

I’ve really been working on myself—started therapy, did partner counseling, and reflected deeply to see what I could improve for a possible reconciliation.

**Month 1:**  
We texted regularly, almost as if we hadn’t broken up. She said she missed me and *“wished everything could be okay again.”* But we didn’t meet in person.

**Month 2:**  
She said, *“We can’t keep doing this. It’s like we never broke up.”* She offered a choice: friendship or nothing. I didn’t accept the friendship clearly, but we still texted and started seeing each other again.

**Month 3:**  
We met for coffee. I told her I missed her and was ready to work on things. She shut down and said, *“We will never get back together. Don’t have any hope.”* She blamed me for “ruining her life.”

Yet, on the same day, she offered friendship again. She said she still loves me deeply and wants me in her life forever - but just as a friend. She even said her future partner will need to accept that I’m still around, because I’m a “good person” and we just don’t match. She wants to go hiking, grab coffee, see movies together, etc. She even stood up for her promises and planned a trip for us, is regularly interested in my mood, wellbeing and asks deep questions.

She also casually mentioned she’s *already dating someone else*, which completely caught me off guard. She claimed it wasn’t a rebound - just that she had emotionally checked out earlier.

**Month 4 (now):**  
We’re still in contact. She said she still wears my t-shirts and necklace, cuddles my plushies, and looks at our vacation photos—**even though she’s dating someone else. Still says ""we will never get back together."" when we talk about our relationship.**

# My Questions:

1. Explanations for her behaviour? (maybe attachment style?
2. Why is she still sending so many mixed signals? Is she really over me?
3. Is her new date a pretty clear case of a rebound?
4. Why can she be friends if she hates me so much and I destroyed her life?
5. Why is she investing so much in me?",1,1751737510.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

Please don’t remove this post. It’s in continuation of my last post on the same date.

I’m (22M) in a new city for work where I moved few weeks ago, and had a date with a beautiful girl (21M) who studies at a university where I work. We chatted a bit, during which she apologised for her slow responses which were due to work. We planned a date at a cafe she wanted to explore and decided to walk right after.

We were on time. I did the right thing to ask for consent before hugging her, which she refused and settled for a handshake. I held the door for her and paid for coffee which she let me. We chatted well.

I always made eye contact, smiled, and we talked about work, life, college - asking her meaningful questions, complimenting on genuine things such as when I learned she got a competitive research fellowship (I said you must’ve worked very hard for it and she smiled widely on that and said thanks). But the thing is, everytime I’d talk, she’d look down, away, fidget with her fingers and say things like “that’s great, or that’s cool”. She didn’t really do what I did about seeing and capturing- what Matthew hussey talks about.

Eventually we took a walk, talked about music and favorites shows and things like that. It somewhat aligned but not fully. I told her cool things about how I like to listen to and do fusion music - one that brings together western and Indian songs (she’s white, I’m Indian). And at the end, she said she had a piercing appointment to go to, and said it was nice meeting you. I said that too and said we should do it again sometime, are you comfortable sharing contact info. And she said “we can keep talking over hinge”.

I am heartbroken. I am in a new city for the first time post college and I haven’t dated much. Which is why every date matters to me a lot. unfortunately I don’t meet too many people due to which this was very important but she from the very beginning seemed very shy and anxious with NO fault of mine. I am a very soft guy who respects boundaries like every man should. I made good conversation, almost no awkward silences and we chatted a good bit.

I feel like crying. Honest to god, I did everything that is right. I was genuine and I feel hurt and broken.

I am not just looking for advice but also for thoughts and am also just sharing this to understand what more experienced daters think. My mom said she is probably very shy and new to dating and doesn’t trust men in general. So I wouldn’t take it personally. But I’m scared if she’s not interested in me. But then why the hell did she go on the date, let me pay, carry the conversation well?

I am likely reading too much into it and am scared. Later when I was walking back home I accidentally ran into her, asking her if she’s actually her from the back. And she said oh hi, and I said, “I’m actually just walking back home. Have a good one” and she said “you too”, before heading in. I don’t want her to think k I followed her because we took different paths at first.

I am very sad. Please talk to me someone 😭🙏",1,1751737485.0,DadForAMinute,5,1.0,False
1lsfko6,https://i.redd.it/wwvu4mbve3bf1.jpeg,An interesting poetry collection,"An Inch of Sky’ by Paresh Tiwari is a collection of Haibun and Haiku. Both are Japanese forms of poetry with tremendous appeal in contemporary English Poetry. Haibun is a form where a block of prose is juxtaposed with a Haiku in a way that they both collate to form a further meaning. It yields itself to memoir, to travelogue, to lyric— to almost all genre of poetics. Haiku itself is defined by its fundamental cut, where two sensibilities— either in image or in semantic meaning, or between the abstract and the concrete, or on a plane invented by the poet, merge to gesture towards a meaning possible only in language. I was surprised to see an entire collection of poems in this experimental form by an Indian poet, and done so well. The poems in this collection are concerned with an urban consciousness, the daily routines of a working life, and the moments of mundane sublimities that arrange themselves in the odd corners of this world. In haiku like, *stubs of a dream -/ the ashtray fills/ with morning chill* and *hospital chill -/ the smell of despair/ in my coffee*, we see the two sensations merging. Why do the stubs of a dream belong a hyphen and a line apart from the ashtray? Because this juxtaposition points to the liminality, the torque of a human awareness moving through a concrete world where the hum of an air conditioner and the hospital chill have no interiority— they are mere facts of the world. The feeling is captured, expanded, experienced from different directions in the collection. It moves through the mundane, the delicate, love and grief with seamless trajectory. Here are two more :*midnight town .../ the train rumbles/ past a stifled dream* and *funeral home -/ the sun sets over/ a lark's call*

I hope u are all feeling amazing! I’ve listened to the show for over three years and although I’m nervous about posting this with all the kindness, support, and good advice I’ve heard both from the listeners as well as the three goats I decided this was the best place I could ask for help. So the story goes as this. My boyfriend(21M) and I(24F) have been dating for over a year now. We met online and actually live long distance…like I’m in America and he’s in Europe long distance lol. We had met online and 5 months later he came to visit me in person which was the most amazing feeling in the world! I’m total we’ve seen each other quite a bit for being so far apart(around 7 times total over the past year and few months). 

Anywho flash to a week ago and we were doing a makeup birthday for me since he wasn’t able to come visit on my actual birthday(which was in April). Leading up to my birthday he had asked whether I wanted to do my gift in person or sent to me and I chose to have that experience together! The make up birthday was very cute and sweet and I could tell he put thought into it! We did lunch, a cute paddle boat and swimming for an hour, laying at a park, coffee, and then a fun outside bar where there was some live music. When we were at the park he had said he wanted us to write things we loved about each other which I found very sweet and when we went to the coffee shop to do it he was in a mood and said he wasn’t feeling like doing it right then which honestly kind of made me sad.

 By the end of the night I kept expecting a gift but it didn’t come, and even when waking up I thought maybe there would be something due to what he said on my actual birthday. However, no gift ever came and I even brought it up saying “I think I had a dream that u wanted to give me something this morning lol, am I psychic or…?” which I know is kind of pathetic but I’m bad at confrontation when I know he gets so butt hurt if I’m disappointed. He said no and honestly that’s when I brought up and asked why he told me on my birthday he’d give me one in person? 

He then explained that he was planning on doing something else that costed a lot more money so that would have been my gift but he didn’t get around to doing it in time. I told him how he could have just written a little love letter or made something and I would absolutely love it! I think with all of this being said I realize I like gifts on special occasions more than I thought even if it’s something small. For me it shows that u know me and were thinking of me even if it’s something that was $10 on amazon or even better if it’s hand made! I just don’t know what to do bc this has been bothering me for over a week now and it’s not the first time I’ve been disappointed with his gift giving or lack there of. I would appreciate any advice on whether on not I’m overreacting or if I’m not than how to bring this up to him in a delicate manor to not hurt his feelings. Thank you all in advance 💕

TLDR: my long distance boyfriend asked if I wanted my bday gift in person or sent to me and I asked for it to be in person. Went to visit and did a cute make up birthday but there was not gift even though I just wanted even a little love letter or something small. Am I asking for too much or is it the bare minimum? 

(also if anyone would like to know the details of the other gift giving or what I did for his birthday than I will gladly respond) 
(Also yes I’m sorry for Sean rule maybeee lol…to be fair he lied to me at the beginning of us dating saying he was 23 lol) ",1,1751737465.0,redditonwiki,2,1.0,False

1lsfjjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lsfjjq/my_mom_is_a_manipulating_alcoholic_what_do_i_do/,"My mom is a manipulating alcoholic, what do i do?","I, (18F) am currently living with my mom (45) and dad (48) and have one more year of high school left. We are an immigrant family living abroad. We live in quite a shithole with barely any public transport, so its near impossible for me to go to the gym/work independently/avoid my household. Dad drives, me and mom dont have a license. I am currently working with my parents and saving up a bit of money.

My mom has had an alcohol issue for about 15 years now. It started with a glass or two of wine to drown out the noise of me crying when i was a baby. The issue has gotten much worse and severe. Whenever we visit our home country she can have up to 14 day benders since liquor is much more accessible there. Whenever she is clearly drunk (complete change in tone, can barely use the phone, talks back, gets angry extremely easily, drowsy and keeps talking about the same stuff she just said 2 minutes ago, breath smells like disinfectant) she completely denies having had anything to drink and gets extremely angry, sometimes physical. She gets migraines and has quite severe back pain which she has pills for. Strong medication for the migraines and opioids for the back pain. (The drinking has gotten so severe that people at work have noticed it, seeing her pour disinfectant into a coffee cup in the locker rooms, the boss has also given warnings)

Around new years when we were in our home country, she drank heavily for about 15 days straight and when we came back here she had to stop cold turkey since we found her booze and hid it. Due to the sudden stop, she suffered from psychosis. It was the scariest thing i have ever gone through but i cannot imagine how it was for her. Hallucinations, aggression, completely delirious state. Ever since then she got antidepressants and is supposed to see a social worker but she has recently gone off the meds without telling anyone and is rarely ever seeing the social worker. She hates psychiatrists and is against what they do, claiming they only use people for money and feed them with pills.

Whenever she is (we assume) drunk, she uses every single thing me and my dad have ever told her against us. She brings up the every single thing we have done wrong, even if it was yeaaaars ago, and uses it to hurt us. She has called me the f slur and lesbian for being ""too close with my girl friends"" and for crying when i stopped talking to an ex best friend a year or two back. I am straight and have told her that countless times. She has never said anything like this when she is sober. She calls my dad the most disgusting things i could think of. He gets of course fed up and yells at her back. She usually gets physically aggressive when they are in bed - kicks him, pushes him, and sometimes he grabs her and holds her down and tells her to calm down and leave him alone. I am not sure how far this can go, im not sure if theyre physically abusive.

One of the biggest issues currently is that i dont know who to believe anymore. My mom claims that my dad is extremely emotionally abusive and has been physical before, 10+ years ago, she says he is controlling and calls her disgusting names. She usually fesses up to drinking a few months afterwards, just not when she is actually drunk. She does in a way admit that shes got a drinking issue/addiction, but she just isnt able to call it for what it is. She just says shes got a ""little problem"". So, she claims that her ""little problem"" is all to blame for my father. His emotional abuse, her constantly feeling tense in the house, unable to freely do what she wants without his insulting comments and icky stares, scoffs. 

Whenever i talk to my dad about any of this, he seems genuinely shocked and doesnt understand what she is going on about, he says that she is manipulating both of us. He says that she has also told him that i am a manipulative disgusting little kid who just sucks money out of my parents and is only nice to them whenever i need something. She has also claimed that me and my dad having a good relationship and being physically close (hugs, ""air"" kisses on the cheek when saying goodbye) is extremely inappropriate and she has called my dad a pedophile. I know for a fact that she has lied about certain things, but that makes up for about 40% of what shes told me.

I cannot trust my parents. I myself am struggling with mental health and am seeing a therapist. Currently doing tests and stuff for possible illnesses but my therapist said that literally from our first 45 min appointment, im coming out of this with a couple diagnoses and its obvious that ive got some heavy stuff. I feel so absolutely horrible for both of my parents, but i dont know who to believe. My poor mom also keeps saying that she feels horrible even taking a mid day nap because everyone is going to assume that shes drinking again. But we can clearly see a difference in her state. I just dont know if its alcohol or pills or whatever. She claims that its her bad mental state which makes her ""like this"" (meaning drowsy, aggressive, cries easily, constantly sleeping, can barely hold up her phone). This state is what we had to see for years, knowing for a fact that its the alcohol, but i still cant seem to accept that i guess. I still keep halfway believing her and feeling so bad for her. But we do assume that shes drinking again for a reason.

Im just stuck in the middle and i dont know who to believe. Im also stuck living here since i have to go to school here for one more year and then im ""free"". What should i do during that year? What can i do to help my mom, my dad? Sorry for the long text 🙏",1,1751737385.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

A Letter in Which a Cactus Appears

I have no strength left—I swear not to write, yet I check my inbox again. I’m waiting. Sometimes I reread your letters, searching for ambiguity. I’m angry at myself for being so weak and indecisive. And I can’t get your shirt out of my head. The one with the wave pattern. It's all swaying around. So much agitation. In everything. Like intoxication.  

I pour coffee, open a book, but on every damned page, the same letters refuse to form words. Words would be too simple—these letters are trying to convey something greater—a name.  

I envy your students—an hour and a half near you, then even asking questions. That’s so much for ordinary people. What are you doing now? Who are you looking at? What kind of strap is on your wrist?  

Before you were gone, I got a cactus. It doesn’t need my love. Just a little water. Very little. Very rarely. But what did you need?  

The Third Letter, in Which a Name is Spoken

I finally managed to cry. My throat doesn’t hurt anymore. Nothing that ever mattered in my body hurts. It feels like I’ll vomit in about twenty-five minutes. Maybe twenty-three—I don’t like precision. Your letter is so rational. You know me the way only a mother knows her child.  

You love order. You knew what to say. But my certainty was different: Rome was better than the truth. Remember when we left for that apartment of ours? Remember how you sat there, twisting your Rubik’s Cube in the living room? It irritated me, but you didn’t notice. Jealousy of an object in your hands, jealousy of the squeaking—because it kept me from hearing your breath. So much time has passed, and I still can’t speak the truth aloud.  

The chill in my stomach has turned to shivering. And I don’t know what to drink to warm up. Manfred, I’m disgusted with myself, I hate the world without you. I keep staring out the window. One hand holds the blinds, the other reaches for you, but it can’t stay suspended anymore. It has no support. It’s drained of blood. Because you’re not here, Manfred.  

I step out to smoke on the balcony, barefoot, my lungs tired of smoke. Someone once said that some people smoke to let nicotine into their blood, others just to hide. I smoke out of stubbornness—I need to know my limits. Or maybe I just need the Rubik’s Cube to squeak… or for this damn shivering to stop.  

Another Letter, in Which Love is Spoken (Unsent)

Manfred. Man-Fred. A cursed name. It echoes in my head without end. Absurd. Like a pulse. Like a glitch in the autonomic system: instead of “fight or flight”, only “repeat and never be again”...  

There’s still so much memory left—I live by it. I remember our hands. Interlocked, carved from stone, veined. Trembling, trying to merge into one another.  

Manfred, Manfred, my damned failure and greatest triumph. I knew about the breakup before we even met. Pattern upon pattern. A stolen phrase—like everything about us. Forgive me, I know how you despise unoriginality. It drains. Just like our… our relationship. Stolen meanings need external energy—they can’t sustain themselves.  

I remember that apartment of ours, with its long hallway and marble floors. Lazzaro’s reproductions on the walls. You stood there, bewildered, and didn’t see me. Tried not to see. But you heard. My words—hypostasized venom, concentrated in every letter. God, I’m a monster. And you just stood there.  

""You don’t love me.""  
""What is love? We never had it. Love is for people—we are souls. Bodies are nothing, space doesn’t matter, time doesn’t exist. There’s only the void that two people filled, endlessly expanding, turning into strings and rings, exploding and collapsing into an ultra-dense lump.""

And in the end? Now I sit on the windowsill, smoke, and count every exhale without you. Now there’s time, because something has started to change. And whatever changes—dies.  

The Letter That Became the Last

I just don’t believe in love anymore—you reply during work hours. How ordinary…

It feels just like when you drink very hot coffee and burn your tongue. Should I be worried or wait more ?


Full context:
I went to the dentist 3 days ago to get some fillings for my teeth. When he anesthetized me it hurt like hell. He warned me before that it will hurt since it is in the back of my mouth. Like genuinely, compared to all my procedures (teeth crowns, fillings, root canals), only the extraction of wisdom teeth hurt more. I think it was even more painful than the extraction of an easier wisdom tooth ??

He also advised me to not close my mouth while the needle is in there. The thing is, I felt like chocking on my saliva, and I swallowed three times (with my mouth opened), and it hurt even more. I even shed a tear because it hurt. I was trying with my hand to signal him that I want the needle out of my mouth and he told me that he knows it hurts but i just need to support this one more minute.

Fast forward to today, my right side of the tongue feels scalded. Basically imagine that you eat/drink something very hot and your tongue hurts from it. This is how I have been feeling and it doesn't seem to improve. I can't taste anything on the right side, I don't feel any flavors. I really hope this is just temporary damage, but I don't see any improvements.

Or both? We met in high school and have been friends ever since. We’re both 25F. 

Lately she’s been a little off. I’ve caught her looking me up and down and I catch these weird/bad micro expressions from her when she does. Maybe that one is my head (everyone’s been saying it is) but the reason I love this friend so much is because I could always be my 100% self around her. I could be honest and so could she (I think, who knows now). We understood each others humor and had very similar, if not same, POVs on several topics. I thought we had a genuine female connection, no comparison, no competition, just genuine looking out for each other.

She hasn’t been a very great friend lately. I’ve been getting really bad vibes from her, which I never had before. There’s been plenty of instances that have happened now within the last year that question my friendship with her. The most recent two that happened within a month of each other. 

1. Made plans with me to meet somewhere 40 min away from both of our locations. She showed up an hour and 30 min late, no warning, nothing. Didn’t even bother to text me that she was running late. If it wasn’t because I called her trying to figure out what was going on, she would have never told me. 

2. Planned a hangout. This time I was driving and picking her up. We hung out about 4-5 hours and the entire time she had her headphones on. The ones that look like this>>>🎧. We went to a coffee shop, a couple of retail stores, even when we sat down at a restaurant for a bite… she did not take them off. It’s not like we were doing something together, but in silence. I was trying to talk to her the entire time and she missed probably about half of the things I said. I asked her if she could hear me, and she said “don’t worry bro, I have it on transparency mode.” 

Like wtf? She even had them on in the car, the entire way to our multiple stops and back to drop her off home. 

Soooo am I overreacting, am I being insecure and overthinking this slight mean girl energy, both, maybe? Idk someone pls give me some insight.

So basically, I love coffee, and going out to coffee is one of my favorite things to do. It’s one of the only things I do socially, as I don’t always have the energy to do things out of the house besides work. But every time my partner and I make plans to go out for coffee, it almost always ends up not happening. 

I’ve tried all kinds of different things. If I suggest we go in the morning, they wake up sick or overwhelmed, or we both wake up too tired. I suggested we go in the afternoon once, but they were not emotionally up for leaving the house. When I thought planning to do it might be the problem because they stay in ADHD waiting mode until it happens, I tried suggesting we go spontaneously, which immediately gave them anxiety over not having it previously planned. I’ve tried inviting a friend to meet us there, because I know my partner likes to be with friends, that worked once but not any other times. I made plans for both of us and their other partner to all go out together, but I think it only worked because we planned to go to the beach anyway and the coffee shop was on the way. 

Yesterday, I asked if they wanted to go out to coffee with me and their other partner, and meet my sister at the coffee shop to all hang together. They said yes, we went to bed assuming we were going out to coffee. This morning, they woke up feeling nauseous (common occurrence) but overwhelmed knowing we were going out, got way too anxious about needing to get up and get ready to go when we had literally an hour and half before we were supposed to be there. About 30 minutes later, they aren’t feeling better and I suggest we just cancel and go out another time.

It feels like I just need to give up on the idea of going out to coffee with them and whenever it does happen to work out, cool. I just can’t keep being excited about going for coffee and then needing to cancel. And I can go out with any friends when I want to go to a coffee shop. ",3,1751736790.0,CPTSDpartners,1,1.0,False

Since then I quit smoking and today I am experiencing awful withdrawal symptoms. I feel tired regardless of drinking 4 coffees already, my head pounds and I feel fatigued. 

The only thing that keeps me going is Guy. Those who've seen his source know how he is. He cheers me up and tells me to ""consider this a part of my training"". Those words make me feel quite strong and despite it being hard not to reach for my pack of magic nicotine sticks, they give me the power to not lit one up.

Measuring 10.75 x 14 x 14.5 inches and weighing a bit over 11 pounds, the machine feels sturdy without being cumbersome. I also appreciate the removable 40 oz. water tank. Refilling it is an effortless process, and it doesn’t interrupt my morning rush. 

Of course, it’s not all about appearances. The buttons are intuitive to use, and you don’t need a tech degree to figure out how to operate it. The refurbished nature of the product doesn’t show; Breville seems to have ensured it offers functionality as close to new as possible. 

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

Over these past weeks, it's become clear that the Breville Vertuo is not just another coffee gadget. This machine uses Nespresso capsules and employs Centrifusion technology, which stands out for its barcode scanning system. Every capsule is automatically identified, adjusting brewing settings to guarantee the best cup every time. Whether I craved a 1.35 oz espresso shot or a 7.7 oz coffee, the process was flawless. The crema on top of my coffee? Unmatched. That golden layer of foam feels like something straight out of a café and adds a premium touch to my morning routine. 

But here’s where it earned a gold star: the speed. Within 15 seconds, the water is hot and brewing begins. No more waiting around tapping my fingers, especially on groggy mornings. 

**Key Benefits**

- Straightforward single-button brewing mechanism
- Fast heat-up time of just 15 seconds  
- Stunning crema for a more authentic coffee experience
- Sleek design that complements a modern kitchen
- Variety of cup sizes (Espresso, Double Espresso, Gran Lungo, etc.)

**Versatility for Coffee Enthusiasts**

This machine isn't just about espresso. The fact that it allows five different coffee cup sizes is a lifesaver for someone like me, who often oscillates between moods for a quick 1.35 oz pick-me-up or the larger 14 oz dose of liquid motivation. On especially warm days, pouring these over ice quickly satisfies my iced coffee cravings. But fair warning: this machine is specifically designed to work with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, giving you fewer options to branch out from the ecosystem. While the capsules produce impressive results, their availability and price could make you think twice. 

**Drawbacks**

- Limited to Nespresso Vertuo capsules only
- Capsules can be pricey compared to ground coffee
- Slightly louder when brewing compared to other models

**Included Goodies: Milk Frother & More**

One of the joys of getting this specific machine was discovering the included milk frother. While I don’t personally use milk in every cup of coffee, my partner loves cappuccinos, and the frother’s smooth operation kept them impressed. Breville even bundles this machine with a complimentary kit of 12 capsules featuring unique aromas. This was honestly a fun way to get started and test out different flavors. 

**Product Rivals**

While using the Breville Vertuo, I couldn't help but think of its competitors like the Keurig K-Elite or the De'Longhi Nespresso Pixie. The Keurig offers a broader range of pods, which could appeal to those who love experimenting with flavors or brands. However, I found the quality of coffee from the Breville far superior. The De'Longhi Pixie brings a similar espresso experience but doesn’t offer the versatility in cup sizes like the Vertuo. For someone who appreciates variety and quality, the Breville comes out ahead despite being slightly restricted to Nespresso pods.

**Cost Efficiency**

While it’s not the cheapest coffee option out there, the value proposition it brings to the table is hard to dismiss. The refurbished aspect made it more budget-friendly while still performing on par with some of the pricier models. And with the energy-saving automatic shut-off feature after nine minutes of inactivity, it’s not just your wallet thanking you—it’s the environment too.

1lsf5sh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsf5sh,€92.64 2 weeks grocery haul and the resulting meals,"Hi all, I did a smaller grocery haul this time and some of the things i bought were not necessarily the cheapest, but i did save a bit more money. Not as impressive as some of the hauls i've seen recently in this sub, you guys are sharp eyed. I tried to follow the tips and tricks like I monitored the websites/apps of all of the shops around me and we actually do a grocery run (or more like a walk, they are all within 15 min walking distance) to multiple grocery stores to get em deals. I also prioritised buying loose produce that are about to be thrown out as they tend to be marked down heavily and it also prevents food waste. It's not the best strategy if you are not using up the produce right away, but i've also learnt to meal prep (again, thanks sub!) and to either keep my produce properly in the fridge or in the freezer. It keeps me creative as well, i like meal planning around it and i also like making jam, soup, sauce, pickles, and dessert with these less than perfect produce. We've also planted some extra veggies in our balcony garden, and now we have 5 tomato, 3 cucumber, some onion, two lettuce and some herbs plants growing happily and we can't wait to harvest them! 

However, we also have some priorities that are not per se budget friendly but i would like to acknowledge anyway. I try to buy as many produce without packaging as possible. I understand plastic is often used to keep produce fresh longer and sometimes buying a large amount of produce in a plastic bag is cheaper than buying the same amount without packaging. But again, i want to prevent food waste and to also prevent plastic waste. Luckily all of the shops we go to sell loose produce that are often on discount and this way we can still keep to our budget. It of course works differently depending on where you are and the size of your household. Do what makes sense for you :) 

Anyhoo, some not so cheap things we got the past 2 weeks. Got my partner's coffee from the local bulk store, quite on the pricier side (€16.95), but we did get like a kilo of coffee beans and they make really nice coffee and it's ice coffee season :D. We also got 18 eggs from the local egg farmer, again a bit on the pricier side in comparison to the ones in the supermarket but we thought we could contribute to local businesses too. These are of course choices we consciously made and not recommendation if you are on a tight budget. A good tip perhaps (tho you probably know this already), check out too good to go for nice things. We always get our bread there from our standard local bakery. We eat a lot of bread for lunch so it's for sure worth it. 

This is the list of the things we got with €92.64:
- 10 bananas
- 450g strawberries
- 5 lemons
- 2 aubergines
- 150g mushrooms
- 2kg potatoes
- 1kg brussels sprouts
- 2 multicolour lettuces
- Green lettuce
- 3 cucumbers
- 4 paprikas
- 500g green beans
- 500g tomatoes
- 500g broccoli
- 500g cauliflower
- Spring onions
- 2 large onions
- 200g caprice des dieux
- 18 eggs
- 400g olives and feta
- 500ml yoghurt
- 500ml soy yoghurt
- 2 mozzarella light
- 2 gnocchi with mozzarella
- 1kg coffee beans
- 1kg chocolate and hazelnut granola
- 55g instant yeast
- 4 mini garlic and coriander naan
- 3 loaves of bread (multigrain, white, sourdough)
- 9 sweet pastries
- 4 milk bread
- 3 bread rolls
- Sausage roll 

Produce left at the end of 2 weeks:
- 500g brussels sprouts
- 3 lemons
- 3 bread rolls
- Half of white bread loaf
- Half of sourdough bread loaf 

And these are the dinners we made: 

1. Berbere grilled tofu and black lentils stew with carrots, tomatoes and paprika on a bed of couscous. We still had some veggies from the big hauls of the previous 2 weeks so i made this dish to use them up and it's my first time using ethiopian berbere spice mix, i'm lovin it!
2. Steak with mushroom cognac sauce, homemade fries and salad with lettuce, cucumber, radishes and honey mustard dressing. Fancy dinner my partner made in celebration of our first ever vegetables harvest (radishes!!). We bought a piece of steak from the local butcher two months ago and it's a really good piece of meat. Of course steak is nowhere near budget food, but for such a bougie meal it costed us less than €7 p.p
3. Grilled aubergine, courgette, paprika and chickpeas orzo with pesto and a side of salad with lettuce, cucumber, sundried tomato, olives, feta and red wine vinegar and mustard dressing. I over grilled the aubergine so it was quite brown but it added a nice crunchy texture
4. Panfried gnocchi filled with spinach and mozzarella, and salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato and mozzarella with honey balsamico vinegar dressing. We didn't have much time to cook so i just quickly pan fried the gnocchi and chopped up some veggies for the salad. I quite like it tho and i looove crispy gnocchi!
5. Shakshuka with paprika, courgette and tomatoes, and a side of garlic and coriander naan and salad with lettuce, feta, olives, cucumber and tahini sumac dressing. Love shakshuka, a simple, fresh and delicious dish. My partner put 4 eggs in but they were kinda hiding and not that obvious in the picture
6. Airfry cauliflower with gochujang sauce and fried rice with broccoli, carrot, soy beans, spring onion and homemade kimchi. We made cabbage, pak choi and cucumber kimchi a few months ago. It was our first try and i was surprised that it came out pretty delicious haha. I used up the last of the kimchi for this dish and we're for sure gonna make more!
7. Frittata with potatoes, brussels sprouts and onion, and a side of salad with lettuce, radishes, mozzarella, cucumber, paprika and lemon and italian herb dressing. I grilled the brussels sprouts to get a nice crispy texture then i mixed them with the air fried potatoes and whipped eggs so they weren't soggy. Unfortunately i cooked the frittata too long in the pan so it came out quite brown but it wasn't burnt at least....
8. Spicy aubergine and green beans stirfry with marinated tempe and jasmine rice. I made two indonesian spice mix for this dish. I used a chili based red spice mix on the aubergine and green beans stirfry and i added in a lemongrass, some lime leaves and coconut milk. I cooked the tempe with a turmeric based yellow spice mix and water until it absorbed all of the spices, and then i pan fried it. It's not the most beautiful dish but damn it was such a flavour bomb
9. Dahl with yellow lentils, courgette, paprika, tomatoes, and a side of garlic coriander naan. Like shakshuka, simple dish and yet so hearty, healthy and cheap! My partner made a spice mix of cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, garlic, onion, curry and cayenne pepper powder and he used coconut milk to cook the lentils slowly with the veggies and onion
10. Quesadillas with cheese, refried white beans, jalapenos and paprika, and a side of grilled chili honey lemon brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were spicy, a bit sweet and fresh from the lemon, surprisingly a great companion to the cheesy quesadillas",13,1751736362.0,budgetfood,2,1.0,False

1lsf4tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lsf4tr/does_the_cuisinart_dgb800_grind_brew_coffeemaker/,Does the Cuisinart DGB-800 Grind & Brew Coffeemaker Deliver Quality? A Detailed Review,"The **Cuisinart DGB-800 Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew, 12-Cup Glass, Silver** has been sitting on my countertop for a few weeks now, and I’ve had enough coffee-fueled mornings (and a few late nights) to share my thoughts. I picked it up after my old, outdated coffee maker began threatening to sputter its last brew. As a coffee-loving individual—read: caffeine-dependent—I needed something that could handle whole beans, offer solid customization, and not make my mornings more chaotic than they already are.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker is anything but subtle in size. It’s got a sturdy frame with a stainless steel exterior, exuding that modern kitchen gadget vibe. It measures around 8.74"" D x 16.34"" W x 11.96"" H, so make sure you’ve got enough counter space to accommodate this beast. Though the footprint is significant, I appreciate the sturdy construction. The carafe handle feels solid, and the glass carafe itself is of high quality. The buttons on the front are easy to press, and the extra-large LCD display is well-lit, allowing me to see exactly what I’m programming, even when I’m still semi-asleep.

**Features and Settings**

This machine offers much more than your typical drip coffee maker. It’s automatic, and the burr grinder integrated into the machine is one of the highlights. It accommodates whole beans and grinds them on demand (to the exact number of cups you want). The strength of the brew is another welcome feature—whether I want regular, bold, or extra-bold coffee, this lets me choose. The 24-hour programmability is a lifesaver for busy mornings; I can set it at night and wake up to the smell of fresh coffee. An adjustable auto shutoff feature ensures I’m not worrying about energy wastage while rushing out the door.

[Check Cuisinart DGB-800 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b079nm2zyn/)

**Advantages**

What makes this coffee maker truly stand out is its grind-to-brew feature. The DirectFlow system seamlessly moves freshly ground coffee into the brew basket, and the Auto Rinse ensures no grounds are wasted. A half-pound bean hopper with a sealed lid keeps the beans fresh, a big plus for anyone who values the flavor quality of fresh grounds.

- Three flavor strength settings provide variety for different coffee tastes.
- Fully automatic operation makes the brewing process almost hands-free.
- Charcoal water filter helps remove impurities, improving the overall coffee taste.  
- Brew Pause™ feature allows grabbing a cup mid-brew—no more waiting desperately.

**Real Life Usage: Does It Deliver?**

Mornings spent with this coffee maker involve significantly less hassle. I don’t need to measure out coffee or pull out an external grinder anymore. The burr grinder is consistent, delivering grounds suitable for strong, medium-bodied coffee. However, I did notice that the grinder isn’t exactly silent—it’s not excessive, but if your house is quiet in the morning, you’ll definitely hear the machine at work.

Programming is as intuitive as it gets. The buttons feel responsive, and once programmed, the machine reliably processes the instructions without glitches. I’ve used it to make both 6-cup and 12-cup brews, and the quality of coffee remains consistent across both volumes.

**Shortcomings**

Like any product, this coffee maker isn’t perfect, and I’ve noticed a few areas that could use improvement:

- The machine tends to retain some moisture in the grinding chamber, which requires occasional cleaning to avoid buildup.
- Given its complexity, the learning curve might frustrate anyone not used to programmable machines.  
- It’s a bit on the heavier side, weighing 15 pounds, making it less portable for those who might want to move it often.  

**Competing Products**

When stack it against products like the Breville Grind Control or the KRUPS Grind and Brew, the Cuisinart machine holds its ground fairly well. The Breville, for instance, offers more grind settings for customization but falls short in affordability, and its design leans bulkier. Meanwhile, the KRUPS coffee maker struggles with grind consistency over time, whereas this machine’s burr grinder does its job uniformly.

The Cuisinart's Auto Rinse and sealed hopper are features that set it apart. However, the noise level and the occasional difficulty in accessing the water reservoir are disadvantages compared to quieter or more ergonomically designed competitors.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

When considering the features packed into this machine, it’s a competitive option. You’d typically pay much more for a similar model with a burr grinder in a standalone unit. The reusable filter cuts recurring costs on paper filters, and the built-in grinder prevents the need for a separate grinder. If you weigh the convenience of its automatic grind-to-brew system and the quality of coffee it makes, it’s a solid contender for a mid-to-high-range price point.

While the service was perfect, and the dining room is the best in the world, the positives really end there. While their famous crisps were great, as well as the raw tuna with an avocado sauce, the rest of the amuse-bouche were sub-par. The bread was far from the best I’ve had. The signature caviar starter consisted of very high quality components, but this wasn’t a 3* dish, and tasted like a knock-off version of Robuchon’s dots. 

The lobster and pigeon were cooked perfectly, but the sauces and sides weren’t great accompaniments. The palate cleanser served to us in the kitchen was bad, and the cheeses were only average by French 3* standards. 

This is the second time I’ve had the signature baba, and I still felt it’s too rich, with too much rum, and chantilly cream that’s too thick, rich, and sweet. The raspberries dessert with the matcha soufflé was slightly better, but overall not an exceptional dish, and it felt disjointed. The mignardises and coffee were awful, and the Ducasse chocolates weren’t great. 

One thing I’ll give them credit for was the wine list. This place has long been criticized for having the worst prices, however, though I was shocked how small their wine list is, I found practically every bottle to be reasonably priced, with an extremely affordable by the glass selection.

**It was a small café on the corner called Beg’s Donuts. He ran across the busy street making sure to watch out for the Cabbie that had dropped him off. The Irony of Paul getting killed by a drunk driver he had supplied alcohol made him laugh to himself. He made it to the door, alive.**

**The mixed stench of coffee, body odor, and cheap perfume waded though the circulating air in the room. One ingredient away from being equal to a biological weapon, Paul thought. The smell invaded his nose like a pillaging army, the only redeeming quality of the place was a fan on the counter blowing the aroma of greasy French fries his way. An older woman with an indifferent and angular face put a coffee in front of him. Her hair tied tight pulled the skin on her face back and her nametag read** ***Lucy.***

 

**“Let me know if you want milk instead.” Lucy quipped.**

 

**“No, this is perfect, thank you.”**

 

**She gave him a smile that he could only describe as faker than a counterfeit bill. Paul poured a creamer and a dash of sugar into his black coffee and swirled the spoon and created a creamy hurricane.**",1,1751736091.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Ghum Station's café was a haven of warmth and nostalgia, the rich aroma of coffee mingling with the scent of aged wood. I sat at my usual corner table, clad in my weathered leather jacket—a memento from countless bike journeys. As I sipped my coffee, savoring its comforting heat, the door chime jingled softly.

She stepped in.

Time seemed to blur. Her eyes, deep and contemplative, scanned the room with a familiar intensity. The slight furrow of her brow as she perused the menu was unchanged, yet there was a new distance in her demeanor—a guardedness that hadn't been there before.

Our eyes met. Recognition flickered, followed by a fleeting widening of her gaze. Then, a neutral smile, practiced and polite.

I offered a nod. She returned it.

It could have ended there—a brief encounter, a ghost from the past—but Darjeeling had other plans.

That evening, the heavens opened. Rain cascaded down, a relentless curtain that drove strangers together under shared shelters. By some twist of fate, we found ourselves side by side on a secluded balcony, cradling cups of steaming tea. The world beyond was a canvas of mist and shadow, clouds weaving through the hills in a silent dance.

The silence between us was thick, laden with unspoken words and memories. It was she who finally broke it.

""Do you still write?"" Her voice was soft, yet it carried the weight of years gone by.

""Sometimes,"" I replied, my gaze fixed on the horizon. ""Do you still read?""

A faint smile touched her lips. ""Only when I can't sleep.""

We lapsed back into silence, but this time, it felt different. The unspoken understanding between us was louder than any words could be.",1,1751736001.0,IndianTeenagers,1,1.0,False
1lsf0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1lsf0nk/psa_if_youre_weird_or_socially_awkward_the_mba/,"PSA: If you're weird or socially awkward, the MBA won't automatically upgrade your social life","I've seen a lot of people write lately about wanting to do an MBA for the social life upgrade.

Yes, in theory it's a rare place where you have the opportunity to make a ton of new friends as an adult. Some of which become lifelong friends. It's a very party and social environment, with most people being extroverts.

However, relationships are two way streets. If you want to be popular, other people need to see value in you. You need to bring value. People aren't altruistic charities. MBA types aren't looking to adopt the lost puppy. They're mainly ambitious, self interested type A personalities who care about boosting their career and having fun. 

and if you are weird or socially awkward what'll happen is people will be cordial to your face but won't befriend you. You won't get invites to birthday parties, overnight trips, international treks, house parties, etc. Unless it's an open invite where you'll left out because people won't include you in their group conversations.

You'll face subtle exclusion. People won't be interested in actively including you in things. You won't get bullied but people with ignore you in a passive aggressive way. You won't get wedding invites down the line, and people will ignore you when you ask to get coffee chats or lunch, or they'll come up with an excuse for being busy while grabbing lunch with other classmates.

Yes, the social scene can be very cliquey and you'll get excluded from the cliques and be shit outta luck.

The only way to get away with being super weird or awkward is if you're very conventionally attractive. More so if you're a woman. Otherwise, you're shit out of luck.

There are a few different ways to add value. You can be physically attractive, have good fashion sense, be funny, be a good conversationalist or listener, be entertaining and ""fun"" to be around. The main things are being seen as cool, fun, interesting, or chill. Have a cool hobby, preferably a social one. Take the initiative to plan things and invite others, such as by cooking your cuisine's food and hosting a large group at your house/apartment. 

Only then will you become more of a social butterfly and someone that people are naturally drawn to. But you can't be seen as a try hard or too needy either. Don't trauma tump or bring up really personal or super vulnerable topics with those you aren't close to. Don't bring up heavy topics like politics all the time.

I see a lot of nerdy socially awkward engineers, particularly international ones, make this mistake and then complaining about having no friends or not getting invited to things. Just automatically joining the MBA won't upgrade your social life: you have to be someone that others WANT to hang out with.",11,1751735982.0,MBA,9,0.76,False

Me and my boyfriend were planning on living in a townhouse in Brighton, until my work required us to move our lives to another city by September. We are looking another **student or young professional** to take our place on this lease/sublet. The house is a very comfortable and large upstairs unit of a 2 unit townhouse, with very clean and respectful roommates, most of which are currently attending school in the area (at Berklee).

The house (5b2b) is ***pet-friendly,*** has ***in-unit laundry*****,** and the particular room has a ***private balcony***. The room also has 6 windows on 3 of the 4 walls, along with blackout curtains. The house has central AC/Heating, dishwasher, gas stove, garage for storage, and a parking spot in a driveway. The house is about a 5 minute walk from the 57, 86, 66 bus route. It's also very close to star market/trader joes.

Everyone currently living in the house are musicians. They're all incredibly friendly and like to host get-togethers, make food together, coffee, and hang out in general. It's 3 men and 2 women, and it is a very well established, cozy home. There are also currently no pets there, but if you were to bring one, that is completely available, and the only cost would be a **$50/mo pet rent**, with **no pet deposit**.

The room that I (was) moving into, that you would be moving into, is on the corner of the house and furthest from any of the other rooms, and even has decent sound proofing. The person who used to live in there was a music producer, so the sound proofing is top-notch for the noise isolation.

The move-in date would be on **September 1st**, and a **$900 security deposit** as well as **First and Last month's rent** would be due ($1300/mo)

If you're interested or have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out! I also have a 2-minute long video walkthrough available upon request. Thanks so much and please share this around!

He hated Rick for It.

Then one night, after too many drinks and an internet rabbit hole, Darren found the site. Black screen. Blinking green text:

”Want what he has? Make it yours.”

He clicked yes.

The world jerked sideways. When it settled, Darren wasn’t in his body anymore, he was inside Rick. Not in control, just there. Like watching a movie from behind someone else’s eyes.

But not just any movie. This was sleek and fast-cut, all neon and sweat and seduction. A porno with a plot. Darren felt every sensation with vivid clarity, like he was the audience and the leading man all at once.

Rick’s muscles flexed under tailored suits. His reflection smirked back with perfect teeth and casual confidence. He flirted without effort, moved through velvet-rope nightclubs like he belonged, and ended his nights tangled up in sheets with someone new and stunning. Darren basked in each drink, each kiss, each gasp not really meant for him, but oh, how he felt them anyway.

Until one day, Rick started coughing.

At first it was a tickle. Then it got worse, night sweats, weight loss. His skin sagged, and his eyes looked sunken. Darren panicked.

He tried to leave. He screamed inside Rick’s head. But no one could hear him.

Rick went to doctors. Scans. Biopsies. Concerned looks.

Then surgery.

Darren felt the cold of the table, the blur of anesthesia. For the first time since entering Rick, he felt fear. Real, bottomless fear.

He could hear the surgeons.

“Mass near the base of the brain. Looks…weird.”

“It feels like it’s watching me.”

“Let’s get it out.”

And then, searing pain. Not Rick’s pain. His pain.

They were cutting him out.

He felt every slice. He tried to scream, but he no longer had a mouth.

The last thing he saw was Rick’s eyes fluttering open in recovery, alive, pale, but smiling.

Darren lay in a dish. A quivering lump of meat.

Still conscious.

Still aware.

The nurse labeled the jar: “Anomalous Tumor. Send for study.”

Somewhere, in a cold sterile lab, Darren waits.

Watching.

And this last time she literally snuck up behind me (I’d noticed her but there was a whole queue of people so decided to shop like normal). Anyway she laughs and says she didn’t mean to scare me and strikes up conversation and talk about how she rewatched to refresh her memory the movie we talked about and I decided fuck it let me ask her to hang out. She’s beautiful but I was asking her out as a friend because it’s more my speed to get to know someone first (I’m demisexual).

I got flustered to the point I started speaking English but we kept talking and even though she would look back at the register I’d be the one to point out to her when a customer was coming. She just seemed really into talking to me and I swear I sweated out adrenaline; I like assertive and bubbly women. Anyway I finally rush to the counter to pay and also make it easier to talk I ask if she’s free tomorrow and she said something along the lines of for me she’ll make time so I suggested 6 o’clock at this place but then when I said wait let me double check because everything closes early on Sunday she said good idea we don’t want to mess up our “date” or good idea our “date” needs to go well. Buuuut I’m scared I misheard her, like the adrenaline was messing me up or my autism made me misread the situation, like she wouldn’t let me pay for my shopping bag either (😝) but like that could be a friend thing to right?

1lseu2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1lseu2o/tragedy_or_wakeup_call/,. Tragedy or wake‑up call?,". Why do so many people feel lonely and insecure? 
There’s no simple fix for loneliness. It’s a multilayered, nuanced experience shaped by biological drives, personal history, environmental factors, and societal structures. 

The rupture with the divine isn’t just about disbelief—it reflects a deeper erosion of spiritual purpose, communal identity, and sacred meaning. Reconnection demands:

More than rituals—relational, embodied spirituality in shared life.
Less dogma—more alignment with modern values, honesty, and authenticity.
Deep spiritual work—embracing conflict, doubt, awe, not just comfort.

It os not just a matter of “losing faith,” but a profound unraveling of our sense of the divine intertwined with cultural, technological, personal, and institutional shifts.

Some global circumstances:
🔹 Hyper‑individualism
Our culture increasingly prizes independence over community. Traditional structures like family, local associations, and public meeting places have weakened, reducing the social support available to us.

🔹 Superficial “self‑love”
Today’s celebration of self‑care often translates to commercialized indulgence—luxury, pampering, products—that doesn’t meet our deeper emotional needs. Ironically, it can increase isolation.

🔹 Social media’s false connections
As psychologists and users have noted, online interactions often replace genuine face‑to‑face encounters, triggering emptiness, comparison stress, and a sense of living through façades.

🔹 Systemic pressures
Stressful workplaces, housing crises—especially for younger generations—and fragmented families exacerbate social isolation.

🔹 Consequences for mental and physical health
Loneliness is linked to heightened risks of depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity—and some researchers equate its impact to smoking or obesity.

2. Tragedy or wake‑up call?

Perhaps both.

A trigger for reflection – losing our sense of purpose can be the catalyst for recognizing we need deeper connection than material success or curated self-care.
A collective reckoning – a global loneliness crisis has prompted both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Surgeon General to classify it as a public health emergency.
It is profoundly tragic—but also an invitation to rethink how we live, what truly matters: relationships, purpose, belonging, trust, and connection.

3. What can we do—personally and collectively?

A) Individually
Rebuild genuine relationships
Invite a friend for coffee, join a book club, sign up for a team sport—even small interactions matter.
Engage in community
Volunteer or participate in social initiatives. It creates purpose and connection.
Mindfully use technology
Limit endless scrolling. Choose active conversation over passive feeds—seek connection, not just content.
Nurture mind and body
Consistent sleep, exercise, meditation, and creative hobbies bolster resilience and joy.
Seek professional support
Therapy or peer groups can help address underlying patterns of isolation or disconnection.
B) Collectively / Locally
Strengthen public infrastructure
Advocates argue for investment in community spaces—libraries, parks, cultural hubs—to foster social bonds.
Cultivate social wellbeing at work
Companies can promote “co‑being” through shared breaks, social events, and mental health initiatives.
Teach emotional literacy in schools
SEL (social‑emotional learning) programs help young people build listening skills, empathy, and community.

Conclusion: framing a new social narrative
This moment is both tragic and a wake‑up call. We stand at a crossroads:

Will we sink further into isolation—or consciously rebuild meaningful community?
Individually, we need to reach out, prioritize authentic connection, and critique superficial self‑care trends.
At a societal level, we must insist on spaces and policies enabling genuine belonging.

Next steps?
What small step could you take today—maybe reach out to someone you haven’t spoken with in a while, or join a local group?
Does this feel like a call to act—personally, within your community, or in civic life?
Share your thoughts—dialogue is how we begin to dissolve emptiness and rediscover direction.

1lsesua,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lsesua/does_the_chantal_mia_electric_kettle_combine/,Does the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle Combine Style with Performance?,"Tested the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M over a few weeks in a busy kitchen, and there's no question it's an interesting little powerhouse. This electric kettle smoothly blends beauty with function, aimed at elevating the mundane task of boiling water to a near art form. Its distinctive design and excellent precision make it suitable for coffee enthusiasts like myself, but there are quirks that might bother some users. Let’s break it down.

**Attractive Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the first thing I noticed was the bold red finish. It's vibrant and easily becomes the centerpiece of any kitchen counter. The painted surface has a sleek and polished look, giving it a premium appearance. Since I often handle kitchen gadgets daily, it's worth mentioning how lightweight it is at just 2.1 pounds. Moving it around to refill water feels effortless. Its 9x9-inch dimensions fit nicely on smaller countertops without taking up unnecessary space.  

Beyond its look, the clever spout design caught my attention. The slow pour spout offers precision while brewing pour-over coffee, a favorite ritual in my household. It cools the boiling water slightly as it flows, hitting that ideal temp of around 205°F for coffee or tea. The all-stainless steel interior feels durable and easy to clean, not to mention the absence of plastic is a big win for those concerned about potential leaching.  

**Functional Performance in Everyday Use**  
The kettle doesn't just sit there looking pretty. Its dual functionality was a standout. Whether I’m carefully making a pour-over coffee or hastily boiling water for a quick tea, it fits the bill. With a 32-ounce capacity, the size feels perfect for smaller households or individual servings. Inside, volume measurements make it easy to fill the exact amount of water needed, cutting down on unnecessary boiling or wasted water.  

I appreciated the boil-dry protection feature. On more than one occasion, I’ve walked away absentmindedly, and this auto shut-off kicked in, preventing any accidents. This safety feature should bring peace of mind to anyone as forgetful as I can be during a busy morning rush.  

[Check Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M deals on Amazon now.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0cl5h9sr9/)

**Benefits**  
There’s a lot that won me over:  
- Unique slow pour spout ensures coffee-brewing precision.  
- Full stainless steel interior is durable and free of plastics.  
- Lightweight and compact for easy handling and storage.  
- Boil-dry protection and auto shut-off enhance safety.  

**Negatives**  
Like any other product, it’s not flawless. Some things stood out as potential hurdles:  
- It’s not the right fit for larger households needing higher water capacity.  
- While the painted finish looks gorgeous, it might scratch or chip over time with heavy use.  
- Cord storage could be improved for tidier countertops.  

**Competitors in the Market**  
Looking at similar products, the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle finds itself competing with the likes of the Fellow Stagg EKG and the Oxo Brew Gooseneck Kettle. Compared to the Oxo, this product takes the lead in aesthetics while offering a comparable pour-over experience but falls slightly behind in temperature control options. On the other hand, the Fellow Stagg EKG offers better precision with its adjustable thermostat, but it's notably more expensive. This kettle, in contrast, provides a more budget-conscious option with decent performance.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its robust stainless steel interior, precise spout design, and overall stylish appearance, this kettle offers remarkable value. It’s a well-built appliance at a competitive cost, especially for avid coffee drinkers who value accurate pour-over techniques.

I met a beautiful girl in Bangkok in April and instantly hit it off , the day after meeting I went for coffee date with her and everything is pretty good. That night I stayed with her and get to know her; where I’m told her work is “modeling” she has some stuff on instagram and big followers and a personal assistant ( ladyboy) so I kind of believed her , after that night she had a job in pattaya and we parted ways but with a strong urge to take this further .

2 weeks pass and we communicate back and forth , one time during that 2 weeks she tells  me she can’t use her phone for a few days as “she has work in a province area with bad signal” - I just believed her outright no doubts yet . A week later I come to suprise her in Bangkok, when I arrive to city she is not at the hotel the time is 9pm I get confused why she’s not there so I have to tell her and ruin the suprise , she tells me she’s at a work “meeting” and won’t be back till late I don’t know anything about modeling but now I’m confused like why so late meeting . Anyway the following week every single night she would have to get ready ; her personal assistant does her makeup hair and everything and go to work at 9pm and not come back till 11am next morning after a few days I got depressed and run down and confronted her then she changed her story that she is a party entertainer. As in rich exclusive parties she entertains guest etc etc . Okay maybe I’m naive but I didn’t suspect anything other red flags were constantly sending good amounts of money back to her home country via western union and eventually getting me to do transfers too (100-200 usd daily) very lavish lifestyle she loves designer clothes ; lv, Rolex etc and she buys stuff like expensive shampoo and just leaves it in the hotel after one use as in money means nothing to her .

Still I’m non the wiser to anything. The story takes a turn for the stranger side now , we had slept together once but never fully dpv as she told me she’s a virgin . The 2nd time the moment arises I ask her to let me in , so she proceeds ; not before going to the bathroom to use numbing cream. I ask about it and shrugged it off but somewhere during the night I realized she never once got naturally self lubricated , confused or horrified I asked her why does it not work? She was defensive and I asked are you trans where she lied to me and say no ; I tell her I won’t leave her and I’ll still love and accept her and she admits it (the whole time I never knew could never tell even feels looks everything normal I don’t like guys) . We continue dating from there but the week I mentioned I was very lonely and fed up of her absence at night  then she left In a hurry to another job abroad . I just continued to travel alone without realizing how low I’d become I started to smoke a lot of weed to cope which further disillusioned me .

On our last meet (final) things were different she apologized sincerely for the way things were last time said she felt stupid for putting work first and that she’ll take the next 3 days (until my flight back to Europe) off of work and just be with me .

She had also bought her mum to meet me which was both nerve wracking but really made me feel like family ; those days were beautiful honestly , she had mood swings sometimes but for the most part we dated , swam , cuddled ; and spent time with her mom things honestly felt perfect and on the last night I couldn’t sleep for a second and balled my eyes at the thought of being the other side of the world from her . She cried intensely too . We stayed in touch pretty much every day until last week where one morning she told me same story as before “job in Vietnam , exclusive party etc , no phone allowed” okay I thought but this time I went CRAZY stalked her and found 2 escort sites with her photos and number on there . I accused her of being an escort but unfortunately the “evidence I gave” was a guy with 12 followers on her recent follow list and he was only following sex workers I said this is proof ; very bad timing as it’s before her flight and she outright denied it saying show proof and she even messaged the guy to show me she doesn’t even know him .

Then during the time at her job I text a lot and try to communicate and I said how much it’s negatively affecting me she breaks down quits the job and calls me drunken late at night . I tell her I don’t want to speak like this and she tells me she lost $17k not doing the job and that she quit for “me” . Rocky territory , the next few days when she’s on way to Bangkok I cannot accept what I’m told “party entertainer , model” I asked many friends , family and even ChatGPT and they all recon she is a high end escort with a manager who connects her to high profile clients in countries like Thailand Vietnam Taiwan Singapore etc ; like a luxury escort circuit around Asia. Those 2 profiles I found where located in manilla her home city so it wasn’t proof enough but all the dots point to my conclusion; the money , the manager (most likely pimp) the secrecy , personal assistant, high end clients who don’t let you use your phone. I called her again this time saying to talk more details about the party entertaining in particular the Vietnam job questions such as : why no phone? what party could possibly be 24hours? What do you do in the 24hours ?. Any names or stories of people you talk to. She got angry with me said she doesn’t want to talk about it and is exposing this secret industry and we should talk tommorow. I hang up and 5 mins later call back and say if you can’t tell me these things we should break up so we broke up. 4 days have past and I quit thc and nicotine in the middle of this so my brain is vulnerable. I call her yesterday and basically said sorry ( I know crazy) she is very upset and angry with me saying she can’t believe I just discarded her like that I did ask her to see my pov and how I became that insecure and crazy ; she was just dismissive choosing more to focus on how I made her feel , how she couldn’t work these past days and how she doesn’t know if it’s good we get back together and she needs time to think. Today my weed brain is clearing and I’m realizing again my self worth I love this girl to bits and actually am heart broken if i can’t see her again we have many good memories we made each other laugh smile , feel safe just overall someone I really saw as potential to be my “ one and only” but I’m hurting still and still feel betrayed like if at the start she told me this before I probably wouldn’t have got involved and she would’ve knew that but still hid the details to “save my feelings” . Would I be an idiot to consider another go at things? Also considering she is now in Thailand and me back in England . I also have since signed upto escort agencies in England and will do that luxury work too as I’m young handsome guy and will feel guilt free about it now I’m single and given the circumstances (it’s also something I tried years ago briefly so not a noob) Also am I the asshole for how I handled things? Are am I completely justified to feel betrayed and go a bit crazy stalker mode lmao. Overall this has been a massive stressor to my life now and affects my ability to form trust in future relationships. I would consider a 2nd chance , only if she is willing to be more open and not hiding anymore secrets. Advice I have been given now after yesterday’s simpy phone call is to initiate no contact for 30 days . After that open the lines of communication again . Please help? Tell me the brutal honesty don’t sugar coat please .",1,1751735354.0,Advice,5,0.6,False

It makes me so uncomfortable and really triggers my eating disorder. I’m struggling right now and while she doesn’t know that explicitly, she does know that my work has been so busy I often only end up eating one meal a day. She also knows that I’ve repeatedly asked her not to comment on calories or my body. I’ve been brushing some of them off but today she asked if she could get me something from a coffee shop, I asked for a large brown sugar iced latte. As soon as she came in she starts commenting about how it was good but she could never drink that much because it’s well over 400 calories. I replied with no it isn’t and please stop saying things like that to me, you don’t need to constantly comment on calories. She got all upset and said well excuse me the board at the restaurant says it is. Now she’s mad and I just don’t understand why she can’t respect that I don’t appreciate those comments.

And this last time she literally snuck up behind me (I’d noticed her but there was a whole queue of people so decided to shop like normal). Anyway she laughs and says she didn’t mean to scare me and strikes up conversation and talk about how she rewatched to refresh her memory the movie we talked about and I decided fuck it let me ask her to hang out. She’s beautiful but I was asking her out as a friend because it’s more my speed to get to know someone first (I’m demisexual). So I asked her to coffee (I don’t even drink coffee 😭) she lights up and wastes no time goes to the cash register rips out a receipt and puts her number on it with a heart and says she was just about to ask me out as well. I got flustered to the point I started speaking English but we kept talking and even though she would look back at the register I’d be the one to point out to her when a customer was coming. She just seemed really into talking to me and I swear I sweated out adrenaline; I like assertive and bubbly women. Anyway I finally rush to the counter to pay and also make it easier to talk I ask if she’s free tomorrow and she said something along the lines of for me she’ll make time so I suggested 6 o’clock at this place but then when I said wait let me double check because everything closes early on Sunday she said good idea we don’t want to mess up our “date” or good idea our “date” needs to go well. Buuuut I’m scared I misheard her, like the adrenaline was messing me up or my autism made me misread the situation, like she wouldn’t let me pay for my shopping bag either (😝) but like that could be a friend thing too right? I also need to ask her age, I know she’s an adult but I didn’t ask when I first asked her out, because again I was doing it as a friend thing 😅 sorry for rambling I’m just so excited!

Is this bad?,"I’m 33 and I’ve been single for two years and actively looking for, ideally, my life partner. I’m finding it terribly hard to meet people out and about, so I’ve mostly relied on the apps. Problem is, most of these guys are just not my type (opposite interests and values, unattractive to me, etc). If a guy that I find interesting matches with me, we talk and it fizzles out, or we go on a date or two and I end up getting rejected. Dating is tough! Especially as an autistic woman.

Anyways, a month ago I matched with a highly compatible guy. Let’s call him Ted. We were talking and the conversation just flowed. We met up for coffee, and the chemistry was there. It was then that Ted told me that he’s honestly not sure what he’s looking for at this time, and wanted to be clear on what he could offer. He just left his longtime partner due to her not wanting kids and wanting to move to a different country. I knew then that Ted was emotionally unavailable and not looking for a relationship. Bummer.

I knew anything more with Ted at this time would be casual, and after thinking about it I said what the heck, why not. Yes I’m looking for a serious relationship, but in the meanwhile, why not make a friend? So he invited me over to watch a movie. That led to us hooking up, and it was great! Since then, we’ve been texting and meeting up. Honestly it’s been so nice to feel a connection with someone, to have someone to text and talk to. Someone to watch movies with, have dinner with. Someone to be intimate with. I’ve been craving that intimacy that comes with having a romantic partner, and this is sort of filling that void.

Here’s the thing. I haven’t done a situationship in ten years, I’ve been in relationships otherwise, and those situationships in my early 20s were more about confused intentions than intentional fun. I feel weird about so wholeheartedly pursuing him and our time together, knowing that it’s “nothing serious” and this will have an expiration date. TBH I do like him and if he decided to seriously date I’d date him in a heartbeat. BUT, I acknowledge and accept that this isn’t what he wants, and I have to be ok with that if I want to keep seeing him. I’m still actively trying to match with people and make other connections, serious ones, but I haven’t found anyone I’m compatible with. If I met a guy out in the wild or on the apps, I’d prioritize our meeting over the situationship, and I’d even tell Ted if he wanted to know why I can’t come over. If our relationship got more serious, I’d end it with Ted, of course. But in the meanwhile…I’m enjoying this? Our fake little relationship? 

I know situationships leave people burned, and esp as an autistic woman this could be dangerous territory. But my thoughts are that this will be no worse than an actual relationship ending, when it ends. If I end things, it’ll be because I found something serious, and I will be fine. I’ll be happy! If he ends it, it’ll be no worse than the rejection and breakups I’ve been through before. We’re not committed, and that’s ok. It’s ok to enjoy this connection for what it is, right? Or am I traumatizing myself big time with this being my mindset? ",7,1751734873.0,AutismInWomen,15,1.0,False

Anyways, a little about me: 33, I live in 2 places in the United States. I work on Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. I work in 2 places; I’m busy and very intense. I don’t have lots of time for nonsense, but I consider myself a fair and kind person.

Here's a bit about myself: I genuinely seek the positive in people, yet I also rely on my intuition. While I have a solid circle of friends, most are married with children, which makes it difficult for us to spend time together. I fully respect their commitments, but it feels like our life paths are diverging right now. Therefore, I'm not looking to connect with married friends at this time; I’m open to friendships with those who are divorced, but I want to steer clear of any drama involving ex-partners—life's too short for that. 

As for me, I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States. My work spans both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones, and I juggle responsibilities at two different jobs. I'm busy and focused, leaving little room for nonsense.

As a passionate reader and a devoted audiobooks enthusiast, I find immense joy in immersing myself in stories, especially while traveling. Listening to books is a practical way for me to indulge in literature, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often crank up the speed to double time, so if you're up for a discussion about books, I’d absolutely love that. Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; though it was a poignant read, it left a lasting impression on my heart and shifted my perspective on significant topics. That's the beauty of books for me!

Music truly means a lot to me. Right now, I'm putting together a dinner playlist that is coming together beautifully, featuring artists such as Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I actually have a 20-hour playlist that includes a wide variety of genres. I recently stumbled upon the band “The Scarlet Opera,” and I'm really enjoying their sound. I have Apple Music, so if you're interested in checking out my playlists, that would be great!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There's something truly enchanting about dressing up to enjoy these remarkable performances. However, I'm equally fond of TV and movies. While getting dressed for an night on a town  is enjoyable, I also cherish the comfort of donning sweatpants and a concert t-shirt while staying in.

I have a passion for dining out and discovering new restaurants. Although I enjoy cooking at home, I've recently found myself in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner venues with friends is my main focus. I’m a huge fan of iced coffee and love to share ample amounts of champagne with great company! Brunch, lunch, and food in general are all favorites of mine!



I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!   
Here are a  fun fact about me :During my college summers, I spent time working in Florida, where I had a job that involved a certain famous mouse. Any guesses on what I did?

I just finished watching the first episode of The Pitt and absolutely loved it! However, I'm watching it with my mom, and she texted me saying she can only handle one episode a night. Ugh!

I'm searching for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who resides in the United States and has a preference for voting blue, just like I do. I’m not particularly interested in sports or video games, so if those are your main sources of entertainment, we may not be a good fit. Additionally, I'm not a fan of hiking or camping, so please keep that in mind!

Ever feel like you're just throwing darts at a dartboard when it comes to your health? You're eating ""healthy,"" trying to get enough sleep, maybe even hitting the gym, but still feel like something's just-off. Maybe you're tired, foggy-brained, or just not performing at your peak. It's frustrating, right? We've all been there, trying every new supplement or diet trend, hoping it's *the* answer.

But here's the thing: your body isn't a generic template. What works wonders for your friend might not do a thing for you, or worse, could even make things worse. This is where advanced diagnostics come into play, literally decoding your unique biology. Precision biohacking isn't about guesswork; it's about getting the actual data to build a roadmap just for *you*. Ready to stop guessing and start knowing? Let's dive in.

## Why Guess When You Can Know? The Power of Precision

Think about it: you wouldn't try to fix a complex engine without looking under the hood, would you? Your body is infinitely more complex than any engine. Traditional annual check-ups are great for catching major red flags, but they often miss the subtle imbalances that keep you from feeling truly amazing.

Precision biohacking, powered by advanced diagnostics, is like getting a detailed, personalized blueprint of your internal landscape. It helps us understand:

* **What's actually going on:** Are your hormones out of whack? Are you deficient in key nutrients? Is your gut microbiome thriving or struggling?
* **Why you feel the way you do:** That persistent fatigue? It might be a specific nutrient deficiency, not just ""stress.""
* **What interventions will actually work:** Instead of trying every supplement on the shelf, you can target exactly what your body needs.
* **How your body responds:** You can track progress and adjust your biohacks based on real data, not just how you feel (though feelings are important too!).

In my experience, moving from generalized advice to targeted, data-driven strategies has been a game-changer for so many people. It's empowering to know exactly what to focus on.

## Beyond the Basics: What Advanced Diagnostics Look Like

So, what kind of advanced diagnostics are we talking about? We're going way beyond your standard cholesterol and glucose numbers here. These tests offer a much deeper look.

### Your Blood, Your Story: Comprehensive Panels

While a basic blood test is a starting point, comprehensive panels give us a treasure trove of information. We're talking about markers that reveal so much more:

* **Inflammatory Markers:** Things like **hs-CRP** (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and **homocysteine** can show systemic inflammation, which is a root cause of many chronic issues.
* **Hormone Panels:** Beyond just thyroid, we're looking at **cortisol rhythm**, **sex hormones** (estrogen, testosterone, progesterone), and their metabolites. These impact everything from energy and mood to sleep and body composition.
* **Micronutrient Levels:** Are you actually absorbing enough **Vitamin D**, **B vitamins**, **magnesium**, or **zinc**? Deficiencies in these can dramatically impact energy, mood, and immune function.
* **Heavy Metals & Toxins:** Environmental exposures can build up. Testing for heavy metals can reveal hidden burdens impacting your health.

### The Genetic Map: Unlocking Your DNA's Secrets

This one's actually pretty cool. Your DNA isn't your destiny, but it's certainly your predisposition. Genetic tests - often called **nutrigenomics** or **pharmacogenomics** - can offer insights into:

* **Nutrient Metabolism:** How well do you process certain vitamins (like folate or B12)? Do you have a genetic predisposition to struggle with caffeine or certain fats?
* **Detox Pathways:** How efficiently does your body clear toxins? This can inform your dietary choices and supplement strategy.
* **Exercise Response:** Are you genetically wired for endurance or power? This might influence your optimal workout routine.

It's about understanding your body's unique genetic quirks so you can work *with* them, not against them.

### Gut Instincts: Peeking into Your Microbiome

Your gut is often called your ""second brain"" - and for good reason. The balance of bacteria in your gut (your microbiome) affects digestion, mood, immunity, and even weight. Advanced stool tests can identify:

* **Bacterial Imbalances:** Do you have an overgrowth of harmful bacteria or a lack of beneficial ones?
* **Digestion & Absorption Markers:** Are you breaking down food properly?
* **Inflammation in the Gut:** Are there signs of irritation or leaky gut?

Knowing this allows you to target specific probiotic strains, prebiotics, or dietary changes to truly support your gut health.

### Continuous Insight: Wearables and Real-Time Data

While not traditional lab diagnostics, modern wearables like continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) or advanced sleep trackers integrate beautifully with your lab data. They provide:

* **Real-Time Glucose Response:** See how different foods, stress, or sleep affect your blood sugar throughout the day. This is incredibly powerful for optimizing energy and metabolic health.
* **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** A key indicator of your nervous system's balance. Low HRV often signals stress or overtraining, guiding your recovery and stress management strategies.
* **Sleep Architecture:** Beyond just how long you sleep, these devices can show your deep and REM sleep cycles, helping you optimize your sleep environment and routine.

When you combine this real-time feedback with your comprehensive lab results, you get a truly holistic picture.

## From Data to Action: How to Leverage Your Insights

Okay, so you've got all this data. Now what? This is where the ""precision"" in precision biohacking really shines.

### Pinpointing Imbalances

Your test results aren't just numbers; they're clues. A high inflammatory marker combined with low Vitamin D might point to a specific need for immune support and sun exposure. A less-than-optimal gut microbiome profile could explain persistent bloating or brain fog. It's like being a detective for your own health.

### Crafting Your Personalized Protocol

This is where the magic happens. Instead of a generic diet plan or a random multivitamin, your biohacking protocol becomes highly personalized:

* **Targeted Nutrition:** If your genetic test shows you struggle with caffeine metabolism, you might dial back on coffee. If you're low in magnesium, you'll focus on magnesium-rich foods or a specific supplement.
* **Specific Supplementation:** No more guessing games. You're taking exactly what your body needs, in the right forms and dosages.
* **Tailored Lifestyle Changes:** Perhaps your HRV is consistently low, indicating chronic stress. Your plan might include more meditation, cold exposure, or specific breathing exercises.
* **Optimized Exercise:** If your hormones are off, maybe it's time to adjust your high-intensity workouts to something more restorative for a while.

### Tracking Progress and Optimizing

The beauty of this approach is that it's dynamic. You don't just test once and forget it. After implementing your personalized protocol for a few months, you can re-test key markers. This allows you to:

* **See what's working:** Are your nutrient levels improving? Is inflammation going down?
* **Fine-tune your strategy:** Maybe one supplement isn't moving the needle enough, or a dietary change needs adjusting.
* **Stay proactive:** Catch potential issues before they become major problems.

It's a continuous loop of testing, implementing, and optimizing - a true partnership with your own biology.

## A Word of Wisdom: Navigating the Diagnostic Journey

Getting advanced diagnostics can seem overwhelming, and honestly, it can be. Here are a few things I've learned that can help:

* **Don't go it alone:** While fascinating, interpreting these results can be complex. Consider working with a qualified functional medicine doctor, naturopath, or a biohacking coach who specializes in data interpretation. They can help you understand the nuances and create a safe, effective plan.
* **Start small, then expand:** You don't need to do every test under the sun at once. Pick a few key areas that resonate with your current symptoms or goals.
* **Data is a guide, not the gospel:** Your labs are snapshots. Always combine the data with how you feel, your lifestyle, and your individual responses. Sometimes, ""optimal"" on paper doesn't translate to feeling optimal, and that's okay. Your subjective experience matters.

## Your Body's Blueprint Awaits

Decoding your biology with advanced diagnostics is one of the most powerful steps you can take on your biohacking journey. It transforms health from a guessing game into a precise, personalized science. You're not just hoping for better health; you're building it, brick by data-driven brick.

Therefore, I'm not looking to connect with married friends at this time; I’m open to friendships with those who are divorced, but I want to steer clear of any drama involving ex-partners—life's too short for that. 

As for me, I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States. My work spans both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones, and I juggle responsibilities at two different jobs. I'm busy and focused, leaving little room for nonsense.

As a passionate reader and a devoted audiobooks enthusiast, I find immense joy in immersing myself in stories, especially while traveling. Listening to books is a practical way for me to indulge in literature, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often crank up the speed to double time, so if you're up for a discussion about books, I’d absolutely love that. Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; though it was a poignant read, it left a lasting impression on my heart and shifted my perspective on significant topics. That's the beauty of books for me!

Music truly means a lot to me. Right now, I'm putting together a dinner playlist that is coming together beautifully, featuring artists such as Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I actually have a 20-hour playlist that includes a wide variety of genres. I recently stumbled upon the band “The Scarlet Opera,” and I'm really enjoying their sound. I have Apple Music, so if you're interested in checking out my playlists, that would be great!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There's something truly enchanting about dressing up to enjoy these remarkable performances. However, I'm equally fond of TV and movies. While getting dressed for an night on a town  is enjoyable, I also cherish the comfort of donning sweatpants and a concert t-shirt while staying in.

I have a passion for dining out and discovering new restaurants. Although I enjoy cooking at home, I've recently found myself in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner venues with friends is my main focus. I’m a huge fan of iced coffee and love to share ample amounts of champagne with great company! Brunch, lunch, and food in general are all favorites of mine!



I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!   
Here are a  fun fact about me :During my college summers, I spent time working in Florida, where I had a job that involved a certain famous mouse. Any guesses on what I did?

I just finished watching the first episode of The Pitt and absolutely loved it! However, I'm watching it with my mom, and she texted me saying she can only handle one episode a night. Ugh!

I'm searching for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who resides in the United States and has a preference for voting blue, just like I do. I’m not particularly interested in sports or video games, so if those are your main sources of entertainment, we may not be a good fit. Additionally, I'm not a fan of hiking or camping, so please keep that in mind!

1lsejg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1lsejg3/recovery_frustration/,Recovery Frustration,"there are periods when I’ve felt fine enough to eat oats for breakfast the next day, then my body switches up on me again. I might eat proper meals for several days on straight and feel fine, then one dinner, just one meal, seems to throw everything off. for example, a vegetarian soup. then i feel weird, off, and out of it for a while until I’ve consistently eaten proper meals for several days straight. then at some point, I do something physically demanding like carrying a bunch of heavy grocery bags and walking back home, then it takes me back to square one.

 to deal with that, I’ve bought protein-rich snacks like yogurt and mozzarella sticks and am hoping itll help. for the last few days, I’ve been eating a bit differently from the most recent meal plan I’ve set up for myself. I also went for a long walk, which was offset by half a cheesesteak. I could tell something was off though because I was craving ice cream after but, for some reason, couldn’t bring myself to order it. I got water ice instead, which gave me a sudden burst of energy, but I woke up so exhausted the next day. 

yesterday for the holiday I already felt odd after breakfast, then snacked the reset of the day because I couldn’t bring myself to prepare a proper meal. I was so out of it by dinnertime, which was spent with family. I had two slices of pizza, a few pieces of sushi, and later, a slice of cake. I would probably be even more out of it if i hadnt eaten an open faced half bagel sandwich this morning. I’m afraid to drink coffee  due to GERD and had such a headache after reading just one chapter of a book earlier. that is one of the biggest signs— when I can’t focus on reading. I hate it. it’s the most awful feeling and feels like a core part of me has been torn out. 

I know I just have to be patient and keep eating, and I’ll feel fine again eventually, but in the meantime, it’s frustrating, and this whole recovery process makes me feel so impatient. I’ve tried to speed it up by loading up on protein shakes, but learned the hard way that too much and too fast at a time can turn out very unwell and unnatural.",1,1751734767.0,EatingDisorders,0,1.0,False

My manager reacted disproportionately when I scheduled a professional coffee chat with a colleague. I challenged his unprofessionalism and the missing offer letter, then resigned. He subsequently ignored my salary requests.

Hey Reddit, I'm looking for some objective opinions on a recent situation. I started an internship at a US based company in May, genuinely excited to contribute and make a strong impression. 

I've consistently dedicated myself, putting in 100% effort daily and sending over 250 emails to keep things moving. (Biz dev)

However, a significant issue arose from the start: my initial offer letter lacked the details we had agreed on when the manager hired me and the COO's signature, and my manager, informed me he'll make a new one the very next day and that it would stand invalid.

Then, I connected with Jemma, a Product Manager at the company, whom I'd found on LinkedIn much earlier. 
Given her MBA from an Ivy college and my aspirations for graduate studies in the US, I sent her a professional Slack message requesting a brief coffee chat for insights. 

This is a common networking practice, and we successfully scheduled a time.
One morning (8 AM, India time), I was on an important call with a university admissions committee in the Europe.

My manager repeatedly called my phone. I messaged him, explaining I was on a call and would be free in five minutes. 

He continued to call persistently. When I called him back shortly after, his immediate question was, ""Care to explain why you have a meeting scheduled with Jemma?""

I calmly explained my professional intent: ""I sent her a LinkedIn invite some time ago, and I reached out on Slack to get insights about MBA for my US plans.""

His reaction was intense. ""Did you ask me? You cannot schedule meetings without me knowing! If you need to talk to her, tell me, I'll see a time she's available and set up a meeting with her!"" 

This was despite Jemma and I having already agreed on a time, and he then instructed me to cancel my existing meeting so he could arrange it himself. 

He also criticized me for using my personal email, a genuine oversight due to both accounts sharing the same profile picture on my device.

I responded, ""Okay, I'll run it by you next time.""
His anger didn't subside. ""You will run it by me?! You HAVE to run it by me!"" He then stated, ""Bro, I don't think you're getting it. You cannot be unprofessional.""

At this point, I felt compelled to address the broader context. Maintaining my composure, I stated, 
""Not at all. And to be fair, I'm currently on a call with a foreign college ad com that I've had on hold because of your constant buzzing. We could have had this conversation in 10 minutes."" 

I then highlighted his own lack of professionalism: 
""And speaking of professionalism, you haven't even given me a revised offer letter yet.""

He attempted to deflect, asking, ""Oh, wait, wait, what do you mean revised offer letter?"" I reiterated that we had discussed revisions to the initial offer, and he had promised a new one that was never sent, despite my having signed the previous, unrevised version. 

He then tried to turn it back on me: ""So you get to be unprofessional just 'cause you don't have the revised offer letter?""
And I was like: ""Here you go again deflecting my point, professonalism isn't conditional""
And ended the call

Feeling that the environment was untenable, I sent an email to both my manager and the COO. In it, I detailed the morning's unacceptable interaction, reiterated my professional intent with a colleague, and highlighted the ongoing issue of the missing formal offer letter. 

I presented conditions for my continued employment (a proper, signed offer letter, clear communication protocols, and a fostering work environment) or stated that the email should be considered my immediate resignation.

I subsequently resigned. 
The next day I had my daily huddle, and he goes like ""Okay let's go over the emails""

Tf?
I was like: No, I'm sure you might have gotten my email, if the terms aren't met I don't think I'll be continuing with the company and I'll send you an invoice for my services""

He was like: sure send it over to my email

I then sent an invoice for my first two weeks' salary.

My manager replied, acknowledging the reminder and stating the payment was ""processing,"" but provided no expected date. 

After 7 days of no payment and no response to my follow-up emails or WhatsApp messages, 

I escalated the matter to the COO. The COO eventually provided the billing email and assured me payment would be made by next Tuesday.

AITHA?

Edit: Got the payment after following up 7 times with the COO.

They would be sent to my address (we live together) and I will give them to her on her birthday. A little about her and why I’m making this request:
She works in the public school system with the special education department, helping high school students with disabilities learn social pragmatic skills and trying to close their educational gap. She spends many hours outside of her work day researching/ planning for every single one of her students, who all learn differently. She’s taught many of her students (and some not her own) how to read and write with confidence, when they slipped through the cracks way before high school. She teaches her kids how to write resumes for jobs they didn’t think would be possible for them after graduation. She’s inspired some of her students to apply for (and get into!) college, when they didn’t think they could because of their disabilities by providing resources that they and their families otherwise wouldn’t have knowledge of. She does so much and I’m always inspired by how much she cares about the minority population in my community. Under the current administration, she is often putting her job on the line by refusing to accept the injustices that are constant for minority students, often speaking out and advocating for every student even when the district wants to sweep things under the rug. With all of the work she does, she seldom gets any kind of recognition (as tends to be the case with public school employees). She also is just generally a kind, fierce human being who loves life and cares a lot about everyone. I’d love for her to have some tangible way of being celebrated. SO if you’d like to send her a card, I’ll be sure to post thank yous, as well as send a card in return if you would like one. 🥰
Things I know she likes (though of course she’ll like anything and will just be excited to receive mail):
- anything handmade! It can be any skill level - it could be the doodle of a 3 year old and she will cherish it
- favorite color is lavender or any kind of purple
- 90s aesthetic and stuff (Goosebumps, Lisa Frank, Scooby Doo, Courage the Cowardly Dog are her favorite things to collect)
- Halloween/spooky stuff all year round: Ghosts, fairies, cryptids, folklore, local legends etc. if you have a personal ghost story she loves hearing individual stories!
- Any animal but she loves dogs, bearded dragons, and giraffes. She also loves the cheap silly animal pun cards
- She’s learning to play the fiddle so you’re welcome to share anything to do with the violin/fiddle, folk tunes, music in general 
- Tea, coffee, boba; she loves vegetarian food recipes, as well as general food imagery like pastries, desserts, fruits etc.
- She’s turning 34 and isn’t very excited about it - if you’d like to share some positive words about getting older I’m sure she’d appreciate it!

Thanks for reading and considering!
Please send me a chat if you’d like my info or anything else you have a question about! 🥰

1lsehsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1lsehsa/thoughts_on_the_decline_of_marriage_vocations/,Thoughts on the decline of marriage vocations among young people,"It’s with some sadness that I realize that there are much fewer catholic marriages than there used to be. There are even fewer marriages at all, in any denomination and the ones that do often choose not to have children.

I get that marriage shoudpnt be rushed and you have to be careful about marrying the wrong person. But surely even a “ so so” marriage with kids with a focus on raising them in the faith or at least with morals is better than the current state:

The huge majority of unmarried late 20 to 30 something’s are not living holy lives of chastity or celibacy. They are having one off flings, with little idea of commitment, often consume porn and instead of having children will have a little dog/cat/ ferret/ iguana and treat thay as their child. Plenty of Facebook and instagram posts of the “ the little prince’s biethday” or “ baby’s day out” complete with the iguana or ferret in the stroller, at the coffee shop etc. 

One thing to keep in mind though, one silver lining is that while there are fewer marriages among the young there are fewer really terrible or dysufnional marriages that weren’t that uncommon decades ago.

I don’t mean abusive ones ) though those were sadly common) I mean jsut really unhealthy unwholesome and dysfunctional ones that lasted for years and didn’t end well.

I just got finished watching a few episodes an old tv show “ Homicide Life on the street” made by David Simon, the man who made the wire. It’s about homicide detectives in Baltimore Maryland in the 90s. Flaws aside it’s a very Catholic show and we’ll worth watching.

One detective is played by Daniel Baldwin, brother of the more famous Alec. He plays a detective who is a good person ( kind of) great detective but absolutely terrible husband and father.

He and his emotionally unstable wife got married either straight out of or not that long after high school, and they have two little kids ( a boy and girl) and a baby girl as well. They fight a lot and he refused to take his wife’s calls having his older partner ( played by Melissa Leo) take them instead and have her almost be he and his wife’s mother/ psychologist figure in an era ) 1993-1995) when therapy was very much out of reach for most of the country.

He is neglectful and mean to her and cheats on her a number of times. She throws him out of the house, cuts up his favorite jacket and changed the locks. His partner does a ton to try and reconcile them and then he falls for his female shift commander, pursuing an affair. Right when his wife calls him to come back and agrees to take him back ( dressed in her best, having baked a cherry pie his favorite) he informs her he had a “ great thing going on” with his shift commander and says she and the kids will have to wait a bit while he explores it. She cries and throws the pie away after he leaves.

As disgusting and in poor taste as this man and character is, it’s worth noting there arnet a ton of crummy marriages like that anymore. Men and women like them typically don’t get married out of high school and women have more economic options that makes it so they don’t “ have to.”

People like them often don’t get married at all or break away very eerily well before having 3 kids 

Also not long before 1993 people like the wife didn’t have many choices. Divorce was hard and the advise they’d get would mainly be “ pray for him and the kids and hope it gets better.”

Am I right in thinking this? With the decline of marriage are there many fewer bad marriages? Is the sort of bummy/ scummy gross version of Homer Simpson/ Fred flint stone as a husband/ father sort of a thing of the past? Can pop culture be a helpful way of looking at societal trends?

A Letter in Which a Cactus Appears

I have no strength left—I swear not to write, yet I check my inbox again. I’m waiting. Sometimes I reread your letters, searching for ambiguity. I’m angry at myself for being so weak and indecisive. And I can’t get your shirt out of my head. The one with the wave pattern. It's all swaying around. So much agitation. In everything. Like intoxication.  

I pour coffee, open a book, but on every damned page, the same letters refuse to form words. Words would be too simple—these letters are trying to convey something greater—a name.  

I envy your students—an hour and a half near you, then even asking questions. That’s so much for ordinary people. What are you doing now? Who are you looking at? What kind of strap is on your wrist?  

Before you were gone, I got a cactus. It doesn’t need my love. Just a little water. Very little. Very rarely. But what did you need?  

The Third Letter, in Which a Name is Spoken

I finally managed to cry. My throat doesn’t hurt anymore. Nothing that ever mattered in my body hurts. It feels like I’ll vomit in about twenty-five minutes. Maybe twenty-three—I don’t like precision. Your letter is so rational. You know me the way only a mother knows her child.  

You love order. You knew what to say. But my certainty was different: Rome was better than the truth. Remember when we left for that apartment of ours? Remember how you sat there, twisting your Rubik’s Cube in the living room? It irritated me, but you didn’t notice. Jealousy of an object in your hands, jealousy of the squeaking—because it kept me from hearing your breath. So much time has passed, and I still can’t speak the truth aloud.  

The chill in my stomach has turned to shivering. And I don’t know what to drink to warm up. Manfred, I’m disgusted with myself, I hate the world without you. I keep staring out the window. One hand holds the blinds, the other reaches for you, but it can’t stay suspended anymore. It has no support. It’s drained of blood. Because you’re not here, Manfred.  

I step out to smoke on the balcony, barefoot, my lungs tired of smoke. Someone once said that some people smoke to let nicotine into their blood, others just to hide. I smoke out of stubbornness—I need to know my limits. Or maybe I just need the Rubik’s Cube to squeak… or for this damn shivering to stop.  

Another Letter, in Which Love is Spoken (Unsent)

Manfred. Man-Fred. A cursed name. It echoes in my head without end. Absurd. Like a pulse. Like a glitch in the autonomic system: instead of “fight or flight”, only “repeat and never be again”...  

There’s still so much memory left—I live by it. I remember our hands. Interlocked, carved from stone, veined. Trembling, trying to merge into one another.  

Manfred, Manfred, my damned failure and greatest triumph. I knew about the breakup before we even met. Pattern upon pattern. A stolen phrase—like everything about us. Forgive me, I know how you despise unoriginality. It drains. Just like our… our relationship. Stolen meanings need external energy—they can’t sustain themselves.  

I remember that apartment of ours, with its long hallway and marble floors. Lazzaro’s reproductions on the walls. You stood there, bewildered, and didn’t see me. Tried not to see. But you heard. My words—hypostasized venom, concentrated in every letter. God, I’m a monster. And you just stood there.  

""You don’t love me.""  
""What is love? We never had it. Love is for people—we are souls. Bodies are nothing, space doesn’t matter, time doesn’t exist. There’s only the void that two people filled, endlessly expanding, turning into strings and rings, exploding and collapsing into an ultra-dense lump.""

And in the end? Now I sit on the windowsill, smoke, and count every exhale without you. Now there’s time, because something has started to change. And whatever changes—dies.  

The Letter That Became the Last

I just don’t believe in love anymore—you reply during work hours. How ordinary…

While traditionally dependent on refined sugar production, countries like Mexico and Colombia are discovering the untapped potential of an ancestral product that could revolutionize their participation in international wellness markets: powdered panela.

The Current Landscape of Latin America's Sugar Cane Sector.

Latin America concentrates approximately 60% of global sugar cane production, with Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia being the region's main producers. However, sugar price volatility in international markets and growing concerns about refined sugar consumption have forced these countries to seek more sustainable and profitable alternatives.

Mexico: A Giant with Untapped Potential.

Mexico, with over 800,000 hectares dedicated to sugar cane cultivation, annually produces nearly 60 million tons of cane. The Mexican sugar industry directly employs more than 450,000 people and sustains the economy of 15 states across the country. However, Mexican producers face constant challenges with price fluctuations and international competition.

The opportunity lies in Mexico's sugar cane varieties with high sucrose and mineral content, ideal for panela production. States like Veracruz, Jalisco, and San Luis Potosí have perfect climatic conditions to diversify into this higher value-added product.

Colombia: Tradition Meets Modernization.

Colombia presents an even more promising scenario. With annual production of approximately 35 million tons of sugar cane, the country already has a centuries-old tradition in panela production, especially in departments like Cundinamarca, Boyacá, and Santander. Colombia currently produces around 1.4 million tons of panela annually, positioning itself as the world's second-largest producer after India.

Colombia's competitive advantage lies in its mastery of artisanal production techniques and its network of over 70,000 small-scale panela producers. The challenge now is modernizing these processes to obtain export-quality powdered panela.

Powdered Panela: The Sweet Gold of the Future.

Powdered panela represents a natural evolution of traditional panela, adapted to meet international market demands. This product retains all the nutritional benefits of block panela while offering the practicality and presentation that modern consumers demand.

Nutritional Advantages Over Refined Sugar.

Powdered panela maintains its complete nutritional profile, unlike refined sugar which loses virtually all its nutrients during the refining process:

Essential minerals: Iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus
B-complex vitamins: Especially B1, B2, B3, and B6
Natural antioxidants: Phenolic compounds that combat oxidative stress
Moderate glycemic index: Between 65-70, compared to refined sugar's 100

Market Opportunity in the 🇺🇸United States and Europe🇬🇧

United States: The Wellness Boom
The US wellness market reached $450 billion in 2023, with annual growth of 12%. American consumers are willing to pay 30% to 50% more for natural and less processed products.

Powdered panela positions perfectly in this market as:

-Natural substitute for refined sugar
-Ingredient for healthy baking products
-Sweetener for functional beverages
-Component for nutritional supplements

Europe: Favorable Regulations and Growing Demand.

The European Union has implemented increasingly strict regulations on added sugar labeling, driving demand for natural alternatives. Countries like Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands show 15% annual growth in demand for natural sweeteners.

Powdered panela meets European organic certifications and can be marketed under fair trade labels, adding premium value to the product.",1,1751734342.0,healthyfoodUSA,0,1.0,False
1lsebxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1lsebxp/tetrislevel_packing_how_i_fit_3_months_across_4/,🧳✈️ Tetris-Level Packing: How I Fit 3 Months Across 4 Continents into One Carry-On (My Hostel Mates Called Me Crazy),"From the moment I landed in my first hostel, I quickly realized that fitting three months of adventures across four continents into a single carry-on bag was not only a personal goal but an exhilarating challenge. My hostel mates raised their eyebrows, chuckled, and even called me crazy when I confidently proclaimed that I could live out of one little bag. But let me tell you, mastering Tetris-level packing isn’t just about fitting everything in; it’s about making the most of your travel experience! 🎒✈️ 

### The Ultimate Carry-On Strategy

**Understand Your Essentials**  
First things first, knowing what to include in your carry-on is crucial. **Think clothes, toiletries, and technology.** That’s it! I curated a capsule wardrobe with mix-and-match items that could tackle all four climate zones: from the tropics of Southeast Asia to the chilly peaks of the Andes. Pick lightweight and quick-drying fabrics, and remember: you can always do laundry!

**Pack Versatile Pieces**  
Consider multi-functional items. For instance, I packed a sarong that doubled as a blanket, beach cover-up, and even a makeshift towel. Pair that with a light jacket that transitions from day to night, and you’re golden! 🧣👗  

**Use Packing Cubes**  
These little wonders will change your travel game. They help to compartmentalize your belongings, keeping everything organized and accessible. I color-coded mine: one for clothes, one for tech, and another for toiletries. This way, I could easily locate whatever I needed without tearing apart my bag.  

### Roll, Don’t Fold

If you haven't already discovered this packing hack, get ready to be amazed! Rolling your clothes saves space while reducing wrinkles. I could fit a week’s worth of clothing into just two packing cubes by rolling them! The space savings were unreal, and I felt like a packing wizard. 🎩✨

### The Tech Dilemma

In the digital age, staying connected is vital, especially for a blogger on the move. I opted for a lightweight laptop and a versatile power bank, which provided enough charge for all my devices. Don't forget your travel adapter—it's your passport to a fully powered life!

### The Local Vibe

As I transitioned between countries, immersing myself in local cultures was a top priority. I made it a point to leave behind a bit of space in my carry-on for souvenirs—like handwoven scarves in Morocco or coffee beans from Colombia. My packing intensity allowed me to embrace spontaneity and gather tangible memories from each destination. 🌍🎁

### Embrace the Journey

Lastly, remind yourself that packing minimal is also about freeing your mind. You’ll enjoy your travels more when you’re not lugging around unnecessary baggage. Less stuff means more adventures, more meaningful experiences, and ultimately, a happier heart. ❤️

So, fellow travelers, what packing hacks have you mastered? Are you a minimalist or do you prefer to bring your whole closet along? Share your experiences and let's swap tips.

1lse6dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/truesnydercut/comments/1lse6dz/a_loser_on_reddit_overanalyzes_the_snyderverse/,"A Loser on Reddit Overanalyzes the Snyderverse: Justice League Part Five ""All the King's Horses""","Welcome one and all to the penultimate episode of season three of r/truesnydercut’s favorite (and only) show: “A Loser on Reddit Overanalyzes the Snyderverse.” Today we get right off to a strong start by immediately learning that digging up Superman’s grave was an item on Barry’s bucket list. Weirdo. Side note, I had to turn off all lights in my room and block out my windows to be able to even vaguely make out what was happening on my laptop screen during this scene, and even then I could still barely tell. 

Barry and Vic then have a chat about Wonder Woman where Barry sounds exactly like teenage me watching the DCEU movies for the first time with a fat crush on Gal Gadot. Random trivia about me: In high school I once ranted to a platonic female friend of mine about how attractive I found Gal Gadot while we watched Batman v Superman together. That female friend and I are now dating. That moment still haunts me.

Bruce then has a conversation with Alfred where he talks about acting on faith and is shockingly not paranoid. It's a small throwaway moment but I appreciate it a lot for how much it shows Bruce’s character development from the first time we saw him. The gang then gets ready for Superman’s “welcome back to life” party and Diana tells Vic he should get dressed, to which Vic responds “that’s my secret captain. I’m always dressed.” Or something like that. The squad strolls into S.T.A.R. Labs where Silas and Vic have a nice moment without a word. It’s a very cool little scene.

We then cut back to Lois, and you all know what that means. Say it with me now, it's time for some more Lois Sadness™ (patent still pending). Jokes aside though, it is kind of frustrating to me that she’s been given literally nothing to do in this movie so far but sit there with a sad expression while slow piano music plays. Especially since she’s one of the main characters of both of the previous movies, and then here it feels like she has nothing to do and is just there because it wouldn’t make sense if she wasn’t. On an unrelated note, is that a pregnancy test? Oh no, I’m getting Arkham City flashbacks. Also flashbacks to that one time Snyder mentioned that he originally wanted Bruce and Lois to hook up and then she’d give birth to Damian or something. Thank heaven he decided against that.

Anyway, the league lowers Superman’s body down and then we briefly cut back to Lois again, this time getting some coffee. I don’t know why we needed to see that but she cracks a smile ever so slightly so that’s a nice change of pace. Barry tells the crew that he can generate a lot of electricity if he approaches the speed of light, and in true Palpatine fashion Batman says “do it.” So they do do it and now Superman’s alive and well. Actually, well might not be the right word. He appears to be very confused and pissed, especially after Victor accidentally shoots him with a missile, which… y’know fair. I’d be pissed too. It is at that moment that we are graced with the single greatest line delivery in the history of the Snyderverse, nay the history of DC, nay the history of film itself… I’m of course referring to the glorious “Kal El No.” We then get the Wonder Woman theme, but more high pitched? For some reason? Oh well, still counts. The Wonder Woman theme counter is at 13.

And since we’re just getting all of the memes in this scene, we also get the Flash and Superman making eye contact meme template. This episode is truly the gift that keeps on giving. It even gives us Marvel characters that the MCU wasn’t bold enough to give us, since Barry lands right in front of the memorial of one Ben Parker. I guess Snyder just watched the Spider-Man home trilogy and after seeing that it refused to acknowledge Ben Parker’s existence said “fine I’ll do it myself.”

Superman and Wonder Woman get in a headbutting fight which is something that always bothers me in movies since there is absolutely no method of combat more impractical and stupid, but it always happens anyway. Batman gets heat visioned into a car, which… physics. At least he doesn’t make his stupid Josstice League quip here thank heaven. But as we learned from Hush, the only thing that can stop an evil Superman is Lois, who conveniently happened to be at the scene while all of this is going down. She pulls up, calms down her zombie boyfriend, and they leave together. It appears to be bad timing though, as Steppenwolf immediately shows up and makes a beeline to S.T.A.R. Labs. Silas makes a last stand, sacrificing himself to make the motherbox’s location findable after Steppenwolf steals it. Ray Fisher’s performance here is excellent, and I really love how Barry empathizes with him. It's a great little moment. And then we leave off today’s installment with Superman back, the motherboxes all united in one place, and the League about to prepare for the final battle. This was a pretty fun segment of the movie. It was a weird choice to introduce Superman into the final movie of a trilogy about him almost a full The Batman runtime in, but I think it works for the most part. I’m excited to see how it all ends, I should have the series finale out in the next few days. I'm definitely shooting to get it out before July 11, because I’ll be busy that day, and if you can’t guess what I’m doing then you must be living under a rock.

It seems like on hot days we sell drinks more than anything, and they’re also our highest profit margin items.

Am I missing something? I don’t see too many beverage only trucks out there.. is that just because the average ticket price is too low to make it work? Or what do you all think? Would love to hear some more experienced people weigh in. ",5,1751733577.0,foodtrucks,15,0.86,False

Fridge wide open, spoon in the peanut butter jar, shame in full effect.

And the wild part?

I *was* taking protein before bed.

Just not the right kind.

# Most people get this wrong

Whey protein is great, but it digests fast.

Like... an hour or two and it's gone.

So if you're using whey to stop nighttime hunger or aid overnight recovery, it's kinda useless.

It’s like drinking coffee and expecting it to knock you out.

# What made the difference

I swapped to a slow digesting protein, one that actually hangs out in your system.

It took a few tries to get the timing and mix right, but once I did?

No more fridge raids.

Better sleep.

Even post leg day soreness wasn’t as brutal.

I didn’t change anything else just what I drank before bed.

# What I wish I knew sooner

* If your shake leaves you hungry again in 90 minutes, it’s not working.  
* Texture matters way more than flavor when mixing thicker proteins.  
* Recovery protein isn’t just for bodybuilders; anyone with soreness or poor sleep can benefit.  
* Price doesn’t always mean performance, but cheap blends *always* left me bloated.

# Questions for the community

Anyone else switch from whey to something slower at night?

Did it actually help your hunger or recovery?

Also any tricks to make the thicker stuff easier to mix?

1lse23o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1lse23o/begging_for_an_endoscopy/,Begging for an endoscopy?!,"Hey all,

On July 27 of last year, I sipped bad coffee creamer that was in my refrigerator on accident (spit it out immediately) and then after that I ate a strawberry with peanut butter toast and I could you not an hour later I had turning stomach pain on the floor gassy for about three hours. I’ve had multiple issues with my refrigerator not cooling properly so that might be a cause of my issues I have now…

A friend of mine gave me some crackers and Gingerale to calm my stomach, but since that day, my stomach has not been the same. I went to the doctor the next month and my primary care physician told me that it seems that I have gastritis and a stomach ulcer so he prescribed me PPIs until the end of September of last year.

During that time, I ate very bland foods and really stuck to that type of diet. 

After I got off of PPI’s, I slowly introduced other foods into my diet, and I actually had pasta on my birthday in November.

Actually, I was feeling a bit better. I was able to slowly eat the food. I normally ate, but also was cautious to eat those foods in moderation and then in April of this year I went to a happy hour with a couple friends and had alcohol for the first time in a couple months, and I had a lot of water with the alcohol and food with the alcohol.

Then a couple weeks later, I had an iced coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts and that sent me into a flare that lasted for about 2 to 3 weeks in April.

May was a pretty good month for me no major flares, minimal stomach burning but in late June I got a little brave and decided to eat a cantina bowl from Taco Bell and next thing you know I had stomach pain and upset for about a week after that.

So just a backtrack when I was having stomach issues in April this year, my doctor prescribed me proton pump inhibitor to take which I have not been taking because I hear that taking them long-term can actually harm you… I mean, I took them for a month last year, but I really didn’t want to go back to PPI’s this year or so there’s that. Anyway, he told me to take PPIs up until August and he said that if my stomach doesn’t feel better in August, send him a message on my My chart and he will order an endoscopy for me to see what’s going on. I just wanna know why he didn’t order an endoscopy for me Last year when I first had issues with gastritis.

Mind you I know he’s my primary care doctor so he’s kind of like the gatekeeper to specialist, but I really do truly want to see what’s going on in my stomach. I just hate this so much. You know I have a couple months where I feel good and then I try to eat something you know in moderation you know just a one time thing and then boom. I’m back to a flare so I don’t know if I’m just dealing with chronic gastritis, but I just wanna know why I have to beg for an endoscopy. I see other stories from people on here where they had symptoms that I had in the doctor went ahead and order day endoscopy to find out what was going on right away.

Mind you I do have a family history of stomach issues. My mom has IBS and diverticulosis. My grandma has had issues with her stomach and my great grandma died of stomach cancer.

I’m also trying to find out ways to naturally heal my stomach. I know having a bland diet can reduce inflammation and triggers but I also wanna know what supplements have worked for you guys. I plan on going to Whole Foods today to see if I can find a supplement for my stomach to ease the pain.

I did go to Fourth of July cookout last night and I ate a couple foods. I try not to go overboard, but I still had slight stomach burning and slight stomach cramps. Nothing too crazy but I just wanna go back to being able to eat the food that I enjoy in moderation without having to be in pain this is the most annoying type of thing to have And a lot of times I feel very depressed on my progress. I thought by a year I would feel 100% better I do feel like I’m about 80% better but the 20% is really killing me. Any advice?

I’m starting to have an issue with walking him though…

The current walk/potty area situation is : 

- tiny front grass patch in front of appartment. He pees there sometimes but it’s in front of a busy sidewalk.

- bigger, well maintained lawn in front of a business right across the street. Little to no distraction. That’s where he pees and poops usually. NOT somewhere I’d sit, considering it’s… a lot of dogs’ potty area.

- Parks A and B, similar walking distance (5 min, 2 blocs. Nice lawns, lots of people but never crowded, nice for socializing with fellow dog owners. Dog seems very chill once we get there, will cuddle or chill on the grass next to us, sniffs around, chews on toys. He also never really eliminates in the parks, maybe only one or two pees in the past week. 

I like going to hang out at parcs because it’s easy to bring a book/coffee and take a minute to chill, which is something I struggle to do with him at home because he demands near constant attention. At first he was chill walking to the parks… now it’s a real struggle. He sits as soon as we hit the sidewalk and sometimes refuses to budge. What would normally take 5 min takes like… 20. 

But going BACK home is a breeze, because, of course, he walks REALLY fast and definitely knows we’re going home. 

We’re starting puppy classes in 2 weeks, but… I’m starting to suspect we walk him too much? We take him to the potty area across the street like 3 or 4 times a day, + 2 walks to one of the parks and back. I’m guessing park is probably too early for now… or at least maybe we should limit it for once a day?

He sleeps in a crate for most of the night + one big nap per day but still whines a lot in it. He also does 1 or 2 naps on the couch if we’re sitting on it.

I was reluctant to replace the pump for the first two years I owned it to not void the warranty, so I just installed the self-stick sound deadening panels only, which maybe made a slight difference.  And after the warranty had expired I was dragging my feet to swap out the pump because I've never done something like that before even though I knew that would be beneficial sound-wise.

I then [ran across this vid](https://www.reddit.com/r/ranciliosilvia/comments/1kayc2o/my_stealthy_silvia_v3_before_vs_after_pump/)  that inspired me to just jump in and 'do it'.  u/DivoNOR thank you!

I measured the difference at startup with a sound meter app on my phone, measured approximately 1m away from the machine.  The difference? Approximately a full 7db!

I have this friend (also my neighbor) who has been desperately trying to get me to do a yoga class with her. I’ve done yoga, I know it’s not especially difficult, but it didn’t improve anything for me. I use child’s pose between my PT exercises for my SI joint problems but the rest of it just made me more tired. 


I see no benefit to leaving my house to do relaxation yoga, meditation, or any other relaxation exercise because it just undoes all the hyping myself up to leave the house and interact with people. It takes me about 3 hours from the time I wake up to let my meds kick in, fill up on coffee, and let my guts calm down to the point where I can start getting dressed and groomed for the day. I know it’s a bad symptom day when I still can’t get it together after those 3 hours. Doing all that to go to a relaxation class feels akin to *hurry up and wait*. Doing all that to go to yoga that is designed to be more challenging feels like I should have just gone to Pilates where at least I’m getting my blood pumping and accomplishing my PT. 


She’s a good friend, but she doesn’t get it, and for some reason she will not drop it. It’s become a joke at this point. Even after explaining that I’ve TRIED YOGA, that’s when she started pitching relaxation yoga. Last night I told her I would get more out of a nap or a hot bath in my own home.

I've been doing it for years, and it's become a staple in my morning routine. Let me walk you through the process.

First, you'll need coarsely ground coffee beans. The grind should be similar to what you'd use for a French press. I usually use a dark roast, but feel free to experiment with different types to find your favorite.

Next, you'll combine the coffee grounds with cold water. The ratio I use is about 1 cup of grounds to 4 cups of water, but you can adjust this to your taste. Mix them in a large jar or pitcher.

Now comes the waiting game. Let the mixture steep at room temperature for 12-24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger the flavor will be. I usually let mine sit for about 18 hours.

After steeping, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the grounds. What you're left with is a concentrated cold brew that you can dilute with water or milk to your liking.

Store your cold brew in the fridge, and it'll stay fresh for up to two weeks. It's perfect for those hot summer days when you need a cool, refreshing pick-me-up.

If you're looking to simplify the process even further, I've found that using an iced coffee maker can be a game-changer. It takes out a lot of the guesswork and mess. I recently discovered some great options at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have a variety of styles to suit different needs and budgets.

One thing I love about cold brew is its versatility. You can drink it straight over ice, mix it with milk for a creamy treat, or even use it as a base for coffee cocktails. The smooth, less acidic flavor of cold brew makes it perfect for experimenting with different add-ins like vanilla syrup or cinnamon.

For those who are health-conscious, cold brew can be a great option. It's naturally lower in acidity than hot brewed coffee, which can be easier on your stomach. Plus, since it's so concentrated, a little goes a long way, helping you control your caffeine intake.

If you're interested in diving deeper into the world of cold brew, I highly recommend checking out some of the iced coffee makers available at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got some innovative designs that can help you perfect your cold brew game.

Remember, making cold brew is all about patience and experimentation. Don't be afraid to play around with different ratios, steep times, and coffee types until you find your perfect brew. Happy brewing!",1,1751732713.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lsdn98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lsdn98/aio_dated_for_3_months_discovered_she_is_a_escort/,AIO - Dated for 3 months . Discovered she is a escort and transgender,"Am I overreacting ?

I met a beautiful girl in Bangkok in April and instantly hit it off , the day after meeting I went for coffee date with her and everything is pretty good. That night I stayed with her and get to know her; where I’m told her work is “modeling” she has some stuff on instagram and big followers and a personal assistant ( ladyboy) so I kind of believed her , after that night she had a job in pattaya and we parted ways but with a strong urge to take this further .

2 weeks pass and we communicate back and forth , one time during that 2 weeks she tells  me she can’t use her phone for a few days as “she has work in a province area with bad signal” - I just believed her outright no doubts yet . A week later I come to suprise her in Bangkok, when I arrive to city she is not at the hotel the time is 9pm I get confused why she’s not there so I have to tell her and ruin the suprise , she tells me she’s at a work “meeting” and won’t be back till late I don’t know anything about modeling but now I’m confused like why so late meeting . Anyway the following week every single night she would have to get ready ; her personal assistant does her makeup hair and everything and go to work at 9pm and not come back till 11am next morning after a few days I got depressed and run down and confronted her then she changed her story that she is a party entertainer. As in rich exclusive parties she entertains guest etc etc . Okay maybe I’m naive but I didn’t suspect anything other red flags were constantly sending good amounts of money back to her home country via western union and eventually getting me to do transfers too (100-200 usd daily) very lavish lifestyle she loves designer clothes ; lv, Rolex etc and she buys stuff like expensive shampoo and just leaves it in the hotel after one use as in money means nothing to her .

Still I’m non the wiser to anything. The story takes a turn for the stranger side now , we had slept together once but never fully dpv as she told me she’s a virgin . The 2nd time the moment arises I ask her to let me in , so she proceeds ; not before going to the bathroom to use numbing cream. I ask about it and shrugged it off but somewhere during the night I realized she never once got naturally self lubricated , confused or horrified I asked her why does it not work? She was defensive and I asked are you trans where she lied to me and say no ; I tell her I won’t leave her and I’ll still love and accept her and she admits it (the whole time I never knew could never tell even feels looks everything normal I don’t like guys) . We continue dating from there but the week I mentioned I was very lonely and fed up of her absence at night  then she left In a hurry to another job abroad . I just continued to travel alone without realizing how low I’d become I started to smoke a lot of weed to cope which further disillusioned me .

On our last meet (final) things were different she apologized sincerely for the way things were last time said she felt stupid for putting work first and that she’ll take the next 3 days (until my flight back to Europe) off of work and just be with me .

She had also bought her mum to meet me which was both nerve wracking but really made me feel like family ; those days were beautiful honestly , she had mood swings sometimes but for the most part we dated , swam , cuddled ; and spent time with her mom things honestly felt perfect and on the last night I couldn’t sleep for a second and balled my eyes at the thought of being the other side of the world from her . She cried intensely too . We stayed in touch pretty much every day until last week where one morning she told me same story as before “job in Vietnam , exclusive party etc , no phone allowed” okay I thought but this time I went CRAZY stalked her and found 2 escort sites with her photos and number on there . I accused her of being an escort but unfortunately the “evidence I gave” was a guy with 12 followers on her recent follow list and he was only following sex workers I said this is proof ; very bad timing as it’s before her flight and she outright denied it saying show proof and she even messaged the guy to show me she doesn’t even know him .

Then during the time at her job I text a lot and try to communicate and I said how much it’s negatively affecting me she breaks down quits the job and calls me drunken late at night . I tell her I don’t want to speak like this and she tells me she lost $17k not doing the job and that she quit for “me” . Rocky territory , the next few days when she’s on way to Bangkok I cannot accept what I’m told “party entertainer , model” I asked many friends , family and even ChatGPT and they all recon she is a high end escort with a manager who connects her to high profile clients in countries like Thailand Vietnam Taiwan Singapore etc ; like a luxury escort circuit around Asia. Those 2 profiles I found where located in manilla her home city so it wasn’t proof enough but all the dots point to my conclusion; the money , the manager (most likely pimp) the secrecy , personal assistant, high end clients who don’t let you use your phone. I called her again this time saying to talk more details about the party entertaining in particular the Vietnam job questions such as : why no phone? what party could possibly be 24hours? What do you do in the 24hours ?. Any names or stories of people you talk to. She got angry with me said she doesn’t want to talk about it and is exposing this secret industry and we should talk tommorow. I hang up and 5 mins later call back and say if you can’t tell me these things we should break up so we broke up. 4 days have past and I quit thc and nicotine in the middle of this so my brain is vulnerable. I call her yesterday and basically said sorry ( I know crazy) she is very upset and angry with me saying she can’t believe I just discarded her like that I did ask her to see my pov and how I became that insecure and crazy ; she was just dismissive choosing more to focus on how I made her feel , how she couldn’t work these past days and how she doesn’t know if it’s good we get back together and she needs time to think. Today my weed brain is clearing and I’m realizing again my self worth I love this girl to bits and actually am heart broken if i can’t see her again we have many good memories we made each other laugh smile , feel safe just overall someone I really saw as potential to be my “ one and only” but I’m hurting still and still feel betrayed like if at the start she told me this before I probably wouldn’t have got involved and she would’ve knew that but still hid the details to “save my feelings” . Would I be an idiot to consider another go at things? Also considering she is now in Thailand and me back in England . I also have since signed upto escort agencies in England and will do that luxury work too as I’m young handsome guy and will feel guilt free about it now I’m single and given the circumstances (it’s also something I tried years ago briefly so not a noob) Also am I the asshole for how I handled things? Are am I completely justified to feel betrayed and go a bit crazy stalker mode lmao. Overall this has been a massive stressor to my life now and affects my ability to form trust in future relationships. I would consider a 2nd chance , only if she is willing to be more open and not hiding anymore secrets. Advice I have been given now after yesterday’s simpy phone call is to initiate no contact for 30 days . After that open the lines of communication again . Please help? Tell me the brutal honesty don’t sugar coat please .",0,1751732408.0,AmIOverreacting,12,0.25,False
1lsdn5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lsdn5z/zombie_life_survival_2_nuka_brain/,Zombie Life Survival [2. Nuka Brain],"\[[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lqoqd1/zombie_life_survival_1_24_hours/)\]

The music was playing at a soft volume throughout the apartment. 

After returning home from his zombie drug run, North cleaned the place last time and then spent some time decorating. 

With preparations nearly complete and the guests still yet to arrive, North turned his attention to his final task. On the kitchen counter sat an array of plastic bags and containers, each holding the assortment of drugs he'd bought earlier. Using his supernatural intuition, he combined and refined them into one potent concoction he had come to name *‘Nuka Brain.*’ The new drug compound was a very intense deliriant. Once taken, it would trap the person's – or anyone's – consciousness in an altered state where fungi spores could no longer fully cripple the brain during the body's zombification. Of course, it was only a half-baked solution, and the chances of death remained high. But it was a necessary sacrifice to preserve their personalities and memories, rather than becoming mindless, flesh-eating monsters.

Overall, dosing his friends without their consent with powerful psychotic drug was unquestionably fucked up and morally wrong, but considering the circumstances, he didn’t see another option. And if any of them did not turn into a zombie, then they could simply treat it as a bad experience or death (which was a better option for what was upcoming.)

He premixed the *Nuka Brain* into beer bottles to avoid any complications later. But in case anyone decided they weren't in the mood for drinking anymore, North had also bought a large humidifier and replaced its water reservoir with a diluted version of the Brain Nuke cocktail. He could rely on that as his backup plan.

*Maybe I should give them a choice. Forcing others to suffer isn’t the right path. Then again, no one would believe me anyway…*

*What is right and what is wrong in this situation?*

*Why do I suddenly sound like a villain?*

Soon, his guests started arriving one by one, and North greeted each of them with genuine warmth, as if he was seeing them after a long time - which, according to his mental clock, he actually was. It had been at least three and a half years since he'd seen these people alive and healthy, even though from their perspective, they'd probably hung out just a few weeks ago.

Anyway, North didn't have an extensive social circle. He was an art student working toward his master's degree at UCLA primarily because he hadn't been able to find steady employment after finishing his undergraduate degree (no surprise there, considering the job market for fine arts majors.) Jake, meanwhile, worked as a data analyst from his home office, which gave him flexible hours and decent income for their age group.

Besides North and Jake, their small but close-knit friend group consisted of four additional people who had all remained connected since their undergraduate years together.

There was *Sarah,* a struggling actress who worked part-time at a coffee shop in West Hollywood while auditioning for roles. She had long blonde hair and an infectious laugh that could brighten anyone’s mood.  *Marcus* was a film student, always working on independent projects and short films. *Joyce* was a psychology grad student and research assistant at UCLA. The most analytical of them all, she often played the role of unofficial therapist often. She was dating Marcus, and they’d been together for almost two years. Lastly, *David* worked as a bartender at an upscale downtown restaurant. He knew everything about cocktails and had introduced most of them to quality alcohol. 

""I recently got cast in a zombie TV series that's going to be released next year,"" Sarah announced, holding a slice of pizza in one hand and her drink in the other. ""It was actually my first real speaking role, even if it was only for one episode.""

“Wait, for real?” Joyce sat up straighter, setting her beer bottle down on the coffee table. “That’s awesome. What was it like acting in a zombie show? I imagine it was… chaotic.”

Everyone's attention shifted toward Sarah.

Sarah tucked her legs beneath her on the couch, clearly pleased to have the spotlight. “Honestly? Not that much ‘acting’ involved when you’re playing a zombie. Shuffle around, moan like you just woke up from a coma, pretend you want to eat someone. That’s pretty much it.” She grinned. “Still, it was fun. I just wish I had more than one episode. My character got crushed by a military truck during some big chaos scene.”

Joyce winced. “God, that sounds horrible. Like, in real life? That kind of thing would be my worst nightmare.”

“Yeah,” Sarah agreed, “They used a prosthetic body for the scene, but watching it get flattened in real time? Kinda messed me up.”

“Zombies always creep me out,” Joyce said with a shiver. “Thank God none of that stuff is real.”

“Oh,” North felt it was his time to shine, so cutting in from his spot. “But what if it was? Like, say the outbreak starts tomorrow. What’s your first move?”

The conversation pivoted fast.

Joyce furrowed her brow, fully leaning into the thought. “Honestly? First rule: don’t be an idiot. That alone probably increases your survival odds by at least fifty percent.”

“That’s true,” David chimed in, lifting his red plastic cup.  ""Personally, I'd wrap myself head-to-toe in thick blankets or padding before even thinking about stepping outside. After all, zombies aren't wild animals with lion teeth or eagle claws that could tear through multiple layers of fabric. They're just reanimated humans with regular human teeth.""

“That’s smart,” Sarah admitted, pointing her half-eaten pizza slice at him. “Just don’t fall into a pool or something.”

“I’d go full duct tape,” Marcus said, mouth full of chips. “Wrap my arms and legs, pad my jacket with phone books. And I’d never go anywhere alone. That’s how people die in those shows, ‘I’ll be right back’ energy. Or simply ignoring rules that are clearly set for your own safety. But for some reason, you have to act like a little bitch and insufferable.”

“Exactly,” Joyce said, nodding. “It’s like watching people volunteer to die.”

Jake wiped his fingers on a napkin. “I’d just stay inside and wait it out. Isn’t that the point? Don’t go where the zombies are.”

“But then supplies run out,” North pointed out from the edge of the couch, where he sat quietly nursing a drink. “What do you do then?”

Jake shrugged. “I’d raid the neighbors’ houses.”

Everyone chuckled.

“Okay, little psycho,” Sarah said, grinning.

“I’m not a psycho,” Jake mumbled as if stating the truth, “It’s just basic logic.”

“I think the scariest part,” Joyce said, her tone softening slightly, “wouldn’t even be the zombies. It’d be how people turn on each other. That’s what all those shows are really about, right?”

Marcus nodded. “Panic’s worse than infection.""

“Actually, in similar real life cases, people either become extremely cooperative and resourceful, or they completely fall apart and start making irrational decisions based on panic and fear."" Joyce said thoughtfully.

“What about you, North?” Sarah then turned to him, leaning forward. “You’re the one who brought it up: what’s *your* zombie apocalypse plan?”

North hesitated, eyes flicking across the room before answering. “I don’t know,” he said slowly. “Honestly? I think I’d probably just want to go early. Get it over with as soon as possible.”

There was a short silence.

He looked around the table, shrugging a little. “I mean... do you really want to watch the world fall apart around you? All the panic, the desperation, the people turning on each other? That’s not surviving. That’s just... stretching out the misery.”

Jake gave him a small snort and shook his head. “Damn, man. That’s bleak.” He grabbed his drink and took a swig. “I get that everything sucks lately, but come on. We made it through COVID, didn’t we? Power outages, toilet paper wars, all that. A zombie virus? At least you can see it coming. Zombies don’t lie on the news.”

“Zombies also don’t care if you're wearing a mask,” David muttered, half-smiling.

Jake laughed. “Exactly. They're dumb and slow. You board up some windows, stay quiet, maybe grow some tomatoes on your balcony – you’ll probably outlive half the population. Moreover, if our government has even a little bit of competence, the chances of an outbreak spreading without getting properly contained are basically negligible.""

""Mmm, that's probably true,"" North nodded thoughtfully, though he was thinking about how utterly wrong Jake's optimism was. In reality, half of our government had taken been taken over by aliens since decades ago. They were the real culprit of human suffering all along. Though, there was no point in saying it out loud,  ""Unless, of course, the government is somehow involved in causing it in the first place.""

Marcus raised an eyebrow. “Oh boy. Here we go.”

North glanced over. “You think it’s impossible?”

“I think you’ve been watching too much late-night YouTube,” Marcus said, reaching for another beer. “But hey, anything’s possible, right?”

Sarah laughed, raising both hands like she was surrendering. “Alright, nope. We’re cutting this off before it turns into a conspiracy rabbit hole. I already feel like the ice caps melting are enough existential dread for one week.”

She turned to David, eyes brightening. “Anyway… *you*! What happened with that girl you were seeing last week? When are we finally meeting her?”

David gave a kind of bashful laugh, scratching the back of his neck. “She’s... um, yeah, she’s great. Still seeing her. We’re going on our fifth date this weekend, actually.”

“Ohhh,” Joyce teased, leaning forward with a grin. “Look at you, Mr. Committed.”

“What’s her name?” Sarah asked. “What does she do?”

“Rebecca,” David said, and there was something soft in the way he said it. “She’s a vet. Works at this animal clinic in Santa Monica. She’s... honestly just really cool. Super grounded. She talks to anxious dogs like they’re little people and somehow it works.”

Joyce smiled. “She sounds lovely.”

“She is.” David took a drink, then added, a little quieter, “I haven’t felt like this in a while.”

Marcus raised his beer. “To David. May this one not ghost you by date seven.”

""Hey, don't jinx it!"" David laughed and clinked his bottle against Marcus’s anyway. 

North could see the hope in his eyes, “She sounds wonderful,” he said, meaning it. “I hope it works out.”

David glanced over at him. “Thanks, man.”

“Actually, now that most of us are getting settled down,” Joyce said, nudging North’s leg with her foot. ""Your last breakup was a really long time ago. I don't even remember you dating anybody seriously during university.""

""Well,"" the question finally made North slightly flustered, “I mean… dating’s not exactly easy. And finding someone who actually clicks with you? Harder than people think.”

“Pffft,” Jake scoffed, lifting his beer. “That’s just code for ‘I like staying single.’ Which is fine, by the way, but don’t act like you’re some tragic romantic martyr.”

North raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t say…”

“No, no,” Jake said, cutting in, “Remember when Natalie said she had that friend she wanted to set you up with? The girl actually had a job and worked as an animation artist in a big gaming company. She thought the two of you would be a perfect match. But, guess what, you ghosted the entire idea. Didn’t even *text* her. Don’t tell me dating’s hard when you’re turning down actual help.”

The group laughed… not mean-spirited, but egging things on like friends do when someone’s cornered.

“Honestly,” Jake added, smirking now, “at this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if you came out as gay.”

“Booo,” Sarah and Amy groaned in unison. “Jake! Come on.”

“Dude,” Marcus chimed in from the floor, chuckling, “at least wait until he finishes his drink before you out him.”

Jake held up his hands. “I’m just saying – if he is, I support it!”

Sarah leaned in, teasing. “If that’s the case, North, I *do* have a very attractive friend who might be your type. Has a great jawline, big reader, and loves hiking. You’d be smitten by him, if you saw him once.”

North raised both hands in mock surrender, the corner of his mouth twitching. “Okay, okay. Thanks for the offer, but… no. Jake’s just talking out of his ass.” He looked over at Jake, giving him a dry glare. “You’re spreading fake news.”

Jake grinned back. “I only speak truths the world isn’t ready for.”

North shook his head, then grew a little quieter. “It’s not that I don’t want to meet someone. It’s just… I don’t think I’m in the right place for that kind of thing. Not right now.”

Joyce smile, “Yeah? Why not?”

He hesitated, eyes dropping to the floor for a beat before answering. “Because when you really care about someone… you owe them the best version of yourself. And I don’t think I’m there yet. I’m still figuring my own stuff out. So, I can only wish to encounter someone whom I can love one day in the future.”

Time drifted on. The laughter softened and the energy in the room thinned into a warm, content quiet. Empty bottles cluttered the table. Someone had queued up a chill playlist. Everyone leaned back into couches and floor cushions, dazed with food and drink, slipping into that hazy space where no one really wanted to move.

Around midnight, North glanced around the room. He let the silence settle for a moment as his eyes lingered on each of them. Sarah was curled up under a blanket, Marcus half-asleep while leaning against Joyce, who was still nursing a half-finished drink. Jake had his back against the arm of the couch, scrolling through his phone..

Finally, it was time. He started to rise quietly from his seat, but Jake reached out and grabbed his arm.

“Where you going, man?”

“Just grabbing more beer,” North said.

“You sure? Kinda feels like we’ve hit the limit.”

Sarah groaned softly and sat up. “Yeah, no more for me. I open the cafe at seven. If I wake up still drunk, I’m quitting on the spot.”

“I can’t even feel my stomach anymore,” Marcus mumbled without opening his eyes. “Think I hit capacity two slices ago.”

“No worries,” North didn’t press. “Let me grab some water instead.”

“I need to use the bathroom,” Joyce said, rising at the same time. She stretched with a wide yawn.

North nodded, already moving toward the hallway. His steps were slow, partly from the alcohol and partly from what he was about to do. He paused just long enough near the wall-mounted humidifier, his backup, then reached behind it. His fingers found the small toggle he’d wired earlier in the day. A soft click, and the green LED blinked to life. The *Nuka Brain* began releasing into the air. It was odorless, colorless, and undetectable. North watched the gentle mist spiral upward through the vented top of the unit, dispersing silently into the surrounding air where his friends were sitting and breathing. Next, North made his way toward his bedroom to check on Danielle and her friends. She had brought two friends with her - a boy named Adam who looked about her age, and her best friend Emma. He had barely exchanged two words with them when they arrived and had taken over his bedroom due to the limited space in the living room and had closed the door behind them.

Right now, from the soft, muffled sounds of laughter and conversation coming from behind the door, it was clear they were still wide awake and having a good time.

North knocked gently on his own bedroom door. ""You guys doing okay in there?""

The chatter in the room suddenly quieted, and after a brief pause, Danielle's voice called back through the wooden door, ""We're fine, North.""

North smiled faintly at her polite response. ""Mind if I come in for a second?""

""Ahhh..."" There was an awkward silence for a moment, followed by some whispered discussion he couldn't quite make out. Then Danielle spoke again, ""Sure, come in.""

North pushed the door open and stepped inside. Danielle, her best friend Emma, and the boy Adam were all lying on their stomachs across his bed, watching YouTube videos on a laptop. They hadn't completely trashed his room, though they had thrown his comforter on the floor and scattered snack wrappers and crumbs across his bed sheets. On any other normal day, he would have been annoyed by the mess, but right now he genuinely didn't care about something so trivial. What did catch his attention was the presence of the boy. What was his story? He was curious about why Jake had allowed Adam to come to what was supposed to be a sleepover with just the girls. There was something suspicious going on with him.

North casually walked over to the small desk beside his bed and quietly turned on the secondary humidifier he'd placed there earlier as part of his backup plan.

""Is everything alright?"" Danielle asked, puckering her lips.

North turned to look at them. ""Do you guys need anything? Water, more soda, snacks?""

""Nah, we're good, thanks,"" Danielle replied. ""You can close the door behind you when you leave.""

*Wow, it's my room and my house, and I'm being ordered around by a thirteen-year-old. Kids these days...*

North felt a flash of irritation, but it was actually convenient that she wanted him to leave quickly since he'd just activated the humidifier. It would take maybe five minutes maximum before the *Nuka Brain* vapors knocked them unconscious. Plus, teenagers could be incredibly cruel when they wanted to be. Danielle had given him plenty of firsthand experience with her mocking behavior whenever she felt like he was being too serious or boring, so he felt it was probably better not to engage with her attitude right now.

""Okay, sounds good,"" North nodded and was about to leave when his eyes happened to glance at the laptop screen. His footsteps immediately halted and his attention was completely captured. He took a step closer to get a better look at what they were watching, squinting at the image.

“Wait… who’s that?” he asked in confusion, pointing to the girl in the center of the screen.

It was Emma who replied, “Oh… that’s Skye. She’s a singer.”

North didn’t respond right away. He wasn’t asking out of curiosity or interest in pop culture. He was asking because she looked almost exactly like someone he’d encountered in three different loops. Though, a little dishevel. She always showed up at the worst moment and brought chaos with her. She was also the half-reason for his deaths in three different time loops, and he still remembered the first time vividly - he'd been hiding from alien monsters when she came running straight toward his position, being chased by a zombie horde. Thus, he had to reveal himself to save her, which ended up alerting his enemies to his location. It had been a complete disaster. At the time, he’d thought maybe she was unlucky, or cursed. However, the scenario repeated two more times later, making him suspect if she was his death star. He needed to steer clear of her.

Anyway what the hell was she doing in a music video?

“I’ve never seen her before,” he muttered. “Or… any of them, actually.”

“She’s actually part of a three girl band,” Emma explained helpfully, scooting forward a little. “She’s also a model. They do kind of a hybrid thing, pop, fashion, dance. Mostly for younger audiences. You probably wouldn’t know them.”

North blinked. *I’m twenty-four, not sixty.*

“They’re not that famous,” Danielle added with a shrug. “I mean, they’re talented and have super pretty faces, sure, but nowhere near the numbers they were hoping for. So, maybe that's why you never heard of them.”

“That’s not true!” Emma said quickly, already on the defensive. “They’ve had multiple songs charting. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean they’re not doing well. They’re still figuring things out.”

“Ha, you literally can’t defend them. They have been singing for four years now, so they should have things figured out by now. Also, all the hype is because their label threw a ton of money at marketing,” Danielle replied. “That doesn’t mean they’re actually good.”

Emma frowned. “You’ve literally never listened to a full song.”

Danielle rolled her eyes. “I’ve heard enough to know they’re overproduced and hollow.”

“That's just your opinion,” Emma snapped. “Some people like fun music that isn’t sad and money all the time.”

North took a half-step back as the argument flared between them, voices overlapping. Emma sounded like a devoted fanatic, while Danielle clearly preferred some other bands. Adam, meanwhile, remained completely silent throughout the debate as if it was not worth it. North decided the boy was probably the smartest one in the room, but after inadvertently starting this war between the girls, he felt it was time to make his exit. 

The Brain Nuke cocktail would be taking hold soon. He hadn’t felt it yet, but he knew the signs. It was similar to a dam filling up with continuous rain until the flood broke without warning. There was no easing into it. Just *bam* – a full-system override.

He quickly grabbed several water bottles from the mini-fridge and walked back toward the living room, where the others were still sprawled across the couch and floor, laughing and arguing.

However, just as he was about to sit down and rejoin the conversation, it felt like someone had suddenly switched off all the lights inside his skull. His legs gave out. The water bottle slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor, rolling out of reach. North’s body slammed onto the couch with a soft thud. Following, his limbs began to convulse and his muscles seized, chest rising in short bursts as if he couldn’t remember how to breathe.

At the sametime, Jake and others looked on in shock and confusion, not understanding what was happening to him or why he'd suddenly fallen.

Someone shouted his name.

But then, like dominoes falling, others joined him in the delirium.

…

At some point during the next morning, the world fell into chaos. 

People froze in their positions, stopping whatever they were doing as their eyes rolled back into their sockets like something had flicked the off switch in their brains; followed by the distant sound of metal crunching and rubber burning as cars slammed into each other on highways, intersections, and wherever drivers had passed out behind the wheel. 

Minutes later, the skies cracked open as planes started falling. Commercial airliners dropped like dying birds, crashing into cities and fields, exploding on impact. Fires broke out, columns of black against a blue morning sky, but no one came to stop them. Helicopters spun out and crashed into buildings. Train operators slumped over controls. People collapsed in their kitchens, bathrooms, classrooms. Hospitals overflowed with unconscious bodies, doctors and nurses included. The scene looked like war, but the enemy was invisible.

By noon, more than seventy percent of the world’s population had fallen into a state somewhere between sleep and death. They were unmoving, and unresponsive. No shock, sound, or drugs could brought them back. 

Meanwhile, the ones left standing had no idea what to do.

Some thought it was a gas leak, some talked about a terrorist attack or a bioweapon gone wrong. Though, most screamed about God or aliens or judgment day, saying it was punishment for humanities sins. In the beginning, people tried calling loved ones, emergency services, hospitals, local news. Social media exploded with footage, shaky phone videos of entire subway platforms frozen, of neighbors screaming as their families dropped to the floor.

However, as the gravity of the situation sank in, fear started to morph into panic, anger, and desperation.

Across the globe, the scene was the same.

In Tokyo, trains piled into one another underground. In Berlin, people dropped in the streets, still clutching their morning bread and coffee. In Beijing, in Mumbai, in Seoul … gridlock. Everywhere, there was nothing but panic and silence.

What was left of governments scrambled to respond, but it was like trying to put out a wildfire with a garden hose. The White House lost most of its cabinet. Parliament in the UK was down. Military bases across the world reported mass blackouts in personnel. The few departments still functioning switched into survival mode, issuing vague emergency declarations, mostly just reruns of outdated disaster protocols no one could enforce.

Police departments, where they were still intact, tried to hold cities together. Some managed for a while. Others splintered within hours. There were still people in uniform doing patrols, trying to protect neighborhoods, but most were just as scared and lost as everyone else.

The whole world was affected and went down the same way, and everyone still awake realized at once: they were on their own.

The looting started not long after. First it was food and water, then electronics, then just random items because people didn't know what else to do. Gas stations got picked clean. Grocery stores turned into brawl zones. The roads became jammed with stalled-out vehicles, many of them containing unconscious drivers still strapped to their seats. Cell towers overloaded. Power grids flickered. Emergency services, overwhelmed and leaderless, soon collapsed into confusion. Many people packed up and left the cities. . Others locked their doors, blocked their windows, and waited - hoping it was a temporary situation, praying someone would show up with a cure or a plan. Others formed small groups, neighborhoods banding together for protection.

In the middle of all that, hanging in the air like static electricity, was the unbearable question:

*What the hell happens next?*

I pull up to the speaker and give my name then pull up to the window. Cue angry looking employee, doesn’t say a word just hands drinks through the window. I said “have a nice 4th of July”. She responds with “have a day” which we all know means FU, and closes the window. Now I’m pissed, she’s obviously mad because I didn’t tip, did she tamper with my drink? It should be illegal to let employees see the tip amount before service, have it pop up after, or better, remove it completely from the app. Starbucks employees make a decent wage for putting coffee in cups, they shouldn’t demand a tip, especially since it’s expensive as hell anyway.

It’s harder than I thought.,"I’ve been with the same brick-and-mortar bank since high school. No real reason just inertia. But after watching my savings earn less than a cup of gas station coffee every month, I figured it was time to look around.

been digging into what people consider the best savings account options right now. I’m not chasing some miracle rate, just something that doesn’t feel like a joke. I don’t need all the bells and whistles, but I do care about customer service and being able to get my money out without playing phone tag with five departments.

Has anyone here made the switch from a big legacy bank to one of the online ones? What was that move like for you? Anything you wish you’d known before jumping?

Also, if you stuck with a traditional bank and found a decent option, I’d love to hear about that too. I'm still on the fence, trying to make the move with both eyes open   ",3,1751732196.0,Banking,48,0.56,False
