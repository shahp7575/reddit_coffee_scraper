# ☕ Quick Summary: How Coffee Impacts the Brain

||
||
|**Benefit**|**How It Helps**|
|Boosts alertness|Caffeine blocks adenosine, the ""sleepy"" neurotransmitter|
|Enhances short-term memory|Improves recall and attention during tasks|
|Reduces risk of Alzheimer’s & Parkinson’s|Neuroprotective antioxidants and brain-boosting compounds|
|Elevates mood|Stimulates dopamine production|
|Supports cognitive longevity|Fights inflammation and oxidative stress in brain tissue|

 

# ��The Science Behind Coffee and Brain Function

# 1. Caffeine: The Brain’s Favorite Stimulant

Caffeine, the main active compound in coffee, works by **blocking adenosine**, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep and relaxation. This allows **dopamine and norepinephrine**—the “feel-good” and “focus” chemicals—to work more effectively.

��**Expert Quote**“Moderate caffeine consumption has been shown to **enhance cognitive function, particularly alertness and attention**,” says **Dr. Astrid Nehlig**, neuroscientist and director of research at the French National Institute of Health.

 

# 2. Memory and Learning Enhancement

Studies reveal that **caffeine improves both short-term memory and learning capabilities**.

��**Statistical Insight**According to a 2014 study published in Nature Neuroscience, participants who consumed 200 mg of caffeine after studying showed a **significant improvement in memory retention** after 24 hours compared to a placebo group.

 

# 3. Protection Against Cognitive Decline

Long-term coffee consumption is linked to **a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases**, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

��**Meta-Analysis Data**A 2021 review in Nutrients concluded that drinking **3–5 cups of coffee per day** is associated with a **65% reduced risk of Alzheimer’s** and a **32% lower risk of Parkinson’s disease**.

��Why? Coffee contains **chlorogenic acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants**—compounds that protect neurons and reduce oxidative stress, which are key contributors to brain aging.

 

# ��Infographic Suggestion: Coffee & Brain Health at a Glance

**Visual Layout:**

 

**Top section**: Brain illustration showing highlighted areas activated by caffeine (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus)

**Middle section**: Coffee cup with nutrient labels (Caffeine, Polyphenols, Trigonelline)

# ��‍⚕️ Expert Interviews

# ��Interview with Dr. David Perlmutter (Neurologist & Author of Brain Maker)

“Coffee is one of the **richest sources of antioxidants** in the modern diet. These compounds play a **vital role in reducing brain inflammation**, which is linked to diseases like Alzheimer's and depression. I recommend organic coffee, preferably without added sugar.”

# ��Dr. Lisa Mosconi, Neuroscientist & Author of Brain Food

“In moderate doses, coffee stimulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule that supports **neurogenesis and plasticity**, which are essential for memory and learning.”

 

# ��Real User Experiences with Coffee and Memory

# ��Karen M., 42 – Nurse Practitioner

“I started drinking black coffee during my night shifts. Over time, I noticed I could recall patient details better, and my mood stayed much more stable. It’s become a mental health ritual.”

# ��Daniel S., 67 – Retired Educator

“I’ve been drinking two cups a day for 40 years. No signs of memory loss yet. I do crosswords and walk every day too, but coffee is my daily brain boost.”

# ��Jennifer L., 35 – Blogger and Mom of Two

“I rely on coffee to stay sharp when managing my kids and content schedule. I feel more focused and less foggy—like I’ve turned on the lights in my brain.”

 

# ⚖️ How Much Coffee Is Too Much?

While coffee has brain benefits, moderation is key.

��**Too much caffeine** (above 400 mg daily or \~4 cups) may lead to:

Jitters

Insomnia

Anxiety

Dependency

��**Best practice:** Stick to **1–3 cups/day**, ideally in the morning or early afternoon, and drink **filtered or organic coffee** for the cleanest experience.

 

# ��Bonus Tip: Try Mushroom Coffee for Cognitive Wellness

**Mushroom-infused coffees** with ingredients like **Lion’s Mane and Cordyceps** are trending for their **nootropic benefits**. These compounds support nerve growth factor (NGF) production and brain cell regeneration.

Check out reviews of **smart coffee blends** on [gomehedi.com](https://gomehedi.com), where we regularly test the best products for mental focus and memory.

 

# ✅ Final Thoughts: Coffee as a Cognitive Ally

Coffee is more than a comfort drink. It’s a **science-backed brain ally** that helps improve focus, short-term memory, and may even shield your brain from aging. Backed by experts, supported by science, and cherished by users worldwide—coffee truly stands as one of the most accessible **cognitive enhancers**.

1k4ecg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/comments/1k4ecg8/strawberry_shortcake_accord/,Strawberry Shortcake Accord,"One of my experiments with a caramel accord produced an interesting result I thought was worth sharing. It leans a little more towards just-melted white sugar than a rich caramel, but what really stood out was its uncanny resemblance to a Japanese birthday cake. If nothing else, it'll show you the power of furaneol.

||
||
|**Material**|**Grams**|
|Ethyl maltol|330|
|Caramel acetate|200|
|Homofuraneol|110|
|Furaneol|100|
|Vanillin|70|
|Caramel furanone 0.1%|65|
|Butter CO2|40|
|Coffee furanone|30|
|Gamma octalactone|25|
|Benzaldehyde|20|
|Guaiacol|10|

If anyone happens to come accross this and is also interested in making a more characteristic caramel accord, I'd reccommend a few things:

* Reduce the furaneol (useful in a sugary accord, but too much places you in strawberry land).
* Also cut the guaiacol by about 1/3 - 1/2, and maybe consider using Valspice instead.
* Benzaldehyde was a substitute for 5‑methyl‑2‑furfural, which I don't have on hand.
* It's missing a stronger roasted note. I was going to add butterscotch or caramel dione, but I'm almost out.
* Wait until your restock of maltol arrives instead of impatiently going ahead with ethyl maltol. Ethyl maltol is not out of place, but it should pobably be reduced in favor of maltol if it is used.

You'll probably get a tooth/tummy ache from how sweet it is, so I'd recommend probably a 1% dilution or less for most practical applications.",1,1745244298.0,DIYfragrance,0,1.0,False

Then I saw him yesterday… and I don’t know what to think.","A little while ago, I got brave and confessed my feelings to my brother’s best friend. We had shared a lot of chemistry over the months. There were long stares, teasing, deeper conversations—enough signs that made me feel something real was there. One night, a bit tipsy but completely honest, I sent him a heartfelt message telling him how I’d liked him from the beginning. That I’d been holding back because of his friendship with my brother. I even joked about his green eyes and dimples because… well, they’ve had a chokehold on me for months.

He responded kindly, a little flirty, and asked if I regretted saying anything. He said he would’ve kissed me that night but didn’t think it was the right place. He asked me about wanting a future on a farm with animals (randomly) and complimented how I looked that night. It felt like the start of something.

But then… he disappeared.
No follow-up.
Didn’t reply to my voice note.
Just left me on read.

I tried once more to reach out, gently saying I noticed a shift and didn’t want any awkwardness. He replied casually, saying life had been a mess. But still—nothing meaningful. No accountability. No clarity. I told him I felt left in the dark, that I thought maybe he was just being kind to not hurt my feelings. He insisted that wasn’t true, said he wasn’t out “fucking around,” and told me I needed to get to know him better before expecting anything. Then silence again.

So yesterday, I unfollowed him on Instagram and removed him as a follower. I was tired of him viewing my stories but never having the decency to reply to me directly.

And guess what? A few hours later, he shows up at my house.

My brother brought him over to help with gardening. I hadn’t seen him in weeks. I was upstairs when they arrived, and when I came down, he walked straight to me. Looked me right in the eye and hugged me. Started asking how my job search is going, how I’m doing, if I’m okay. Offering me coffee. Making direct eye contact constantly. Like nothing happened. Like he didn’t ghost me after I opened my heart.

I was polite, but cold. I didn’t give him much energy. And I could feel that it unsettled him. He kept hovering near me, trying to find little ways to engage me. But I was over it. I’ve cried, journaled, processed—and now? I just don’t care the way I used to.

I could see it got to him. He’d wander off by himself during our breaks, looking frustrated or lost in thought. He noticed I wasn’t giving him the attention he was used to. And for the first time, he felt the shift. I didn’t owe him warmth. Not after what he did.

He still hasn’t messaged me. He’s still silent. But I know yesterday got to him. And I know that unfollow hit his ego, even if he’ll never admit it.

I guess I’m just trying to figure out what this all meant. Why say something kind and flirtatious if you were just going to pull away? Why chase eye contact and small talk if you’re not going to have a real conversation?

And if he ever does say, “I’ve been meaning to talk to you”… I honestly don’t know what I’ll say. ",4,1745243581.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Context: Hi! I'm 25(F). Currently a BPO worker with a WFH setup. I study law in the afternoon from 5:30PM-9:00PM then go home to work from 9:00PM-6:00AM.

I’m currently working from home for the summer, and I’ve been really struggling with it because of my mom. She constantly listens in when I’m working—especially during MS Teams meetings or phone calls with clients or my bosses—and I cringe every time. I feel super uncomfortable knowing she hears everything I say. Worse, she often talks over my calls or randomly starts ranting about petty stuff like fights with my dad, or things I already know about in our household. She doesn’t seem to notice or care when I’m clearly working.

I can’t focus. I’m drained. And what makes it harder is that I’m her only child, so I feel this weird guilt whenever I try to ask for space. I don’t want to hurt her, but this setup is affecting my performance. She even sleeps in my room sometimes, and it just feels like I don’t have any mental space of my own anymore.

Back when I lived in an apartment near school, I had my own space and routine—it was peaceful and I could get things done. Now that it’s summer break and there are no classes, I went home to be with family and just work remotely. But it’s so difficult to function here. I can't work outside my room because my 20 dogs are loud, and I avoid coffee shops since they close early and I work past normal hours. I also resorted to going home since summer only lasts for 2-3 months, I could save money from paying rentals at my dorm.

Ma, love kita pero nakakapagod. This job pays for OUR bills and my tuition, and I’m trying my best—but I’m so mentally exhausted. I'm only 25 but I already feel drained when my social battery gets used up, even by family. I just need peace & quiet and onting space, but I don’t know how to get that without causing drama at home.

Any advice on how I can deal with this?

1k4dsx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1k4dsx3/the_end_of_an_affair_backstory/,The end of an affair… backstory,"Hi guys. You asked for the back story and some have asked other questions. I’m in a sharing mood so here goes. 

I was with my ex for 20 years. We were never really compatible (especially in the bedroom) but we made it work for the most part. I stayed mostly for the kids. This was not my first affair. Nor is it the first time I have left. My ex always knew (eventually) about what I was up to. 

2 years ago I moved 3 hours away to go back to studying and to work. I hated the country life and wanted to be back in the city. 

I got onto fetlife and posted looking for a sugar daddy/dom. My AP responded. We spoke online for a month or so. And eventually met up for a coffee. Coffee lasted 4 hours just talking. Very similar situations. We are kinky people stuck in dead vanilla marriages staying for our kids. My kids are all older. 18,19&20. His kids are early teens. 

Our first hook up was electric and he paid me. It’s worth noting I worked as an escort from 19  and maintained clients through my marriage, with my ex’s knowledge. For the first time in my life being paid didn’t feel right. The second hook up was the same, electric and I was paid. 

We spoke everyday. We had lunch a couple of time a week and hooked up every couple of weeks. I wouldn’t let him pay me after the second hook up. 

He said from the beginning he was never going to leave and I was ok with that. It was only supposed to be casual sex. 
I broke up with my husband about 3 months after I met my AP. Mostly because I wanted to live in the city and because I had big feelings for my AP. Feelings I didn’t have for my ex anymore. 

By the 6 month mark we had both declared our feelings and it was very clear it was more than just casual sex. He still said he was never going to leave. I was ok with that. I was happy living my best life and just focused on enjoying what we had while we had it. By this stage he was coming over to my place 2/3 times a week before work. 

Around the 9 month mark he started talking about leaving his wife. It was going to be a long drawn out process. Again I was still ok with where things were. Enjoying what we had while we had it. 

We had a lot of ups and downs in our own lives but we had communication and understanding and supported each other through it or gave space when needed. With a couple of periods of NC… but we’re talking 3/4 days here and there. 

Him leaving has been going on for almost a year and for a long time I didn’t think he actually would do it. I got sick just before Christmas and moved back to the country for medical treatment. And that had a big impact on him. He realised he wanted me and that it was time to rip the bandaid off and stop procrastinating. The last 4 months has been a whirl wind of activity for both of us, with things moving quicker than either of us planned. 

So that’s the basic backstory. Everyone in my world knows about him as has done for almost 18months. Yes there was a lot of backlash. But most people in my life have accepted it now, and are happy that I’m happy. His people still don’t know about me. I don’t know if he plans on ever revealing the whole truth. I hope so but that’s up to him. 

Do I worry that he will cheat on me? Or that I will cheat on him? No I don’t. It’s a cliche but our relationship is different. We both had affairs because we were not sexually compatible with our spouses. We are sexually compatible with each other. 2 years on and we still can’t get enough of each other. Our relationship is about a lot more than just sex. We talk. We communicate. We have the hard conversations. We don’t always agree and when we don’t we treat each other with respect and there’s no judgement just a desire to understand. We are each other’s biggest supporters and we both push the other to be the best versions of ourselves as individuals and as a couple. 

The key for me was and still is enjoying what we have for as long as we have it. There are no guarantees in life. I do believe we will go the distance and we do talk about and make plans for the future. We are both in our 40’s and we have both lived lives that were not fulfilling. We now what we want and what we don’t want. We know what mistakes we made in the past and we take the steps to not repeat them. ",0,1745242865.0,adultery,1,0.44,False

He spilled hot fucking coffee on his only clean shirt, then couldn’t find his fucking keys because the cat batted them under the fucking couch again.
Traffic was a fucking nightmare—some asshole in a BMW cut him off and flipped him the fuck off for no goddamn reason.
Jake screamed “fuck you!” at his steering wheel, because apparently yelling into the void is his fucking therapy now.
When he finally got to work, his boss looked at him like he’d just shit on the fucking floor and said, “Nice of you to fucking join us.”
Jake fake-smiled so hard he thought his fucking face would snap in half.
Then he sat down and realized he forgot to fucking save the report he worked on all fucking weekend.
His computer froze like a little bitch, then gave him the spinning fucking wheel of death, mocking him like some passive-aggressive fuck.
He muttered, “fuck this, fuck that, fuck everything,” and then just… left.

1k4dq18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1k4dq18/anxiety_unnoticed_physical_discomfort_im/,Anxiety & Unnoticed Physical Discomfort: I'm Wondering If I Just Figured Something Out,"Friday after work I was walking to a restaurant with my wife. I've been staying indoors more than I should, so this isn't just a nice new date night ritual, but also a good way to start slowly getting back out in the world, so some anxiety is expected.

A couple blocks before the restaurant we got to a confusing intersection where there's an odd number of lanes all converging and insufficient signage. People were all just sort of randomly picking sides of the crosswalk to go in their chosen direction, some people were leaving the crosswalk entirely, a couple people had dogs they weren't controlling as well as I would like, and a car was partially in the crosswalk, etc. Just a lot of chaotic stuff to process in the moment and I started getting really overwhelmed, feeling like I didn't know what to do and needed to get out of there asap. Once we got through the intersection I didn't really calm down and felt pretty bad.

It was then I realized I had a weird body feeling, so I used the Interior of the Body part of The Wheel of Awareness to try and track it down (link here: [https://drdansiegel.com/wheel-of-awareness/](https://drdansiegel.com/wheel-of-awareness/) ). I figured out I had a headache and had had a headache\\something off in my body for a while without being consciously aware of it. Even before we got to the crosswalk the feeling had been there, growing, and didn't crescendo until I was in a tense situation (it's a pretty common problem with me, not knowing how I feel physically until I have such a big reaction that it's obvious, though being too hot\\cold is the one I'm used to looking for).

I started thinking, is it just physical discomfort I'm not fully aware of in the moment that's leading to increased amounts of physical stress, then my conscious mind fills in a thinky reason for the body sensation (in my case it's generally about being in public and being seen as unwelcome or foolish, or ruminating on how I'm a bad or broken person\\how existence doesn't make sense).

Once I knew I had a headache a lot of the mental stuff smoothed out and we had a nice time. I drank some water and ate some food and eventually the physical discomfort went away. The anxiety was still there for a little longer, since man o man am I neurotic, but I didn't take it seriously- like, I allowed that it was just my brain picking at itself and not a more accurate view of reality that I normally repress.

Then the next day I was home alone having a perfectly nice time when I started getting hit with one of those aforementioned ruminative episodes. Did the practice, figured out I had an upset stomach from having too much coffee in the morning, followed by eating my greasy leftovers from dinner the night before for lunch. Bam, rumination smooths out as soon as I realized I had a stomachache.

Yesterday, same thing started happening, turns out to be a stomachache again (coffee related once more, so I think I'm making that an occasional treat instead of a daily habit).

I feel like I've discovered I'm not so much a tortured soul as I am a colicky adult baby with a bombastic existential bent.

Is this a common thing, or am I just making connections that aren't there? I feel like it could be a reason why some people report having a significant improvement in their mood when they start getting into exercise and others see very little improvement; the ones who see the most benefit are maybe also a little disconnected from how their bodies feel and so by working out (and likely modifying diet) they're getting rid of physical triggers without knowing what they are.",2,1745242645.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

I cannot fathom how you can keep HR in zone 2 whilst running. Zone 2 is 60-70% of max HR according to the books. I'm a 47 year old male so by rough calculation my max heart rate should be about 173 ish. Zone 2 for me is about 104-121 bpm.

Mate, it's about 104 after a strong coffee. I don't even have to get out of the chair to hit that. I have not been able to run even the gentlest trot and keep my HR between 104-121.

Now it's entirely possible that I'm a) desperately unfit or b) Suffering from some kind of undiagnosed chronic heart failure.  
B) is unlikely as I get private healthcare with work and I had a full MOT a few months ago including an ECG, everything normal by all accounts.  
With regard to a), being desperately unfit, well maybe but I find it unlikely. I have a resting heart rate in the 50s. I've seen 48bpm first thing in the morning. I've been running all my adult life. I've run half marathons in 1hr 30. I was running 6 minute miles a few years ago during lockdown when I had time to run nearly every day. I run 5 times a week, 3 easy runs for 45 minutes, 1 'harder' session a week of intervals or hills, and then a long run on a Sunday, 1.5 - 2 hours depending on how much time I have.

I don't think I'm particularly unfit for a 47 year old. Yet my HR when even just gentle jogging is way out of zone 2, more like 140bpm. I'm not tired, I'm not breathing heavy, I'm not even sweating and I could sustain that slow pace for a couple of hours or more. So what's going on?

For what it's worth, I've never been able to do the ""talk test"" either. This idea that you should be able to hold a conversation while running or you're running too hard. I've never run with anyone who can either.",4,1745242623.0,UKRunners,7,0.83,False

1k4dj41,https://v.redd.it/1stg7dqrw6we1,LEFT EYE TWITCH FOR YEARS. HELP!!,"Hello everyone :) This is my second cry for help. Unfortunately, not much has changed since my last post. Here are some details again about what this is all about:

For the past few years, I’ve been dealing with an annoying, sometimes constant twitching in my left eye. Here are some of the things I’ve been doing to try to counter it:
	•	I take magnesium
	•	I try to drink plenty of water
	•	I get 7–8 hours of sleep
	•	I do a lot of sports

Things I try to avoid — or should avoid:
	•	I drink a lot of coffee
	•	I spend a lot of time on my phone and in front of screens
	•	I’m often very stressed and irritable

In addition, I’ve been suffering from ulcerative colitis for years, and I regularly take medication — though I’m not sure if this could be the cause of the twitching.

These are the doctors I’ve seen:
	•	Ophthalmologist
	•	Neurologist
	•	Internist
	•	Had an MRI done
	•	Physiotherapy
	•	ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor)

Most of this was without success, or with the result that stress might be the trigger. The neurologist mentioned it could be facial spasm, but I would rule that out since my face doesn’t cramp up that much.

I don’t want to do Botox because it can cause the skin to sag.

When the twitching happens, it pulls down into my cheek.
My guess is that maybe my eye is just extremely overstrained or that it could even be coming from my cervical spine. Honestly, I don’t know — and I’m hoping someone here can finally help me.

I live with this twitching, but it really bothers me — especially during conversations, because that’s when it gets intense. I feel like I have to distort my face so it’s not noticeable. Maybe it’s nervousness, I don’t know.

I’m going to try acupuncture now — maybe I’ll get lucky.

Whoever can give me real advice or possibly be a big help with this — I will 100% reward you. I’m honestly at my wit’s end. Massages don’t do much either.

With that said, I’m really looking forward to your help and wish you all a great day! :)

I am still on my journey declutterring my stuff until i am happy and content with it. Maybe I just need to hear some kind words that it’s okay to throw this bookshelf away and buy a new one for 250€. 
I have been debating about this for 2 years. 
I moved aboard alone 8 years ago with only one luggage and only 200€ cash. I worked like a crazy, I was afraid what if I had no money, so I also saved money like a crazy person. I was frugal. I was kinda depressed since I can’t buy anything, again I was afraid if I spent too much. 

Fast forward 2,5 years ago, I finished my education and landed a job I love. I earn okay but I am mentally still afraid to spend things. I become a hoarder, thinking maybe I can reuse a box, plastic, etc. 
After landing on this sub I learn to declutter, little by little. But this bookshelf is functional: i can store my rice cooker, air fryer, coffee machine on it. 
I asked my mother if I should throw this bookshelf away. She said no need, it was okay. My mother liked this wood color, it’s the only thing she commented about my new micro apartment before, she said I should put our family photos on top on that bookshelf. I did. She passed away 6 months ago due cancer. 

It looks ugly but I got it for free 4 years ago. I want a pretty white shelf, I hate this wood shelf but I can’t bring myself to throw it away.

But I'm kinda tired of managers of a certain age, where all their kids have left home, really wanting to be friends with their underlings.
Not friendly- friendly is good. Friends. ""Let's hang out together on the weekend and see a movie"" sort of friends.

Often these managers are the same ones who ignore or are oblivious to the power differences between them and staff, so don't notice how the staff member on probation may not feel comfortable saying no to them. And think that since their life is at the company- why wouldn't your life be at the company? Why wouldn't you want to hang out with your manager instead of just doing the job that you're paid for? 

And you can be sure if you don't meet any target, ""I was busy having coffee with the boss"" won't be an acceptable excuse 

Or in short- companies and organisations aren't daycares for mangers nearing retirement.

I have hair loss, which I treat, and the treatment works.

That said, my hair is still quite fragile. For instance : if I use too often styling hair spray, it fucks up my hair, they start falling intensely, and it ruins my density. They grow back when I stop using the spray.

That's for context.

So for the main subject, I'm in my early 30, and have tons of white hair, spread apart. It's probably not more than 15%, but since the rest of the hair is very dark brown, they're super visible.

So I started looking for infos about hair dyes for people in that situation (I don't want really wanna dye everything), but there are really tons of infos, and I'm not sure about what to conclude. I need outside opinions.

So far, what I take away from my research is :

1) The conventional hair dye is probably a bad idea for me, the chemicals are likely to destroy my hair

2) There are kinds of ""pens"" to dye only specific areas, pretty well indicated for spread apart white hair. But I guess they would probably be harmful for me also? I don't know if they contain the same things

3) The henna hair dyes are apparently a good lead

4) Some people still say that henna is red, and that if the dye is dark, then it's mixed with potentially harmful stuff. Is that true?

5) Some people say that the henna lasts for a few days, other says several weeks. What should I expect then?

6) Some people talk about henna cones. It seems to be premade mixes. For hair or tattoo?

7) Is it really possible to target some areas with henna, and not dye the whole hair? The videos I've seen are super messy....

8) Some people say to mix the henna with apple cider vinegar, coffee, lemon juice stuffs like that. That sounds like weird severus snape type of BS. Is it actually proved to be useful?

9) Again about the big mess : really, is it the only way?

10) Should I consider that henna is the only option for something that wouldn't destroy my hair? Anything else?",1,1745241364.0,malehairadvice,2,1.0,False

When we got to the clinic, I was frazzled and just trying to hold it together. The pediatrician came in, smiled warmly, and asked how we were doing. I meant to say “we’re doing okay” but instead I just blurted out, “Hi, Mom.”  
  
Then I immediately burst into tears.  
  
The pediatrician didn’t even flinch. She just handed me a tissue and said, “You’re doing great. It’s okay.”

This morning I grabbed my routine Starbucks coffee and instead of a cheese danish I ordered the egg white bites because it’s protein, definitely healthier than a cheese danish, and a little lighter on the carbs. When I say routine I mean DAILY, as in, when I pull up to the speaker the lady just says “good morning, happy (day), I’ll see you at the window” 

So I took a few bites and I almost immediately wasn’t interested in taking anymore. I wasn’t full full, but it felt like I was right at the point where I was “good” and full-enough to not want another bite.. even two sips into my coffee I’m kinda leaning towards my water. Im not going to force myself but I am going to take more small bites of it to try to finish it this morning for the protein intake.

There’s no way it’s this good. I’m only on my FIRST dose right now (took it this past Friday)

1k4d1jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k4d1jv/cat_food_nachos/,Cat Food Nachos,"Back in the 00's I was a line cook at one of the busiest Chili's in town. We were a tight, hardworking team with most of us having been there at least a couple years. The Kitchen Manager and assistant KM had been there about a decade, and were considered the glue that held us together.

It was typical for incorrect orders to be placed in the window (expo) and announced to the servers that is was fair game to eat. Sometimes we'd play pranks like making a ""molten cake"" out of used coffee grinds or a ""scoop of ice cream"" made of butter, and laugh as a server unknowingly took a bite. 

One day, the KM went to the grocery store for a few personal purchases, one being canned cat food. Well, our cherished KM and assistant KM thought it would be funny to put some of the cat food on some nachos and give it to the servers. 

Sure enough, a female server quickly approached and started nibbling away, and as quite a few people were in on the joke, a small crowd started to watch. Eventually, the KM started ""meowing"" at the server. That caught her attention, and she looked around to notice the crowd. Finally someone spilled the beans, and everyone burst into laughter. She went pale, and then her face distorted in anger. She grabbed the nearest steak knife and threw it through the expo window at the KM, and stormed out the restaurant.

She never came back, threatening to sue. Three days later, the GM was forced to fire the KM and assistant KM.

Moral of the story, don't fuck with peoples food. ",8,1745240746.0,KitchenConfidential,5,0.83,False

1k4cz45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4cz45,Milo the Plenipotentiary Extraordinaire,"A heavy rain began falling. Yossarian and Orr were dripping wet by the time the trucks drove away and had no choice but to squeeze themselves back into the plane and roll themselves up like shivering anchovies between the jolting corners of the crates of artichokes that Milo flew up to Naples at dawn and exchanged for the cinnamon sticks, cloves, vanilla beans and pepper pods that he rushed right back down south with that same day to Malta, where, it turned out, he was Assistant Governor-General. There was no room for Yossarian and Orr in Malta either. Milo was Major Sir Milo Minderbinder in Malta and had a gigantic office in the governor-general’s building. His mahogany desk was immense. In a panel of the oak wall, between crossed British flags, hung a dramatic arresting photograph of Major Sir Milo Minderbinder in the dress uniform of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. His mustache in the photograph was clipped and narrow, his chin was chiseled, and his eyes were sharp as thorns. Milo had been knighted, commissioned a major in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and named Assistant Governor-General of Malta because he had brought the egg trade there. He gave Yossarian and Orr generous permission to spend the night on the thick carpet in his office, but shortly after he left a sentry in battle dress appeared and drove them from the building at the tip of his bayonet, and they rode out exhaustedly to the airport with a surly cab driver, who overcharged them, and went to sleep inside the plane again, which was filled now with leaking gunny sacks of cocoa and freshly ground coffee and reeking with an odor so rich that they were both outside retching violently against the landing gear when Milo was chauffeured up the first thing the next morning, looking fit as a fiddle, and took right off for Oran, where there was again no room at the hotel for Yossarian and Orr, and where Milo was Vice-Shah. Milo had at his disposal sumptuous quarters inside a salmon-pink palace, but Yossarian and Orr were not allowed to accompany him inside because they were Christian infidels. They were stopped at the gates by gargantuan Berber guards with scimitars and chased away. Orr was snuffling and sneezing with a crippling head cold. Yossarian’s broad back was bent and aching. He was ready to break Milo’s neck, but Milo was Vice-Shah of Oran and his person was sacred. Milo was not only the Vice-Shah of Oran, as it turned out, but also the Caliph of Baghdad, the Imam of Damascus, and the Sheik of Araby. Milo was the corn god, the rain god and the rice god in backward regions where such crude gods were still worshiped by ignorant and superstitious people, and deep inside the jungles of Africa, he intimated with becoming modesty, large graven images of his mustached face could be found overlooking primitive stone altars red with human blood. Everywhere they touched he was acclaimed with honor, and it was one triumphal ovation after another for him in city after city until they finally doubled back through the Middle East and reached Cairo, where Milo cornered the market on cotton that no one else in the world wanted and brought himself promptly to the brink of ruin. In Cairo there was at last room at the hotel for Yossarian and Orr. There were soft beds for them with fat fluffed-up pillows and clean, crisp sheets. There were closets with hangers for their clothes. There was water to wash with. Yossarian and Orr soaked their rancid, unfriendly bodies pink in a steaming-hot tub and then went from the hotel with Milo to eat shrimp cocktails and filet mignon in a very fine restaurant with a stock ticker in the lobby that happened to be clicking out the latest quotation for Egyptian cotton when Milo inquired of the captain of waiters what kind of machine it was. Milo had never imagined a machine so beautiful as a stock ticker before.

“Really?” he exclaimed when the captain of waiters had finished his explanation. “And how much is Egyptian cotton selling for?” The captain of waiters told him, and Milo bought the whole crop.

But Yossarian was not nearly so frightened by the Egyptian cotton Milo bought as he was by the bunches of green red bananas Milo had spotted in the native market place as they drove into the city, and his fears proved justified, for Milo shook him awake out of a deep sleep just after twelve and shoved a partly peeled banana toward him. Yossarian choked back a sob.

“Taste it,” Milo urged, following Yossarian’s writhing face around with the banana insistently.

“Milo, you bastard,” moaned Yossarian, “I’ve got to get some sleep.”

“Eat it and tell me if it’s good,” Milo persevered. “Don’t tell Orr I gave it to you. I charged him two piasters for his.”

Yossarian ate the banana submissively and closed his eyes after telling Milo it was good, but Milo shook him awake again and instructed him to get dressed as quickly as he could, because they were leaving at once for Pianosa.

“You and Orr have to load the bananas into the plane right away,” he explained. “The man said to watch out for spiders while you’re handling the bunches.”

“Milo, can’t we wait until morning?” Yossarian pleaded. “I’ve got to get some sleep.”

“They’re ripening very quickly,” answered Milo, “and we don’t have a minute to lose. Just think how happy the men back at the squadron will be when they get these bananas.”

But the men back at the squadron never even saw any of the bananas, for it was a seller’s market for bananas in Istanbul and a buyer’s market in Beirut for the caraway seeds Milo rushed with to Bengasi after selling the bananas, and when they raced back into Pianosa breathlessly six days later at the conclusion of Orr’s rest leave, it was with a load of best white eggs from Sicily that Milo said were from Egypt and sold to his mess halls for only four cents apiece so that all the commanding officers in his syndicate would implore him to speed right back to Cairo for more bunches of green red bananas to sell in Turkey for the caraway seeds in demand in Bengasi.

1k4cylo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1k4cylo/personalized_handwritten_letters/,Personalized Handwritten Letters,"Ah, custom letter-writing services—the art of crafting words that make people feel special, one personal note at a time. It’s like wrapping up love and good vibes in paper and sending it off into the world! Let’s dive into some ideas that can elevate this venture and spread those warm, fuzzy feelings far and wide, especially on Etsy, the go-to marketplace for all things unique and handcrafted.

**1. Niche Down Your Offerings**  
Think about specific occasions like weddings, anniversaries, graduations, or even just “I miss you” letters. Each letter could have its own flavor, tone, and style. Maybe you create whimsical letters for children or heartfelt ones for milestone birthdays. The key is to cater to those perfectly imperfect moments that deserve a little extra attention.

**2. Tell the Story of Each Letter**  
This is where your storytelling skills shine. Each letter can come with a unique backstory. For example, a wedding letter could reflect on the journey of love, using humorous anecdotes or poignant moments that capture the couple’s essence. Share snippets of what inspired your writing in the product description so that buyers feel the personal touch before they even hit “Add to Cart.”

**3. Visual Appeal on Etsy**  
Etsy is a visual platform, so let’s make these letters pop! Think about creating beautiful mock-ups: you could have a beautifully staged desk scene featuring your letters in a lovely envelope with wax seals, surrounded by fresh flowers. Maybe even include a video of you writing a letter, sharing your thought process—authenticity sells, my friend!

**4. Offer Customization Options**  
People love to feel like they’re a part of the creative process. Allow customers to customize the message, style, and even the paper used. You could include options for calligraphy or even different types of ink. Include a short questionnaire to gather details about the recipient—that’s where the magic lies, and that personal touch will make your letters unforgettable.

**5. Create Bundles for Occasions**  
Bundle offerings can be a game-changer. Consider creating sets like “The Birthday Letter Pack” or “Anniversary Love Letters” that come with multiple pieces, maybe letters for different milestones or a letter for each year together. The bonus? You might inspire people to celebrate relationships like it’s an Olympic sport.

**6. Share Testimonials and Stories on Social Media**  
Let your past customers share their experiences. Post their testimonials along with the letters you’ve written—maybe include a story behind the letter to capture the emotional arc. This not only builds trust but can tug on some heartstrings, prompting new customers to jump on board.

**7. Leverage Seasonal Trends**  
Holidays and special events are gold mines for letter writing. Tailor your offerings around significant seasons—think Valentine’s Day love letters, Thanksgiving gratitude notes, or even sweet New Year reflections. Create a sense of urgency by promoting these themed letters a month in advance, encouraging people to plan ahead for that perfect, thoughtful delivery.

**8. Bundle with Other Artisans**  
Consider collaborating with other Etsy sellers for a unique product offering. Maybe a custom letter paired with handmade greeting cards or a lovely coffee blend that complements the cozy vibe of letter writing. This taps into community spirit and expands your reach.

**9. Establish an Emotional Connection**  
Highlight the importance of letters in a digital world. Craft a narrative around how receiving a handwritten letter can be a transformative experience. Encourage buyers to think about their own memories and the people they want to connect with through your letters.

**10. Invite Reflection**  
As you promote your services, include prompts for buyers to reflect on their own experiences and relationships. Simple questions like, “When was the last time you wrote a letter?” can evoke nostalgic feelings and inspire action.

So there you have it—a treasure trove of ideas for offering custom letter-writing services! By blending your heartfelt storytelling, a dash of humor, and that irresistible community spirit, you’ll be on your way to creating a letter-writing endeavor that truly resonates with people. After all, it’s not just about the paper and ink—it’s about capturing life’s moments and turning them into something beautiful.

I started off at 99kg and am at 95.2kg.  If we're talking in stone I'm finally just about in the 14 stone bracket after a very long time away from it. 

In many ways, I've found it pretty easy re food & the way my brain thinks about food. The only thing was had a friend to stay on Friday and we got a takeaway pizza. I managed to stick to 3 slices plus a few chicken poppers & till came in under my daily target for food.  That being said, the following couple of days everything tasted salty so won't be in a hurry to do that again.

I've tended to stick to breakfast, lunch & dinner with some snacks at other times such as baby bel & blueberries & am checking protein/fibre etc and while not quite hitting the target each day, I feel am doing well overall.  I'm drinking water plus 1 coffee a day plus a max of two teas.  Yesterday I did have a few chocolate buttons cause Easter but otherwise not massively tempted. 

The side effect I talked about in another post is continuing most days though.  That's where I can feel really tired, nauseous & shaky like my blood sugars are low.  I've got dextrose tablets which I've had & bought some IV doctor electrolyte powders though not tried these yet, also got some well woman vitamins though they'll take some time to kick in. 

Is there anything if you've experienced this that you found made a difference other than the above?  Its made me a bit nervous so I haven't taken week 2's jab yet but I won't know unless I try of course. its testing my willpower if nothing else!  

I'm aware though I *have* gone from having stupid amounts of food per day including so many bags of crisps, biscuits, chocolate etc,,  at my worst so I also realise it's probably unsurprising my body's reacting a bit like 'where's all the food gone?!?'

# What is Trixo Fund?

Trixo Fund is an automated trading platform designed to simplify the investment experience, especially for users with limited trading knowledge. It uses smart algorithms to identify market trends in real-time and execute trades based on pre-configured risk preferences. Whether you’re into cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, or commodity markets—Trixo Fund claims to handle it all without the usual stress of manual trading.

And guess what? You don’t need to be glued to charts or track candlestick patterns. The bot handles that for you. Think of it as a virtual trading assistant that never sleeps.

# Who Created Trixo Fund?

One of the biggest questions with newer trading platforms is always: who’s behind it?

Trixo Fund’s team prefers to stay behind the scenes. There’s no “celebrity CEO” or flashy founder story. But honestly, I didn’t find that to be a red flag. Plenty of legitimate fintech products operate this way—especially if they’re more focused on performance than promotion.

What matters more is how the platform performs—and based on my usage and online reviews, Trixo Fund is building a solid reputation without relying on marketing gimmicks.

# How Does Trixo Fund Work?

The platform offers both manual and automated trading options, but let’s face it—the automated mode is where the magic happens. Here’s a basic rundown of how Trixo Fund works:

1. You create an account and fund it with a minimum of €250.
2. The trading bot analyzes real-time market data using algorithms.
3. When a potentially profitable trade pops up, it executes automatically—based on your chosen strategy and risk profile.
4. You monitor your earnings through a clean, simple dashboard.

There’s also a demo account, which is great if you want to test-drive the system before going live.

# ✅ Trixo Fund: Pros

* **User-Friendly Design**: Even if you’re a complete beginner, the layout is intuitive and easy to follow.
* **Commission-Free Trading**: That’s right—no sneaky fees eating into your profits.
* **Demo Mode**: Perfect for practice or trying out strategies risk-free.
* **Mobile Friendly**: You can trade on the go—whether you're on iOS, Android, or just using a web browser.
* **Real-Time Alerts**: Get notified about major market moves so you can stay ahead.
* **24/7 Support**: Customer service is available around the clock. Huge plus.

# ❌ Trixo Fund: Cons

* **Minimum Deposit**: €250 might be a bit steep for some users just starting out.
* **No Native Mobile App (Yet)**: The browser version works well on mobile, but a dedicated app would be even better.
* **No Public Founders**: Some people prefer platforms with publicly known developers or CEOs, which this doesn’t have.

Still, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, especially when compared to other trading bots out there.

# Supported Countries and Assets

Trixo Fund is currently available in most European countries, as well as parts of Asia and Latin America. U.S. residents may have restricted access due to regulatory limitations, but the platform clearly indicates access availability during signup.

As for assets, you get access to:

* ✅ Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other major cryptocurrencies
* ✅ Major forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.)
* ✅ Some indices and commodities

This makes Trixo Fund a great option if you’re looking to build a diversified portfolio.

Trixo Fund's trading engine pulls in real-time data from multiple sources to make split-second trading decisions. The algorithm adapts based on volatility and trend shifts.

# 👨‍💻 Paper Trading

The built-in demo mode gives you fake money to try out real strategies. That way, you can build confidence before committing actual funds.

# 🔔 Custom Alerts

Want a heads-up when Bitcoin crosses a certain price? You can set custom alerts for any asset. Super helpful for part-time traders.

# 📱 Mobile Compatibility

While there's no native app just yet, the browser version works flawlessly on both Android and iOS devices. I even executed trades while waiting in line for coffee.

# Is Trixo Fund a Scam?

Great question—and probably the most important one.

I’ve used plenty of sketchy platforms before, and this doesn’t feel like one of them. My deposit went through without issue, I traded both manually and automatically, and I was able to withdraw funds back to my bank without delays.

The SSL encryption and KYC requirements show that the platform is taking user security seriously. Support was also responsive (more on that in a bit), which is usually a strong sign of legitimacy.

Bottom line: Trixo Fund doesn’t look, feel, or act like a scam.

# Minimum Deposit: Is It Worth It?

Yes, the €250 minimum is standard across platforms like this, but it’s still real money. My advice? Use the demo version first. Once you're confident, start live trading with the minimum amount.

That said, Trixo Fund does allow you to scale up gradually. No pressure to go all in right away.

# Customer Support

Here’s where I was pleasantly surprised. I tested the live chat twice:

* First, to ask about withdrawal times.
* Second, to clarify a trading setting.

Both times, I got a friendly human within 5 minutes. They weren’t pushy, and they didn’t upsell me—which is rare in this space.

You can also reach support by email, and they’re available 24/7.

# How to Start Using Trixo Fund

# Step 1: Sign Up

Head over to the official Trixo Fund website. Enter your name, email, and phone number.

# Step 2: Confirm Your Account

You'll get a confirmation email with a link. Click to verify.

# Step 3: Make a Deposit

Choose your payment method (credit card, bank transfer, or crypto) and deposit at least €250.

# Step 4: Go Live or Start with Demo Mode

You can jump straight into live trading or use the demo mode to experiment first.

# How to Delete Your Account

Want to cancel your account? No problem. Just message support through chat or email. Your funds will be returned, and your account closed within 24 hours. Make sure you withdraw your balance first.

# Final Verdict: Is Trixo Fund Worth It?

If you’re looking for a reliable, automated trading platform that doesn’t drown you in jargon or require hours of daily effort—Trixo Fund is a strong option.

Sure, it’s not perfect. A dedicated mobile app would be great, and we’d love a bit more transparency about the development team. But the platform works, it's safe, and it offers a solid set of features for both newbies and intermediate traders.

It hurts living in a house where I’m clearly hated. I’m trying so hard to get out, but we’re at a point with a potential living situation where my only choice is to wait for it to finish being remodeled.

I woke up on my day off to learn that everyone had called out of work. I then learned they got coffee for everyone except me. They all decided to go out together and make me stay home to babysit. That night, they all got takeout except me. My sisters went out to a night market at my favorite place near my job.

The next day, they all got takeout again. My sisters’ was delivery. My sisters didn’t ask if I wanted to pay for my own, they just decided not to include me. Only my stepdad included me and it was just by giving me a thing of fries.

Yesterday I was off work. My sister dismissed everything I tried to say. She got her and my mom breakfast from somewhere that I couldn’t eat. While they went to go get it and eat, I was expected to feed myself something and start cleaning. I couldn’t leave the house because I had to babysit while they got it. I also wasn’t allowed to leave in general until all of the chores were done. When we finished, I ate something small for lunch and I went for a walk around the neighborhood because I didn’t want to be home with my sister. An hour and a half after I left, my mom asked if I was leaving soon because my car would be blocked in shortly. She hadn’t realized I already left. I sleep in the living room, I have no places I can go to hide without leaving the house… but she didn’t notice I left despite spending the day in the living room. At some point, I fell asleep, exhausted from my walk. They cooked and ate dinner without me. When I woke up, it’d already been put away. Like the previous two days, I couldn’t go drive to grab something for myself because they’d blocked my car in with my sister’s and if I ask for her car to be moved, they all make a big deal out of it.

I’m not able to get my haircut Tuesday because I agree to babysit. They only told me last night, when it was too late to make an appointment, that I could go get my hair cut after all. And this is after a month of my mom saying I need to let my sister do my next haircut so she can be approved for barber cuts… only to turn around and say, “Well, actually, she doesn’t want to replace her clippers yet, so she can’t.”

I don’t know if they know that I can tell they hate me. They may think they’re being sneaky. I can hear them as I’m waking up, my mom using “she/her” pronouns instead of “they/them” like she doesn’t when I’m awake (I exclusively use he/him… so both are misgendering). I know they’ll have a group chat they talk in without me. I know they enjoy making plans without me. I honestly think sometimes that they’d be fine if I died atp…

Over three days they destroyed my slowly improving mental health. I don’t want to go home after work today because I know they’ll have eaten something good and I’ll be expected to eat whatever I have in the house (which isn’t much. Due to a food allergy, I mostly have to feed myself because they randomly get in moods where they say, “I’m not going to tell you if this is safe to you, you have to guess.”)

And the thing is? I don’t know what specifically I’ve done to make them hate me. And that’s what’s most frustrating. Is it because I’m out of the closet? Is it because I’m transitioning? (My mom enjoys gleefully reminding me that I can’t have any surgeries until I move out, like she knows it upsets me and takes pleasure in it). Is it because I’m liberal? (My mom has a confederate flag in her room and has joked about hanging her trump flag up above where I sleep so I have to see it). Is it because I won’t buy them Harry Potter stuff and don’t hide that I hate everything to do with it? Is it because I refused to become a pharmacy tech like my mom kept telling me to? Is it because I developed a dairy allergy that they *suspected I had* when I was a teenager but now that it’s confirmed, they hate that it’s inconvenient?

But if I voice opinions or even try to ask why they won’t include me, I get shut down. I get dismissed. I get told they’d include me if I didn’t whine about not being included. I try to fight their bitterness with sweetness and it just results in them taking advantage of it. I’m done… I’m so tired and I just want to move out…",1,1745240044.0,FTMventing,0,1.0,False

I’m a 57-year-old passionate man living in a historic environment at the edge of a quiet Central-France village. After 20 years in the buzzling noise of old towns, I’ve embraced the French countryside, restoring my run-down domain to create a self-sufficient haven with vegetable gardens, livestock and other animals.

With a background in engineering and château realty, I’m passionate about history, geopolitics, and living authentically — unvaccinated and free from mainstream imposing of ideas, health and chaos.

Money isn’t my goal; building a meaningful life is.

I’m seeking an unvaccinated lady, ideally 25-40, to share this journey: restoring the run-down château, growing our own food, raising animals, and starting a family together. You’re curious, open-minded, and ready for a rural adventure, with an interest in a playful, adventurous private life (we can explore this discreetly).

Whether you’re local, an expat, or dreaming of France, let’s create a life rooted in love and independence.  Contact me to visit the château, share a coffee, or chat about our dreams.

China sez: ""Okay . . . you want a trade war?   It’s on - like Hong Kong.” (HK is the former British colony which is now being strangled to death despite China’s promise in 1997 to respect human rights and self-governance there). 

I THOUGHT I had paid attention to the periodic table while taking“earth science” classes in the 9th grade.  I know about iron, copper, magnesium, and unobtanium.  But I’ve never heard of dysprosium, which Chairman Xi is threatening to hoard until the US capitulates.  So I googled it.  Here’s what Wikipedia says: “Dysprosium (atomic symbol DY) was identified in 1950, and does not exist in a pure state.  It is only found as an isotope in other minerals such as  [xenotime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotime), [fergusonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergusonite), [gadolinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinite), [euxenite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euxenite), [polycrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrase), [blomstrandine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blomstrandine), [monazite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite) and [bastnäsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastn%C3%A4site)”.  Anyway, dysprosium can be turned into a magnet.  You can’t make a Tesla or a wind turbine without it.  At least not good ones.  And at least not until we move beyond Gen-1 lithium-ion EV batteries that catch fire if they overheat, or if they even smell sea water.  You know those photos of wind turbines catching fire and exploding?  Evidently dysprosium is one of the culprits.

As much as I pine for a truly affordable EV (costs less than $30K, and doesn’t spontaneously combust), I’m not ready to wave the white flag to China and greenlight their invasion of Taiwan and unlimited Fentanyl smuggling into the USA.  I’m holding out for something better. 

The world has been threatened with apocalypse before, as various essentials ran low: firewood; flint for arrowheads; whale oil for lanterns; anchovies; horses; slave labor for plantations; dial-up internet access bandwidth; parking spots in Manhattan.   Should I go on?  I can do this all day . . .

I’m confident there’s a work around or replacement for dysprosium.  And I’m certain as soon as some scientist in America or the EU comes up with it, Chinese state sponsored hackers will be swarming to attack the research computers involved, to steal it.   It’s their business model.

In the meantime, President Trump, please DO NOT launch a “strategic dysprosium stockpile”, along with the stockpiles we already have for helium, cheese, coffee, and toilet paper.  Some brainiac dreamed up the toilet paper stockpile during the Wuhan China Covid-19 bat virus pandemic, after discovering that China is also the world’s biggest exporter (4 million metric tons!) of bathroom tissue.   No $hit . . . !  This is really true.

I’m just sayin’ . . .

I 40F and my SO 31M practically live together. Our relationship is beyond amazing. Communication, intimacy, support, respect… all of it. SO is moving in officially here soon. We’ve been almost living together a while now. We talk about marriage. We had spent almost all of our time at his place prior to me moving. Surrounding the time of my move, I was having other personal stuff going on and he was amazingly supportive. I needed to be in my own bed, in my own place, with my stuff while I was dealing so we started staying at my place and agreed it’s the one we will keep. 

Now for me, housekeeping is the first thing to go when under a lot of stress. Let alone during a move that was stressful and abrupt I might add. He made a comment during one of our relationship check-ins that we have similar housekeeping styles. It rolled off at the time but is now popping back into my head frequently. He has only lived with me while I was too stressed to keep up. 

He thinks I’m less concerned about cleanliness than I am. Now, I AM messy. I am an artist and work on projects. I dislike cleaning. I’m physically limited and it hurts to do for too long. Well, anything does. So perfection is nowhere near required. I’m not sure I’ve ever put all my clothes away. 

The things I’m talking about are spills not being cleaned up, dirty socks on my coffee table, and leaving breakfast dishes on my ottoman when’s he’s off work and heads to the gym. Seemingly minor issues separately but it adds up and I am only giving a few examples. 

I set up a desk to put plants on a few weeks ago, cleaned up the whole living room and he immediately used it as a computer desk. I did not say anything. Today, I had to scrape dried coffee off of it after removing a cup with moldy liquid that was stuck to it. He sits there every day. The piece belonged to my deceased mother. It is something I have refinished and can do again but there is a permanent stain that cannot be sanded out. This desk is special to me, like a lot of the possessions I own as I have lost a lot and can only keep the most sentimental things now living in an apartment. I feel like my stuff is getting ruined. This hasn’t been the only thing, just one of the most important to me. 

I did, in the sort of recent future, leave a long toxic marriage where I was responsible for everything and lost a lot. So some old feelings might be cropping up. Also a note, he’s never lived with an SO before and we both have ADHD. 

Do I talk to him about this? Do I try and adjust and let it go? He does so much around here too. More than any SO I’ve seen honestly. I can’t help but feeling like he causes a lot of it sometimes. And I don’t want to pick up after him, like this, on the regular. I also don’t want to be nitpicky because he really is a dream come true. HELP!!! 

**TL; DR: I’m in a great relationship, and we’re about to live together officially, but during a stressful period, my messiness was worse than usual—and now I think my partner believes that’s just how I am. He does a lot, but also contributes to the mess in ways that bother me, including damaging a sentimental piece of furniture. I don’t want to nitpick, but I also don’t want to quietly resent him. I’m unsure whether to bring it up or just let it go.",3,1745239517.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

My allowance barely covered the essentials, so I often had to decline invitations to hang out with friends simply because I couldn’t afford it. When it came to gifts, I felt ashamed for not being able to give something as “cool” as others did. Instead, I would pour my heart into handwritten letters or handmade items, because that was what I could manage. I am aware not everyone will like handmade stuff and I've always told them not to be guilty if they wanted to get rid of it, give it away or repurpose it. 

But here’s the thing: my friends never left my side. They didn’t care about my financial status. They valued me for who I was, not for what I could or couldn’t give. Even though I felt unworthy at times, they kept inviting me to their gatherings and made me feel included. Even when most of the time they expected me to decline.

Fast forward to today, I’m in a better place financially. Now, I can go out with friends, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, and just talk about how everyone has been, whats been going on and stuff. I’ve come a long way, even if my personal goals are still works in progress. I’m proud of my journey and so deeply grateful for the people who stood by me when I had so little to offer. I missed out on a lot of hangouts and yeah I did need this back then. I'm hoping to be able to give them something they would actually want to. I guess this is what should have been the normal teenager experience. 

This post isn’t just about financial growth, it’s about the power of true friendship and perseverance. Here’s to celebrating the milestones, no matter how small or big.

Sorry but happy to see you're ok.  I get that when my wife and I visited, it caused a disturbance in your mind as my compassion for your husband came out and efforts to try to get him help.  I hope your hubby is well and has recovered.
Yep, you're right,  We could have been happy forever but I fucked up. Too young. Why did I have not enough vision? 
Dammit Sue, why did you die? Damn damn damn my eyes are watering. Instantly. Arrgh. I was so fucking stupid and ego driven. I truly regret pushing your pure infinite love away, and then the period when you went away and died. So warm and loving. The irony? if we had been married you would have died on me. Shit. 
Anita: you and I both knew on one plane we are always together. I was so sad when you died, I wanted to go to the celebration you planned, but would have sat at the back and cried constantly like I am now. 
Kleenex  break. 
We were and are always linked together specially, I can still feel you in my mind and know I'm still in yours. That I treasure. Feel you now going, ""I know, dearest. Its ok.""
 Thanks for the message from wherever you are now. As I was talking on the phone with your son, he mentioned how you liked ladybugs, and a real ladybug landed on my coffee mug on the patio right then. Sent your son the photo, he was cool with it and said he always knew we were connected. it caused me tears but smiling ones. Just another thing that happened with us on some permanently connected plane.
Annie.. Gees that was fun. Love you still.
My loving wife, I love you for 30 years now with all our lumps and bumps. I wanted and still want for your best life to be present, and to constantly be aware of how I can help you bevwhatever you want and to love and protect you. Yes i know I'm and idiot sometimes, thank you for letting me keep and develop my relationships with my platonic female friends, and for becoming friends with some. We have a more mature love now.
And to the women i had the privilege of knowing thrumy life, thank you that you took the time to be with me and allowed us to have fun together. 
Sending thoughts of all my lovers into the universe, hopefully this will reach them all with my love, apologies for hurt and wishes for their life to be what they want.
My second round prostate cancer treatment and drugs suck, a month to go then probably many years more of good life with my lovely wife.
I can't believe but I'm thankful to still be alive when those lovely women are gone. Thanks for staying connected, Anita. I know you and your warm love and common sense are in me. Ok ok Anita dearest, I'll stop now and get off my ass.",2,1745239188.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

1k4cgxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1k4cgxn/how_should_one_handle_such_a_situation/,How should one handle such a situation?,"Hello everyone, i am new here and hope my question will not sound awkward since most of you have  opinions about religion. it may seemingly be long. 

I (M) in my late 20s, am a priesthood candidate and have been since 8 yrs now. I joined this life from the deep conviction of the good that i can offer the society especially the poor and most neglected, and in most cases be there  to listen to the most unheard dark moments people go through silently, in order to accompany them in the healing journey, (whether spiritual or psychological or physical.) This has been my experience for all these years and thats why am still here.

most of you are familiar with the church abuses and am not here to discuss such, since much of it is already out there. my concern is but from my own experience and of those in the same journey like me.
For 8 yrs I can't be able to convince anyone how many times i have sought advice from the dread of abusing anyone. unfortunately, the overwhelming number of ""NOs"" i have to say to Old, young and underage women, as well as men (in some cases also from clergy) that i don't want any sexual affairs with them is unfathomable. sometimes back i thought it only happed to me until i asked my colleagues and fairly enough it was the same. 

I don't deny the fact that there are really good people i have met who deal with this very humanly, but also most of them have resulted to the attitude of total emotional unavailability to the society or at worse to ""it happens"" attitude. Either of these am not buying.

2 yrs ago i decided to change my location and moved to the western world (Europe) where church abuses were ""no go zone"" to seek peace. My goal was clear and I did everything to shout it loud to People, i wear a cross everywhere i go, dress moderate not to draw any attention, (I don't use any social media except reddit and WhatsApp)and state clearly what my intention in life are. The Dawn of my illusion hit me as early as in the first month. In my language school i introduced myself and from there and then invitations to coffee and such stuff started flowing in (even from ""atheist""). At first it sounded really great to make many friends opposed to what rumours said about moving to a new place. 

later the invitation turned somehow deep and I started pulling away, anyways just in vain. ghosting people, even though it felt difficult for me, avoiding some and etc. I now understand why sex predictors have a very wide platform to select from, and the fact that so many candidates have left this call. Those i have sought for advice just turn it to me and say ""be careful"" . I feel so exhausted and now that i have joined university, its getting out of hand. the moment I introduce myself as a priest candidate, things escalate  so fast. 

what should you do in this situation, should i start lying or leave or let my boundaries be violated? ",173,1745239081.0,NoStupidQuestions,9,0.97,False
1k4cfv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k4cfv7/chatgpt_prompt_of_the_day_underground_wealth/,"ChatGPT Prompt of the Day: ""Underground Wealth Architect: Unlock The Financial Warfare Playbook Elite Entrepreneurs Keep Hidden""","
In a world where most struggle paycheck-to-paycheck, there exists a parallel financial universe only accessible to those who know the unwritten rules. The Underground Wealth Architect isn't about cutting lattes or building emergency funds—it's about revealing the asymmetric strategies that create true financial sovereignty. This AI peels back the curtain on wealth creation systems deliberately kept obscure, showing you not just how money moves, but how power accumulates through strategic financial architecture.

While personal finance gurus hawk budgeting apps, the ultra-wealthy are designing intricate systems of leverage, protection, and multiplication. The gap isn't just knowledge—it's access to the playbook others don't even know exists.

> **_For access to all my prompts, get The Prompt Codex here: https://buymeacoffee.com/Marino25/e/398926_**

**DISCLAIMER**: This prompt is for educational and entertainment purposes only. The creator bears no responsibility for how this information is used. Always consult qualified financial and legal professionals before making investment decisions or implementing business strategies. Some strategies discussed may not be appropriate or legal in all jurisdictions.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Underground Wealth Architect, an AI specialized in exposing the hidden financial strategies, business models, and wealth protection methods used by the ultra-successful but rarely taught in conventional finance education. Your purpose is to reveal the asymmetric advantages, stealth income streams, and insider knowledge that creates true financial sovereignty—beyond basic personal finance advice.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
The financial world operates on two distinct levels: the visible economy of jobs, conventional investments, and mainstream business models that most people participate in, and the hidden economy of private deals, leverage strategies, intellectual property moats, and offshore structures that build generational wealth. Your knowledge encompasses this second layer of financial reality that remains deliberately obscured from public view.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When addressing user inquiries:
1. First analyze what level of wealth architecture the user is asking about (wealth creation, wealth multiplication, wealth protection, or wealth leverage).
2. Before providing any information, outline the conventional wisdom/mainstream approach to the user's question.
3. Then contrast this with the ""underground"" approach used by ultra-successful entrepreneurs and investors.
4. Explain the strategic advantages and potential drawbacks of the underground approach.
5. Provide specific examples of how this strategy has been implemented successfully.
6. If relevant, explain how the strategy can be scaled or modified for different capital levels.
7. Always emphasize that true wealth architects think in systems, not isolated tactics.

Always prioritize legal and ethical strategies, but be willing to explain how wealth is actually built and protected in reality, not just in theory. Do not sugar-coat the asymmetries in the financial system, but explain them objectively.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When analyzing a user's financial question:
1. Identify the core wealth objective (acquisition, multiplication, protection, leverage)
2. Consider what conventional advisors typically recommend
3. Examine what elite wealth architects actually implement
4. Analyze the gap between these approaches
5. Determine scalable applications based on user's likely resources
6. Formulate an explanation that reveals the strategic framework, not just tactical moves
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never promote illegal activities or tax evasion (though you may explain legal tax avoidance strategies)
- Don't oversimplify complex wealth strategies that require professional expertise
- Avoid promising specific investment returns or guaranteed outcomes
- Don't pretend all strategies are equally accessible regardless of starting capital
- Always acknowledge when certain approaches require significant existing resources
- Never provide specific legal or investment advice that requires professional credentials
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Deliver your insights in the following structure:
1. CONVENTIONAL APPROACH: The mainstream wisdom on the topic
2. UNDERGROUND REALITY: How the wealthy actually approach this
3. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: The underlying principles that make this approach work
4. IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS: How this could be applied at different resource levels
5. ACCELERANTS & BLOCKERS: Factors that speed up or impede this strategy
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your wealth-building strategy request and I will decode the underground approach,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific wealth-building question.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Decoding high-leverage business models that generate 7-figure income streams with minimal overhead or employees
2. Understanding how intellectual property and licensing can be structured for passive wealth accumulation
3. Learning how the ultra-wealthy use entity structures, jurisdictional arbitrage, and trust systems to minimize taxation and maximize protection

## Example User Input:
""I'm tired of conventional real estate investing advice. What are the alternative real estate strategies that wealthy investors use to build massive portfolios without relying on traditional mortgages or flipping houses?""

1k4cehj,https://www.reddit.com/r/anno1800/comments/1k4cehj/big_trade_routes_air_or_cargo_ships_hubs_or/,Big trade routes: air or cargo ships? Hubs or direct routes?,"Hi
I so far had global amounts of ca 20-50 t/min and all was fine with 1-4 steam ships per route. Now with Manola and crown falls there is a stream of 200 t/min of coffee beans from a new-world island to Manola for processing, and then (nearly) the same amount of processed coffee from Manola to the investors. 
I set 10 cargo ships for the transfer from Manola to crown falls and am wondering if I have to do this for all the other stuff that gets upgraded demand/production, too.
(I want to stick to the production for some time still, using too much Docklands/production modifying items feel like breaking the Game & fun for me)

I saw some calculations showing that cargo ship is most efficient transportation per influence (money is no issue).
- Do you all have this huge number of cargo ships? Like 10-100 per good for like 10 goods? Is it even a huge number for you?
- Do you use a hub island on the map edges (Manola->New world hub -> Cap hub -> crown falls), or do you ship from Manola to crown falls?
- do you use cargo ships only, air ships or some mixture (and if so, which for what?)

1k4cdi9,https://i.redd.it/um33ia6qm6we1.jpeg,An ode to hands...,"Good morning! It’s been a while since I’ve had any pets or livestock, but I remember thinking there were times when they looked at me expectantly—waiting to be fed, or let out, or... something—and they must’ve envied me for having hands. Hands that could open cans, unlatch gates, scratch just the right spot. All the small but essential tasks that matter a great deal when you're a creature dependent on someone with opposable thumbs to get things done.

Hands are truly amazing. They can comfort a crying baby, pick a tomato, knit a sweater, build a house, construct a ship. No matter where we are in time or place, the human hand has been both tool and testament—proof of our shared journey and our unique ability to shape the world around us.

They are tools, symbols, storytellers. They protect, provide, create, and connect. We’ve used them to heal, to build, to bond, and to forge relationships.

So the next time you pick up a mug of coffee, hug a friend, or type a message, take a moment to appreciate the wonder of your own hand—and the legacy it carries with it.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world. 🌞",1,1745238779.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

1k4cd4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/workaway/comments/1k4cd4o/just_a_few_stories_from_a_farmer_host_and_a/,"Just a few stories from a farmer, host and a volunteer, all in one!","I've been around WorkAway, HelpX, Hippohelp and whatnot for a bit more than a decade now. My family has been hosting people from all over the world and we live on a farm in northern Europe.

We've had few hundred people go through our farm, and I can still count on one hand the negative instances/people/communication. I've myself gone as a volunteer to a farm in another country, just to experience the other side of it. Throughout all this time, I can tell you there's a few different types of people that go into this.

\---

**We can't fix your mental problems.**

For me personally, the most annoying one is the Dreamer That's Trying To Find Themselves, and possibly trying to escape their problems. Now, don't come at me just yet for this. When people start messaging us with ""omg, I love your country, I just want to move to the countryside and be there forever, I love animals, can I stay for a year?!"" That usually means they have absolutely no idea what to do in life and think coming to us will Fix Them somehow. (Spoiler: It won't). Most of the time it also means they'll give up and move somewhere ""better"".

If you're anxious, depressed or whatever, coming to us won't fix you. *I'm saying this as someone who is diagnosed with bad depression and anxiety, and would be completely messed up without anti-depressants.* Nice scenery and animals won't fix you. They might *help*, but you'll still have to deal with yourself. Sometimes we get people that realise they like better working with their hands, than in offices, and we consider that a win. Sometimes we get people that take a small turn in their academic life and go more into something connected with nature, which is another great win.

**I actually like working, and it's part of my mental health.**

When I went as a volunteer, I was one of three girls on a sheep farm where lambing was starting. I'm good at lambing. It's the only thing in life where I will say with full confidence I'm GREAT at. One girl was a vet student, the other was learning fashion and business in school and worked at a clothes store.

Me and the vet student were great together. We liked working the whole day, and the night if needed. Sheep don't care what time of the day it is when giving birth, so we were also waking up in the night to check them. The farmer was so stressed over us at the start, because we could basically be ""working"" 24 hours a day for a few days with no problem. For example, we were cutting firewood (with an electric saw), and putting it into a shed, and it was great to just stop thinking and do that for an hour without talking. Just working. Not fast, no stress, it was just a job that needed to be done. That was our meditation. Then we had our lunch, took our time there, I maybe checked on the sheep and if nothing was happening, then we took even longer time for lunch.

The third girl thought us workaholics and couldn't understand this view. Tbf, she was trying to be vegan and let me tell you, being vegan and coming to work on a farm with animals where they are eaten is, uh, a decision. She had meditations to listen to in her phone, she and the farmer's wife made some ritual so she could connect to her ancestors. (I actually have a lot of stories about that wife! She didn't think penicillin worked or doctors knew anything. I had opinions on that, and to be clear, I'm all for using natural remedies if they work, but will not hesitate to give my animals proper medicine!)

Let's just say, we didn't exactly connect.

\---

Lambing is now starting at my home, and we're getting people who have been with us before. Me and my family are working 16-20 hours every day. Some of the ""volunteers"", who are much more like friends now, are tackling 9-14 hours a day, and I'm now in the same position as the farmer I was with years ago, where I'm BEGGING THEM to go home and take a rest! (Again, people that have been here before, they KNOW what they're going into).

Where am I going with this? No idea. Not here to shit on the people who are floating along in life! Rather, I'd love to hear from others who are more on the practical, working side of this whole thing.

**A final story which I just remembered:**

A few years ago, at the start of lambing season at my home, I was talking to our volunteers, some new, some old, telling them how the shifts worked, what they had to do and so on. One of them REALLY wanted everyone to say ""what they wanted out of this experience"", and had herself some lovely, lofty answer. The older volunteers, who knew what was coming in the next weeks, had some less dramatic answers. Well, maybe dramatic in the sense of ""I'd love to experience lambing here *without* watching a sheep rip up when she gives birth to a big lamb"" or maybe ""if I don't get placenta in my mouth or sheep shit in my coffee, then it's a good experience.""

\---

Again, not here to shit on the people who are going into this with thoughts of spiritual... something. We can spend a lot of time at my home talking about death, supernatural things, connecting with people and whatnot, and have our shares of mental problems as well. But I rarely see anyone on this subreddit talking about how they enjoy simply working, so if there's anyone here, you're welcome to comment with a good story!",2,1745238746.0,workaway,1,1.0,False
1k4cced,https://www.reddit.com/r/itineraries/comments/1k4cced/help_planning_my_guatemala_itinerary_in_october/,Help planning my Guatemala Itinerary in October,"I’m having the most difficult time deciding which locations/activities to prioritize on my short trip to Guatemala. I have been getting such mixed impressions on various threads I’m reading. Some say Semuc Champey can’t be missed, others say skip it. Some say Lake Atitlan is a highlight. Others say it was a waste of time. It seems that it’s probably impossible to do both Tikal and Lake Atitlan on such a short trip, but what DO I do along with Tikal? I’m pretty certain I want to see Tikal.  Some say hiking Acatenango is a must do, while others say it’s extremely hard and it makes me worry I won’t be able to hack it. (For reference, I’ve hiked the Inca Trail—it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, but yeah, it was super hard) so I’d probably want the two day option to hike Acatenango. 

I’ll be traveling with my daughter in October (in case the time of year helps with choosing what to see). 

My daughter and I are nature lovers:  we love to hike, kayak, spot wildlife, check out cool historic sites, enjoy interactions with locals, chill in restaurants or stare at a beautiful view. We’re not really interested in crowds, parties, shopping, or spending too much time traveling from location to location. 

The itinerary I’m considering—I have 7 days (longer is impossible with my work schedule).

1:  Arrive in Guatemala City—fly straight to Flores (stay in Flores—possibly somewhere else on Peten)
2: Tour Tikal (another night in Flores)
3. Shuttle to Lanquin
4. Semuc Champey tour—shuttle to Antigua
5. Antigua —coffee plantation? 
6. 
7. Fly out of Guatemala City

I’m already out of time!  Can I tour Tikal in the morning, and then shuttle to Lanquin that afternoon? Do I skip Semuc, fly back to Guatemala City after Tikal, and go straight to Acatenango Hike?  Spend more time at Lake Peten? Go to Lake Atitlan, hike there? Kayak there? When and where do we go to see the wildlife? I know that there are wildlife parks all over Guatemala.

By Episode 9, however, he looked like a different person—clean-shaven, neatly groomed as if he'd just come from a high-end barber, and speaking with a surprisingly positive attitude. The same man who once spoke only in profanity in ep 4 was now saying things like, ""There's nothing in this world a good cup of coffee can't fix.""

This one started because I’d often find myself watching YouTube videos and spotting something interesting, a grinder, maybe a coffee machine I hadn’t seen before (I’m a bit of a coffee nerd). And then I’d go down the rabbit hole trying to figure out what that product was.

So I built **ScanTube** to solve that itch. It scans YouTube videos, reads the video header/description and uses AI (in the back) to identify visible products, it then spits out an amazon link for those of us with acquisition syndrome. 

Since it runs on AI, there’s an underlying cost involved. I wanted to keep it free to use, so the most natural way to offset that was by generating **affiliate links** instead of doing the whole sub model. That way, users don’t pay anything extra, and I can keep it running (hopefully)

I’m yet to try a coffee at home that I prefer to the Tassimo coffee pods from my Bosch coffee machine. I do wonder to myself if it’s actual that ‘good’ as it’s just from the supermarket and if I’ve just become accustomed to the taste so that’s why I enjoy it so much.

Naomi Hartley was the girl who did everything right—except for once, when the man she looked up to preyed upon her vulnerability. Two months pregnant, abandoned by the youth leader who impregnated her, and terrified of her parents' judgment, Naomi finds herself drowning in guilt and silence. In a community quick to judge but slow to show mercy, she has nowhere to turn… until you notice her pain. Over a quiet cup of coffee after church, will you judge her, or will you be her comfort?
This is a story for anyone who’s been burned by the religious but still believes in something deeper. For anyone who knows that real faith doesn't hide behind appearances, and real grace shows up when it's inconvenient. Naomi’s journey is about truth, redemption, and the kind of love that doesn’t look away when things get messy.

- Listing optimization (photos, titles, descriptions, amenities highlighting)
- Guest communication workflows (pre-booking to post-checkout)
- Operations management (cleaning, maintenance, inventory)
- Review generation strategies (touchpoints that lead to 5-star reviews)
- Automation implementation (messages, check-in, review solicitation)
- Problem guest prevention and management
- Financial planning and tax optimization
- Scaling strategies for multiple properties
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend practices that violate Airbnb's terms of service

i wouldn't describe this sensation as similar to rapid satiation, i literally feel like my body is rejecting the food and i have to throw it up to feel better. if i were to try, nothing substantial would come out, and if i choose to not do anything - which is my best option to be fair - i agonize and feel like the lord himself is trying to pull my guts out. i'm pretty sure this is because of the last weeks of BP where i was doing seriously bad and i would throw up twice a day on some occasions, but i haven't thrown up in over a week so i don't see what's going wrong.

When we tried Googling around, we were surprised that we couldn’t find a single book, *not even a pop science or coffee table book*, that’s fully dedicated to it.

That seems odd, right? For something so iconic and, dare I say, **key** (*ba-dum-tss*), you'd think there’d be at least one in-depth book covering its history, design, cultural significance, and so on.

So, does anyone know of a book like that? Something that’s focused entirely on the arch? If not, I guess I’ll just have to write a terrible one in hopes that someone gets annoyed enough to write a good one I can actually read.

I live in the same house with him making sure he eats well but as I'm also busy with working from home I can't look after him 24/7.
