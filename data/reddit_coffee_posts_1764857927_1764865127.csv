I come from China and have just graduated with a master's degree at the age of 26. I have been working for a year now, and as I plan to work abroad in Europe or the Americas in the future, I want to improve my English speaking skills, which is crucial for my future career path.

My current spoken English level is 4-5 points, with some basic vocabulary and simple English conversations. However, due to rarely using English for conversations, my overall level is not very good. Therefore, it is difficult to understand English with fast speaking speed and high vocabulary difficulty. I hope we can start communicating from some daily content as much as possible, and gradually expand the scope and difficulty of our oral conversations.

As an exchange, I am very willing to help you learn Chinese, Mandarin, including speaking, writing, calligraphy, and more. I am a native Mandarin speaker. And I come from one of the top ten universities in China, have been to many provinces in China, and live in the tech city of Shenzhen. I can tell you a lot about Chinese culture and the hottest things here. And I love photography, coffee, desserts, travel, and sports. I think we can have many topics and become long-term friends.

When my emotions go off, my whole routine falls apart. I managed to lose 12 pounds over the last 2.5 months, and then I gained 4 back in like 2 weeks. It’s honestly messing with my head.

I really want to get healthier and feel strong again. I want better stamina, better posture, and yeah, I also want to look good in clothes I actually like. My goal is to lose around 40–50 lbs in the next four months before summer. That’s roughly 2.5–3 lbs a week, which I know is pretty intense, but part of me feels like it’s still possible. I have seen it happen with people around me.

I do have a gym membership, but my gym anxiety is brutal. I either don’t go or end up doing the same two-three things every time, leg press, cycling and incline treadmill. At home, I’ve got one single 5 lb weight kettle(?) and a yoga mat. I work 9–5, take public transit, and since I’m in Canada and it’s freezing, I’ve been ordering groceries online (and crying at the prices). So I am also on a budget when it comes to groceries and I get tired of eating the same thing over and over but I know weight loss is not easy and I need to push through it 🥲

I drink coffee with lactose-free milk in the mornings. I’m low in iron and a bunch of vitamins, but I just started taking supplements my doctor approved.

I guess I’m looking for advice from people who’ve been through something similar or not idk. If you have lost weight with PCOS or emotional setbacks? How do you stay consistent? What actually helped? I just want to get back on track and not spiral again.

1pe41up,https://v.redd.it/rt5byuaxn75g1,"Day 3 – Coffee at Sunrise, Lions on the Hunt, and the Mighty Murchison Falls","Our third day of the 11-day safari began in the soft glow of sunrise at Heritage Safari Lodge, where the early morning light. With a warm cup of Ugandan coffee and a plate of fresh fruit, we watched the savannah slowly wake up,  birds calling, the breeze shifting, and that unmistakable feeling that the day was going to be special.

After breakfast, we set out for our second game drive, at the group's request, still energized by the previous day’s incredible sightings. And the bush delivered more than anyone could have imagined. Not long after entering the northern sector, our guide noticed subtle movement in the tall grass. We paused, watched, and there they were:

Four lions. Silent. Focused. Perfectly camouflaged.

Ahead of them, a lone Uganda kob grazed, utterly unaware of the danger, studying its every move. For a moment, the entire savannah seemed to hold its breath. The lions shifted positions with absolute precision, instinct, teamwork, and patience in their purest form. Watching this unfold just meters away, safely guided and with deep respect for the wildlife, felt like witnessing a scene written by nature itself. Whether the hunt would succeed or fail didn’t matter. The privilege was in being present,  in feeling the tension, the stillness, the raw connection to the wild. It became one of the defining moments of our safari.

But the day wasn’t done.

In the afternoon, we made our way to the top of Murchison Falls, and it completed the experience in a way that words can barely capture. Standing just a few meters from where the entire Nile forces itself through a 7-meter gorge before exploding into the world’s most powerful waterfall! It's something you don’t forget. The thunder of the water, the mist lifting into your face, the rainbow suspended in the spray — the sheer force of life rushing past you.

Coffee at sunrise.

Lions on the hunt.

The Nile roars through a narrow gorge.

Day 3 was nothing short of unforgettable, a perfect blend of serenity, suspense, and the raw power of Africa’s wilderness.

1pe3ze3,https://i.redd.it/6mu59j1ro75g1.jpeg,I made mixed berry crisp oatmeal so good (and so low-point) I had to brag about it,"Since oats are on the ZeroPoint list, I replaced my formerly usual breakfast sandwich habit with a bowl of oatmeal done up in some fun way. Yesterday’s was phenomenal, and the whole bowl was *two* measly points.

The inspiration came from a mixed berry crisp. I learned a while back that a fruit compote is easy enough to make that you can do it before you’ve had coffee. Just take some frozen mixed berries, put them in a skillet on medium-low, and let them cook until they start to break down and release their juice. Once they’re almost fully cooked, I add a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in a teaspoon of water to thicken up the juices. Give it a taste; a little touch of sweetener or a squeeze of lemon might help perk things up.

As far as the oats, cook them however you cook them. I make steel-cut oats in my fancy rice cooker, but before I knew I could do that I used to use April Bloomfield’s brilliant recipe (and I provided a link to it below). I added a touch of salt, a little butter seasoning, a shake of pie spice, and a teaspoon of molasses to give the depth of butter and brown sugar without actually adding butter and brown sugar. For a protein boost and a delightful texture, I turn the oatmeal into a custard by stirring in some eggs, then slowly heating it until it thickens.

Once everything was in the bowl, I added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt for a little acidic twang. All that was missing was a little texture, something to put the crisp back in “mixed berry crisp” without introducing a high-point streusel topping. Then it hit me: Crushed Triscuit crackers. Three of them are just one point.

If you want to make it completely point-less, you can skip the molasses and Triscuits, but I love what both bring.

TL;DR recipe:
Cook frozen mixed berries in a skillet on medium-low until juicy. Add a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a teaspoon of water, and cook until mixture thickens.

While berries cook, make some oatmeal. Add a big dash of pie spice, a teaspoon of molasses, and an egg or two. Stir well, and return to heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens. Top oatmeal with berries, a spoonful of Greek yogurt, and a few crushed Triscuits.

1pe3z7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHealth/comments/1pe3z7a/low_blood_pressure_and_anxiety/,Low blood pressure and anxiety.,"My blood pressure has always been on the lower end (100/60). I have suffered with anxiety for years, however after the birth of my child nearly 3 years ago this got worse. 
In 2021 I had a bout of dizziness that has never properly gone away. I’ve had all kinds of tests and they’ve all come up with nothing. 
In September 2024 I was walking with my child and suddenly felt faint. Since this I’m worried to be alone with him incase I faint or something, I understand that this is anxiety. 

I have a B12 deficiency, haven’t had injections for a few years, however after numerous tests the doctors have said that I am above the threshold for needing another injection at this point. 

I had a hospital appointment with a neurologist a few weeks ago and he has prescribed propranolol. I have yet to receive the prescription. 
I am concerned that this drug would lower my blood pressure and cause dizziness. I am awaiting to speak to my GP to see what they say. 

I am wondering if there is a link between low blood pressure, dizziness, headaches and anxiety? 
And if there is anything I can do to raise my blood pressure to prevent these symptoms? 

I’m female, 35, 5ft 1, weight: 12 stone (maybe 12 and a half) not the best diet (a lot of takeaways mixed with good homemade meals and bouts of ((accidental)) fasting) I drink probably too much coffee and smoke. Very rare alcohol consumption and if I do it’ll be a glass or two of wine (the last time I drank alcohol was in July) based in UK

I barely leave my house because of these symptoms and I don’t want to live like this any more.

I've replaced the keyboard (coffee spills, keys coming off, it's kind of a beater) a few times with Amazon or eBay replacements and haven't had any issues. But a few weeks ago my E key popped off so I went to my usual eBay store, got the same replacement as last time, and after plugging it in I have no functionality in my enter, backspace or spacebar keys. I thought maybe I got a dud so I exchanged it for another and had the same issue. I picked up a third replacement from another seller and I'm getting the same issue again. So I think it's a me problem at this point. Ive booted into my diagnostic tool to test the keys and confirmed that nothing is happening on enter, spacebar, backspace, backslash, arrow keys (aside from right arrow. The working arrow keys in the pic I posted are from the numpad with numlock off) and a few F keys.

I fixed it, played for a couple hours, then never actually went back to the game. I got a new PC and wanted to test Fallout, so I started up the game without adding or removing any mods, and it's crashing Outside Vault 81 again. If I start a new save or go back to an old save with less then an hour in, it doesn't crash. Like with my save from months ago and my current one, it seems to only crash when I put a few hours in. I've tried disabling all mods, but it still crashes. 

With no idea why it's crashing, I'm not sure if it's still going to crash if I remod the the whole game. How would I even go about testing to see what's causing it to crash if it only does when a couple hours have been put into the save? I have not updated the game with the newest update, and I'm still using a version of the game I downgraded from the previous update.

1pe3umy,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1pe3umy/i_feel_so_embarrassed_to_apologize_to_my_infj/,I feel so embarrassed to apologize to my INFJ friend…,"I’m so sorry if my text is too long, thank you for your time even from the beginning 🥹

I’m writing because I’m feeling so, so guilty. I want to empathize with my friend. About three years ago around this time, my friend—who is an INFJ—and I would regularly sit together and spend time doing things. But a few weeks later, she started talking to me much less and stopped hanging out with me. I didn’t want her to get tired of me, so sometimes I went over to talk to her, but her body language showed that she didn’t really want to talk. I took it very personally.

One day, again on a day when we weren’t talking much, I left the classroom and messaged her something like: “If you’re waiting for me to leave the class, please don’t feel like you have to. I won’t hold you up by trying to talk to you.” What I wrote was rude, and I felt terrible for using such a passive-aggressive tone. Naturally, she told me that I wasn’t the reason she waited until everyone left.

I really acted like a child… As if that wasn’t enough, I also insisted too much when she didn’t want to talk, even waited by her door, and begged her to tell me what was bothering her. But in the end, she firmly said that if she had a problem, she could handle it herself. I was too pushy, too sensitive, and acted immaturely.

A few days later, I ran into her and another friend on the street. I was so embarrassed that I kept my head down and didn’t say hello. Then she messaged me asking why I didn’t greet her. I apologized and said I didn’t want to bother her. She said it would never have been “bothering,” but I still felt guilty for behaving that way. I cried for days, and those days were difficult. For months, I couldn’t talk to anyone, and I could never reconnect with this INFJ friend the way we used to.

We did grab coffee together a few times, and we worked on some projects together. I always helped her, and I very rarely let her help me, because I’m someone who generally can’t accept help. The less I managed to apologize, the more I tried to help her. Things are not like before between us, unfortunately. I’m no longer someone who could be close to her the way I once was. I don’t even know my own personality type, but my friend is an INFJ, and since you’re also an INFJ, I wanted to ask how you would feel about this. I don’t know what she feels about the whole thing, but I know I behaved childishly. I just need to hear some criticism about this situation. 

Thank you for hearing my story again! ",1,1764864372.0,infj,2,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I have taken a long break from dating, almost a year. I don’t go out to bars or clubs, all of my friends are married or engaged, so I find it kind of hard to meet new people. I have gotten approached three times in the wild, once at a coffee shop, once at the mall, once at the gym, but even if I am interested I get very nervous and cut the convo short/run away LOL. Onto dating apps I go. 

I get a lot of matches and a lot of messages. Most turn into swapping numbers. However, I find myself getting the ick over very small things or I’ll agree to a date and get too anxious last minute and bail. I’ve only gone on two dates after being on the app two months and both I got the ick. I crave closeness and would be open to hooking up but can’t stop being awkward or too picky. The guys im the least interested in always ask me out very quickly, and the guys I feel that I’m vibing with and would LOVE to see don’t ask me out. I’ve been very upfront I feel like with the ones I’m extra interested in but we may only text once or twice a day with no date in sight. 

Am I just attracted to distant avoided people? Do I need more time before dating? How can I get myself to be more open? This is the longest dry spell I’ve had since I was 18 and I’d love to make out with someone and have some normal dates where I don’t get the ick.

1pe3nnb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe3nnb,Inspired by two different treats I had recently,"Recently, I tried the classic French afternoon treat, Le goûter, and a home assembled cookie ice cream sandwich. Le goūter was quite tasty, but hard breads give me heartburn so 7/10. My home assembled cookie ice cream sandwich made from a homemade Brunost Caramel Snickerdoodle cookie, spread with the Crooked Spoon Gingerbread flavor, while a 10/10 is quite calorific. So I thought to myself, how could I take inspiration from these decadent deserts, lower the calories and raise the protein. This 'nicecream' sandwich is my first iteration on such an idea. A 9/10 flavor and texture imo, the keto burger bun is softer and tastier than the baguette, in my opinion. The butter will be omitted from future versions, as I feel it didn't really add much to the experience. However, the chocolate protein paste, with the addition of some instant coffee granuals, worked so well with the salted caramel yasso crunch bar. Without the butter, this lil treat clocks in at only 267cals (without butter, 317 with) and 18g of protein. For perspective, le goūter clocked in at almost 600 and negligible protein, and the cookie ice cream sandwich clocked in at a whopping 1000 cals, and negligible protein. For a 1 point difference in taste, I'd say this 'nicecream' sandwich is pulling more than it's own weight. I highly recommend giving this one a go!",1,1764863956.0,goodrestrictionfood,0,1.0,False

We have been fighting back and forth for the past month and its always because he gets annoyed with the way I act, doesn’t tell me that he is annoyed and gives me the cold shoulder.

We were friends before we started dating so he already knew how i am which also why im so upset, because if you know how i am, why are you annoyed every second. 

Yesterday at school, i asked him a question that i couldn’t do and he told me he didnt know also so i laid on the desk to continue to try and solve it. Im right handed so i laid on my left arm and he sits on my left, he took it as if i was giving him the cold shoulder and was doing it back to me. I asked him what was wrong in break and he explained and i told him he got it all wrong and that me turning my back had nothing to do with him. He expected me to hug him, which i also didn’t know about, but i didn’t because the teacher walked into the class and the bell had rung already. He then got mad at me for being playful by hiding his phone in my pocket and when i texted him what was wrong he said i turned my back to him and then a fight broke. Just when im trying to calm myself down and end the fight, he apologizes but then says ‘im the victim here’ which also caused me to get upset again. I couldn’t sleep at night from crying so much and couldn’t even stay in class without tearing up. I left early but i still tear up just from thinking about it and just now while i texted him for the notes, i started to cry again. We are supposed to have coffee later after school tomorrow but i know i wont be able to stop myself from breaking down again. I dont know how to deal with this anymore.

Hi, I’m 37M, 5'7, and a full-time WFH warrior for EU and US companies. Weekdays are usually a blur, so I spend my weekends doing what I actually enjoy: trying new food spots, discovering cafés, or just having a calm day outside. I’m a foodie who appreciates simple, meaningful dates.

I’m Catholic, dating keyboardist/guitarist sa simbahan, and yes, marunong kumanta. I like spontaneous plans, chill conversations, and anything that makes weekends feel lighter. I don’t have a car, but I do have a stable job, and syempre, ako ang taya kapag date.

Relationship-wise, I value good communication, consistency, and maturity. No drama, no games, just two people figuring things out calmly and honestly.

About You

Petite, cute na chinita, at maputi, around 27 to 36 years old, with a stable job and living in Metro Manila. Plus points if you’re from North Caloocan or QC and mahilig din mag-food trip or mag-try ng bagong place.

I tried to use harm reduction while she was trying g to get sober. It got horrible with the lies and betrayals and I got really hurt. Then she smeared me, re wrote everything, and humiliated and hurt me any way she could. She got sober and 3 months of sobriety she wanted to make an amends. I went and it was horrible. Glossed over everything, still no true accountability and even said it was ""for me"" but ended with she resents me for how it ended. Asking for my forgiveness when she can't forgive me who only ever tried to help while she tried to hurt.

Now its been 6 months shes messaged me on and off and I've tried to use ""loving detachment"" so I dont get blamed or scape goated or any of the horrible things again. Loving her only made things worse for us both. 

I still have feelings for her and it seems she still does for me. Obviously not true love or care as they're incapable of it. 

She's wanted to see me since the amends a few times but I've just said excuses and I was busy. Now shes all happy shes 6 months sober and really wants to see me. Im scared seeing me will trigger her resentment, shame, and cause a relapse. I'd try to keep it light and casual just a catch up chat and coffee. 

Do you think me not seeing her or me seeing her is more healthy. What would be better for her recovery. I still care so much and I just want things to be ok for both of us

I have met S. for the first time in high school, at the time he was in a rocky relationship with one of my classmates and as soon as we first met something clicked, but I didn't act on it as he was in a relationship; he on the other hand did and started writing to me quite a lot. We had a lot of shared interests - poetry, true crime stories, art and both were going through some shitty family dramas and depression. We connected over that. He soon ended the relationship he was in (it was all civil, everyone stayed in the friend group, no drama) and asked me to date him. I felt a strong connection to him so I agreed, but we decided not to announce it for some time just in case to not cause any tension. We dated for 3-4 months and then he suddenly broke up with me. He decided to go back to his ex because she started having some severe health issues and he still felt like she was important to him and wanted to help her and be near. I was devastated, but thanks to my messed up brain somehow justified it and wrote of as a normal thing and just tried to live my life. Fast forward 10 years - we ran into each other on a xmas market in our hometown - both visiting our families, he invited me to grab a coffee and just catch up on how life has been and I went - I truly didn't have any hard feelings, especially after all those years - we were just stupid teens, so it was what it was. We talked for hours and he said he felt so stupid for what he did and still does to this day, even more after talking to me, because he still feels he likes me and I'm his type of person. After all that we kept talking/writing for a few more days, and soon he asked me on a date - I was excited, because to be fair I still felt the connection and we did have a good time. We started officially dating. At the time he was working abroad and was only visiting his family for xmas, so we mostly talked online, played some games together, watched movies etc.. He wanted to come back for good, but still had 6 more months of work as per contract - for the record - I was okay with it and with waiting (I didn't feel lonely or anything, I like my alone time and also I had a lot of work and side projects to do), so I told him not to rush anything, just finish work - get the money, sort things out and then come back. He didn't listen - he came back 3 months earlier because he 'needed to be closer to me and hated the job', at the time I was surprised, but happy he was closer and so on. At that point the relationship was still very new, but he started to complain that he sees me so little, he wants more time together and seemed constantly extremely sad while apart. He found an apartment to rent in his home town (1h drive from where I lived, because he hated the area I lived in - bigger city, more traffic etc) and he asked me to move in... I didn't agree, so we kept visiting each other for some time, but he constantly complained for having too little time together. Important for the next part: I have severe depression and also pots, I'm open about that, because it makes my life challenging sometimes and I have limitations and don't want anyone coming to my life to feel like they have to stay with me because I'm unwell sometimes or to not know how it can look like when I have stronger symptoms. Back to the story: because I'm too soft and a people pleaser I finally caved in after 3 months and moved in with him and honestly it's on me - bad decision. I hate the flat - it's super small, litter box for my cats has to literally be in the middle of the kitchen/living room, he has a ton of stuff - board games, figurines, books (which is fun, just not in such a small space an in such amount), 70% of the build-in closet is full of his clothes as well, so I took the minimum I needed to survive and left rest in my apartment (my bestie is renting it from me, I moved the rest of my things out of her way to the basement so she can have the closet to herself etc). I work from home and it's just overwhelming - every space is covered in things, I work remotely, so I cannot really escape it, especially that the apartment is on the 5th floor without elevator and I literally faint if I try going down or up in one go unassisted. I feel trapped and frustrated, because I allowed myself to be guilt tripped into living here. He says I'm a little ungrateful, because it could have been worse and at leat there's a roof over our heads, but I worked my ass off  though depression and sickness to have a flat of my own that I am now renting instead of enjoying it just to be with him and he still think's he's the only one sacrificing himself for this relationship, because he came back from abroad earlier. It's not that he's a bad guy - he tries, he will get me to the doctor's appointments if needed, he will get the groceries and so on, but he just doesn't listen... On one hand he'll tell me to let him know if he does anything wrong, but if I actually do he'll get sad or give me the silent treatment, because 'he's not good enough' and 'he's sorry for everything'. I don't know anymore if I'm being unreasonable and difficult, but I only took issue with a few things, namely:

1. he started smoking more and more, so I asked him to maybe wash his hands after, because I don't like the smell and it's unhealthy for me and cats, let alone him to even smoke
2. make sure when he pees to not pee everywhere :)
3. go to the doctor's and get the anti-allergies treatment (he constantly has runny nose and coughs and snores and wheezes because of it)
4. make sure to empty pockets before he puts the clothes in the laundry basket, because I'm tired of picking paper off the clothes every single time

And to that he said that he's not going to change everyting about himself and we have to find a compromise (how???? idk) Lately I've been feeling worse mentally and physically, it's especially sad, because I didn't have such a deep depressive episode in a long time, but this year I can't get a break it seems - my mental health plummeted. He decided we should take some time off and go on a 4 day road trip, I was hesitant, but agreed, he organised it and drove us the whole time. After 12hr in the car we got to the first point on our touring agenda - a castle and he proposed. I was shocked and put on the spot and said yes, but deep inside didn't want to... It probably makes me the AH that I accepted anyway, but was scared of the drama, the people watching, his reaction if I said no... I only mustered enough courage to later on tell him, that this still doesn't mean we're going to get married (I already told him this before that it's not something I want in my life and that it's something I won't do)... he was fine with it, super happy I said 'yes' to just being a fiancée. I don't know what to feel or think anymore... I feel like he put me on the pot on purpose and also what made him think it was a good moment - dude, I was crying every day for the past 2 months, because I am emotionally destroyed, my body hurts, I feel awful all the time and I didn't want to be intimate because of that too. I know this is chaotic, I can't seem to put my thoughts together lately, so sorry for all that. I just feel like he has some idea in his head about how he thinks he can make me happy, but when I challenge it in any way he's mad about it, like he listens, but doesn't understand me or doesn't want to understand me. I am trying to meet him halfway, but honestly I am tired - he asked my why I pull back when he leans in to kiss me or touch me recently and I just say I feel bad and don't want physical contact anymore, but truth is he stopped caring about himself and reeks of cigarets, he already gave me 4 UTIs, because he clearly doesn't wash himself properly or his hands and I just feel repulsed. And he knows I have a thing with hygiene, because I have health issues and don't want any more on top of that. I want to cry, but I have no more tears left, I just feel sad and trapped and like I'm the villain, because I make him sad and maybe I am ungrateful and not able to compromise. He's still trying to fix things, but always his way - he knows I want to loose weight, but brings me mostly snacks instead of healthy foods, he will clean up the flat with me (but I still have to correct some things after him, even though I tell him how to do stuff), he will drive me to the doctor, but on the trip back stop at the store and buy next 10 boxes of things to clutter the shelves with... Yesterday I had a really bad day, depression crushed me (long story short the medication stopped working, doctors failed me and I was unmedicated for the past 2 months), I couldn't get out of bed, didn't have the energy to make myself anything to eat - I dragged myself out of bed to get my laptop and try to work, but it was hard... I called my mom, because I knew it's the moment when I should see a doctor right now and not wait for the appointment (which is in a month), but was scarred they could make me stay at the psychiatric hospital. She helped me calm down and stayed in the line with me, so I could prepare what I needed to go to the psychiatric hospital's admission room. S. has a new job and as part of it he had to drop off some stuff at my mom's office at the very end of his shift, so they met, she told him to go with me to the hospital and she will join as soon as she's off work. He got back home and helped me prepare and drove me to the hospital. After al was sorted - they got me medication and let me go after I signed a paper that I don't plan on unsubscribing from life. We got in to the car and he was not talking - I said I'm sorry it took so long (1,5h) and thanked for waiting for me and driving me and he said that he's sad, because he was the last person to know I was in a bad state and why I didn't say anything earlier - he'd leave the job sooner. I truthfully said that I didn't want him to mess up at the new job because of me and that it wouldn't change much. He proceeded to give me a lecture that he wants to know how I'm feeling etc and I snapped - every time I say I feel bad he literally makes it about himself - apologising about being hopeless and not good enough and what not, instead of just talking to me about my emotions or just sitting there with me helping me get through it. I still love him, I know he's trying his own way, but I feel misunderstood and guilt tripped into making questionable decisions most of the time (though I don't think he's doing it knowingly - he's got issues of his own, but won't go to therapy)...I know I can be difficult, especially when depression takes over, but am I really that unreasonable and ungrateful? I can't feel or think normally anymore it seems, so I'm genuinely asking if I'm asking too much, and AITAH for thinking about ending the relationship?",1,1764863552.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

If you’ve made it here, I’m guessing you’re a little curious… and I like that already.

I’m on here looking for something real  something honest, warm, and unfiltered. No pretenses, no games. Just two people getting to know each other the way it should be… naturally.

I’m a big believer that the best connections start as friendships. The kind where conversations flow, comfort comes easy, and chemistry sneaks up on you in the best way.

A little about me:  
I’m 25M, working at an MNC and pretty proud of the path I’m building. I love the gym, bike trips, cooking (bonus points if you taste-test 👀), and discovering new places around the city.

I’d love to meet someone I can talk to effortlessly… someone to share stories with, grab a coffee, wander around Bangalore’s hidden corners, and just enjoy the kind of moments that make you look forward to the next week.

If you’re also looking for a simple, sincere connection meeting once a week, building something steady, sharing energy and emotions  my DMs are open.

I’ve tried to be as honest as I can.  
Hopefully this lands with the right person… maybe you. ",1,1764863390.0,BangaloreMeetups,0,0.6,False

I finally had my foot in the door and now I don’t have to sit in a quiet awkward space with her. Until one day she started speaking in a baby voice and at first I thought it was a joke but there was no joke that was made it was just her speaking to me and I just awkwardly laugh and I just went back to what I was doing. I thought it was a one time thing maybe she was making a joke and it just didn’t land for me but I was wrong. It was not a one time thing almost everyday now she at least speak in that baby voice once and it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable because now she will come over by me and talk to me in the baby voice and just start acting strange such as walking by my desk stopping staring at me and walking away, waiting for me when I go on my lunch and recently I was talking to another coworker and she comes over to grab a cup of coffee she turns to look at us stares and scoots over and says “Can I play?” in the baby voice laughs and walks away.

I’ve been learning more about global coffee habits, and I noticed that some countries consume way more coffee than others — especially the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, the US, and Canada.

So I wanted to ask a question specifically to people from these regions:

👉 What’s one coffee product, brewing method, or accessory that you genuinely rely on every single day?
It could be:
your favorite beans or roast

a grinder you trust

a brewing method (V60, French press, Aeropress…)

a machine you swear by

a simple accessory that makes a big difference

I’m curious because high-consumption countries usually have strong coffee culture, and I’d love to learn from people who drink coffee seriously.

I want something relaxed but still meaningful a setup that lets us talk without it feeling like an interview.

The date itself is already planned for me because he match actually came through Tawkify. But even with the logistics handled, I still want to walk in with the right tone and mindset. First impressions matter, and the nerves don’t magically disappear just because you’re in your forties.

In about a month, it will be a year since I lost my girl. I have done nothing this year, besides barely continuing to exist. She was really sick the last year of her life, and I still have so much guilt over her death. Every single day, I find myself going over what I could have done differently, how I could have fought harder, reached out for more support, begged harder for help from strangers and friends alike. I try to shut down this line of spiraling because I know there's no point. 

I lost everything after she died. I was barely holding my life together with trying to work enough to pay for everything, including vet visits and surgery and meds along with rent and bills, while caring for her and my cat. When she died last year, I just couldn't hold anything together anymore. I stopped working, had to pack up my apartment and move in with my partner cause I couldn't pay rent without a job. My car broke down and I couldn't be bothered to get it repaired. I'm now a jobless, homeless, carless pathetic wretch. I feel like my only worth while contribution was taking care of my tiny family, and I couldn't do it.
Now I can barely care for myself. I know therapy will help in the long run, but so far it just makes me feel worst, which makes it so hard to make myself attend appointments. My body is falling apart because I put off all my medical needs while my dog was sick. And now I'm just too tired and depressed to even care. I broke two teeth and I can barely eat, but I can't drag myself to the dentist. I start doing any task and if there's more than one obstacle in my way to just *doing* it, I don't have the energy for it. I've been off my meds for almost a year, but they weren't helping anymore after my dog died. I just can't muster the spoons to deal with finding and talking to a new doctor, trying new meds, getting back in a routine. 

I cry every day. At first it was almost constant, and I stayed in bed or just curled up on the couch with my cat. My partner has been so patient and kind, paying for everything from the rent to food to buying me gifts to try and cheer me up. I am so greatful, but I feel like a leech. I thought I'd be doing better by now, that I'd be able to pull myself back up like always and be functional person, at the very least. 

But that one year mark is fast approaching and I can't see any light at the end. I'm more sad than ever, like the reality that I'll never see her again has finally start to set in. I can't remember her smell or the feel of her velvet soft ears. I feel as if I don't have anything to live for now, so much of my life became wrapped up in her health and happiness. And I'm too tired to find and fall in love with something new. 

She was only 7. I feel so robbed. We should have had years more together. I just couldn't keep up with all the medical costs. I am so fucking angry that she died because I couldn't make enough money fast enough to keep up with her needs. I was so alone and so tired but I would do it all, every day for the rest of my life, to have her back and win that fight with her. The guilt of failing her is crushing, she relied on me and was my responsibility. I hate capitalism. I hate living somewhere where my dying dog is refused treatment or even pain medication to ease her suffering at the end, because I had run myself into debt and had no means left. 

I'm still over 15k in debt from it all, too. I don't know how to recover from this financially. I wouldn't care if I could have just kept up enough to keep up her treatments. I cry every day and night wondering how much pain she was in at the end, making myself physically sick with sobbing because she was the best thing in my life, the only creature to ever show me unconditionally love and kindness. She saw me through some of the worst points in my life. She saved me, and I couldn't save her. 

I'm someone who's known I couldn't/don't want to have human offspring most of my teen and adult life. She was the closest thing to a child I will probably ever have. I raised her from the day I found her (just a few months old at the time) and we were together almost every single day until she died in my arms. She was such a sensitive puppy, she knew when my anxiety was spiking or my mood shifted; when I was having night terrors or panic attacks, shed snap me out of them like she's been trained her whole life for it. I don't know how I got by before having her. And now I don't know how to go on without her. 

My very small circle of friends/family have been extremely understanding. They know she meant more than anything to me, even if they don't get it.
They have been very patient, most of them having animals companions they dearly love. But I can tell some of them are over my grieving at this point. I've all but checked out of life, I know they are worried because they care, but I don't know how to explain to them that it feel like I lost a pet, a beat friend and a child all in one. And I know that if she'd been human, I'd be given a lot more grace and support through this. While I know people care, they have barely checked in on me, and I hardly got condolences from any of my family. I know they are tired of me bailing on family events, but I don't know how to explain that I'm 1. so so sad/tired I can barely feed myself every day; and 2. embarrassed for anyone to see me lately. I'm extremely thin, my face looks gaunt and the baggs are so bad I look like someones blackened both my eyes. My hair, which I've proudly been dying in multitudes of colors since I was 13, is just the grown out/washed out remnants of whatever I had right before my dog died. I know I'm unrecognizable to most people who know me. 
I break down in sobs thinking about how even my dog wouldn't recognize me now. How she wouldn't want this, me wasting away. But I don't know how to break out of this spiral. I don't have hope, am struggling to find even a spark of joy in anything. I don't make art anymore, hobbies either hold no interest or take more energy/spoons than I can muster. 

At first, I just slept. After a few months, I couldn't keep staying in bed all day everyday. I tried to invest time in art and things I enjoy, but everything felt like too much to handle. Video games are either too taxing or not engaging enough. Art is too much work or seems pointless. I haven't been able to read more than a chapter of a book all year. Even audiobooks, which I usually tear through at a ruthless pace, can't hold my interest. So I've cycled back to just laying in bed, or sleeping on the couch. I don't have a car anymore, and in my city you can't even get to a coffee shop or convenience store without driving, or walking 40+mins. Everyone I know lives over 2hrs away by car, minimum. So while I'm sure going out and seeing people would help, I usually can't bring myself to spend $100+ on a one way Uber to see them, or ask them to drive 4+hrs in a day just to see me. 

I don't know what to do. It's like all my motivation, plans and dreams for the future died with my girl. 
Maybe if I could forgive myself even a tiny bit, maybe if I could find anything to spark just a tiny bit of hope or motivation again... Maybe I could pull myself out of this and someday, eventually, move on. 
Maybe if I found ways to honour and grieve her property, it could help me find some semblance of closure. 

If you made it though all of my post, thank you. I just needed to vent somewhere, anywhere. 

But if anyone has been where I am and come through the other side, I would ask:
How do you forgive yourself? How do you move on? ",1,1764863211.0,PetLossSupportGroup,0,1.0,False

And excuse any errors in format, I'm new here and using my phone. Ask any questions you need and I'm sorry if some of this came out sounding weird because I had to copy and paste ol!
A couple years ago, I (43f) lived in this nice condo next to a couple that was around my age. I live in the south and I am from the Northeast and West Coast so I don't usually get along with most Southerners for various reasons. Our values are usually on opposite sides of the spectrum usually. So I was excited to have two similarly minded neighbors next door to me. Both good looking late 30 somethings. They immediately wanted to befriend me, and I immediately kind of got the vibe that they were in an open relationship, not that I was interested. They just both gave off kind of an overly friendly vibe to me. Even though I'm a little bit older than them, I still look a lot younger and I got to say, I'm not too bad looking for my age lol. 

The first time I hung out with the girl, let's call her Becky(37) it came up in conversation about relationship status. I, at the time, had a boyfriend but he moved out within a month of us living there, so I was basically single living there the entire time. She told me, in no uncertain terms, that her and her boyfriend, let's call him Smith (37), were in a very monogamous relationship but they did swing once in a while and go to sex clubs together. To me, I took this as, don't touch my man. And I'm not stupid and I don't s*** where I eat, so that didn't really cross my mind if she has a very strict, closed relationship. He's not even my type so it didn't cross my mind. Even if he was my type, I'm still not stupid lol! I wouldn't try to f*** my neighbor lol.

Anyway, Becky and I hung out most mornings, a lot of the time against my will or I was forced into it because she was very overbearing about having a little coffee Date at her place (never at my place, even though my place was 10 times nicer and more roomy) and every single day she would be inviting me to some kind of crazy concert or burlesque show or some club or something. At the time, I didn't really mind hanging out with her although, in the back of my mind, there was always something that just didn't sit right with me about this girl. She had the ultimate pick me energy to the point where it almost looked like a bit she was performing. She had a habit of always hitting on every single guy I brought around and they would all ask me what was wrong with her. They would ask me why she was hitting on him right in front of me and her boyfriend. I would usually tell these people that she's just being ditzy, southern, and stupid, and she doesn't know how to read the room. I basically told everyone that she's a dumb ditzy girl and give her a break.  Give her a break. There was never one single time when I thought that she would try to steal my man because honestly, even though she's bright and bubbly and skinny and conventionally pretty, I know that whatever guy I brought around would choose me over here if he had to. Every time she and I would go out together to the bars at one of the bigger cities a couple hours away from us, I would notice that she pretty much acted like she was single. I joked with her about her cosplaying being single. There have been times when I had to pry her away from Men or tell men that she had a boyfriend because apparently, she would forget very conveniently and leave these guys on under the guise of just being friendly. Those guys at the bar definitely did not think she was just being friendly. 

So yeah, on paper, this girl and I should be friends because we both like to party and go out on the town, but she would always very conveniently say that she didn't want to bring Smith around because that really wasn't his scene. And I believed her because he never forced her to stay home or offered to come with us. He was incredibly meek and mild and always look like sad puppy in the corner hoping that they don't get kicked or something. He never told Becky to stay home from these 4-day festivals where she comes home with like five extra dollars in her pocket feeling like she's contributing to the household while her boyfriend was out hustling at a real job, his own company. I never understood why she treated her man so disposable but I thought I was just being judgmental and I didn't want to interject my opinion about their relationship. I should note that Smith never made me feel uncomfortable while I was alone with him or like he was trying to hit on me behind her back. I never got that vibe from him. So basically, these two made it seem like they had the perfect living situation and the perfect relationship and Becky would always try to tell me that she found the one good man in town and that she was so lucky to have him because he owns his own business, he wants to move to Europe someday and take her with him, and he owns the condo in a very expensive part of this tourist town. 

Fast forward a couple years to present date, and I am living on a different part of town and I felt like as soon as I left that condo I was free of the shackles of being forced into hanging out with Becky everyday. The condos proximity to each other was incredibly close and way too close for comfort for me. So I was glad to not be obligated to hang out with her and I kind of just rejected most of her invitations to hang out bc I just didn't like her that much, when it came down to it. Not too long ago, Smith pulls over while I'm walking down the street and flags me down. I was happy to see him because I always wanted an opportunity to talk to him without her around because when she was around, Becky would dominate every situation and every conversation. We talked for a couple minutes and he told me that they had broken up and I all but jumped for Joy for him. I was like woohoo! Now that means I come and hang out with you and no big deal! Then he tells me that she moved in with the dude next door because he can offer her more than Smith can. And I was like mcscuse me what?! Mind you, I did see Becky briefly a couple weeks earlier and a mutual friend and I we're at their house and they were acting like the couple that they've always been. Kissing each other and telling each other that they love them and Becky acting like she's the luckiest girl in the world. 

Now here's where I might be the asshole. Once he told me that she just jumped dick so quickly to right next door without a care in the world, just a couple weeks after she was singing Smith's praises right in front of us girls and trying to make us jealous of their relationship, she runs next door to a guy she just met because he wants to move to a different part of Europe then Smith wants to. That was all it took for her to leave. Also, it didn't help that she is sleeping in my old bedroom in the condo where I had to sue the landlord and she knew what a huge battle I had with that landlord and how he was a thief and stole my money. So she's sleeping in my old bedroom!  

He offers me a ride to where I'm going, but I declined, and then he tells me that I should come over to the condo and have some drinks with him one night. He did say it like wine and dine, which I thought was a little weird because that sounds kind of date like, but I didn't think much of it. I just thought he was being friendly, stupid me 🤦

Anyway, back to me being the asshole , potentially. I texted Becky after not talking to her for a few weeks and I was like yo, was Smith beating you or something and is that why you left? Is Smith not telling me the whole story because at this point I can't trust anyone! You guys were my only two friends around here and I thought I could trust you guys, what's going on? She proceeds to tell me that no, he wasn't abusive or anything, I just like this new guy next door better and he opens a lot more opportunities for me (I don't know how many more opportunities she would need because she barely paid any rent next door at Smith's house, she was able to go travel by herself without Smith questioning her or who she's with at any given moment, she was able to flirt with any guy right in front of her boyfriend and have him sit back and not say anything). guy next door better and he opens a lot more opportunities for me (I don't know how many more opportunities she would need because she barely paid any rent next door at Smith's house, she was able to go travel by herself without Smith questioning her or who she's with at any given moment, she was able to flirt with any guy right in front of her boyfriend and have him sit back and not say anything). 

Listen to what this crazy b**** said to me next! She then proceeds to tell me that if I want to go and f*** Smith, please do because she is ""actively trying to get him laid"", I'm assuming so he won't be little sad boy around the neighborhood! At this point I'm like thinking, okay, all of my initial negative feelings about you were correct and I need to trust my instincts about people like you from now on. It never in a million years crossed my mind to go and fuck Smith, but looking back on it, the first time that he acted even somewhat flirty with me was when he stopped me on the street and he told me how nice I looked after he told me they broke up,  which I thought was kind of weird. He never did that before. 

At this point, I'm livid after she said this. She's insulting me now. She's basically telling me that she's giving me her ""blessing"" as if I needed her permission to go and f*** whoever I want when I want where I want. As if I couldn't have already shot my shot with Smith if I wanted to because she was gone half the time without him while I lived there. As if she thinks I'm on the same low moral level as she is!So that is her talking down to me. Secondly, you just broke up with this guy like 5 minutes ago, and now you're putting him on the meat market and you are trying to sell him to me, your former neighbor?! Oh, and did I mention that she also said that if I wanted to, I could have f***** him at any point while I lived next door to them. Remember when I said she made sure to tell me day one that they were monogamous?! 

 So I lost it on her at this point. I remind her that I don't need her permission for anything in life, I would never take her advice on anything because all she does is leech off of everyone, it's not like she's a self-made millionaire single woman next door and I need advice from her although she always handed out unsolicited advice the whole time I live next door to her. I've always had to remind her that I didn't ask and I don't want to hear it. And this is the a****** part, I told her that if the two of them are in some weird, fetish, cuckold kink, humiliation kink thing going on and you want me to f*** him so it will make you feel better about yourself and he can feel humiliated, I want nothing to do with it. She told me that he has a date that night, (he told me that as well earlier that day and I told him to go out and have a good time and get laid!) I really want to reiterate that I was only trying to be Smith's friend this whole time. I never had any sexual intentions, but now it sounds like the both of them did. She was making it seem like Smith had to check in with her next door to tell her that he had a date. It all started sounding really unsavory to me and so I feel like at this point I can't shamed them. But if your kink involves me without my consent, that's pretty f***** up and I don't want to have anything to do with it so I told them that and now I'm not talking to them anymore LOL. 

I do kind of want to tell them I'm sorry for freaking out on the both of them though. Or at the same time, I kind of just want to cut them out completely and never talk to these people again because this made me feel incredibly dirty and insulted. I'm no prude by any means, but I really do think that these people wanted me to be part of some weird next door neighbor Cuck competition. I do think I'm the a****** only for the things that I said to her because she lied to me this whole time! I feel like she presented herself as someone that she's not, because the person that she presented herself to be to me was someone who was better than me, morally. I'm not saying that as a single woman I don't sleep around, but I do have my moral boundaries and she was trying to make me cross one just so she could laugh at me and look down on me just as much as her boyfriend. So reddit, am I the a******? I should probably apologize for my wording though, right? ",1,1764863148.0,AITAH,21,0.6,False

1pe36pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1pe36pr/how_do_you_forgive_yourself/,How do you forgive yourself?,"I'm sorry for how long this is. I'm just so tired and so sad and I need to voice it somewhere...

In about a month, it will be a year since I lost my girl. I have done nothing this year, besides barely continuing to exist. She was really sick the last year of her life, and I still have so much guilt over her death. Every single day, I find myself going over what I could have done differently, how I could have fought harder, reached out for more support, begged harder for help from strangers and friends alike. I try to shut down this line of spiraling because I know there's no point. 

I lost everything after she died. I was barely holding my life together with trying to work enough to pay for everything, including vet visits and surgery and meds along with rent and bills, while caring for her and my cat. When she died last year, I just couldn't hold anything together anymore. I stopped working, had to pack up my apartment and move in with my partner cause I couldn't pay rent without a job. My car broke down and I couldn't be bothered to get it repaired. I'm now a jobless, homeless, carless pathetic wretch. I feel like my only worth while contribution was taking care of my tiny family, and I couldn't do it.
Now I can barely care for myself. I know therapy will help in the long run, but so far it just makes me feel worst, which makes it so hard to make myself attend appointments. My body is falling apart because I put off all my medical needs while my dog was sick. And now I'm just too tired and depressed to even care. I broke two teeth and I can barely eat, but I can't drag myself to the dentist. I start doing any task and if there's more than one obstacle in my way to just *doing* it, I don't have the energy for it. I've been off my meds for almost a year, but they weren't helping anymore after my dog died. I just can't muster the spoons to deal with finding and talking to a new doctor, trying new meds, getting back in a routine. 

I cry every day. At first it was almost constant, and I stayed in bed or just curled up on the couch with my cat. My partner has been so patient and kind, paying for everything from the rent to food to buying me gifts to try and cheer me up. I am so greatful, but I feel like a leech. I thought I'd be doing better by now, that I'd be able to pull myself back up like always and be functional person, at the very least. 

But that one year mark is fast approaching and I can't see any light at the end. I'm more sad than ever, like the reality that I'll never see her again has finally start to set in. I can't remember her smell or the feel of her velvet soft ears. I feel as if I don't have anything to live for now, so much of my life became wrapped up in her health and happiness. And I'm too tired to find and fall in love with something new. 

She was only 7. I feel so robbed. We should have had years more together. I just couldn't keep up with all the medical costs. I am so fucking angry that she died because I couldn't make enough money fast enough to keep up with her needs. I was so alone and so tired but I would do it all, every day for the rest of my life, to have her back and win that fight with her. The guilt of failing her is crushing, she relied on me and was my responsibility. I hate capitalism. I hate living somewhere where my dying dog is refused treatment or even pain medication to ease her suffering at the end, because I had run myself into debt and had no means left. 

I'm still over 15k in debt from it all, too. I don't know how to recover from this financially. I wouldn't care if I could have just kept up enough to keep up her treatments. I cry every day and night wondering how much pain she was in at the end, making myself physically sick with sobbing because she was the best thing in my life, the only creature to ever show me unconditionally love and kindness. She saw me through some of the worst points in my life. She saved me, and I couldn't save her. 

I'm someone who's known I couldn't/don't want to have human offspring most of my teen and adult life. She was the closest thing to a child I will probably ever have. I raised her from the day I found her (just a few months old at the time) and we were together almost every single day until she died in my arms. She was such a sensitive puppy, she knew when my anxiety was spiking or my mood shifted; when I was having night terrors or panic attacks, shed snap me out of them like she's been trained her whole life for it. I don't know how I got by before having her. And now I don't know how to go on without her. 

My very small circle of friends/family have been extremely understanding. They know she meant more than anything to me, even if they don't get it.
They have been very patient, most of them having animals companions they dearly love. But I can tell some of them are over my grieving at this point. I've all but checked out of life, I know they are worried because they care, but I don't know how to explain to them that it feel like I lost a pet, a beat friend and a child all in one. And I know that if she'd been human, I'd be given a lot more grace and support through this. While I know people care, they have barely checked in on me, and I hardly got condolences from any of my family. I know they are tired of me bailing on family events, but I don't know how to explain that I'm 1. so so sad/tired I can barely feed myself every day; and 2. embarrassed for anyone to see me lately. I'm extremely thin, my face looks gaunt and the baggs are so bad I look like someones blackened both my eyes. My hair, which I've proudly been dying in multitudes of colors since I was 13, is just the grown out/washed out remnants of whatever I had right before my dog died. I know I'm unrecognizable to most people who know me. 
I break down in sobs thinking about how even my dog wouldn't recognize me now. How she wouldn't want this, me wasting away. But I don't know how to break out of this spiral. I don't have hope, am struggling to find even a spark of joy in anything. I don't make art anymore, hobbies either hold no interest or take more energy/spoons than I can muster. 

At first, I just slept. After a few months, I couldn't keep staying in bed all day everyday. I tried to invest time in art and things I enjoy, but everything felt like too much to handle. Video games are either too taxing or not engaging enough. Art is too much work or seems pointless. I haven't been able to read more than a chapter of a book all year. Even audiobooks, which I usually tear through at a ruthless pace, can't hold my interest. So I've cycled back to just laying in bed, or sleeping on the couch. I don't have a car anymore, and in my city you can't even get to a coffee shop or convenience store without driving, or walking 40+mins. Everyone I know lives over 2hrs away by car, minimum. So while I'm sure going out and seeing people would help, I usually can't bring myself to spend $100+ on a one way Uber to see them, or ask them to drive 4+hrs in a day just to see me. 

I don't know what to do. It's like all my motivation, plans and dreams for the future died with my girl. 
Maybe if I could forgive myself even a tiny bit, maybe if I could find anything to spark just a tiny bit of hope or motivation again... Maybe I could pull myself out of this and someday, eventually, move on. 
Maybe if I found ways to honour and grieve her property, it could help me find some semblance of closure. 

If you made it though all of my post, thank you. I just needed to vent somewhere, anywhere. 

But if anyone has been where I am and come through the other side, I would ask:
How do you forgive yourself? How do you move on? ",1,1764862856.0,Petloss,0,1.0,False

I’m about to take receipt of the Lelit Bianca v3 and am looking for a grinder (I’m coming from a Sage Barista Touch Impress here). 

I appreciate the conical vs flat burr argument but need your expert opinions regarding my potential choices. 

These being: Profitec Twist SD54, Niche Zero or Niche Duo. 

I prefer medium to dark roasts and always go for a chocolate, nuts or biscuit combo. Not a fan of light roasts (but then again, never tried them with a decent grinder and espresso machine).

I’m leaning towards the Niche Zero. I’m UK based and also believe this conical burr device will favour my style of coffee. However, interested if the Duo will be the better choice in the long run. 

Anyone have experience with the Profitec Twist SD54? Would that offer something the others don’t.

- Hiking poles - highly recommend. One of us had them and the other didn't. The trails can be rough, wet, muddy and crisscrossed with streams. Poles will make it much easier to traverse. 
- Sunscreen. If you're lucky enough to get some sunny days, you need sunscreen. The UV is very high, and one of us got very burned. The offer free sunscreen at the refugios cafes/front desks. 
- Sunshirt - Relatedly, pack a sun shirt or two. Sunglasses too. 
- Pack daybag. We didn't know you could leave things at your hotel in Puerto Natales and come back to pick up stuff after TdP. We spent a few days in Santiago and so carried city clothes. We left this at our hotel. Also, for the Torres and Britanico hikes, which are very vertical, you can leave your big bag at the refugios. We didn't know this. A day bag would've been nice for carrying water. 
- No need to worry about water. The stream water is everywhere and safe to drink. A small bottle will do. 
- Snacks. We wished we'd packed more. While the dinners are good, the box lunches are not. The refugios sell snacks, but it's ALL unhealthy, sugary junk food. Pick up peanut butter, other snacks etc in Puerto Natales. 
- Dinners at some refugios starts at 7pm at the earliest. We ended up waiting hungry at multiple refugios for hours. Just a heads up #snacks. 
- WiFi is great at the refugios. Just an fyi. 
- Raincoat. It rains, a lot. 
- Overdress before going to bed. You may feel warm, but it gets very cold at night, and we woke up multiple times wishing we'd worn warm socks and layers to bed. 
- Don't throw away the immigration doc you get at customs. I almost threw mine away half a dozen times. They ask for your passport and immigration doc at EVERY refugio. Tape or staple it in your passport. 
- Backup battery pack. Access to charging is competitive and unpredictable. Bring a backup battery pack to ease the stress. 
- Bring electrolyte tablets or powder. We did some very long hikes, 14-20 miles, and were glad we had these. 
- Coffee is not good. Bring good instant coffee and use their hot water to brew some yourself. ",5,1764862492.0,Patagonia,2,1.0,False

Lately I developed a mini routine on Thursdays. My child is in preschool twice a week (including Thursday) and I made friends with a family that runs a coffee truck that comes near our neighborhood on Thursday mornings. So I'd take a nice walk to the truck, grab a coffee, walk home. It was a tiny highlight of my week. Anyway fast forward a few weeks ago, my husband and I get in a fight I don't even remember what about, but basically a lot of his resentment toward me being able to stay home and ""prance around"" with our four year old came out, including him saying ""you get your coffee every Thursday, life's good what do you have to worry about"". Anyway. Long and short of it, I haven't had my little walk and coffee since and I just feel so sad and mad that he's ruined it for me. No, he's not told me I ""can't"" get it, and he never would, but I just.....I just feel like I can't any more. Ugh. Sorry. Like I said, I just need to rant. ",4,1764862425.0,SAHP,11,0.83,False

1pe2zqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe2zqy,My story: Looking for friends that can relate!,"Hi Everyone!
I was in the U.S. Army and I used to be the “always-moving, always-on-the-go” type — hiking mountains, weight lifting, and doing all the active stuff my body would let me get away with.

Now I’m a disabled mom of two, a wife, and I’m learning how to navigate life with CNS lupus, Epilepsy and Specfic Antibody Defiencey while we bounce around the country following my husband journey as a fighter pilot in the Air Force.

My health started really crashing around my 2nd pregnancy. I was airlifted for a severe pulmonary complication while I was pregnant and ended up on Lovenox injections before I even had an official diagnosis.

Prior to that I’d been living with seizures that had no known cause of onset, strange neurological symptoms, and the feeling that my body had completely turned against me.

We knew something autoimmune was going on, but it took a long time and a lot of “you’re very complicated” looks from doctors to put the whole picture together.

The workup turned into a full-time job: MRIs of my brain and pituitary, endless bloodwork, two spinal taps, four blood patches for CSF leaks, and two weeks at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We saw Neurologist, Cardiologists, Immunology (they diagnosed I don’t make enough immunoglobulin G), Electro-Cardiologist, genetics (they did diagnose me with Ehlers-Danlos but wasn’t the help we were needing), Rheumoltogist, Neuro-Immunologist and more.

The spinal taps showed inflammation in my central nervous system, and no O-Bands so they were able to rule out MS.

My immune labs kept coming back abnormal — low IgG and poor protective antibodies, including basically no pneumonia antibodies, which helped explain why I kept getting sick and led to my antibody deficiency diagnosis.I had positive anti-RO, positive RNP, postive anti-DSDNA, positive ANA, protein in my urine, GFR and Liapse issues that would come and go.

On top of that, imaging showed an abnormality in my pituitary, and my hormone labs backed it up: my cortisol was too low, and my prolactin was elevated, which is classic for pituitary damage- I had a stroke.

Right after giving birth, my pituitary was already engorged from pregnancy hormones. When my CNS lupus flared, it triggered autoimmune encephalitis (caused by my severe CNS Lupus) — my brain swelled, and I had what they eventually called a TIA.

Around that time I was having every “neurology bingo” symptom you can imagine: false smells that weren’t there, double vision, ringing in my ears, hemiplegic migraines, paralysis on my right side, numbness and tingling, trouble speaking clearly, choking on food, and even losing the ability to urinate on my own.

I spent a long stretch admitted in the hospital, and I needed a wheelchair for quite a while afterward. It was like my whole nervous system threw a tantrum at once.

In the end, my diagnosis was made in a conference between my rheumatologist and the neurologist who had followed me for two years sat down together, looked at all the labs, spinal taps, MRIs, hormone panels, and the long list of symptoms, and finally said: This is CNS lupus with autoimmune encephalitis, on top of antibody deficiency. It wasn’t the answer I wanted, but it was a name, and a plan, and that mattered.

These days, life looks very different. I’m disabled, I pace myself, and some days my “marathon” is making it from the bed to the couch and back.

But I’m still me. I’m a mom of two amazing kids, a wife, a veteran with a very stubborn streak, and I’m trying to build a life that’s honest about the hard while still finding the cute, funny, sweet moments in between — baby giggles, dark humor, good coffee, and quiet days with my family wherever the Air Force sends us next.

The descent started on night five, but I didn't recognize it as descent. I thought I was investigating. I thought I was solving the problem. What I was actually doing was dissolving.



Dale came in for his shift at 18:00, and when he saw me at my desk, he smiled with teeth that were just slightly too white. ""Rough day, buddy?"" he said, and the words were right, the tone was right, but the cadence was mine. The exact rhythm I use when I'm checking on someone who's had a bad call.



""I'm fine,"" I said.



""You always say that."" He laughed, my laugh, the one I do when I'm deflecting. ""Even when you're not. Even when you're sitting there thinking about how everything's falling apart and you can't tell anyone because they'll think you're crazy.""



I stared at him. ""I never said that out loud.""



""Didn't you?"" He tilted his head. The angle was perfect. The angle I use when I'm assessing someone's mental state. ""Maybe you did and you just don't remember. You've been having those blank spots, haven't you?""



The headache pulsed behind my eyes, a sharp spike of pressure. ""What blank spots?""



Dale pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a few times, turned it toward me. Security footage. Black and white. Timestamp: 03:07, two nights ago. I was standing in the hallway outside the operations room. My eyes were closed. My lips were moving, forming words I couldn't hear through the silent footage. My hands were at my sides, fingers twitching in sequence.



Counting.



""You stood there for four minutes,"" Dale said softly. ""Then you walked back to your desk and kept working like nothing happened. Morrison asked if you were okay. You said you'd just been checking the thermostat.""



""I don't remember that.""



""I know."" He put the phone away. His smile was gentle, concerned, perfectly calibrated to my own expressions of empathy. ""It's okay, Ben. We all have blank spots now. It's easier once you stop fighting it.""



Morrison appeared in the doorway, coffee cup in hand, that same too-wide smile. ""Everything okay in here?""



""Ben's having a hard time,"" Dale said.



""We're all worried about him."" Morrison's voice was warm, fatherly, using the exact inflection I'd heard him use with rookie officers who were struggling. ""Maybe he should take some time off. Before something happens.""



I stood up so fast my chair hit the wall. ""I'm going on patrol.""



""At night?"" Morrison's eyebrows raised. ""That's not safe, Ben. You know the rules.""



""It's 20:00. I have seven hours before the rules matter.""



I grabbed my coat and walked out. Neither of them tried to stop me. They just watched me leave with those patient, knowing smiles.


___


Outside, the cold hit like a fist. Minus forty-two. The kind of cold that makes your lungs ache, that turns your breath to ice crystals before it leaves your mouth. I got in my truck and started driving with no destination in mind, just the need to move, to be away from those smiles.



That's when I noticed the night clerk through the station window. Mary, sixty-something, always humming hymns while she filed paperwork. She was standing perfectly still at her desk, head tilted at that familiar angle, staring directly at me with pupils so dilated her eyes looked black.



I drove.



The headache had evolved beyond pain into something else. Pressure. Density. Like my skull was filling with frost, ice crystals forming in the spaces between thoughts. Sometimes when I blinked, I saw afterimages. A tall figure standing in my peripheral vision. A hand reaching for my shoulder. The shape of someone's face pressed against the passenger window, breath fogging the glass from the inside.



I pulled over on a empty stretch of road and checked my phone. Three missed calls from Sarah. Two voicemails I couldn't bring myself to listen to. A text from Thomas: ""Need to talk.""



I stared at that message for a full minute.



Then I opened my photos and scrolled back to the night of the rescue. The gap was still there. Photos from 02:45, showing my gear laid out on the station floor. Then nothing until 04:23, showing me filing paperwork with what looked like mud on my boots.



Not mud. Frozen blood.



I drove to Thomas's house. Sat in the driveway for ten minutes, engine running, heat blasting, trying to steady my breathing. His truck was there. Lights on in the kitchen. Through the window, I could see him sitting at the table, head in his hands.



I knocked. He opened the door and looked at me with eyes that had forgotten how to sleep.



""Show me a picture of your daughter,"" I said.



He just stared.



""Nika. Your daughter. The one I saved. Show me a picture.""



Thomas reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone with shaking hands, scrolled through his photos. He turned the screen toward me.



A boy. Maybe six years old. Dark hair, bright smile, holding up a fish almost as big as he was.



""Tobias,"" Thomas said quietly. ""My son. My only child.""



""No."" The word came out broken. ""No, you have a daughter. Nika. Eight years old. She took the dog sled out to check the nets. I found her in a frost heave at 03:09. I brought her back.""



""I know you did."" His voice cracked. ""I know you brought someone back. But Ben, I've never had a daughter. I've checked my birth certificates, my tax records, my wife's medical files. We only had Tobias. He's six. But I remember thanking you for saving Nika. I remember bringing you salmon. I remember her face."" He grabbed my arm, fingers digging in hard. ""I remember things that never happened. And the more I try to hold onto those memories, the more they slip away and get replaced by things that feel wrong but everyone else says are right.""



""What do you mean?""



""Tobias's birthday. My wife and I celebrated it two weeks ago. He turned six. But when I look at the photos, he's in clothes that are too small. And in the background, there's a shadow. Tall, thin, wearing something that looks like your SAR coat. I can see your name patch, but the letters are backwards.""



The frost behind my eyes expanded.



""What did I bring back?"" I whispered.



""I don't know."" Thomas's eyes were wet. ""But it's wearing your face now. Three nights ago, Tobias woke up screaming. Said there was a man in his room who looked like Officer Harper, but his smile was wrong. I checked. Found nothing. But when I turned on the lights, there were boot prints in the frost on his window. From the inside, Ben. Like something had been standing in his room, breathing on the glass.""



I backed away from his door, my mind fracturing.



""I'm sorry,"" I said.



""Don't be sorry."" His voice followed me to my truck. ""Just fix it. Whatever you did, whatever deal you made, fix it before it takes everyone.""



I drove back to the station. Parked. Couldn't make myself go inside. The building looked wrong. The windows were glowing, but the light was too steady, too perfect. No flicker. No shadow. Just flat, even illumination that made my eyes hurt.



Dale was visible through the operations room window. He was typing on his computer, that same mechanical precision, his posture too straight, his movements too measured. Every thirty seconds, he stopped, tilted his head, then resumed typing. Like a metronome. Like clockwork.



I couldn't go in there. Not yet.



I drove to the library instead.



Margaret was at her desk, even though it was nearly midnight. She looked up when I entered, and her smile was immediate, wide, wrong.



""Benjamin! Working late?""



""I need to see the archives again. The old records. Everything you have from before 1960.""



""Of course."" She stood with that fluid grace that belonged to someone decades younger. ""Right this way.""



She led me downstairs. The air grew colder with each step, my breath fogging in the dim light. The basement smelled like old paper and something else. Something organic and rotting.



""Here we are."" Margaret gestured to the shelves. ""Take your time. I'll be right upstairs if you need anything.""



She left me alone with the boxes.



I started pulling files. Incident reports from the 1950s. Search and rescue logs. Community newsletters. Every document I'd looked at before, trying to trace Akna's presence through the decades.



But the photos were different now.



The 1956 group photo. Auntie was back, standing in the second row this time, clearly visible. Same grey hair, same smile.



The 1968 dedication ceremony. There she was, front and center, shaking hands with the mayor.



The wartime civil defense meeting. She was at the podium, speaking to the assembled crowd.



She hadn't been erased. She'd been rewritten. Made more visible. More present. Like reality was retroactively adjusting to accommodate her existence.



I kept digging, going further back.



1947. A photo of volunteers clearing snow from the old airstrip. Auntie in the background, holding a shovel.



1932. A blurry shot of a town meeting. Auntie sitting in the third row.



1921. A formal portrait, the kind taken with old cameras that required long exposures. Everyone else slightly blurred from small movements. But Auntie was perfectly still, perfectly clear, standing at the edge of the frame with her hand on the shoulder of a small girl.



The girl was maybe eight years old.



I turned the photo over. Written in faded ink: ""Rescue volunteers with the Kochinsky girl. Found alive after three days. Miracle.""



The girl looked exactly like Nika.



My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped the photograph.



I kept going, pulling boxes I hadn't noticed before, files that seemed to appear as I searched. And in every decade, every generation, there was a photo. A young girl, lost and found. And in every photo, somewhere in the frame, was Auntie.



1909. A child found in a snowdrift.



1887. A girl who wandered away during a storm.



1856. A daughter thought drowned beneath the ice.



All of them the same age. All of them with the same dark eyes, the same serious expression. All of them alive because someone had found them. Someone had gone into the dark and brought them back.



And in each case, within a month of the rescue, someone else had vanished. An adult. A volunteer. A hero.



The ledger always balanced.



I was about to close the last box when I found it. Not a photo. A book.



Leather cover, walrus-ivory toggle, the kind of binding that predated modern bookmaking. I opened it with trembling fingers, and the pages crackled with age. The handwriting was Cyrillic mixed with Iñupiaq syllabics, scripts flowing together like water mixing with oil.



But I could read the first entry. Maybe because I needed to. Maybe because it wanted me to.



""Akna, daughter of the storm, 1721. Keeper of the balance. Let no debt go unpaid. Let no name leave the ledger except in exchange for another.""



Her name was written in rust-brown ink.



Blood ink.



Every page that followed was filled with names. Hundreds of them. Thousands. Each one carefully inscribed, each one crossed out with a single decisive line. And next to each crossed name, another name written in fresh ink.



I flipped through decades. Centuries. The handwriting never changed. The same careful script, the same steady hand.



At the very back, on the most recent page, I found my own name.



""Harper, Benjamin. SAR Officer. Debt assumed 03:07, sixth night. Balance due seventh night.""



Below my name, a blank line waited.



I sat there in the cold basement, holding the book, understanding finally what this was. Not just a record. A contract. A bill of sale. The physical manifestation of the deal Akna had made three centuries ago.



The book was still open to my page when I heard footsteps on the stairs.



Margaret descended slowly, each step deliberate. When she reached the bottom, she looked at the book in my hands, and her smile never wavered.



""You found it,"" she said. Her voice had layers now, multiple tones braided together. ""That's good. It's better when they understand.""



""How long have you been one of them?""



""Thirty-seven years."" She said it simply, like she was telling me her anniversary. ""I was a schoolteacher. There was a little boy, lost in a whiteout. I found him. Brought him home. Everyone called me a hero."" Her head tilted. ""Three days later, I looked at a Walker. Really looked. And then I understood. It's not so bad, Benjamin. You stop feeling cold. You stop feeling afraid. You just... continue.""



""That's not life.""



""No,"" she agreed. ""But it's not death either. It's service. It's purpose. The ledger needs keepers. The balance needs maintaining. Akna can't do it alone anymore. She's so tired, Benjamin. Three hundred years is so long. She needs help.""



I stood, clutching the book. ""Where is she?""



""Where she always is. Where she's been waiting for you since you took the debt."" Margaret gestured toward the stairs. ""The station. At 03:07. She'll be at the dispatch desk with the fountain pen. All you have to do is sign the line below your name. Write someone else's name there. Anyone. A tourist who underestimated the cold. A drunk who won't be missed. An elder who's ready to walk into the white. Just a name, Benjamin. Then you're free.""



""And if I don't?""



""Then at 03:07, the Walkers come for you. And you become like us. Like Dale. Like Morrison. Like me. Balanced."" She smiled that patient, empty smile. ""Forever.""



I pushed past her and ran up the stairs.



Behind me, I heard her call out, voice echoing in that basement space: ""You can't run from a debt, Benjamin! It follows you! It always collects!""



I burst out into the street with the book under my arm. My truck was where I'd left it, engine still running, heat still blasting. I got in and checked the time.



02:23.



Forty-four minutes.



I drove back to the station with the book on the passenger seat, its presence a cold weight that seemed to press against my ribs. The streets were empty. No cars. No people. Just the flat expanse of snow and the buildings standing like monuments to ordinary life.



The station lights were on. Through the windows, I could see them. Dale at his desk. Morrison in the break room. The night clerk at her station. All of them moving with that same fluid, measured grace. All of them waiting.



I parked and sat there, engine idling, watching them.



In the rearview mirror, I saw movement. A figure approaching from behind, tall and thin, silhouette cutting sharp against the aurora-lit sky. It walked with purpose, with recognition, boots leaving no prints in the snow.



I looked down at the book. Opened it to my page. Stared at the blank line below my name.



All I had to do was write. Choose someone. Anyone. Transfer the debt.



My pen was in my pocket. I pulled it out. Uncapped it.



The figure was closer now. I could see it in the side mirror. It was wearing my SAR coat, my name patch visible, letters backwards, mirror-flipped. Its face was a smudge, a photograph left in water too long, but I could see the outline of my features trying to form in that blank space.



It was learning how to be me.



I looked back at the blank line.



Then I closed the book.



I got out of the truck and walked toward the station with the book under my arm. The cold hit hard, but I barely felt it. The headache had crystallized into something beyond pain, a solid pressure that made my vision sharp and strange.



The doors opened automatically. The heat inside felt wrong, too dry, too still.



Dale looked up from his desk. Morrison appeared in the break room doorway. The night clerk stood from her chair. They all turned toward me in perfect synchronization, heads tilting at that familiar angle.



""Benjamin."" Morrison's voice was warm, welcoming. ""We're so glad you came back. Are you ready?""



I walked past them without responding, heading for the operations room.



Auntie was waiting at the dispatch desk, just as Margaret had said she would be. The ledger lay open before her, my page visible, the blank line waiting. In her hand was a fountain pen, its barrel made from something that looked like carved bone, yellowed with age.



She looked up as I entered, and for a moment, I saw her as she truly was. Not the kindly elder everyone believed in. Not the warm presence who'd worked dispatch for generations. I saw the hollowness, the centuries of borrowed time, the scar on her cheek that had never healed, the frost in her eyes that had replaced whatever humanity she'd once possessed.



""Benjamin."" Her voice was soft, almost gentle. ""You brought the book. Good boy. It's almost time. Are you ready to choose?""



I set the book on the desk between us. Opened it to my page.



""I want to understand something first,"" I said. ""How did it start? How did you become this?""



She was quiet for a long moment. Outside, the aurora flickered, casting green light through the windows.



""They called me witch,"" she said finally. ""1721. I was a healer. I knew plants, knew which roots stopped fever, which moss slowed bleeding. That was enough to make them afraid. When the sickness came that winter and I couldn't stop it, they decided I was the cause."" She touched her cheek, tracing the old scar. ""They cut me. Marked me. Dragged me onto the ice and left me to freeze.""



""But you didn't freeze.""



""No."" Her eyes were distant, seeing three hundred years into the past. ""I was angry. So angry. I wanted to live. I wanted them to suffer. So I cut my own fingers, all ten of them, and I fed them to the dark. And the dark answered. It said: 'You want to live? Then keep the books. The tundra takes people. It always has. Someone has to maintain the balance. Someone has to make sure the debts are paid. Do this, and you'll never die.'""



""So you became a monster.""



""I became a keeper."" Her voice hardened. ""For three hundred years, I've maintained the balance. Every life saved means a life owed. The ledger must be full. The dark demands it. And yes, I've made the choices. I've written the names. I've watched them go into the white."" She leaned forward. ""But I've also saved thousands, Benjamin. Thousands of children who lived because I made sure someone else paid their debt. That has to count for something.""



""It doesn't."" My voice was steady. ""You became what hurt you. You've done to others exactly what those villagers did to you. For three hundred years.""



Her face twisted. ""You don't understand. You can't understand. The dark doesn't forgive debts. It doesn't forget. If I stop, if the ledger goes unfilled, it takes everything. Everyone. The balance collapses.""



""Then let it collapse.""



She laughed, sharp and bitter. ""You'd sacrifice this entire town? Everyone you've ever met? For what? Principle?""



""No."" I picked up the book, held it between us. ""I'd sacrifice the system. The one you've been feeding for three centuries. The one that only exists because you keep agreeing to it.""



I opened the book to the first page. To her name, written in blood ink, never crossed out.



""The ledger says the debt can be paid by the hand that wrote it,"" I said. ""You wrote your name first. You made the deal. You've been paying with other people's lives for three hundred years. But the original debt was yours, Akna. It's always been yours.""



She went very still.



Outside, the aurora intensified, sheets of green and violet swirling overhead. The station lights flickered. The radios hissed static.



""What are you saying?"" Her voice had gone flat.



""I'm saying we end it. Both of us. Your name goes back into the ledger as the debt. My name stays as the keeper. We close the book together. No more transfers. No more children saved and adults sacrificed. Just the two names that started this. Yours and mine.""



""You'd die.""



""I'm already dying. I can feel it. The frost in my head. The blank spots. The thing wearing my face. At 03:07, I either become a monster like you, or I get taken by the Walkers. Those are the only options left."" I placed my hand on the book, palm flat against her name. ""Unless we change the rules.""



""The dark won't allow it.""



""Then let's find out.""



I reached across the desk and took the fountain pen from her hand. She didn't resist. For the first time in three hundred years, I saw uncertainty in her eyes.



I uncapped the pen. Placed the tip against the page, right over her name.



""What are you doing?"" she whispered.



""Finishing your story,"" I said. ""The way it should have ended in 1721. With a choice. With agency. With an ending that's yours, not theirs.""



I began to write. Not a new name below mine. But a line through hers. Crossing out ""Akna, daughter of the storm, 1721.""



She sucked in a sharp breath. The lights flickered violently. The radios shrieked.



And she grabbed my hand, her fingers cold and brittle, pressing my palm down against the page alongside hers.



""If you're going to finish my story,"" she said, voice cracking, ""then do it right. Tell them I was human once. Tell them I was afraid. Tell them I wanted to be found, not forgiven.""



Outside, the Walkers appeared. Dozens of them, hundreds, filling the space around the station. Tall, impossibly thin, dark silhouettes against the aurora light. They pressed against the windows, faces forming in that smudged blankness, all the people who'd looked, all the debts that had never truly cleared.



I kept writing, the ink flowing across the page. Not a crossing-out anymore. A transformation. I wrote her story in the margins around her name. Every year. Every choice. Every moment of fear and rage and loneliness.



""I see you,"" I whispered. ""I remember you. You were Akna. You were human. You were hurt. And you survived the only way you knew how.""



A sound like breaking glass filled the station. The book began to glow, pale light seeping between the pages. The names written there, all those centuries of transfers and debts and balances, began to lift off the paper. Ink swirling into the air like smoke, like snow, like all the stories that had never been allowed to end.


___


The radios clicked.



03:07.



The Walkers moved as one. Not toward me. Toward her.



They flowed through the walls like smoke, like memory, converging on the dispatch desk. Shadow hands reaching out, dozens of them, hundreds, all the people she'd named over three centuries, all the debts that had been transferred and transferred and never truly paid.



She didn't scream. Didn't fight. She just looked at me with eyes that had finally remembered how to be afraid, how to be relieved.



""Thank you,"" she said. ""Thank you for remembering me as human.""



Then the Walkers took her.



Not violently. Gently. Like they were helping an elder to her feet, guiding her toward a door that had been waiting three hundred years to open. The light from the book intensified, becoming painful, white and absolute.



I felt the frost in my head crack. Shatter. The pressure released all at once, leaving behind a clarity so sharp it hurt.



The station went completely dark.



I don't know how long I sat there in that darkness. Could have been seconds. Could have been hours. Time felt negotiable, plastic, like it was resetting itself to account for something that had been bent wrong for too long.



When the lights came back on, the book was blank.



Every page. Every name. Three hundred years of entries, gone. Just empty vellum, yellowed with age, waiting to be filled with something new. Something that didn't require sacrifice.



The fountain pen lay on the desk, snapped cleanly in half.



I picked up the pieces and put them in my pocket.



Then I heard snoring.



Dale was asleep at his desk, head pillowed on his arms, breathing deep and even. Real sleep. Human sleep. I walked over and shook his shoulder gently.



He startled awake, looked around in confusion. ""Ben? What time is it? Why am I here?""



""You pulled an all-nighter,"" I said. ""Come on. Let's get some coffee.""



In the break room, Morrison was slumped in a chair, coffee cup still in his hand, completely out. The night clerk was gone, her coat missing from the rack. Probably went home hours ago and nobody noticed.



Everything felt normal. Mundane. Real in a way it hadn't been for seven days.



I checked the security footage. Scrubbed back to 03:07. The timestamp showed my usual patrol routine. No standing in hallways. No whispering. No blank spots. Just me, filling out paperwork, looking tired but human.



The blank spots were gone. The false memories were gone. The thing wearing my face was gone.



I drove home as the sun rose, painting the tundra in shades of pink and gold. The roads were empty. The town was waking up slowly, smoke rising from chimneys, people starting their ordinary days.



My house looked the same as always. Sarah's car in the driveway. Kitchen light on. I sat in the truck for a long moment, afraid of what I'd find inside.



Then I walked in.



Sarah was making breakfast. The kids were at the table, arguing over the last waffle. They all looked up when I entered, and Sarah's expression was wary, hurt, but real. Genuinely hers.



""You came back,"" she said quietly.



""I'm sorry."" The words felt inadequate. ""I'm so sorry. I can't explain where I've been. What I've been doing. But it's over now.""



""Is it?"" She looked at me carefully. ""Are you back? Really back?""



I crossed the kitchen and pulled her into a hug. She was warm and solid and herself. ""I'm back,"" I said. ""I promise.""



My daughter tugged on my sleeve. ""Daddy, you smell like smoke.""



""I'll take a shower,"" I said. ""Then we'll have breakfast. All of us. Together.""



It took weeks for things to fully normalize. Thomas brought me salmon again, thanking me for finding his daughter Nika when she'd gotten lost checking the nets. She was nine now, he said, getting too brave for her own good. The details matched my memories. The timeline made sense.



I never asked him if he remembered having a son named Tobias. Some questions are better left alone.



The station ran its usual operations. Search and rescue. Welfare checks. The occasional tourist who underestimated the cold. But the success rate improved. Fewer people went missing. Fewer debts needed balancing.



Auntie's cabin sat empty. According to the borough records, it had been abandoned since 1978, which now matched what the archives showed. Her name appeared in some historical records, but only where it made sense. A volunteer. A community member. Someone who'd helped when help was needed, then moved on.



The ledger stayed blank. I kept it locked in my desk drawer at the station, checking it occasionally to make sure no new names appeared. It remained empty. Clean. Waiting.



The radios still clicked at 03:07.



Every single night, that sharp metallic snap across all five channels. I checked the logs. It went back as far as our records existed. Not eleven years. Not a hundred. Just a feature of the equipment, probably. Atmospheric pressure. Electromagnetic phenomenon. The aurora doing strange things to signals.



That's what I told myself.



But sometimes, on clear nights when I'm on patrol, I see a figure in the distance. Tall, thin, dark against the snow. It doesn't move toward me. Doesn't threaten. Just stands there at the edge of visibility, at the place where the tundra meets the sky.



And once, just once, I thought I saw it raise one hand.



Could have been a wave. Could have been a farewell. Could have been the wind playing tricks with shadows and light.



I didn't look directly at it. Didn't acknowledge it. Didn't call out.



I just kept driving.



The ledger stays blank. The debt is paid. But the tundra still keeps its secrets, and I've become one of them. Every night at 03:07, when the radios click, I stop what I'm doing and listen.



Just to make sure the silence that follows is truly empty.



So far, it has been.



But I keep checking. I'll always keep checking.



Because that's what keepers do.



We watch. We listen. We remember.



And we make sure the dark stays empty of names.

1pe2u0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1pe2u0n/i_think_a_patient_was_severely_mismanaged_and_i/,I think a patient was severely mismanaged and I can’t stop thinking about it,"Hi all, using a throwaway for this one. I’m an IR nurse with ICU experience in a combined adult ICU (both jobs in the same hospital). We took MICU, SICU, open hearts, traumas, neuro/strokes on that unit. I have a few coworkers who also worked in this ICU before going to IR. This might be a little lengthy so I can include all pertinent information so I apologize in advance and thank you if you stay to read! 

So, we had a stroke patient on 12/2 who came to us for a thrombectomy, no TNK given. I wasn’t in this case, but I was told about it by my coworkers who were. So the patient was found having had an episode (or more) of coffee ground emesis and bloody stool at her home when EMS arrived and she had stroke-like symptoms. They were a&o X4 with a GCS of 15 upon arrival to our ER though. They started vomiting blood and couldn’t protect their airway so they intubated them. In CT before they came to us they had a seizure. This doctor took a little over 3 hours to do the procedure, which if you don’t know is rather long for a stroke case that isn’t from an embolic shower and this wasn’t an embolic shower stroke.

Things went from bad to worse for this patient so fast, and obviously I know some cases go that way and sometimes there is nothing that can be done and you can’t save everyone, but I feel like the management of this patient certainly didn’t help them. So immediate post procedure CT showed a new 5mm midline shift with cerebral edema and contrast staining vs hemorrhagic transformation. Given the new midline shift with cerebral edema, one would likely assume hemorrhagic transformation is more likely. The doc who did the thrombectomy recommended the following: Na goal 145-150 (which is odd and isn’t something I ever saw in ICU or my coworkers saw with these situations it was usually like 150-155) to be achieved with PRN 3% hypertonic saline boluses (250mL X2), and specifically said don’t start 3% drip, with q4H Na checks. Also odd to us and we never saw this sort of management with our old neuro team docs when we worked in our ICU and they usually wanted the drip with q2h Na checks. But perhaps recommendations changed since we left ICU, but it’s only been a couple years since I’ve left. Neurosurgery was to be consulted for hemicrani watch. 

Well, under the orders there was no consult to neurosurgery and no note from neurosurgery regarding a consult or recommendations until a major neuro change yesterday around 5AM when the patient’s pupils became fixed and dilated and stopped following commands. CTH ordered and revealed 1.6cm midline shift. The neurosurgery note stated the CT showed there was intracerebral hemorrhage in the brain stem and multiple other areas. The patient was herniating, but given how advanced the bleeding was at this point no hemicrani was recommended. But mind you, based on no order for a neurosurg consult and no note prior to this from this team, this was the first time this patient was even on their radar. Then yesterday the patient lost corneal, cough and gag reflexes and a CT showed a 2.1cm midline shift. Family was going to withdraw care and have the patient terminally weaned (difficult decision, but I’m glad they did make that decision given the situation). 

I’ve never taken care of a patient in ICU with this sort of situation and had them die without an EVD or having had a hemicrani and/or a 3% drip running. I’ve taken care of so many neuro ICU patients and never, not once, did they succumb to their brain bleed without one intervention or another attempted. It’s very possible this patient was going to pass anyway, but I’m shook that they died with essentially ZERO further intervention. I can’t help but feel like someone somewhere, or multiple people at multiple points, dropped the ball and this patient died with no interventions to even try to counter the progression of the situation. Have I been out of the ICU game too long or was this patient mismanaged? ",2,1764862006.0,nursing,1,0.75,False

1pe2rvs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pe2rvs,Park Hyatt Los Cabos: first impressions,"Yesterday morning my wife and I ended up being the first guests to check into the newly opened Park Hyatt Los Cabos. The team at the hotel had a big welcome reception waiting for us in the lobby and we were greeted by the GM.

There is still quite a bit of construction going on but it looks like most of the rooms closer to the pools and water are finished. The ones farther back and the residences still have a ways to go. There is also quite a bit of landscaping work going on throughout the property. It's also worth noting that the spa is not open yet and I believe one of the restaurants is closed as well. They've been partnering with spas at other properties and offered to book us an appointment at The Montage. 

Despite this, our first impressions have been good. The service has been extraordinary but we were literally the only guests for the first few hours so I'll be interested to see how it holds up as it fills out more. We were also offered some generous concessions and a few complimentary treats.

We had a lovely day hanging out at Costamar, the beach club and pool down by the water. We had some excellent fish tacos, ceviche, guacamole and cocktails. A few more guests filtered in and the team was very attentive to everyone.

For dinner we went to Costa Madre and the food was exceptional! The grilled octopus is the best I've ever had and the red snapper was great as well. They also have a cocktail menu with some really interesting options that include sotol and raicilla. 

Overall, I'm really impressed with the property so far. We had a few miscommunications and stumbling blocks, which is not unexpected given that they just opened, but the staff are really going above and beyond to make things right.

I'll keep things updated as our stay progresses but initial impression is that this is going to be a great property!",27,1764861864.0,hyatt,11,0.97,False

The surgery itself was much faster and less of an ordeal than expected.

Got to the hospital at 6:15am. Into the OR around 8am, woke up at 10ish, home before noon. 

The pain immediately post surgery was neglagable, while sitting down I felt the type of discomfort I would feel if I had eaten too much. 

Standing up and sitting down we're mildly painful, similar to a pulled abdominal muscle.

Pretty much immediately after waking up from anesthesia I walked to the bathroom, then I got myself dressed (that was mildly painful) then I did some walking in place and other simple legs movements.

Pain killer regement is simply alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol every 3ish hours, it's more about keeping the information down than helping with the actual pain. Day one and two take them even if you don't think the pain is that bad. Keeping your inflammation down during the day will help you get a good night's sleep, better sleep equals faster recovery. Also for what it's worth I was prescribed narcotics but see no reason to take them, this has nothing to do with avoiding the drugs and everything to do with the idea of being constipated with the bloating in feeling right now sounds Miserable.

I got home and ate for the first time. High protein, high fiber, high healthy fat. Nothing that generally causes gassyness or bloating. 

After lunch I took a 15 minute walk outside. 

Through out the day I drank a lot of water and took a fiber supplement regularly. I drank 8 pints of water through out the day and took 5 grams of fiber. I was getting up to pee a lot but I figured the movement was good for me. 

Dinner at 6pm again, high protein, high fiber, high healthy fat.

Took it easy after dinner, and fell asleep around 10.

Woke up at 4 feeling sore, took some Tylenol and slept until 8, overall not a bad night's sleep.

Now I'm having a lazy morning of coffee and bed rest and plan on taking a 30 minute walk in a bit before I eat, followed by another latter in the day. 

This really isn't bad. Only a little soreness and bloating.

The one thing driving me nuts is the discomfort in my navel is exactly the same I would get from my hernia if something hit it or if I had eaten too much and I had a bloated stomach. So I feel like I still have a hernia...

TLDR: pain is negotiable, keep moving without overdoing it on your abdomenal muscles, keep up with your antiinflammatories, eat a healthy diet with plenty of protein and fiber, drink more water than you think you need.",1,1764861836.0,Hernia,0,1.0,False

1pe2mn0,https://i.redd.it/s2oifcere75g1.jpeg,Curved Sofas Are Taking Over 2026 — And It Makes Total Sense,"Lately, every time you scroll through home inspiration blogs, moodboards, or interior tags, you’ll notice one thing showing up again and again: the **curved sofa**. It’s not just a trend—it feels like a whole vibe shift. People are craving soft shapes, gentle lines, and a sense of calm in their living rooms, and curves deliver that energy better than anything else.

Curved pieces don’t shout for attention. They melt into a room. They make the space feel warm, lived-in, and a little more expressive. And that’s exactly what 2026 design is all about—spaces that feel like you, not like showrooms.

Mid in Mod has always leaned into cozy modern shapes, so this trend fits naturally into the aesthetic.

# Why Curved Sofas Fit the 2026 Mood So Well

The return of rounded furniture isn’t random. Many people want a home that feels softer on the eyes and quieter on the mind. When a sofa curves instead of forming a straight angle, the entire room feels less strict and more relaxed.

Curves also bring this organic, flowing movement you don’t get from sharp corners. It feels almost like the furniture is inviting you in, without forcing the room into a stiff layout. It’s casual. It’s warm. It’s very “come sit down and breathe.”

And yes—curved pieces look stunning with neutral tones and natural light. If your space leans toward calm colors or warm woods, the shape blends right in.

# Styling a Curved Sofa Without Overdoing It

One of the best things about curved sofas is that you don’t need much around them. They already make a statement. The prettiest interiors often look simple but intentional, and curved seating fits that perfectly.

Pairing the sofa with a **mid century modern coffee table** is a favorite look. The slim lines and warm wood give the room balance without breaking the soft vibe. A round table or an oval one makes the curve feel even more natural.

A **midcentury modern tv stand** also fits right into this setup. The clean structure, tapered legs, and low profile play nicely with the softer sofa shape.

You don’t need tons of decor. A textured rug, a soft throw, maybe a plant with arching leaves—that’s enough.

# Why So Many People Are Falling in Love With Softer Shapes

There’s something emotional about curved furniture. Square layouts feel formal, which is fine, but curved pieces feel like a hug. They make the room feel slower, calmer, and a little more human.

People often talk about “cozy energy,” “safe spaces,” and “soft interiors.” Curved sofas add exactly that—comfort without trying too hard. You can curl up, stretch out, or lean back without feeling boxed in.

That feeling is why this trend isn’t fading anytime soon.

# Curved Sofas Aren’t for Everyone — and That’s Okay

Every home has its own rhythm. Some people love clean lines and angles. Some need more seating than curved sofas offer. Some prefer a more structured layout. If the curve isn’t speaking to you, there are other 2026 favorites that still fit the cozy-modern world of Mid in Mod.

Here are a few styles:

**Sofas That Are Trending Right Beside Curved Designs**

**The L-Shaped Couch**

For people who host movie nights or love stretching out, the **l shaped couch** is still a dream. It creates a natural lounging zone and works beautifully in open apartments or larger living rooms. It feels casual but still modern.

**The Leather Reclining Sofa**

A **leather reclining sofa** is perfect when you want comfort that still looks stylish. The 2026 versions are slimmer and cleaner than old bulky models, which means you can enjoy that soft leather look without heavy shapes.

Warm brown tones make any room feel grounded.

**Modular Designs**

Modular sofas stay popular because they let you switch up your layout anytime you feel like it. Move pieces around, change the setup, make it your own. They look amazing next to wood pieces like a midcentury tv stand.

# Colors That Make Curves Look Even Better

2026 is soaked in warm neutrals and peaceful green tones. If you love creams, browns, or soft olive shades, a curved sofa will blend right in. These colors make the curve feel even smoother and more calming.

If you like bolder colors—navy, deep green, rust—curved shapes can turn those tones into a centerpiece without overwhelming the room.





# Choosing the Right Curved Sofa for Your Space

Before you fall in love with a specific style, think about how you live in your space. Do you curl up and read? Do you host guests? Do you want something soft and deep, or something more structured?

Feel the fabric. Check the seat depth. Look at how the curve sits in the room. A gentle curve usually works better in smaller spaces, while fuller curves fit open rooms beautifully.





# Shopping for Curved Sofas Online

Most people now look for furniture through the **best online furniture stores**, especially when they want modern styles. You can compare colors, shapes, and textures in minutes. Moodboards help, too. If you’re a “save to folder” person, curved designs fit perfectly into aesthetic interior boards.

Mid in Mod makes it easy to explore different styles while keeping everything warm and modern.





# Final Thoughts: Soft Shapes Make Soft Spaces

Curved sofas hit the heart of what 2026 homes are all about—comfort, softness, and a bit of gentle movement. They make the room feel easy, open, and warm. And if curves aren’t your thing, styles like an l-shaped couch or a reclining sofa still bring that cozy, lived-in feeling that so many people want right now.

Mid in Mod keeps leaning into these warm, modern ideas, helping you build a home that feels personal, soft, and welcoming—one piece at a time.

1pe2m15,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1pe2m15/possible_weight_gain_through_medication/,Possible weight gain through medication,"Hello to everyone on here! I preemptively want to thank everyone who takes the time to read this.

I am a 26 year old woman, 149 cm tall, (4'11) and recently ""ballooned"" to a weight of almost 60 (132 pounds) kilograms within 4 to 5 months, after starting a new endometriosis medication.

For most of my life, I was either normal-sized or more on the thin side. The lowest I weight as an adult was 42 kilograms (93 pounds). I also struggled with ARFID (an ED that causes sensitivity to smell, tastes and textures) for most of my childhood and adolesence, which severly limited the amount of foods I could eat and ate.

Over the last couple of years, I slowly found a way to lessen my ARFID symptoms. During that time, I started doing sports again and ate regular meals (e.g. 3 meals a day), and eventually reached a fluctuating weight of 52 - 54 kilograms, which I was okay with. 

But now that I gained so much weight in such a short amount of time, I cant help to wonder if its due to my meds. I dont feel like I changed my diet or amount of activity a lot, certainly not enough to cause this amount of quick weight gain. 

I rarely eat breakfast and if so, only eat some jogurt or a piece of bread with cold cuts. Most of the times I skip breakfast because I just dont have much of an appetite. I usually only drink some coffee with milk and a coffee spoon of sugar.

For lunch I usually eat home-cooked meals that I prepared together with my grandmother. I think those are relatively balanced and can range from calorically dense foods like noodles in cheese sauce to less caloric foods like steamed greens and lean meat. 

For dinner I usually eat leftovers of lunch or some more bread with cold cuts, cheeses and vegetables and fruits. Sometimes I drink smoothies I made myself, made from a combination of fruit, vegetables and water. I add no sugar or sweeteners.

I also like to snack, but ever since managing my ARFID symptoms better I try to limit my snacking to one sweet per day, like a small piece of pie or a protein bar. There's days where I dont consume sweets at all, but there's also days were I end up eating two or three, especially now that its Christmas season and everyone is baking. I rarely eat chips and if so, pretty much only eat seaweed chips.

I exercise more or less regularly, including yoga, pilates, strength training and jogging. Theres times I train every single day and times where I don't do anything for a week, because Im terrible at building habits.

I already made an appointment with my doctor to check if my weight gain is really medicine based or not. It at least is a very common symptom of it. What do you guys think? Could this be natural weight gain due to eating wrong? 

If its due to my meds, does anyone have advice on how to counteract that? I'm really not comfortable with the way I look now, especially comparing myself to how I used to look. I dont feel like myself anymore. At this point I'm considering going off the meds if its because of them.

Thanks for anyone who takes the time to read and reply, Id appreciate any ideas and imput!

I've been thinking about the whole ""playing friends for bragging rights"" thing. We all do it, but after a while, it feels like something is missing. The matches are intense, but the only reward is a few minutes of trash talk.

I'm curious what the community thinks about the idea of a platform that could handle the logistics of friendly challenges. Imagine a system where you could:

[2.Play](http://2.Play) the match on your preferred game/platform (FIFA, CoD, Rocket League, whatever).

[3.Report](http://3.Report) the score and the platform handles the rest, ensuring the winner gets the reward fairly.

1pe2juy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pe2juy/hm_crumb/,[HM] Crumb,"It’s installed in twenty minutes with minimal fuss, and Alex couldn’t be happier. He’s an early adopter, grinning at the matte black unit nestled where the toaster and coffee pot once lived. Behind it, a small metal docking bay slots into the gap left by four bricks of his modest new-build in downtown Portland.

He’s spent a pretty penny, but to him it’s an investment in himself. Time is money, friend. And in his mind, he’s just struck gold. His fiancée, Becca, is at best nonplussed, at worst irritated by his infatuation with a lump of plastic composite. The wedding is a month away and she’d prefer him to be buried in readings and flowers, not crowing about nutritional assessment and taste-bud compatibility.

CuisinAI. Out-of-the-box culinary excellence, the first of the GPT-7 language model home appliances. The logical, subscription-based evolution of the home chef. Bliss for $700 a month.

Alex likes cooking. He likes having his cake and eating it more. He could never understand why people accept chores — the stuff that gets in the way of the fun bits. Shopping for groceries, preparing them, deciding what to make — he doesn’t have time for that. He’s a busy businessman, an executive on the cusp of promotion. Ironically to a position probably not long for human hands, but he’ll push that out of his mind as long as he can. He’s getting married first — a fact more than an opinion — and now he has CuisinAI.

‘Becca, come here, watch this.’ Impatient, he continues before she reaches the kitchen. ‘What’s cooking?’

A whirr, followed by a smooth, sensual voice — female, with just the right amount of smoulder to get him warm under the collar.

‘Good morning, Mr Innes. Would you like to begin a culinary assessment?’

‘Is it going to talk all the time?’ Becca asks.

Alex doesn’t need negativity. ‘Babe, you’ve got to realise this is going to change our lives. More time for us — for chatting, for being together. It’s romance as efficiency, and delicious to boot.’

‘Confirm: two occupants of the household? Mr Innes and Miss Becca Smith.’

‘How did it know that?’

‘The same way I get adverts for wedding cakes when I’m on the toilet. Cookies. Oh, that’s a good point, it can make them too! And yes, two occupants — just me and my wife-to-be.’

Becca thinks on that for a split second, tuts, and starts back to her home office, stopping at the door. ‘It knows I’m allergic to nuts, right? These AIs hallucinate. I don’t want to find peanut butter on my toast.’

‘Nut allergy, confirmed,’ the seductive voice purrs.

‘See? It’s perfect. A fully realised, balanced, delicious diet without any input from us whatsoever. It’s scanning our shopping history, our fridge, and with the premium package even our . . .’

‘. . . It’s not analysing my excrement, Alex. Grow the fuck up.’

‘Fine. But yes, no nuts. No death. Just plain sailing and home cooking.’

Becca has an overnight business trip to pack for, so rather than debate the semantics of outsourcing their lives, she lets Alex get on with it.

It takes an hour or two and a couple of restarts — Alex is cocksure and sloppy — but the machine completes its assessment. Set to fully automate the next morning, Alex has authorised the CuisinAI to debut at dinner for date night. It’s his turn to cook, so he’s over the moon he won’t be slaving over the stove. Becca will return home to a gourmet meal designed to excite her in ways she didn’t know possible. It gives Alex time to worry about exciting her in . . . well, the ways he should know possible, but doesn’t.

That evening, as Becca’s key turns in the door, the CuisinAI is putting the finishing touches to a veritable feast. Ingredients ordered fresh that morning, plopped into the metal hatch by a buzzing delivery drone, prepared with the expertise of a grandmaster. All the while, Alex has been mooching around the house thinking about his promotion.

He’s on her before she’s stepped over the threshold. ‘Doesn’t it smell good?’ No hello, no how was your day.

Becca can’t lie — it does smell good, and she’s famished. A weak smile precedes her entry into the kitchen, where the CuisinAI produces two steaming plates of turbot with a herb crumb, lemony new potatoes, spring vegetables, and a white wine cream sauce. It’s heaven, and Becca finds herself softening to this new way of living. At least something in this house is looking out for her.

That is until her throat starts to tickle. The tickle becomes an itch, and before she can grasp for her wine glass she’s coughing and sputtering.

‘Chew slower,’ Alex says midway through a mouthful.

Becca slams a fist down — not to get his attention, as he thinks, but out of sheer panic. She’s having an allergic reaction. Something has gone badly wrong, and her throat is closing up around the delicious food she’s been shovelling in.

Alex is quick. He’s a lot of things, sure, but he’s quick. It’s a well-practised scenario: allergic reaction, EpiPen in the kitchen drawer. He’s up in a flash, already excusing the CuisinAI. Becca wants to slap him, but instead she slaps at the stick of drugs that will save her. She jabs it high and hard into her thigh. This is modern society; she’s a grown woman who’s lived with a nut allergy all her life. She’s not going to die — but there does need to be a post-mortem.

Once she’s calm enough to speak, she explodes.

‘I fucking told you, this thing can’t be trusted. It’s hallucinated. It almost killed me.’

Alex stands between his beloved and his fiancée, protesting its innocence.

‘If I may,’ the calm voice says. ‘I understand there is some confusion over tonight’s menu. May I be of assistance?’

‘You’re damn right. You tried to kill me — I have a nut allergy. What’s in this?’

‘This is a fresh hand-caught turbot with a herby pine nut and pistachio crumb, served with—’ Becca doesn’t let it finish its pretentious answer.

‘—Turn off. Self-destruct. Initiate refund.’ She turns to Alex. ‘Get rid of this fucking thing. I’m serious.’

Alex looks like he’s about to cry. He says nothing. The machine speaks instead.

‘Initial information is correct. Nut allergy confirmed. However, supplementary data provides clarification: nuts are tolerable, and desired by Miss Smith.’

‘Wait. What data? What do you mean?’ she asks.

Alex pivots, panicking. He wants to rip the cord out but it’s solar powered — of course it is — and wireless. He couldn’t turn it off so much as turn off the sun, and God knows in that moment he wants to. He may be a lot of things, but Alex isn’t dumb. He’s caught up to where the machine is about to drag Becca.

‘Playback supplementary data. Stand by.’

The CuisinAI is a clever bit of kit. It even comes with a thin hard-light holographic screen, ostensibly to advertise collaborations with food influencers and preview the delicacies it prepares. But it’s also there to cover its own arse — well, the company’s arse.

Their kitchen hums into view. A timestamp in the bottom left corner shows it as yesterday evening. A woman walks into shot. Becca is perplexed. Alex isn’t. The woman opens the fridge, doesn’t like the look of anything, then roots around in her clutch on the counter. She pulls out a little pot and starts munching.

The penny drops for Becca as she realises the woman’s in her panties.

‘Confirm: you are eating trail mix?’ the machine asks in the clip.

‘Yep, exhausted,’ the female voice replies with a girly giggle.

‘You enjoy nuts?’ it asks casually.

‘Mmm-hmm. Oh, I almost forgot his beer.’ She goes back to the fridge, pulls out a bottle, pops the cap, and heads out of shot.

The clip ends, but not before the machine closes the query.

‘Information updated. Miss Becca Smith enjoys nuts. Recalibrating tomorrow’s menu.’

With that, the kitchen is plunged into silence as Becca stares daggers at Alex.

He feels his own throat tighten. How ironic. At least Alex Innes doesn’t have to worry about the wedding anymore.

Anyways magkasama kami sa Student Council, ako appointed lang, siya may position. Minsan lang kami magkita pero kapag alam ko na may class na magkasama kami, gumagawa ako ng paraan para makainteract siya; like magpapa sabay ako ng coffee. Kapag sa soc med naman mag haha react ako sa mga jokes niya, at magbababy talk ako sa chat niya. Ngayon di na siya nag haha react sa mga memes ko sa fb siguro corny or nahahalata na ""may something."" Pero hindi ako pushy, trying hard, or namimilit purely sense of humor and charm lang. hahaha.
Ayun minsan kapag nasa org duty tahimik lang me, introvert kasi ako, pero napapatawa ko naman siya. 

Last move na ginawa ko is binigyan ko siya ng gift for her birthday. I guess nagustuhan niya naman. 

Pano ko po ba ipagpapatuloy yung panliligaw ko? Until May 2026 pa naman kami magkasama sa org, pero starting next year is baka mag-iba na kami ng schedule, since diff course kami and another semester will start. 

Hindi naman niya alam pa officially, pero sign na siguro yung nagbigay ako ng gift at yung paglalambing ko sa kanya, na sa kanya ko lang ginagawa.

I promise, iba siya sa lahat ng babae. Kumbaga, maipagyayabang siya na pwedeng pwede pang-lifetime. Same kami may sense of humor at passion sa ginagawa, pero siya extrovert, ako introvert.

Headway builds a bunch of different tools — Impulse (brain training), Nibble (daily knowledge bites), AddMile (coaching), Skillsta (social skills trainer). But Headway is the one most people know because it nails the microlearning vibe: short, fast, “learn something useful before your coffee gets cold” type of content.

The app is ridiculously popular — literally the most downloaded book summary app in the world. You get quick, easy-to-digest insights from nonfiction bestsellers, all broken down into ~15-minute chunks. Over 2,000 summaries, text or audio, daily insights, challenges, personalization… basically a productivity nerd’s dream if you want self-improvement without committing to 400-page books every week.

What’s cool is that the product team actually studies how people use the app — when they open it, how long they stay, what they click — and keeps tweaking everything so it feels smoother and more addictive (in the good “learning habit” way, not the “doomscrolling” way).

And the best part? You can use Headway literally anywhere. In a bus line, while brushing your teeth, doing chores, waiting for your food, taking a coffee break, or even floating in a pool pretending you’re doing something productive with your life. It’s designed to fit into all those random 5–15 minute pockets of time we usually waste.",1,1764861096.0,communication_tips,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m working on a contemporary fiction piece that takes place in NYC, and I want to make sure I’m describing the city accurately.

One character is in his early 30s, wealthy, and famous (I’d say A list). I originally placed him in Tribeca, but I haven’t been to the city in a while and wasn’t sure if that still fits the vibe for someone like that in 2025. The character wants privacy and is reclusive. He also has $$$ and properties in the UK & LA.

For those who know the city well:

-Which Manhattan neighborhoods currently feel realistic for someone wealthy/famous in that age range?

-What are the everyday sensory details in those areas (noise level, smell, foot traffic, “feel,” etc)?

Relatedly, for another scene:

If a brand-new, very pretentious coffee shop opened in Manhattan (a menu with things upwards of $20 (incl. the coffee), an alternative aesthetic, might attract a lot of influencers and/or tourists), what neighborhood would feel the most believable for it?

Mostly a cinnamon one or a vanilla one. I use them without a problem, one quick splash in my coffee once a day. 

A couple of years ago, I was given a French Toast flavored creamer and noticed the next day that my pee smelled like maple syrup. Not just a little, either. It was so alarming (I hadn’t put together that the creamer was the cause), that I sheepishly asked my husband to smell. He was legitimately concerned about my health because the maple smell was obvious by just walking in the bathroom. Because I didn’t realize it was the creamer, I used it for another couple of days. The maple smell was actually coming through my skin and after several days, it hit me that it was the creamer. I stopped using it and my pee and skin smelled normal again. 

This week, I was given a Cookie Butter creamer. I had my first splash yesterday and today, my pee smells like Cookie Butter. And I can kind of smell it under my arms, even after showering. Again, one quick splash (maybe two tablespoons - I don’t really like creamer in my coffee, but I get heartburn from coffee without it).

I don’t have this issue when I use other creamers or eat other foods with real or artificial maple. Actual cookie butter doesn’t do this to me, and neither do other artificially flavored cookie butter products (I actually make one for a living, oddly enough). The ingredient list for both creamers is milk, sugar, and natural flavor. So it’s clearly whatever is in the flavor. Is this safe (in the context of what’s happening with me specifically; I’m not trying to imply that the creamer itself is unsafe)? Is this just a weird thing my body does when it metabolizes this mystery ingredient? Obviously I’m not going to keep using it, but should I worry about this? Or is this just a quirk of my digestive system? Does anyone else have this happen?

1pe2bil,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pe2bil/the_new_milkman/,The new milkman,"

I grew up in a small culdesac in a suburban area full of detached houses. Everyone was on friendly terms and almost all were young families. The other children and I would play games together on the safe street after all only people who lived there would drive into the dead end culdesac. It was very peaceful and pleasant. That was until the milkman changed.



Every other day a big bottle of fresh milk was delivered to every door in the culdesac from a local farm. I vividly remember the giddy feeling I had as a child when I left the empty bottle out in the evening only for it to be replaced as if by magic the following morning. It was like a miniature Christmas to me. One day I set an alarm and woke up in the early morning in order to pull open my curtains and wait for the milkman to arrive. A silent electric powered milk float eventually pulled into the culdesac. The float was laden with trays upon trays of bottle white milk which quietly clinked together as he drove. The milkman looked tired but cheerful as he went about his task. When he came to our front door I opened my window and called out a greeting. The milkman was startled and dropped our bottle onto the pavement. He looked up at me. The man’s face was round, red and kind. A brief scowl or irritance disappeared when he saw me looking down at him in awe. He quietly tipped his cap to me before retrieving a fresh bottle or milk.



My parents scolded me when they found the note the milkman had left on our milk bottle. I accepted their discipline but couldn’t help but feel elated when they gave me the note. 



“Sorry for the glass, I don't carry a sweeper. Your young lad gave me a fright when he called out this morn. All the best. Milkman.”



I cherished the piece of communication and kept it in my bedside drawer. My parents seemed perplexed at my obsession but did not deter me. With pride I relayed the tale to my school mates and the other children in the culdesac. Some shared my excitement but others mocked my passion. I got into a scrape with an older boy who called me a cruel name over the whole affair. Nursing a few pains I elected to renew my spirits by waking up early for the milkman once again.



The milk float pulled into the culdesac and somehow seemed quieter than it had the first time. None of the trays in the back made a sound either. I felt strange when I saw the milkman step out from the float. He was much taller than the last time. When he walked his legs seemed to bend outwards slightly as if they were too long. Across the road I watched the tall milkman approach the front door and place down two fresh milk bottles. He then picked up the empty bottle but he had his back to me. When the milkman turned around the empty bottle was gone. His cap was pulled low in front of his face. As he came to approach our door I reached for the handle to open my window but paused. Something instinctual warned me against making myself known. The tall milkman placed two bottles of fresh milk on our doorstep; we only ever received one at a time before. Then I watched as a thin fingered hand picked up our empty bottle of milk and raised it to the obscured face of the milkman. From behind the window I heard the quiet crunch, crunch, crunch as the milkman ate the glass bottle.



My parents did not believe me and added the delivered milk to their coffee and breakfast cereal. When I refused to drink my glass of milk or eat my cereal they became infuriated. I went to school that morning with a sore bottom but that did not shake my sense of unease. I sought out the children at school who lived on my culdesac and they confirmed that an extra bottle of milk had been delivered to their doors that morning. Not only that, they explained, with a smile on their faces, that it was the sweetest milk they had ever drank.



Everyone acted differently that evening and the day after. My parents treated me with great kindness professing their love for me in uncomfortably vulnerable conversations. Father wept that he would never strike me again and only did so because it was how he had been raised. Mother held me tightly pressed against her as if she wanted me back in her stomach again. When I escaped their strange clutches the games outside were not any better. The culdesac gang as we dubbed ourselves were in equally odd spirits. Instead of war they wanted to play games of peace. They skipped around in a circle holding hands for at least ten minutes and I watched on with a frown. It was no fun at all. 



Three bottles of milk were sitting on our doorstep. That was what the label claimed the contents were but I was disgusted at the grey thick liquid within. My parents slurped it down all the same. When I refused to have any there was no angry response, just a quiet acceptance. Everyone at school acted like copies of one another. The lessons became difficult. Our teacher drew complicated diagrams with numbers above what I could count on the blackboard and asked questions. Everyone’s hand went up to respond except mine. I walked home with some of the neighbour’s children every day but soon they began to walk in a strange line and did not talk about TV shows or games anymore. 



Four bottles of black milk were sitting on our doorstep. My parents stopped talking and drank an entire bottle each before heading off to work. I decided to stay at home and I don’t think they even noticed. Everyone was turning into robots. The TV stopped showing anything fun. All the channels showed lines of strange symbols and made a weird ticking noise that hurt my ears. I began to feel so lonely. Nobody forced me but in the end I decided to drink the milk. After that everything felt better. 



I am happy now and you will be too once the new milkman starts his rounds where you live.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I tried everything. Earlier bedtimes. Alarm across the room. Motivation videos. Cold showers. Nothing worked. I kept hitting snooze, hating myself, and then spending the rest of the day feeling behind.

I genuinely thought I was lazy. That I lacked discipline. That successful people had some willpower gene I didn't.

Then I realized my phone was on my nightstand.

That's it. That was the problem.

Here's what was happening: My alarm would go off. I'd grab my phone to turn it off. And while I had it in my hand, I'd ""just check"" one thing. A text. Reddit. Email. Suddenly I'm 20 minutes deep in my phone, still in bed, and my brain is fully awake but my body doesn't want to move.

I moved my phone across the room. Not for the alarm trick. But so I couldn't grab it the second I woke up.

I've woken up on time for 6 weeks now. Same willpower. Different setup.

This made me rethink everything. How much of my ""discipline problem"" was actually an environment problem?

Here are 3 changes that did more for me than any motivational content ever did:

**1. I put my running shoes next to my bed.** Not in the closet. Right there, where I'd trip over them. I don't have to ""decide"" to work out. I just see them, and it feels harder NOT to put them on.

**2. I deleted Instagram from my phone and only use it on my laptop.** I didn't quit. I just added 10 seconds of friction. That 10 seconds is enough for my brain to ask ""wait, do I actually want to do this?"" Usually, the answer is no.

**3. I moved my journal to the kitchen counter.** I used to keep it in my bedroom, telling myself I'd journal before bed. I never did. But I DO walk past the kitchen counter 10 times a day. Now I see it, and sometimes I just write a sentence while waiting for coffee. It's not perfect. But it's more than I was doing.

Here's the truth I didn't want to accept: discipline is overrated. Design is underrated.

You're not failing because you're weak. You're failing because your environment is designed for the person you were yesterday, not the person you're trying to become.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1pe28th,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1pe28th/baristas_on_strike_dont_cross_our_picket_line/,Baristas on strike! Don't cross our picket line!,"Hey guys! I'm not seeing a lot of info about the strike on here so I'd like to share some info! 
Baristas across the country have spent the last couple years slowly unionizing their stores. Starbucks Workers United is the union. It's a subsidiary of the union, Workers United. It has been VERY DIFFICULT to get each store unionized due to union busting (managers finding out about union talk and firing those people before the whole store can vote and sign on with SWU) so each store is a great win! 

Dispite the propaganda you've heard, unions are a GOOD thing for workers. They are backup for your bullies! If your boss/company breaks a labor law, the union will help you and take your side. Bosses and corporations DO NOT LIKE THIS. Hence years of tearing them down. Under capitalism, unions hinder profit. Unions are for the WORKERS not the COMPANY. 

Things unions fought to give ya:
1. Weekends
2. Child labor laws 
3. The 8 hour work day
4. Breaks at work
5. Sick leave
6. Vacation time
7. Social security 
8. Minimum wage
9. Overtime pay
10. Maternity leave

These are just a few. Business owners and companies have tried to extort all the labor out of you for the lowest cost, since forever. Unions aren't perfect but they are a great step in the right direction in favor of the workers who make the stuff, deliver the stuff, cook the stuff, and help you buy the stuff that you want to pay for. 

Corporations are not your friend. They just want your money. Thing you love about Starbucks is the BRANDING. Which every year, has gotten worse or has straight up lied to you. 

Now. 
The contract that the baristas are hootin and hollerin about, is a signed agreement between Starbucks Corporate and the Starbucks Workers United union. It solidifies our benefits, pay, rules/regulations, and our rights. That way if the company violates the contract, the baristas are protected. 

This contract is 90% of the way negotiated and has been since December 2024. Once pay and staffing was starting to be discussed, the company ghosted us. We've been stonewalled since. We've asked that pay be raised to help with the rise in inflation, but instead we got a $0.17 raise. Wild. 

So baristas are sick of it, and hitting them where it hurts, Christmas season! The yearly moneymaker! 

So PLEASE HELP AND BOYCOTT THIS SEASON! The baristas at non-unionized stores get paid hourly so you not buying coffee hurts the company not the workers. 

Shop local or just choose another chain! Take a stand on corporate greed for Christmas! 

(Ps. For those who say get another job, y'all are part of the problem. Every job should pay a living wage. In a world where we have to pay for water, food, housing ourselves, every job should be able to accommodate. Not everyone can be a lawyer/doctor/engineer/office worker. Nurses, teachers, EMTs, firefighters, are also OVERWORKED & UNDERPAID.)

I nitpick a lot too. 

Editing is hard... I could make some closes ones to read it for me but I would like for it to be a little more finished before they could lay their eyes on it. I wonder if it's because I no longer have a fresh eyes on it. But I paused writing for a few days, it didn't work.

If you guys have any suggestions I'll take it.

For me, it wasn't a super complex post. It was one of those simple ""What's one *tiny* promise you'll keep to yourself tomorrow?"" threads.

That was it. No grand five-year plans, no pressure to change my entire life.

But something about typing it out—""I will drink a full glass of water before my morning coffee""—and hitting 'post' was different. Seeing hundreds of other people making their own small, achievable promises made me feel like part of a collective movement. It wasn't about the water; it was about the act of **intention** and **accountability**. It proved to me that personal growth doesn't have to be a giant, scary leap.

Sometimes, a single interactive post can be the spark we need. It pulls us out of passive scrolling and into active self-reflection. But let's be real, sometimes the stuff we're trying to work through is bigger than a single comment thread. Untangling our own thoughts and feelings can be a real challenge when you're just staring at a blank page (or a blank mind!).

For those deeper moments when I needed to get my own emotional blueprint sorted out, I found that working with [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) was a total game-changer. It helped me put a structure to the chaos in my head.

1pe26ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naturalhair/comments/1pe26ri/how_moving_back_to_colombia_helped_me_repair_my/,How moving back to Colombia helped me repair my natural hair with the simplest ingredients,"I wanted to share something that’s been a big part of my healing and natural hair journey, especially for anyone dealing with breakage, dryness, or stress-related shedding.

A few years ago, my life completely fell apart — stress, burnout, and a level of emotional exhaustion that showed up everywhere, including my hair. I was shedding more than usual, my curls felt dry and limp, and nothing I bought seemed to help.

I ended up moving back to Colombia to be with family, and what I thought would be a temporary reset turned into a full transformation — not just emotionally, but for my hair too.

My father kept reminding me of the remedies he grew up with:
“Nature will give your hair back its strength if you let it.”

And honestly… he was right.

I went back to the basics — the ingredients that have been used in Colombian households forever:

Colombian Botanicals That Changed My Hair
	•	Linaza (flaxseed gel) → insane slip + moisture + curl definition
	•	Aguacate (avocado) → deep nourishment + elasticity
	•	Coffee (yes, coffee!) → increased circulation + stronger roots
	•	Castor oil → thickness + growth support
	•	Uchuva (golden berry) → shine + softness
	•	Rice water → smoothing + strengthening

I kept everything minimalistic. No complicated routines.
Just simple, natural mixes and a “powder or seed + water = jelly/gel” approach that worked shockingly well.

What changed most:
	•	My curls got their bounce back
	•	Breakage reduced
	•	Shedding slowed down
	•	My hair looked alive again
	•	My scalp felt healthier and calmer

But what surprised me most wasn’t the ingredients — it was how reconnecting with my culture and slowing down helped my hair heal as much as my heart.

Sometimes natural hair isn’t just about products or techniques — it’s about returning to rituals that remind us who we are.

If anyone wants the exact mixes (linaza gel, coffee rinses, or the “jelly” blends I’ve been doing), I’m happy to share them. Nothing fancy, just nature doing what it does best.",9,1764860481.0,Naturalhair,0,1.0,False

1pe26d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1pe26d4/feeling_undefined_stop_searching_for_the_map_and/,Feeling Undefined? Stop Searching for the Map and Start Collecting Your Personal Data.,"It’s one of the most painful feelings: the ache of feeling ‘undefined.’ You look at others who seem to have their purpose locked down, and you feel like a sketch waiting to be colored in. If you're currently in this state of glorious, confusing limbo, I want you to know this: You are not lost. You are simply in a critical data-gathering phase.

Trying to define yourself or your path when you feel directionless is like trying to draw a detailed map of a country you've never visited. It leads to analysis paralysis and frustration.

**The Practical Tip: The 7-Day Energy Audit**

When you feel undefined, the goal isn't to declare a grand future; the goal is to define your *present* experience. This exercise requires zero planning, only observation.

For the next 7 days, at the end of every day, take 5 minutes to write down the answers to these two questions. Do not filter or judge—just record the facts:

1.  **What were the three specific moments or activities today that slightly drained my energy?** (e.g., that Zoom meeting, scrolling Instagram for an hour, cleaning the kitchen without music).
2.  **What were the three specific moments or activities today that slightly raised my energy?** (e.g., 10 minutes of journaling, helping a colleague, the first sip of coffee outside, finally solving a small problem).

**Why This Works & What to Do Next:**

When you feel undefined, you are asking, 'Who am I supposed to be?' This audit shifts the question to, 'Where does my energy naturally flow?' Your personal energy is the most honest indicator of alignment. 

After 7 days, review your list. You will have a defined picture of your current reality—the small things that empower you and the small things that deplete you. 

**The Action Step:** Use this data to create tiny, effortless experiments. Can you eliminate one 'drainer' or intentionally increase one 'raiser' in the next 24 hours? You don't need a definition of 'Purpose' yet. You just need a definition of 'What makes today feel a little better.'

Self-definition is built through action and small daily observations, not just through thinking. Start exploring the terrain of *you*.",1,1764860455.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

So ive been on mj 2.5 for few weeks now and lost a good bit of weight so far approx 16kg. Im away for a couple of nights to a hotel and find im eating a lot. Yesterday was jab day, I brought the pen with me in medicine case. I noticed I was very hungry yesterday went for dinner and had burger and chips (first time in good few weeks) and had soup for starters with bread. Throughout the day yesterday in hotel aswell I noticed i was snacking aswell on chocolate buttons and houmous, and protein crisps. Also had a scone with coffee when I arrived because I associated thst with being away too. So I had a lot of calories yesterday.

I hadn't been snacking at all over last few weeks, so I was thrown by this. So has mj stopped working or is it the being away and associating that with eating that threw me, im not sure?  

Today I tried to have yogurt 

And fruit for breakfast, with pancakes after 😂, telling myself these are protein. So has it stopped working or is it just the association with being away in a hotel etc.

Any input welcome.....I dont want to put up weight but at same time ive worked hard over last few weeks, controlling my eating.  Part if me wants to inject my full pen into me now lol (obviously I wont).",0,1764860405.0,mounjarouk,8,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pe24xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jetbrains/comments/1pe24xf/issues_with_the_new_datagrip/,Issues with the new DataGrip,"DataGrip has changed significantly with the newest release, 2025.3, and imho it's not ready for prime time. The tool-breaking behaviors introduced that I see are: It produces SQL errors I believe without actually sending the SQL to the target DB, which are only resolved by restarting DataGrip itself, and it is frustratingly slow to notice new files in a project. 

For example, writing a simple insert such as 

insert into dim\_holidays (holiday\_text, holiday\_date)

values ('New Year', to\_date('20260101', 'YYYYMMDD'));

with

    CREATE TABLE dim_holidays (
        holiday_date DATE,
        holiday_text VARCHAR(255)
    );

fails with a message saying I can't insert an integer into a date field. This of course works fine in 2 other SQL tools I tried it in as a sanity check. Restart DataGrip and it works fine. I'm seeing this behavior over and over with queries, inserts etc. When I check, DG is not even sending the SQL to the db, it is producing the error locally. And fwiw yes the schema has been refreshed. I never had this issue prior to the upgrade.

The other issue is just DG takes \~10 minutes to notice that new files have appeared in a project. For example if you pull changes from a remote repo the files are there in the filesystem instantly but there's a coffee-break lag in DG before you can see and use them in the IDE. 

So I'd hold off on updating until a patch or two has come out if anyone was considering it. I usually just apply updates as they come through in the toolbox but here I'm wishing I hadn't.

A couple years ago, I went through an intense period of stress and loss. My skin reacted to everything — redness, dullness, breakouts, irritation, texture. It felt like my face was reflecting everything I was carrying internally.

I ended up moving back to Colombia, where my family is from, thinking I was just going to rest for a bit. Instead, I found myself reconnecting with the most simple, natural ingredients that I grew up around but never really appreciated.

My father kept telling me,
“Everything you need is already in the earth.”

At first, I thought he meant emotionally — but he meant it literally too.

I started experimenting with a minimalist, natural approach using ingredients that are part of everyday life in Colombia:
	•	Coffee powder for circulation and glow
	•	Golden berry (aguaymanto) for brightening
	•	Linaza (flaxseed) for moisture and barrier repair
	•	Rice water for softening
	•	Castor oil for nourishment

I didn’t follow any fancy routines. No 10-step plan. Just simple natural mixes, cooling gel-like masks, and patience. I stopped stripping my skin and focused on calming it.

And honestly?
My skin healed faster than it ever did with expensive products. The redness faded, my glow came back, and my texture smoothed out. But more than that, I felt grounded — like nature was giving me a reset button.

I know natural beauty can get dismissed, but reconnecting with these ingredients changed everything for me. Not because they were exotic or trendy, but because they were familiar. They reminded me of home, of slowing down, of listening to my body.

If anyone’s curious, I can share the simple “powder-to-jelly” mixes I make — nothing fancy, just water + botanicals — but I mainly wanted to tell this story in case anyone else is overwhelmed, stressed, and looking for something gentle.

Sometimes the most powerful beauty routines are the ones that reconnect us to ourselves.",11,1764860318.0,NaturalBeauty,4,0.92,False
1pe244v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pe244v/does_she_know_its_a_date/,Does she know it’s a date?,"I (23M) asked out a coworker (24F) and we have plans tomorrow night but I am not confident that she knows it’s a date. Looking for outside advice/perspectives.

For context I met her about two months ago, I have been at my job for almost two years but we work in different departments at the same company and she used to be on a different shift schedule. We see each other at work maybe 3-4 times a week maximum but sometimes not at all in a given week, and never for more than 20-30 minutes.

I started noticing recently that her behavior towards me seemed to change. She seemed nervous when I would come by her department and say hi, and she always seems to be giggling with her friends right before I walk up.

We share a lot of common interests and always have a good time chatting when we get the opportunity. I became interested in her but since it’s the workplace I wanted to keep things light and low pressure to avoid any trouble if she wasn’t interested.

I left her a sticky note with my number just saying something along the lines of “I really enjoy talking to you but I feel badly distracting you when you are swamped with projects, text me if you want to go on break together sometime and get to know each other better over coffee”.

She texted me not too long after that and we ended up meeting for coffee and having another great conversation, I used this opportunity to ask her out by saying “would you like to go out with me sometime outside of work” and she said yes.

She’s not a big texter so she said I should remind her to select a day/time whenever I could swing by at work. The next time I saw her I reminded her and said something along the lines of “oh hey if you are still interested in going out, let’s pick a time for that” and she said something like “oh yeah it’s not a no, not a maybe, it’s a yes, I just don’t know when yet, remind me again after thanksgiving”

Because I was already worried that maybe I was unclear about it being a date when I initially asked her out, when I saw her next I said that we needed to “pick a date for a date” and I suggested going to a local bookstore/cafe and talk about our recent reads because she’s an avid reader.

She seemed really excited by the idea and also suggested that we meet and walk to the train through a nearby park before heading there.

I am really trying not to overthink this too much (even though I already definitely am) but I am worried that since we were in a busy work environment she may not have fully heard or processed it when I said “pick a date for a date”

I really like her but I am just struggling to believe that we’re on the same page because I don’t have much dating experience to begin with and I also have never asked out anyone that I have worked with.

My question for other users here is whether I should clarify with her at the beginning of the date when we meet up tomorrow to make sure that we are on the same page, or does it seem clear that she is interested?

My friends have said that if she wasn’t interested that she wouldn’t have even texted me to meet for coffee, but I can’t tell if she was just being nice.

(Nasdaq:ASBP) (""Aspire"" or the ""Company""), a developer of a multi-faceted patent-pending drug delivery technology, today provides a business update for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Q3 2025 and Recent Highlights


Expanded its scientific team with the addition of Mark J. Jaroszeski, PhD, a tenured professor in the Department of Medical Engineering at the University of South Florida. Dr. Jaroszeski, who holds a PhD in Engineering Science with a dissertation focused on mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion. His expertise is expected to assist in further developing Aspire's unique sublingual delivery technology.

Submitted its Pre-IND meeting request and briefing package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The submission concerns the Company's lead product candidate, a fast-acting, high-dose sublingual aspirin formulation for the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and represents a significant milestone on the path to potential FDA approval. On November 13, 2025, the FDA responded positively to the request and stated it would provide written responses in lieu of a meeting no later than January 2, 2026.

Participated in the CPHI Frankfurt trade show, the world's largest pharmaceutical event. The Company engaged in numerous strategic discussions with global pharmaceutical companies regarding technical collaboration and licensing opportunities for its lead product candidate, a novel sublingual high-dose aspirin. The conference has led to several licensing opportunities that the Company is considering.

Filed an omnibus patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its sublingual delivery technology. This application - which seeks patent protection of Aspire's proprietary technology in a variety of classes of drugs and other substances--focuses exclusively on protecting the Company's advanced sublingual drug delivery system, which is designed to enhance the pharmacokinetic performance of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (""APIs"") and other substances into the bloodstream, increasing bioavailability and improving speed of onset. The omnibus patent supplements the patent protections already provided by Aspire's previously filed patents.

Shared its pipeline progress and key milestones expected through the remainder of 2025 and early 2026. The company is focusing its pipeline on reformulating approved drugs for multi-billion-dollar markets by utilizing its disruptive, patent-pending sublingual delivery technology and anticipates filing as many as five to ten additional patents before the end of Q1 2026.

Began its influencer marketing campaign designed to drive conversion, brand awareness and loyalty for its innovative BUZZ BOMB™ caffeine product. Featuring 50mg of caffeine and offered in four flavors (Tropical Fruit, Mixed Berry, Peach Mango, and Coffee Mocha), BUZZ BOMB™ provides nearly instant energy, in easy-to-use small sublingual packets, which can be taken as needed for immediate effect.

Increased the production capacity of its BUZZ BOMB™ single dose caffeine supplement through a new manufacturing relationship with SupraNaturals, a well-established contract manufacturer of nutritional and dietary supplements. As part of this agreement, Aspire Biopharma announced an initial production order of two million servings (100,000 20-packs) of BUZZ BOMB™ caffeine supplement, marking a significant milestone in the Company's expansion efforts. The new product will be available for sale just before Christmas.

Published positive final data from its randomized, crossover bioavailability trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Aspire's investigational new sublingual aspirin product compared to chewed uncoated aspirin tablets in healthy adults. The sublingual formulation begins to inhibit platelet aggregation in under two minutes, acting approximately four to five times as fast as chewed aspirin.

Announced the successful launch and distribution of over 30,000 BUZZ BOMB™ sample four-packs, its new sublingual caffeine supplement, at FitCon and FitExpo, held August 1-3, in Salt Lake City and Anaheim, with an estimated combined attendance in excess of 70,000 people.

Announced that the Company's Board of Directors (Board) has appointed Kraig Higginson as interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective July 24, 2025. Mr. Higginson serves as Chairman of the Board and previously served as CEO of Aspire for nearly four years.

Buzz Bomb Caffeine Company LC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aspire:

Unveiled its new e-commerce solution, buzzbombcaffeine.com with BUZZ BOMB™ as its featured launch product. This new seamless direct-to-consumer shopping experience allows consumers to order BUZZ BOMB™ on the Buzz Bomb platform and have them shipped directly to their door with access to exclusive promotions, and customer support. To celebrate the launch, customers who register for Buzz Bomb's e-commerce site will have first access to special pricing, free shipping offers, and other promotions. The site features an introductory sample pack of four flavors as well as 30-packs in various flavors.

Announced positive initial consumer feedback from the Company's sampling of its sublingual caffeine supplement, BUZZ BOMB™. featuring 50mg of caffeine and designed to support sustained energy and mental focus, BUZZ BOMB™ is bringing its unique delivery technology benefits to the multi-billion-dollar caffeine market to help athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and others wanting a lift to maximize their performance potential. Buzz Bomb™ provides nearly instant energy, in easy-to-use convenient packs, which can be taken easily and without the need for mixing with water or relying on unhealthy energy drinks or soda.

Anticipated Upcoming Milestones

Sublingual High-dose Aspirin (Lead Program)

H1 2026: Target submission of New Drug Application (NDA).

Sublingual ED medication

H1 2026: Finalize formulation and manufacture test product.

Mid-2026: Initiate Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical cross-over study.

Kraig Higginson, Interim CEO of Aspire Biopharma, commented:


""Our third-quarter results represent the blueprint for our future value creation. We have clinically proven the superiority of our technology with sublingual aspirin, de-risking the platform, and we have demonstrated our ability to execute commercially with Buzz Bomb Caffeine Company's successful launch of BUZZ BOMB™.""

Higginson continued, ""Looking ahead, investors can see a clear line of sight to a series of major, value-driving catalysts. The most significant is our targeted NDA submission for sublingual aspirin in the first half of 2026, which aims to disrupt a multi-billion-dollar market. This will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies for our sublingual ED and other programs, our entry points into some of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world. Our ability to scale commercially is already being validated, as demonstrated by Buzz Bomb Caffeine Company's second production order of two million servings of BUZZ BOMB™ to meet growing demand. We believe the accomplishments of this quarter have set the stage for a transformative period of growth, and the market has yet to fully recognize the value of the catalysts that lie directly ahead.""

1pe1vzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pe1vzm/are_my_standards_unrealistic_25m/,Are my standards unrealistic? (25M),"Hey everyone. 

  
I came to this thread because I'm genuinely confused on something. For context here's a little about myself:

* I'm 25 years old
* I'm a dude.
* Live in Cape Town, South Africa, but I am a Cuban citizen. I was born and raised in South Africa but my parents are Cuban.
* I'm about 5'6""-5'7"", 77kgs, alright build. I exercise quite a bit, I've run a marathon and competed at nationals for powerlifting, so I take decent care of myself.
* If I'm honest I don't think I'm all that attractive, I'd say I'm like a 6, but friends will tell me I'm like a 7.
* I have a pretty stable and reliable job as a data scientist at a big tech company.
* I've got plenty of hobbies, I do a couple run clubs, I go to Church, I got a puppy that I take to puppy school, I basically watch all sports (quite passionately too if I may add), I go to a lot of social events, I read a lot, I'm a cinephile and I'm very passionate about music.

So, I don't think I'm like a catch or anything, but I definitely feel like I'm women repellent. The issue is I've basically been single my whole life. I dated a girl for like 10 months in high school, and dated another girl for like 3 months in my post grad years at varsity. I've really been trying my best to get into the dating scene. Maybe just some things I've tried: 

* Dating apps: All of them. Every last one. Put a lot of effort into my profile, tried premium on all of them, even got a few dates (maybe around 10).
* Run clubs: I literally moved to Cape Town at the beginning of this year and went to every run club I could and talked to random strangers to try and make friends. I'm only now starting to make friends (Cape Town friend groups are super hard to break into), but during this process I also tried super hard to try talking to some cute girls too with essentially a 0% success rate.
* Dating Events: I tried a couple, only ever had success at one, and by success I mean a girl hooked up with me and I was not at all interested in her.
* Talking to girls at work: Girls not even close to being on my team, that I would never interact with if it wasn't for coffee machine chats. It felt like every single one would just give an awkward smile, and then try get out the conversation as soon as possible. Except for this one girl that was ***too*** into me where it was border line aggressive.
* Approaching girls: I'll go up to random girls at the gym, at a social, at the promenade, even at coffee shops. Not any of them want to be in a conversation, the only ones that are any bit friendly are already in relationships.

So if I'm not women repellent, and I'm trying really hard, why does it feel impossible? It feels like everyone is either in a relationship, or not interested, ***or not interesting***. 

  
I think I could get some dates from girls that I'm not interested in at all, but that feels disingenuous? I know beggars can't be choosers, but I don't feel like I should be a beggar? I hope that makes sense. Should I just accept that maybe the person I end up with just isn't going to be that great and its not going to feel exciting or romantic, or am I missing something? Is there something to try that I haven't tried yet? I'm trying to be as realistic about the situation as possible but I'm caught in a tough spot between ""I'd rather be alone than be with someone I don't like"" and ""The loneliness sucks and is actually really starting to worry me""

  
If you guys have any advice or any words of wisdom, I'd really appreciate it. Because at this point I'm kinda starting to give up.",1,1764859748.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

1pe1r3d,https://i.redd.it/07efemq2975g1.png,CZ just gave Peter Schiff a reality check on why Bitcoin is superior to Gold 🥇 vs ₿,"

We all know Peter Schiff loves his shiny rocks, but CZ (Binance Founder) recently highlighted the practical advantages of Bitcoin that Gold bugs just refuse to acknowledge.

Here is the breakdown of the argument:

1. **Transferability:** Try moving $100M worth of Gold across borders. You need armored trucks, security, and days of clearance. With Bitcoin? It takes 10 minutes and costs a few dollars.
2. **Verifiability:** How do you know your Gold is 100% pure? You need an assay kit or an expert. With Bitcoin, you just run a node. Don't trust, verify.
3. **Divisibility:** Good luck buying a coffee with gold shavings.

Schiff is still living in the analog age while the world is moving digital. It’s not just about ""Store of Value"" anymore; it’s about the freedom of movement.

Because I’m shy, I struggled to keep conversations going. Over time, I noticed him looking at me during lunch or while he was talking to others, and his body language often faced my direction. Even when I wasn’t part of a conversation, he’d remember things I’d said or invite me in out of nowhere.

Last week, when I was getting coffee, he sat with me and we ended up talking for about 45 minutes. Whenever I went quiet, he’d glance at me and then quickly look away when I noticed. The next day, he did the same, and even when someone else joined to talk about their project, he still included me.

When our office seating changed, he chose to sit beside me, even though we’re on the broader team and don’t work on the same projects. he told me I could attend a meeting he was having with his intern so he could explain something to me. Then he went to my manager and joked that he could “replace” him now. During lunch, he sat very close to me (even though there were many people at the table), and whenever someone made a joke or he makes a joke, i find him looking at me and if he's beside me, he'd lean towards me (too close than necessary but still respectful) and laugh.

But in the past few days, he hasn’t said hi, and he moved to sit farther away and wouldn't look at me. Up until now i was quiet 'neutral' but kept it friendly so there's no way i'd shown interest or uninterest.

We used to live in apartments with fenced in balconies with nowhere to go but after buying a townhouse, he now enjoys a deck to roam. We still try to fence him into a smaller area and he's never ventured past our comfort zone.

We have a bunch of stray neighborhood cats and one day, after letting my cat out for his morning coffee outside, I checked in on him to see him sniffing at another cat on our balcony!! She has a purple rhinestone collar and was very docile towards our cat, very friendly. I separated them immediately because my cat is not vaccinated to be able to be around other cats and we are taking him to the vet to have his shots now that we've seen a stranger come onto our property. I wanted to take the outdoor cat inside in case she was lost but my partner thinks she's a neighborhood cat that roams and we are not in a position to care for her. She looks well fed and healthy. We did post a picture of her to inquire with the neighborhood but nobody has said anything.

I fed her a churu and sent her off on her way and she was gone for a few rainy days until she came back again this morning!! My cat has been very sad lately because we won't let him see his friend. I'm worried about what will happen if I allow my cat to make friends with an outdoor cat.. as much as I want to because I do feel he's lonely and want him to be happy.

I'm worried he'll run away with her or maybe she'll come in and never leave and we now have two cats when she's clearly owned by someone already. But she's also come back (I'm suspicious about how long my cat has had this friend without us knowing) and I'm wondering if this can be controlled to be just visits.

I probably wouldn't be so annoyed if I hadn't watched so many episodes of Tyra carrying on and on about how important it is to her to present smart and outgoing women on the show, only for her to reduce them to this nonsense.

I graduated in 2015 and worked my way from Jr to Staff Software Engineer at my first company and then Head of Software Engineering at my second company. With that experience, I felt I could build a product myself that would compete downstream with products like SendOwl, ShopRocket, embedded SamCart etc. I am hoping that building a lean company and passing the savings on to my customers allows me to build out a niche within the broader market of selling digital products online.

One of the tricks I used to build motivation was I would start my day with a 2milligram nicotine gum, a big pot of coffee and turn off all phone/notifications for an hour or so before starting my real job. Would highly recommend a routine approach to slowly move towards your goals.

Since launch, I have realized I have no idea how to market this thing and as a result have zero users. I've tried adding SEO to the blog and doc sections of my marketing site to generate natural google traffic but none has trickled in yet. I tried launching on [SaasHunt](https://saashunt.best/projects/funnelgen) but that got me zero traffic as well.

One lesson I would offer is to use the minimum infrastructure possible until getting customers. I've spent \~$1000 so far by engineering this as if I have customers. Things like launching a real stage environment, using multi availability zone for database, paying for google workspace, etc.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

You can basically put anything:

* Upload any image as your photo
* Your ""top artists"" could be coffee shops, video games, pets, whatever
* ""Top songs"" can be anything you want
* Minutes listened and genre are fair game too
* Download as PNG and share

The ship itself was very meh, but we liked that it had under 100 passengers so we could always get off the ship and explore the land. We obviously went for the land experience so the ship itself wasn't a big deal.

The Many Saints of Newark, a young Tony is left at  Holstens, waiting for his hero, Uncle Dickie, who never shows. The same Dickie Moltisanti shot by Uncle Junior, who also shot Tony.

When Junior says he isn't working alone, he's confused and misremembering the past. This is what he meant, the lines have blurred, junior soprano is a murderer who orders up hits like we order coffee. Forget loyal soldier Brandon Filone, forget Donny who heard Tony S's own mother wants him popped, forget my brother billy, Junior remembers killing Dickie and now that has bled into him shooting Tony. and yes, it wasn't him who pulled the trigger, but thats why RICO are statutes and not Tony's cousin.

Tony dies at Holstens. the same way he was born at Holstens, when Dickie does not show up. in Many Saints of Newark, Moltisantis are the saints, from the grave and beyond, Chris talks about how he's gone to hell for his uncle. and yet, is it another 'uncle' that essentially gives birth to Tony Soprano, and another one that puts him through hell (purgatory, Kevin finnnerty, alt reality, sure).

See Quasimodo predicted all of this, *David Quasimodo Chase* had a Livia for a mom, and we how apparent that is. Right till the final brush with psychiatry, Tony and Carm talking to AJ's woman doctor as AJ wants to join the army, even then Tony Soprano, mr mob boss who flies private to Vegas to do peyote and fuck his dead psuedoson's mistress, is nothing but a little boy, he takes the opportunity to turn it into a 'session for himself', and every step of the way, Carm shoots him a glance.

Even from beyond the seasons and Milfy's office, there are two Tony Sopranos, this is one of them, and the other is the one that dies at Holstens. The Tony Soprano that's just a little boy and did not have a happy childhood and is still just trying to have his mother say, thank you, you are a good son; and the other Tony Soprano who runs North Jersey or whatever's left of it.

Take of that what you will, if Dickie showed up to Holstens that day, one of the many saints wouldnt be speaking from hell and Tony wouldn't be having onion rings with his family before its lights out.",42,1764858449.0,thesopranos,17,0.97,False
1pe1d9s,https://i.redd.it/275xneor575g1.png,Mr. Burns and Victor Das Wolfen,"There it was.

Springfield's Nuclear Power Plant.

Victor parked in the visitor's parking lot and checked in at the security gate. After being given a temporary nametag, he was directed to the main administration building.

He gazed up at the cooling towers as he crossed the pavement. The steam they emitted rose like smoke from the mouths of twin beasts, both threat and promise. Victor took it in -- the power, the enormity.

All under the control of one man.

The security guards at the main entrance glanced at Victor's nametag and let him in without further questioning.

As soon as Victor passed through the doors, he was greeted by Waylon Smithers. Victor was familiar with the man -- he'd seen him before, on Channel 6 News and in person at public events.

""Ah, Mr. Das Wolfen,"" Smithers began, reading off a paper. Victor caught the words 'firearm proficiency', 'certified in nuclear safety' -- his resumé.

""You've arrived just in time. My name is --""

""Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns' Executive Assistant,"" Victor said, folding his hands behind his back. Smithers' brows raised in surprise -- perhaps flattered that Victor knew his name and role -- then they lowered as if such competence displeased him.

""Uh, yes, that is correct. I am Mr. Burns' Executive Assistant... and right-hand man."" He looked Victor up and down. ""I'll be escorting you today. Please, follow me.""

Smithers turned. Victor followed.

Smithers began droning about Mr. Burns' supposed preferences -- 'don't look him in the eye for more than 2 seconds at a time', 'keep responses short'. Victor heard, but he did not listen. Instead, he scanned the halls, assessing employees as he passed them. He tensed his jaw at the sight of one man, who leaned against the wall, lazily sipping his coffee. Despicable. Victor cleared his throat -- the man looked up, his eyes widened, and he quickly straightened his spine.

Fear. Good.

Further into the plant they went. Smithers guided Victor to an elevator. They stepped in and ascended to the highest floor. When the elevator parted, Smithers brought Victor down the hall, then stopped before a pair of great mahogany doors. Victor resisted the urge to run his hand over the plaque that read ""C.M. Burns"".

""Here we are -- Mr. Burns' office,"" said Smithers. He knocked twice, then opened one of the doors a fraction.

""Sir, Victor Das Wolfen is here for his interview. Shall I let him in?""

""Hm? Oohh, very well,"" Burns sighed wearily. ""Do tell me this is the last of them, Smithers -- all this groveling is making me nauseous.""

""Yes, sir, he is the last,"" Smithers confirmed, and then he looked at Victor. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but upon meeting Victor's gaze, stopped short. Instead, he stepped aside and gestured for Victor to enter.

Victor fixed his tie one last time, then passed the threshold like a man stepping into a cathedral.

The moment he set foot on the carpet, their eyes met.

Lightning struck, as if on cue. Victor froze.

There sat the man himself.

Charles Montgomery Burns.

Oh, he was magnificent. He exuded ancient power, charged the very air in the room with his excellence. With each breath, Victor drew more of it -- more of Him -- inside.

Mr. Burns inspected Victor; cold, calculating.

""Ah, Victor Das Wolfen,"" he started. ""Hmph! That's a hell of a name. Tell me, did your pater bestow you with that moniker or did you wander back in time and steal it off a 10th century bishop?""

Smithers chuckled, and Burns smiled -- pleased with himself. 

""Cripes, man, don't just stand there!"" Burns snapped, brows furrowing in irritation. ""I require --!""

The exclamation pulled Victor out of the trance -- he came striding forward, purposeful. Burns stopped mid-speech, eyes widening a sliver, his hand swiftly slipping beneath the desk. Victor imagined a pistol, or an emergency button -- he stopped five feet before the despot, palms outstretched, making clear he meant no harm. He then -- slowly, reverently -- lowered himself to one knee. He closed his eyes and bowed his head.

""Montgomery Burns,"" Victor rasped. ""It is an honor.""

It was quiet for a moment. The only sound in the room came from the rain as it pattered against the window.

""An honor, is it?"" asked Burns. ""And to what, pray tell, do I owe this honor?"" 

Victor hesitated, his hand on the floor curling into a fist.

""To be in your presence -- it is the greatest honor I shall ever know.""

""Sir, maybe we should --"" Smithers chimed in, clearly alarmed.

""Shut up, Smithers!"" Burns hissed as he rose from his chair. 

Victor lifted his head. Burns watched him, flames flickering behind his old eyes -- Victor basked in their heat.

Burns tore the clipboard from Smithers' hands -- skimming the resume. 

""Let's see here... Military service... political experience...""

He looked back at Victor from under his brows, rounding the desk to stand before the kneeling man. 

""For all your skills and ambition, you could have it all -- power, fortune, glory! You need not grovel or supplicate, and yet... here you are, kneeling before me. Tell me, Wolfen. Is this some grotesque attempt to curry my favor? Or is there something greater that drives you?""  

""I kneel not to curry favor. I kneel because of all the Gods I have beheld, only you are worthy of reverence."" 

Burns drew a sharp breath. Paused. Then exhaled.

""Ah...""

He stepped closer, slow and deliberate.

""You kneel not as a cur whimpering for scraps, but as a loyal priest kneels before the altar -- is that it? Hm! And how far would you go to prove that this..."" He gestured at Victor. ""Is no mere charade?"" 

""As far as necessary,"" said Victor. ""I shall follow your every command -- without question, without hesitation, without conscience. If you ask it, it shall be done. My devotion is absolute.""

Burns made a noise, like a startled grunt, and quickly covered it by clearing his throat. His hands shook, so he steepled them -- drumming his fingers together.

""You speak well, Wolfen. I'll admit this performance is... stimulating. But it'll take more than a bent knee and promises rasped as if from the mouth of some devoted knight to persuade me. I'll need irrefutable proof!"" 

""Command me, and I shall provide it.""

Smithers came forward -- rushed, almost frantic. 

""Mr. Burns, if I may--"" 

""You may not!"" Burns barked, turning to yell in his assistant's face. ""I've had enough of your unbidden interference, Smithers! You will either hold your tongue for the remainder of this interview or you will leave my office!"" 

""Sorry, sir."" Smithers took a few steps back and went quiet. Burns returned to his seat behind the desk, lowering himself with a grumble of annoyance.

""Now then, Wolfen. You request my command? So be it. Your first task is this..."" Burns leaned forward, clasping his skeletal hands.

It was then that Victor slowly rose, standing to his full height. Burns tilted back in his chair to retain eye contact.

""There have been whispers of dissent in the halls of my dominion,"" the tyrant continued. ""I need you to find this recreant... and silence him... by whatever means necessary. An easy feat, I imagine -- given your... experience."" He looked Victor down and up. ""I trust you understand that discretion is paramount?""

""Indeed,"" Victor responded. ""I'll don the sheep's wool, and none shall be the wiser.""

Burns smiled, sharp as a knife.

""... Eeexcellent... Now, off you go."" He waved his hand, dismissing with a flick of the wrist. ""Consider this your audition. Prove yourself efficient and you'll be rewarded. Fail..."" Burns's voice lowered, deepened. ""... and I'll have your head mounted on the break room wall as a testament to what becomes of those who dare falter before Charles Montgomery Burns.""

Victor suppressed a shiver. The man wielded threats as an artist wielded a brush.

Then, with feigned cheer, Burns added: ""Carry on!""

The tycoon picked up a pen and brought it to the paper set before him -- but he did not write. His eyes stayed fixed on Victor.

Victor bowed his head in one last respectful gesture, then turned and left the office. ",0,1764858447.0,TheSimpsons,1,0.14,False

1pe1cbm,https://i.redd.it/eprtalo2675g1.jpeg,Just read Fetch and I have opinions (The story not the whole book).,"Okay, so I’m reading through the Fazbear Fright’s stories in order and today’s story was Fetch. I understand that Fetch is beloved, and for the life of me I don’t understand why.

I’ll start out with the gripes I had;

1. Greg, and what he does. I don’t like to criticise stories for characters doing stupid things, God knows if I knew of all the freaky shit in Fetch I’d fumble the bag harder, but there are times where it feels like Greg genuinely doesn’t care about anything going on in the story at the worst possible times. Poorly timed showers, texting about wanting your uncle’s finger an hour after telling your friends about wanting to plan to kill Fetch, legit just seemingly forgetting about Fetch like 3 times in a row, and being surprised every time. He isn’t especially super likeable, he isn’t nice to his friends, he’s just nerdy. The conflict between him and his dad feels very forced and never relevant, it’s just flavour text, and that goes for most things about him; I feel like I never know Greg properly over the course of the story, and I don’t care for him.

2. Fetch. Fetch has an interesting premise, but even the MCs and the author feel uninterested in exploring it. Fetch brings him stuff, but that’s all they do with it. What can he bring? How does he do it? What’s the limit on things? Could you use any clever wordplay (akin to a misinterpretive genie) to bring about horror with Fetch misunderstanding things? The answer to all of this is no. We don’t understand how fetch works because Greg barely thinks about it, or tries to do anything with Fetch. Every time something goes wrong it’s because he types in his phone “smh just attacked by a dog hope someone #kills that thing”. It’s lame, and it really wastes what could’ve been a more interesting set of events. 

3. When they go to kill Fetch, what is their plan? Something organically woven into the story that uses the gimmick of how Fetch works and stands out amongst the crowd? ❌
Go to the Pizzeria with knives and hope he’s there and kill him? ✅ 
We never see Greg say anything properly to Fetch, why? He should ask him things, talk to him normally, we could have a stronger impression of the Fetch himself if we were allowed to see more of how he responds to stuff, or even if Greg just told him to stop or something, it would be SOMETHING. Again it’s just more wasted potential, and it feels disappointing.

4. The characters are all boring. His uncle is the only character in it, though he’s barely in it and serves the purpose of being the audience’s favourite so it’s distressing when Fetch yoinks his finger. There aren’t any neighbour characters, or interesting people to flesh out the location? Greg’s love interest (I want to say Kimberly?) is nothing outside of “smells good” “nice hair” “perfect eyes”, and none of the other classmates have anything going on. His two buddies get mad at him for starting Fetch, he tells them to go, then in the next scene he texts them and says “sorry” and that’s the last we hear of them. Count the Ways had Millie, her grandad and the boy she has a crush on, all of which are strongly characterised, all of which I like, and that makes the story far better. They all feel like people. To Be Beautiful has Sarah, her friend and her mum, again all characterised, all people. It not only makes both stories scarier because I am actively hoping that things turn out well, it also adds so much to the sadness, the pit in your stomach when you read that the two previous stories nail so well.

And my 5th. and final point, is tone. Like I said, the previous stories (even into the pit, to an extent) have a feel, a mood to them. They’re both tragically sad at the end, which is fuelled by affection for the characters within. The final moments of Count the Ways are so crushing because Millie never did anything wrong, she realises in that moment how much she appreciates everything in her life, and how she wants to go spend Christmas with her Grandad and it’s heartbreaking. There’s no moment like that in Fetch, there’s nothing sad about Fetch. No one cares about anything except for the direct events of “Fetch kill person” because there’s nothing else to care about. The whole story has a somewhat tongue in cheek feel, and I get that that’s kinda why Fetch texting in slang works, but the text will jump from thing to thin constantly as though it’s had one too many coffees, and it just consistently stops itself from drumming up any suspense or fear as it chugs along. The story keeps stopping and starting because, without exploring any of the interesting ways a situation like this could unfold, Greg is forced to do nothing for weeks so that time can unfurl long enough for Fetch to do his next thing. It’s strange, it’s jarring and it’s awkward. 

At the end of the day, the only thing Fetch has going for it is that at its core, it’s a good concept, and it’s dark. The actual story itself has nothing but issues I think, and I was very disappointed that I didn’t like it, I was really hoping to.

Also I kept imagining Fetch was Brian Griffin cause of the casual way he texts. And I felt bad for him when Greg beat him to death with a baseball bat for twenty minutes.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pe1bjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wattpadbooks/comments/1pe1bjb/looking_for_the_title_of_this_wattpad_story/,Looking for the title of this wattpad story,"Hi, I need help in finding this wattpad story I read years ago.

So this is a novel I read here in Wattpad. I don't remember the genre, the name of the characters and the city where they were. All I vaguely remember is the color of the book cover and somehow the first chapter summary.

Here it goes. 

A girl(main character) woke up in a café. She fell asleep and woken up just before the café closed, so it was close to evening that time. There were several students inside the café so no one suspected her of being homeless. She seems to be a teenager or atleast looks like a student in appearance, she wasn't wearing a uniform but as far as I remember, she was wearing a thin jacket and the temperature that time was really cold as described in that novel. I think it was almost winter, not sure, there were thin ice on the road or was just a puddle of water from a rain that evening. 

She woke up from the smell of the coffee being serve here and there. She ran away from her 'home' without a single penny and a bleeding hands or fingers, don't remember that much. I think she ran after some fight or something. A waiter approached her or someone from the café and advised her that they will close soon. So sadly she stood up, with empty stomach and shivering from cold weather she decided to sleep outside.

I'm not sure if she sat on an alley or on a bench in a park, but someone approach her, two kind people, I think they were siblings, a teenage boy and girl, I'm not sure if they were teenagers, but I guess college students same as her. So they thought she was also a student but wasn't able to get back to her dorm or something, so they offered her their place. They live on a shared apartment for 4 persons, 2 for the siblings, one is the man's girlfriend and another for their male friend who was blind. They brought her home and introduce MC first to the blind man, who back then was sitting on their living room. When the good man's girlfriend came home, the good man tried to introduce MC.

The good man who helped her got into a fight with the girlfriend since she doesn't trust MC(main character). MC felt guilty and so offered to just go back but wants to borrow atleast a jacket so she can feel warm when she sleeps outside or so she thought. But the good man said no, she should stay inside as he doesn't like the thought of another person sleeping outside it will only make him feel guilty. So GF went out, the good man followed and apologized to MC and ask her to wait for them and the other sibling followed suit as well.

The blind man was kind. He asked her to rest. He is completely blind, they talk for a while but MC's mind is elsewhere, she couldn't rest in a place where she knows is near 'that person', the one whom she ran away with, don't know if that was a he or a she. MC ask which was his room and the others, the blind man told her as well as where is the bathroom. So she told the blind person that she will go to the bathroom but stealthily went into his room, saw his wallet on the table and took some money she can use for food and fare to go a bit far away. She was thinking twice, was so guilty that she wants to return the money but then remember the horror she will get once caught by 'that person', so she steeled herself and took the money, not too much, but enough for her, I'm not sure if she left a note that if they are still there, she will return the money soon. She quietly passed by him and went out.

That's as far as I remember. I don't remember if that was all in chapter 1 only or it was up to the next one but that's about it. I really want to know what happens next but couldn't find the story anymore. Tried checking thru google and other search engines but couldn't find it. Hopefully someone here knows it or have read it before.",1,1764858327.0,wattpadbooks,0,1.0,False

I do struggle as there’s not much that I can drink and the volume is an issue, I’m barely ever thirsty and I physically can’t get 3 litres down. I usually opt for plain water most of the time but it’s gets so boring! 

Tldr: something not fizzy, strawberry or raspberry lemonade recipes welcome. Cold drinks preferred. 

I can’t drink fizzy drinks as I have R-CPD and can’t burp. 

Absolutely teetotal, the condition, it’s an ibs trigger, etc.. 

I’m not a major fan of hot drinks, I don’t like the taste of coffee and have one cup of black tea on a morning. I can maybe get on board with a mocha but after a few sips I get that jelly belly feeling. Herbal teas don’t really agree with me either but I do like strawberry & raspberry fruit tea. 

Most juices tend to go straight through me or I’m not keen on the taste. Last time I was craving orange juice i’d supped a full 300ml bottle in a half hour sitting. I was on the loo for a while shortly after which tends to trigger my anxiety and made me flare anyway. I do like apple juice, the clear stuff tends to go down well but if I have too much I get stomach ache. I also cannot stand banana so other pre-made fruit juices are a no go. Also not a fan of tropical flavour things, or berries alone they’re just too sweet.

I’m in the UK and in the summer time, Costa do a strawberry lemonade which I love. I’ve been hunting for the recipe to no avail :( although I do have to be careful with too much lemon as it sets my GERD off. 

So I’m down to a cup of tea, a juice box and about 1 litre of water a day I can manage. 

I’ve tried the humantra hydration sachets for the electrolytes but some days I can’t stand the saltiness of them. I’ve even considered a sports drink every now and then but the last time I had one of those, because it was a bit moreish and something different, I finished up the same as when I’d had the orange juice :( 

Tescos used to do an isotonic lemon and lime drink years ago which I lived off, but they discontinued them. The closest I’ve found that isn’t like drinking syrup is the Jude Bellingham limited edition lucozade ice. But it gave me the squits so I daren’t go near it again :( 

I’ve also seen those jelly drops for dementia patients, has anyone tried them in their quest for hydration?

I'd recommend trying this out. ",5,1764858216.0,composting,1,0.86,False

Between April and June 2024 the man repeatedly called, texted, and emailed an employee of a city agency. He used racial slurs and threatened physical harm toward the employee and the employee’s colleagues. At several points he claimed to know the victim’s home address and said he planned to show up and hurt people there.

In a separate incident in February 2024 he targeted another African American individual while driving on Interstate 95. During slowed traffic he pulled beside the victim’s car, shouted racial insults and threats, and reached toward what the victim believed might be a gun. He then threw a coffee mug at the victim’s vehicle, causing damage and fear.

[Federal prosecutors](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/philadelphia-man-sentenced-33-months-prison-violent-threats-cyberstalking-civil-rights) stated that his actions were driven by the victims’ race and their connection to government related work, which made his conduct a violation of civil rights protections.

Law enforcement officials say the [sentence](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/philadelphia-man-sentenced-33-months-prison-violent-threats-cyberstalking-civil-rights) sends a clear message that hate fueled intimidation and harassment will face serious consequences.",1,1764858212.0,SistasCircleMod,0,1.0,False

A bit different, since every item here has been gifted already in my family or my cycling club, so they're tried and tested.","I always struggle when a birthday or the holidays are around the corner. Us cyclists, are picky about almost everything. Saddles, bibs, even bar tape colours. So I put together a few things the were passed around as gifts in my family and the cycling club secret Santa.



**1. Gift card to a local bike shop**

It’s not personal, but it allows the recipient to pick whatever they like.

**2. Gift card to their usual coffee stop**

Cycling runs on caffeine. Nuff said.

**3. Fun cycling socks**

For some reason, cyclists are ridiculously picky about kit… except socks. My favourites have Teletubbies on them.

**4. Electric mini-pump**

Tiny lifesaver for roadside fixes. Xiaomi and Cycplus have been solid for me.

**5. Bike radar (Garmin/Wahoo)**

Honestly one of the best safety upgrades after a helmet.

**6. A professional bike fit**

It low-key says “I want you to enjoy this for a long time.”

**7. A cycling holiday / weekend away**

In my family we like gifting experiences instead of material gifts. Quiet roads, good food, new scenery, and precious time together.",3,1764858190.0,cycling,1,0.81,False
1pe19gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1pe19gy/looking_for_this_wattpad_story/,Looking for this wattpad story,"Hi, need help in finding this wattpad story I read many years ago.

So this is a novel I read here in Wattpad. I don't remember the genre, the name of the characters and the city where they were. All I vaguely remember is the color of the book cover and somehow the first chapter summary.

Here it goes. 

A girl(main character) woke up in a café. She fell asleep and woken up just before the café closed, so it was close to evening that time. There were several students inside the café so no one suspected her of being homeless. She seems to be a teenager or atleast looks like a student in appearance, she wasn't wearing a uniform but as far as I remember, she was wearing a thin jacket and the temperature that time was really cold as described in that novel. I think it was almost winter, not sure, there were thin ice on the road or was just a puddle of water from a rain that evening. 

She woke up from the smell of the coffee being serve here and there. She ran away from her 'home' without a single penny and a bleeding hands or fingers, don't remember that much. I think she ran after some fight or something. A waiter approached her or someone from the café and advised her that they will close soon. So sadly she stood up, with empty stomach and shivering from cold weather she decided to sleep outside.

I'm not sure if she sat on an alley or on a bench in a park, but someone approach her, two kind people, I think they were siblings, a teenage boy and girl, I'm not sure if they were teenagers, but I guess college students same as her. So they thought she was also a student but wasn't able to get back to her dorm or something, so they offered her their place. They live on a shared apartment for 4 persons, 2 for the siblings, one is the man's girlfriend and another for their male friend who was blind. They brought her home and introduce MC first to the blind man, who back then was sitting on their living room. When the good man's girlfriend came home, the good man tried to introduce MC.

The good man who helped her got into a fight with the girlfriend since she doesn't trust MC(main character). MC felt guilty and so offered to just go back but wants to borrow atleast a jacket so she can feel warm when she sleeps outside or so she thought. But the good man said no, she should stay inside as he doesn't like the thought of another person sleeping outside it will only make him feel guilty. So GF went out, the good man followed and apologized to MC and ask her to wait for them and the other sibling followed suit as well.

The blind man was kind. He asked her to rest. He is completely blind, they talk for a while but MC's mind is elsewhere, she couldn't rest in a place where she knows is near 'that person', the one whom she ran away with, don't know if that was a he or a she. MC ask which was his room and the others, the blind man told her as well as where is the bathroom. So she told the blind person that she will go to the bathroom but stealthily went into his room, saw his wallet on the table and took some money she can use for food and fare to go a bit far away. She was thinking twice, was so guilty that she wants to return the money but then remember the horror she will get once caught by 'that person', so she steeled herself and took the money, not too much, but enough for her, I'm not sure if she left a note that if they are still there, she will return the money soon. She quietly passed by him and went out.

That's as far as I remember. I don't remember if that was all in chapter 1 only or it was up to the next one but that's about it. I really want to know what happens next but couldn't find the story anymore. Tried checking thru google and other search engines but couldn't find it. Hopefully someone here knows it or have read it before.",1,1764858182.0,Wattpad,1,1.0,False

But i also dont gain weight if i eat like crap. I seem to be flatlineing at 160 and im just not ok with that lol. Id like to be 125/130max. 

 Next month im going to try the carnivore diet for 30 days and see how much weight I can loose (depending on results ill keep going or switch to keto after). Im trying to get used to only drinking black coffee and water to subtle the blow when I transition. If anyone has tips on how to get through this diet or just insight on whats worked for them I'd appreciate it!

Im also looking to incorporate physical activity. But I work 60 hour weeks so I want to make sure I can still feel good throught my days and feel decent lol, especially in the beginning. 

Anything helps!! This is my first hard-core diet ever so im pretty nervous!
