1) Fled the school during class

2) Caused two fender benders

3) Terrorized a group of people who called her ""a monster""

4) Caused tens of thousands of dollars in property damage through the fender benders, destruction of the fire escape on the apartment building, and the destruction of the coffee shop sign

5) Nearly killed a guy when the fire escape fell in the street. 

6) Has at least a dozen witnesses

7) Was shown on international news. Her grandmother in Florida says that the news had a story on a giant red panda sighting in Toronto (where Mei is from)

So, why didn't the school lockdown or report a missing child to the police? It's kinda a big deal for a school to lose a kid during the school day.

I went into HomeGoods yesterday to buy espresso pods as my local store normally is overflowing with cheap tasty options. The entire coffee section was decimated. 

I did ask the cashier if they had an idea on getting more espresso pods/coffee in general and all I got was a blank look and they changed the subject. I swear I asked politely and nice/positively, there were literally no other customers in line and the few floor workers I saw were hustling so I didn't want to interrupt. 

So I guess Im asking here 😅

Are people buying out coffee and hoarding it, or is it just not coming in on the trucks like normal? Or is my store just a random outlier? 

I normally only go looking like once every few months or so, right after Christmas I got some  great espresso pods and was hoping I could find more.

Large, varied and some unforgiving weather days. Money ticks over, but not like WW and XP is rather much slower. 

A bass boat as F2P is ridiculous money so the motor boat is my steed. However (!) this map is gigantic and at a top speed of 15mph I could make a cup of coffee and be back on my controller before my little tug boat has gone from one end to the other, so consider that when you arrive. 

Uniques are pulling out up to 120lb and the YouTube recommended spots are still doing their thing on 4/0 - 8/0 hooks with shiners and cut bait. The Tarpon fishing is from about 20 yrds. If I leave I am buying a second strong match pole instead of fishing an extra bottom rod. 

Reddear Sunfish on the Explore 1 mission is a bish, and will need a boat to get to as well. 

I don’t see the point in swapping between here and WW imo. When the licence expires, personal preference is go back to WW and stay there until next map. 

BCI needs to be explored, in full. It offers everything and whilst I am grinding the levels it isn’t offering enough for that roadmap. But, it is excellent and fish are there to be had.

A month ago, I wasn't in the best mental place 😔. I live in a place that is cold & depressing and decided to take a month off and go somewhere else.

During my vacation, I set a goal to walk 30K steps a day to see what would happen to my body.

Before leaving for vacation I weighed myself at \~153 LBS at 5'6 close to 25 BMI.

I weighed myself this morning and I am at 147 LBS so a total loss of 7 lbs over 4 weeks without really watching what I was eating. My body feels lighter now and doing daily chores feel a lot easier than before.

My feet were in rough shape the first 2 weeks and had some blisters but they adapted quite well and walking 30k at the end was super easy and felt like I could easily go to 50K.

Mentally walking has helped a bit but I won't say that I am cured or anything. I feel like I am still the same just a bit more positive.

My sleep after all that walking improved by a lot. I had more vivid dreams and felt more energized when waking up. I didn't really need coffee anymore and I feel like walking first thing in the morning feels better than caffeine.

Now, that I am back to my old life and routine I highly doubt I can keep up the same step count until spring comes around and it makes me sad.

Going forward until spring time comes, I am going to continue focusing on being kind to myself and eating healthier foods until I can go back to walking again. ❤️

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience in the hopes that It may help someone.

My symptoms are I usually wake up feeling totally fine, and then after about 30 minutes get the feeling of needing to clear my throat on and off throughout the day. Usually about 30 minutes after a meal I clear my throat and sometimes cough up what looks like foamy spit. I almost feel like I get mild chest congestion after I eat. Doesn’t seem to matter what the meal is. 

Anyways, since I can’t identify diet triggers - is it possible this was triggered by the two rough respiratory viruses I had this winter? Anyone have expertise with that as a trigger and does that mean it should improve  soon  ?

**Memory transcription subject:** *Leena, Capitol Spaceport Logistics Coordinator*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: August 22, 2136*

The alarm started chiming and the blinds opened, flooding the room with light. My twins’ cries filled the room, insistent and sharp. I let out a slow breath, shaking off the last remnants of sleep as I lifted them.

“Alright, alright, I hear you,” I murmured, running my paw down Vissa’s back to calm her. Her tiny claws flexed against my fur, searching for comfort. Even exhausted, I couldn’t help but smile. I turned on the news to watch while I fed them.

A bandage wrapped around Talen’s head, pressed tightly against his wool. My gut twisted with shock and concern. Had the predators attacked him? That would make sense, wouldn’t it? Yet… something about the way he held himself—tired but unharmed otherwise—didn’t quite fit the image of a brutal assault. My thoughts were interrupted when Talen took over from his co-host Liara.

“Breaking news. The venlil and human that have been missing in action since the arxur attack on the research outpost that was hosting half of the Venlil-Human Exchange Program on \[August 21st\], have made their way back to us in a stolen Federation craft.”

Talen sighed. “The human, known as Marcel, is in critical condition, while his partner Slanek was injured but stable. We will now show you a recording of their return. If you are prone to fainting or other outbursts, please block this show for the next \[2 minutes\] as the contents of the video are quite disturbing.”

My heart pounded at Talen’s warning. *Disturbing footage.* Those words sent a tremor through my body. Everyone had seen what predators did to the weak, even their own kind. *Marcel was injured, helpless.* What would the predators do to him? I had heard stories—to show weakness was to invite death among predators. Wounded predators were abandoned, or worse.

My instincts screamed at me to look away. I didn’t want to see it.

I shifted on the bed, my tail curling around the twins protectively as I struggled to free a paw. If I could just skip ahead, just bypass whatever human cruelty was about to be shown, I could keep myself from witnessing the inevitable. I jostled the twins in my arms, trying to ease one of them off my chest for just a moment, but they weren’t cooperating.

*""Come on, just for a moment,""* I whispered desperately.

Vissa gave a disgruntled chirp, nuzzling closer against my warmth, while Tas’s tiny paws tightened their grip on my wool, unwilling to be disturbed from their feeding. I winced as little claws pulled my fur, my attempts to shift them only making them squirm restlessly.

My ears pinned back in frustration. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t skip the inevitable carnage.

Panic crept up my spine as the segment continued, trapping me in place, forcing me to watch. Prime news switched to a camera elevated above the predators, who were crowded around the docking bay, craning their necks to see their pilot as the ship finished the docking procedures. The footage played on, and I braced myself for the violence, for the brutality, for the moment humans proved they were the monsters we feared.

But the moment never came.

I blinked in disbelief. A venlil, Slanek I assumed, rushed out of the ship and shouted at the nearest predators carrying a stretcher, making demands for medical assistance and gestured with his tail inside the ship. I expected the predators to punish him for his insolence. Prey don’t give predators orders, they don’t care for weakness, especially not that of an enemy. He was scared, his own ears pinned back like mine, but he showed no signs of aversion to the predators with large red crosses running towards him. They followed his direction without hesitation. It was as though his voice had command over them. When he followed them inside, none of the other predators made a move to silence him, or any move at all. 

I stared at the screen. I couldn’t comprehend what I’d seen. A venlil had given predators orders. An injured venlil had given predators orders and he wasn’t immediately torn apart. An injured venlil commanded predators and they obeyed. It didn’t make sense. That didn’t happen. 

When the humans reemerged, my breath hitched and my mind refocused. That couldn’t be a human. Humans were supposed to be strong, terrifying, predators who could tear through anything in their path. But this one… he looked frail. Defenseless. The predators in the crowd gasped as one. My paws trembled, the weight of my children grounding me as my mind reeled. *Sun and stars, what happened to them?*  

My gaze flicked over the crowd, waiting for the jeering and gloating. Instead, I saw only the blank visage of their masks. They had no tails to read and I could not understand their bodies. One human, a woman standing near the front, covered her mask with her hands as if in silent disbelief as Marcel rushed by. Her body stiffened like she was genuinely dismayed. My ears pricked up in confusion. This was not what I had expected. No laughter, no smirking faces, no gleeful satisfaction in the misfortune of another. Instead, they stared, unsure, with emotions I couldn’t read. Was that sympathy? Was it compassion? My thoughts raced as the camera followed the predators while they whisked their injured packmate through the crowd, Slanek hurrying after them.

Before the video ended, I noticed that the predators cleared a path for the red crossed ones as they drew close. Where they had been frozen before, they now moved with purpose to get out of the way, to allow Marcel and Slanek to pass unhindered. Talen returned to the screen.

“What you have seen here is the after effects of Federation torture of their human prisoner. The story that we have so far is that Marcel made a call to lure the arxur attackers away from the outpost, where their ship became disabled and were rescued by the renowned Captain Sovlin. Marcel was fitted with an electric shock collar, beaten, and starved for days before Slanek woke from a coma. Slanek was taken to see Marcel in an attempt to convince them that humans are savage beasts. When that failed the Federation Captain attempted to feed Slanek to his human partner. According to Slanek, despite his extensive injuries, Marcel was more concerned with Slanek’s health than his own. Following Sovlin’s actions, Slanek was able to convince the first officer, Recel, to betray his captain and save Marcel. The trio stole a Federation craft and made their way back to Venlil Republic space where Marcel is still in critical condition.”

My tail stiffened. That had to be a lie. The Federation wouldn’t do something like that. Sovlin was a hero. He wouldn't... he was one of the good ones, the righteous ones, protecting us from predators. He didn’t have predator’s disease; did he?

Liara continued, “For those out there that still believe humans are simply biding their time, or will slip into predatory behavior if they are stressed out, here is proof that even if they are starving to death, they will not attack and attempt to eat a venlil. We have contacted the UN for an official statement on what they plan to do and have been notified they will give an official statement soon. We will continue to cover this story as it unfolds.”

The broadcast shifted to a panel of experts, but my mind lingered on what I had just witnessed. My emotions churned—confusion, disbelief, and a hesitant, uneasy curiosity. Could it really be true? Had the Federation lied about the humans, or was this some elaborate deception? I shook my head, trying to push the thoughts away. I had a routine to follow, and dwelling on unsettling news wouldn’t help.

I sighed and switched to another segment, letting the next broadcast play in the background as I put the twins in their play pen and went about my morning.

Dramatic music introduced the channel with a bold “Breaking News” banner flying across the screen coming to a rest along the bottom of the screen. I set the data pad down while I began my morning routine. 

The show’s host set his pad down and leaned forward, *“Good evening Venlil Prime, you are watching Prime Debate with Selrak. Tonight, we have some deeply disturbing developments in Governor Tarva’s reckless gamble with our future. As part of her so-called ‘exchange program,’ we now have confirmed reports that Venlil citizens are being encouraged to live alongside humans, interact with them daily, and—get this—even trust them as friends. This is not speculation. This is happening right now.”*

I exhaled, dragging my brush through the stubborn knots in my wool. The bristles snagged, tugging sharply at my fur, but I barely noticed the discomfort. My ears flicked toward the screen as Selrak’s voice filled the room, the weight of his words pressing down on me.

More reports. More warnings. More proof that Governor Tarva was gambling with all our lives. I had already heard about the exchange program, but hearing it framed so starkly sent a fresh prickle of unease through my skin. Venlil were living alongside humans—actual predators—sharing their spaces, speaking with them, even… trusting them? I swallowed hard, working the brush through another tangle. That couldn’t be right. It was madness, wasn’t it?

Selrak’s words painted a familiar picture: war, devastation, entire cities reduced to dust. We had all seen the same footage, predators gloated when they raided another planet, they wanted everyone to suffer when they did. They were unparalleled in their capacity for violence. That was fact. That was what we had always been taught.

And yet… I had seen the way Slanek had behaved towards that predator, Marcel. It should have been a ruthless monster, but the things it had endured… no true predator would have tolerated such treatment. It wouldn’t have left Slanek alive. They were supposed to be heartless beasts. It didn’t make sense.

I frowned, my grip tightening on the brush as I yanked through another knot. 

*Selrak jabbed his digit into the desk in front of him. “Now, I want to be very clear about what we’re dealing with. These are predators. Creatures biologically designed to kill. You’ve seen the evidence. You’ve seen the footage of their world wars—entire continents reduced to rubble, weapons of mass destruction capable of wiping out entire cities in an instant! They wage war like no other species in the galaxy. And yet, Tarva wants you to believe they can be our friends?”*

The screen shifted briefly to a montage of archived footage, a visual backdrop to Selrak's rhetoric: scenes from humanity's history—a cloud rising from the ground and bulging at the top, apocalyptic landscapes of scorched earth and ruined buildings, pictures of craters as big as the governor’s mansion. The images were stark, chaotic—reinforcing Selrak's words. 

*“And let’s talk about that predatory instinct. We know what drives them—an insatiable need to hunt and kill. It’s not a question of if they will snap, but when. And when they do, who will suffer? You. Your family. Your children. Are we supposed to believe that millennia of evolution can simply be ignored because Tarva hopes they’ve changed? That’s not science. That’s suicide.”*

*""Now, to discuss the severity of this situation, I’m joined by Vashek, a former extermination officer who’s studied predator behavior extensively. Vashek, you’ve seen the evidence firsthand—what do we really know about these creatures, and why should we be so concerned?""* Selrak leaned back in his chair and gestured towards his guest.

Vashek took over and leaned forward, his expression stern *""What’s most alarming, Selrak, is that they don’t just kill for survival. They kill for sport. They kill for pleasure. They even kill their own kind in brutal wars that have claimed billions of lives. And now, we’re supposed to invite them into our homes?""*

*Billions?!* My ears fell flat, my tail stiffened. 

Selrak continued, *“Exactly! And yet, Tarva and her administration are pushing this agenda forward, despite growing concerns from citizens, despite clear evidence of human aggression. And let’s not forget the economic crisis unfolding at the same time. Coincidence? Or is she deliberately making us weaker while we open the gates to these predators?”*

Vashek pointed at the camera. *“Venlil Prime, I want you to ask yourself this: When humans go hungry, when their instincts take over, when their true nature reveals itself—who will be there to stop them? Tarva? The same governor who is rolling out the welcome mat for the deadliest species in the galaxy?”*

Selrak looked triumphant as he spoke, *“We’ll be right back after a word from our sponsors.”* 

The screen faded to black with the words, STAY ALERT, STAY SAFE, STAY VIGILANT, lingering before the feed cut out. 

My digits hovered over the datapad, my mind still racing from Selrak’s words. *Predators... or misunderstood?* I felt a pang in my chest, a mix of discomfort and curiosity. What was the truth about humans, really? Before I could sort my thoughts, the screen flickered to life loading the next segment in the feed, a scheduled press conference from the Governor’s office.

I propped up the datapad so I could watch the conference as I played with the twins, my eye lingered for a moment as the Governor’s seal spun round on the screen. The twins were still in their playpen, happily gnawing on soft toys. I made my way over to them, giving them each a gentle tickle, my tail wagged as they gurgled in response. 

My attention stayed fixed on the press conference, but there was a sense of comfort in the sound of their little noises, grounding me as I listened intently to the words of the Governor’s Press Liaison.

The camera feed switched to a warm, well lit room, revealing Press Liaison Melchi standing at the podium in the Capitol press room. The official seal of Venlil Prime had been projected behind him, a silent reminder of the administration’s authority. He had shuffled his notes briefly before looking up, ears forward in what had been meant to be a reassuring posture.

“Citizens of Venlil Prime, I know many of you are facing uncertainty and hardship in the wake of our planet’s realignment. The transition has not been without challenges, and our administration understands your concerns. This is a period of temporary hardship, but it is one we will overcome together.”

Before he could continue, a journalist’s voice had cut in. “Temporary? The unemployment rate has doubled! How long is ‘temporary,’ Press Liaison?”

Melchi hadn’t flinched. “We are fully aware of the impact, and that’s why we’re taking decisive action. Workforce adjustments have been necessary in some industries, but they are part of a broader effort to ensure long-term stability and security for all Venlil.”

Another reporter had practically shouted over him. “Be specific! What ‘adjustments’ are you referring to? People are losing their jobs, their homes--”

Melchi had lifted a hand slightly, commanding the room back to order. “The governor’s office has authorized an economic stimulus program to aid struggling industries. We are also working to expand employment opportunities through joint ventures with our human allies in manufacturing, medicine, and agriculture. These industries will not only replace lost Federation imports but strengthen our planetary self-sufficiency.”

“Isn’t that just another form of dependence?” a journalist had fired off before Melchi could even finish. “Trading one power for another?”

The room had murmured in agreement, a few voices overlapping as more reporters had jumped in.

Melchi’s ears had flicked, but he had maintained his composure. “Dependency suggests a lack of agency. That is not the case. We are diversifying our economy, not surrendering control of it. These workforce adjustments are a necessary step toward self-reliance, not subjugation. We are working with our allies to secure our future--not relying on any one power to dictate it.”

More voices had risen at once. “What about the food shortages?” “Medical supplies are running low--when will that be resolved?”

Melchi had exhaled sharply. “While some temporary disruptions have occurred, they are being addressed swiftly. Emergency shipments from Earth are supplementing supply gaps, including essential medicines, nonperishable food, and medical equipment. This is a temporary measure while we increase domestic production and stabilize supply lines.”

A new voice had shouted over the others. “And what about security? The Federation has cut us off--are we just waiting for the predators to strike? What happens when we have no allies left?”

Melchi’s tone had hardened. “Venlil Prime will not be left defenseless. The administration has authorized a full-scale modernization of our defense fleet. The construction of new warships and enhancements to our planetary security forces will ensure our safety is never compromised.”

The room had been a cacophony of murmurs, some hushed, others loud with barely contained anxiety. Another journalist had leaned forward, voice pressing. “So, are we preparing for war? Yes or no?”

Melchi had leveled a firm gaze at the press corps. “We are ensuring the security of our people, our trade routes, and our planetary borders. Any government that fails to take these precautions would be acting irresponsibly.”

The press room had buzzed with restless energy, some reporters hurriedly scribbling notes while others had whispered furiously among themselves. One had tried to speak again, but Melchi had cut them off.

“I understand the anxiety many of you feel. These are challenging times, but let me be clear: Venlil Prime will endure. This period of temporary hardship will pass. We are not alone in this. We are taking bold steps to secure our economy, protect our sovereignty, and ensure a prosperous future for all citizens.”

Despite his reassurances, the journalists were still shouting questions as the feed cut out.

The press conference ended, but the words lingered, looping in my mind like a broken transmission. Temporary hardship. Workforce adjustments. Stability and security. The meaningless phrases washed over me like static, offering no solutions, no relief—just more proof that things were slipping further out of my control.

My holopad chimed. My stomach clenched. I already knew it wasn’t good news, but some desperate, foolish part of me still hoped.

“Leena, they cut my hours. Yours too. I tried to argue, but they wouldn’t budge. I’m so sorry. We’ll figure something out.”

NO! No, no, no, no, no, no!

I sucked in a breath, but it caught in my chest, hot and sharp. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I had done everything right—worked late shifts, stretched every credit, made every sacrifice to keep things steady after my husband died. And for what? To watch it all crumble anyway?

The twins stirred in my lap, sensing my tension. Their little ears flicked, and one let out a soft, questioning whimper.

I pressed a paw to my eyes, trying to steady myself. Not now. Don’t break now. But the weight of everything pressed down, suffocating, relentless. My breath hitched, and I let out a shaky exhale, barely holding the sob in my throat at bay.

Then the fussing started.

First, a soft, restless shifting. Then, another whimper—higher, more insistent. Tiny claws grasped at my fur, and before I could even force myself to soothe them, the first wail cut through the room.

That was all it took. The other joined in, their cries sharp and needy, a desperate plea for comfort I didn’t have the strength to give.

I tried to shush them, my voice breaking. “I know, babies. I know.” I ran a trembling paw over their backs, rocking them, but the tears had already blurred my vision, and my own breaths were coming too fast, too shallow.

One of them buried their face against my chest, while the other twisted in my grasp, their cries growing more frantic, their little bodies tense with distress. They could feel it—they always could. No matter how hard I tried to hold everything together, they knew.

I clenched my jaw, sucking in another breath.

No. No more crying. I had already done this. I had already lost everything once. I couldn’t fall apart again.

But it was too late. The dam had already broken.

A choked sob forced its way out of my throat, and I curled around them, pressing my forehead against their tiny, trembling bodies. Their cries didn’t stop, but I couldn’t shush them this time.

Because they weren’t the only ones crying anymore.

**Memory transcription subject:** *Dani, Anxious School Teacher*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: August 22, 2136*

Sunday mornings in our household followed a familiar rhythm, one woven from years of tradition. The scent of warm bolillos filled the air as my mother set out breakfast, a simple yet comforting spread of fresh bread, coffee, and leftover picadillo from the night before. My father, still in his pressed button-up shirt from Mass, thumbed through the morning paper while my aunt Lucia animatedly recounted the latest gossip from the church congregation. The hum of conversation, punctuated by laughter, made our modest home feel full, alive.

I had just begun helping Mamá clear the table, stacking plates and wiping away stray crumbs, when Papá rustled his newspaper and set it aside with a satisfied sigh. ""Nothing new in here we haven't already heard at Mass,"" he muttered, stretching his arms before reaching for his coffee. The scent of cinnamon and roasted beans filled the air, mixing with the lingering warmth of fresh bread. Satisfied that the table was cleared, I made my way to the couch and sank into it, letting out a small breath. The cushions felt soft and familiar, a comforting contrast to the weight settling in my chest. I tucked my legs under me and wrapped my hands around my coffee mug, letting its warmth seep into my fingers. The morning had been pleasantly routine, the kind of Sunday I had come to cherish.

I took a sip of my own coffee, savoring the momentary peace. The quiet hum of the television played in the background, a familiar presence in our household, but I paid it little mind. Mamá wiped her hands on a dish towel and glanced at the clock. ""It’s almost noon,"" she noted, more to herself than anyone in particular. Papá hummed in response, already reaching for the remote.

As Papá pressed the remote, the television flickered to life, immediately displaying the noon news. It was a routine part of our Sundays—he always insisted on staying informed—but lately, the updates had only brought more unease. The news droned in the background, just another part of our Sunday routine. I wasn’t even listening—until something in the anchor’s voice *curdled*. Sharp. Wrong. My stomach clenched before my brain caught up. I looked up.

“We interrupt this broadcast for breaking news. We have just received confirmation that the two missing pilots from the attack on the exchange program have been recovered. We must warn you—the following footage is disturbing.”

All eyes in the room—mine, Mamá’s, Papá’s, and Tía Lucía’s—immediately fixated on the TV broadcast, our conversations forgotten. The air in the room shifted, thick with tension as the reporter’s voice carried over the hum of the television. My mother murmured a quiet prayer under her breath. All thoughts of our usual Sunday comforts faded as we turned toward the screen, bracing for whatever came next.

The living room shrank around me. The hum of the news broadcast blurred against the pounding in my temples. My hands clenched against my thighs, slick with sweat. The cinnamon-scented air turned thick, suffocating. I wanted to move—but I couldn't.

The camera panned to the shuttle as it descended into the hangar, soldiers surrounding it with weapons raised, their rigid stances betraying their readiness for violence. Despite the layers of protocol and precaution, there was an air of unrelenting uncertainty. Was this a rescue or a trap? My throat tightened as I watched the scene unfold.

The shuttle hatch opened slowly, revealing a single fluffy figure stumbling down the ramp. A Venlil, head wrapped in bandages, hands raised in desperate supplication. The Venlil called out in a language I couldn't understand, its tone urgent and pleading. His tail swayed erratically behind him, emphasizing the urgency in his movements. My heart leapt at the sight of him, an alien, alive and desperate, but something unspoken clawed at the edges of my mind. This wasn’t relief, it was dread. My breath caught in my throat as I realized what—or who—was coming next.

Two uniformed medics rushed forward with a stretcher, their movements precise but urgent.

Their actions were swift, controlled, and efficient, but their postures were rigid, betraying the tension that lined every step they took. The crowd in the hangar stilled, as if holding its breath alongside me.

Then, they reemerged carrying the battered form of the human pilot. A shudder rippled down my spine. His swollen face, deep gashes, and overlapping bruises—each a silent scream of suffering. As the camera zoomed in, the  image of a metal collar cut into his raw burned skin filled the screen.

“¡Dios mío!” my mother gasped, clutching the crucifix hanging from her neck, her words almost drowned by the sound of my own heartbeat. My father made the sign of the cross, his voice barely a whisper as he muttered a prayer.

My stomach churned, the sickening weight of the moment sinking deep into my chest. There was no mistaking the brutality of it—this wasn’t just a fear of us. It was hatred. It had been carved into his flesh, as if trying to erase his humanity entirely.

I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the screen, even though the bile rose in my throat. Marcel’s image—once a smiling face on news reports—was now a twisted shell of what had been.

As the camera lingered on Marcel’s battered form, I felt time stretch in a sickening loop. My mind raced with questions, but the reality of what I was seeing bludgeoned them into silence. My pulse pounded in my ears, drowning out the muted hum of the television. Every breath felt shallow, each inhale a struggle.

The room had grown cold, even though the warmth of Sunday had clung to the walls like it always did. The weight of what we were witnessing pressed down on me, a thick, suffocating blanket that made it hard to breathe. The taste of cinnamon in the air was cloying, and the warmth of my mother’s candles seemed out of place, only deepening the feeling that something had shifted, irrevocably.

Ever since the announcement that the Odyssey crew had made contact with the Venlil, I had yearned for the chance to speak with them myself, to bridge the gap between our worlds and learn about them. But as I stared at the screen, a creeping unease settled in my chest. The UN had warned us—the Federation feared us because of their history with the Arxur, and if they discovered we were still alive, they would try to wipe us out. I wanted to believe in peace, in diplomacy, but how could I ignore this evidence?

My uncle, ferried cargo across the stars, had been making frequent trips to the Mars colony since first contact, transporting large amounts of military equipment instead of his normal goods and materials. My cousin in the armed forces had been called into active duty only a week ago. The signs of war were everywhere, woven into the fabric of my own family.

Despite it all, I clung to the hope that we could avoid conflict, that there was still a chance for something better. If the venlil could overcome their fear, maybe others could too.

But now, confronted with the grim reality of Marcel's fate, doubt crept into my heart.

Was humanity ready for this? Were we prepared for the chaos and uncertainty that would surely follow our discovery?

Dad finally clicked off the TV with a heavy sigh. ""Terrible,"" he muttered, shaking his head.

I swallowed hard, glancing at my mother, my father, my aunt—but their faces mirrored my own dread. No one moved.

The only sound was the faint hum of the refrigerator, leaving us alone with our thoughts. After a long, tense moment, my father exhaled sharply and ran a hand over his face. 

""Let's sit down,"" he said at last, his voice quieter, almost weary. 

The images lingered in my mind, each frame seared into my thoughts, refusing to fade. How could things have gone so wrong? 

We filed into the dining room, the weight of what we'd witnessed hanging over us like a storm cloud. As we took our seats, Dad's brow furrowed with concern. ""Dani, if you get accepted into that Exchange program... after seeing this, I'm worried sick about what could happen to you.""

Mom shot him a pointed look, her lips pursed. ""What's done is done, mi amor. All we can do now is pray for Marcel and hope he recovers quickly.""

The images wouldn’t leave me. My fingers twisted my napkin, my stomach knotting. I glanced at my parents, both lost in their own silent contemplation, their faces drawn with worry. I turned to Tía Lucía, hoping for some reassurance, but even she looked uncharacteristically troubled. Her fingers drummed lightly against the table, her brows furrowed in concern. Was she thinking about her husband? He had been working longer hours lately, making more supply runs. Maybe she feared what might come next just as much as I did. only the soft hum of the refrigerator filling the silence. Just as I opened my mouth to say something—anything to break the tension—Papá stood abruptly.

Looking at Mamá he said, ""You're right dear, it's in God's hands now.""

Mom stood too, putting on her favorite apron and walked to the kitchen. ""I'll start on lunch.""

""Need any help?"" I offered.

I was looking for something to do, something else to occupy my thoughts, anything to drive the images of that man from my mind.

""I got it, you two just relax."" Dad called from the kitchen.

Tía Lucía's chair creaked as she leaned back. She had a mischievous grin on her face, her previous worry completely gone.

""I've told you all about the goings on at church but I didn't get a chance to talk to you Dani.""

She kept her voice a little higher than necessary and an eye on the kitchen doorway.

""That's right!"" My mother's voice carried over the sounds of my parents at work on lunch. ""How was your week Mija, meet anyone special yet?""

It was an obvious ploy, one she had used many times before whenever she wanted to change a subject of conversation. I knew what she was doing, and for a brief moment, I considered rolling my eyes or giving a sarcastic response. But instead, I decided to let her have this one.

I lowered my gaze, my mind still tangled in the weight of the broadcast. The delicious scent of enchiladas floated in from the other room, a stark contrast to the gnawing unease in my stomach. I took a slow breath, forcing myself to push aside the lingering dread. Only then did I catch the expectant look on my mother's face. Heat rushed to my cheeks. ""Mamá,"" I groaned, torn between embarrassment and amusement.

Before Mom could press further, Tía Lucía took advantage of her opening to tease my father, ""Any cute alien girls catch your fancy?""

Papá moved like lightning to the doorway.

""Lucía!"" He exclaimed as he threw a dish towel at her playfully. ""Don't give her ideas, I still want grand kids.""

I couldn't help but chuckle at their banter, feeling some of the tension in my shoulders ease. This was my family—warm, supportive, and always ready with a joke to lighten even the darkest mood.

As I began to relax, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I hesitated before reaching for it, my fingers hovering over the screen. The moment of normalcy around me suddenly felt fragile, like glass waiting to shatter. Taking a steadying breath, I pulled out my phone and glanced at the notification. My heart stopped as I saw the sender—Exchange Program Admissions.

The email sat on my screen, waiting. My thumb hovered over it, heart pounding in my ears. This was it—the moment I’d been waiting for. The chance to speak to a real alien, to learn how they thought, how they created, how they saw the world.

I took a breath, then tapped the message open.

""Thank you for taking the time to apply...""

My eyes darted ahead, scanning, searching. My stomach twisted.

“Rejection.”

The word slammed into me like a punch to the gut. It was like the air had been sucked from the room, leaving me weightless and untethered. The weight of it pressed down on my chest, squeezing the breath from me.

I blinked hard, willing the words to change, but they stayed the same, stark and final. My fingertips tingled, my grip tightening around my phone as though I could squeeze a different answer out of it. My heart pounded in my throat, loud, erratic—drowning out every other sound.

For a moment, everything blurred, like I was underwater, watching my own world tilt. But I forced my eyes back to the screen, desperate for an explanation.

Then I saw it.

The UN had determined that the Venlil were not ready to be exposed to humans who consumed meat, even lab-grown meat. They needed to be selective. The program was flooded with applicants, and they had to choose those best suited for early integration.

That was it.

Not because I wasn’t qualified. Not because I wasn’t capable. But because of something so fundamental, so intrinsic, that I couldn’t change it without lying about who I was.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep reading.

""We will be keeping your application on file. As the program expands, we will notify you if another opportunity arises.""

The words were meant to soften the blow, but they barely registered. My hands trembled as I tightened my grip on my phone, like holding onto it could stop the world from shifting beneath me.

I took a breath meant to steady me, but it only made the rejection settle deeper, heavier. My body felt distant, foreign, like I was floating outside myself, watching as I stared at the screen, reading the same lines over and over.

Rejected.

Because of what I ate.

""Dani, what's wrong?"" My tia had taken my hand in hers, concern etched in her features. My mother and father approached from behind, peering over my shoulder at my phone to see what had upset me.

I opened my mouth, but the words caught in my throat. I clenched my jaw, forcing back the lump rising there. It took another long moment before I finally found my voice.

""They rejected me,"" I confessed, barely above a whisper. ""They're not accepting people who eat meat right now.""

The silence at the table stretched between us, thick with unspoken sympathy. No matter how much I tried to push the rejection email from my mind, the words refused to leave, burned into my thoughts like a brand.

My mother reached behind me and began to gently rub my back. “Mija, I know how much you wanted this.”

My father nodded, his expression thoughtful. 

""You are clever Dani. This door may be closed but you will find another."" 

He placed his hand on my shoulder and gave me a reassuring squeeze before walking back into the kitchen to retrieve lunch.

I forced a small smile, but my stomach twisted. Another door. Sure. But the next one probably wouldn't be for some time. It wouldn't be what I’d spent weeks hoping for.

Tía Lucia, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke up. “I just hate seeing you like this, corazón.” She gestured animatedly, as if motion alone could chase away the disappointment weighing me down. “It’s their loss, really. You would have been an amazing ambassador for us.”

I let out a breathy chuckle. “Yeah, well, they don’t want someone who eats meat, amazing or not.”

My mother’s brow furrowed, “That doesn’t mean they won’t change their minds later.”

I wasn’t so sure, but I didn’t want to dwell on it anymore. The rejection had taken up enough space in my mind. I needed to move on—at least for now.

“So,” I said, sitting up a little straighter. “We still need to finish planning for Día de los Muertos. Have you decided if we’re setting up an altar at the church?”

My mother exchanged a glance with Tía Lucia, the shift in topic obvious but unchallenged.

“I think we should,” my mother said, “but we still need to talk to Father Matthew about the space.”

Tía Lucia nodded. “And we need to figure out how much pan de muerto to make. Last year, we ran out way too fast.”

The conversation flowed around me, and I added small comments where I could, but the rejection still sat heavy in my chest. No matter how much I tried to push it away, the what-ifs gnawed at me.

Lunch proceeded as usual, though, I barely registered the meal, preoccupied as I was.

As we cleared the table, Tía Lucia suddenly snapped her fingers. “You know, Dani, maybe you should take this as an opportunity.”

I glanced at her. “For what?”

“A pen pal program! Not just for you, but for the kids. The exchange program is all well and good, but what about the children? Imagine if human and venlil kids could learn from each other, share stories, talk about their lives!” Her eyes sparkled with excitement. “You could write up a proposal and take it to the UN.”

I stared at her. “You think they’d actually listen?”

“Why not?” Tía Lucia grinned. “If they’re so selective, maybe they need a new way to connect people. And you, my dear, might just be the one to start it.”

For the first time since opening that email, something other than disappointment sparked in my chest.

I hesitated, caught off guard. A pen pal program? It wasn’t the same as going myself, but the idea had merit. My students were naturally curious, and this could be a way to foster understanding in a way the official exchange program wouldn’t allow me to. I tapped my fingers against the table, considering. ""You really think the school would go for something like that?""

I hesitated, my immediate instinct was to dismiss the idea. After everything I had just seen, after the way Marcel had been treated, after I was rejected, was it even worth trying? A part of me thought it would be a waste of time, but another part—the part that had dreamed of understanding the unknown—couldn’t ignore the possibility. If there was a way to change their perception of us, maybe this was it. *And maybe that dream was still worth chasing*.

I exhaled slowly, the weight of resistance easing. Tomorrow, I’d try again. Maybe this time, it would be different.

I have an IT job, and he’s involved in his family’s business.

We live with his parents, and over the past year, I’ve realized just how much he has been pampered. His parents never even let him move out for his education. We do have a maid and a cook, but when they aren’t around, he doesn’t lift a finger. He won’t even fold his blanket after waking up, do his own laundry, or clean up after meals. He expected me to make his coffee every morning, but I put my foot down on that. Because of this, my MIL constantly taunts me and compares me to other women.

She expects me to pack and unpack his bags after a trip. If he eats lunch late, she never asks him to clean up after himself, but if I do, she expects me to wash the dishes. If he leaves wet towels around, she tells me to dry them. I don’t hate her, but the way she babies him—and expects me to do the same—is exhausting.

I’ve told my husband that I don’t think this is fair. His response? ""Do whatever you can, and whatever you can't do, my mom will."" That’s it. No effort, no compromise.

I had decided I was done. I was ready to leave. I even talked to my sister-in-law, and she understood completely. She suggested that we live separately for a while so that he could learn how to take care of himself. I brought it up to him, but he was completely against it. His parents are in their mid-60s, but they’re not dependent on him—if anything, he is dependent on them. Especially his mom. He also said that even if we moved out, I would end up doing most of the work anyway.

That was it for me. I was prepared to walk away.

And then… he was diagnosed with early-stage cancer.

Now, he needs me more than ever, and I feel incredibly guilty for wanting to leave. I love him, but I can’t see myself staying in this marriage long-term. I feel trapped. I don’t know how to navigate this situation. I don’t want to abandon him while he’s sick, but I also don’t want to keep living like this.

How do I handle this?

1ivqzes,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialkillers/comments/1ivqzes/gerard_john_schaefer/,Gerard John Schaefer,"Please note that this is written as a script because we used this in a Youtube video. I decided to keep it like that because it makes the whole thing easyer to read.

To write this article I read some [newspaper articles](https://www.newspapers.com/image/318378095/?clipping_id=119971489&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjMxODM3ODA5NSwiaWF0IjoxNzM3NzM4NDI4LCJleHAiOjE3Mzc4MjQ4Mjh9.bCobUsvWre2aqw1dw9TZ5rnXLqzQieHyxdUbpB6YK9I), a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Hangman-Life-Crimes-Gerard-Schaefer/dp/1987902165) and other sites.

**CHILDHOOD (Levi)**

Gerard John Schaefer was born in Neenah, Wisconsin, on March 26, 1946.  
His father was a traveling salesman, and his mother was a housewife.  
From a young age, Gerard displayed some strange behaviors—behaviors that seem to be common among future serial killers.

Gerard:

* Stole women's underwear
* Fantasized about dying
* Killed small animals
* (A little more specific) Tied himself to trees because it ""excited him""

  
Gerard considered himself ""hated"" and ""unwanted"" by his parents, saying they much preferred his younger sister.

**ADOLESCENCE (Pavlein)**

Gerard attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School.

He was a very solitary boy and was thought to aspire to become a park ranger.

At 14, he had his first girlfriend, Cindy, who later said that Gerard involved her in role-playing fantasies where he would tear her clothes off and ""rape"" her. In 1963, she broke up with him.  
These fantasies evolved, leading him to develop a preference for sadomasochism. He started deriving pleasure from inflicting pain on himself, sometimes doing so while wearing women's underwear. He often performed full-fledged “rituals,” which involved tying himself to a tree in a remote area. The time he spent doing these “rituals” increased in both frequency and intensity, eventually occupying most of his waking hours.

A former classmate, Barbara Krolick, recalled him like this:  
(Watson) *""I don’t remember him being friends with any of the guys. He was always on the outside looking in. In fact, the only thing I really remember is that I always had to tuck my skirt under my legs because he would practically stand on his head to look under girls' skirts.""*

(Watson)  
**DESPITE BEING A SADOMASOCHIST AND A NOTORIOUS PEEPING TOM,**  
Schaefer was still considered a promising student by his teachers.

He graduated in June 1964 and briefly worked as a fishing guide in the Everglades before enrolling at Broward Community College. After completing his second year at Broward, he applied for a scholarship at FAU, Florida Atlantic University, where he began his studies in 1968, aspiring to earn a degree in education.

It was while studying at Broward that John received a letter instructing him to report for a medical examination for military enlistment. Since John didn’t want to go, he left another letter in his room—a suicide note. Webster, his roommate, said he did it just to get another deferment. (I say ""another"" because John was already seeing a psychiatrist to be deemed ""mentally disturbed"" and avoid being drafted into the army.)

**LOVE LIFE & CAREER (Watson)**

What you're about to hear now are the reactions of Schaefer’s “friends” to his marriage with Martha, aka ""Marty,"" Louise Fogg. These reactions will be kindly voiced by Levi:

*""He met Marty somewhere in Michigan while traveling. When he told me he was engaged, I told him he was crazy. He had only known her for a few weeks.""*

*""Marty was a genius. John is very smart too, but he’s also very competitive. It was tough for him to be with someone as intelligent as Marty.""*

(Watson)  
And this time, John should have listened to his friends since he divorced his wife after just two years. Now, let’s focus on his professional life:

**TEACHER (Pavlein)**

Schaefer started working on September 23, 1969, having been admitted (as a teacher) to Plantation High School. His job was to teach geography. He was fired on November 7 for repeatedly trying to impose his moral and/or political views on his students.

His last attempt at a teaching job was in April 1970, when he began teaching geography at Stranahan High School. His superiors noticed both his arrogance and his ""very limited"" knowledge of the subject. Seven weeks after Schaefer started teaching there, the principal informed him that the school had decided to terminate his internship by May 18. His teaching career officially ended the next day.

**SECOND MARRIAGE (Levi)**

It was around this time, May 1970, that Schaefer officially divorced his wife and decided to take a trip to Europe ""to forget her.""  
In October, he was hired as a night watchman at Florida Power & Light Co., where he met a secretary named Teresa Dolly Dean.  
They got married in September 1971 (about a year later). John was 27.  
After the wedding, he decided he wanted to become a police officer.

**POLICE OFFICER (Watson)**

Finding a job wasn’t difficult since, just a few days after his wedding, he was hired by the Wilton Manors Police Department in Florida. Let’s hear how Schaefer was perceived by Bernard Scott, the police chief:

(Pavlein) *""A man without even a gram of common sense.""*

(Watson)  
But that wasn’t all, as Scott also recounted a particular incident in which Schaefer and a sergeant had gone to a location where an accident had just occurred. Here’s Scott’s story:

(Pavlein) *""The sergeant was interviewing the people involved, and Schaefer was supposed to direct traffic. When the sergeant looked up and saw the traffic getting jammed, he looked around for Schaefer, and there he was—leaning against a pole, eating a bag of fries.""*

(Watson)  
So, one day in April, Scott called Schaefer with the intention of firing him. But on the same day, after being fired, Schaefer went for an interview with the Fort Lauderdale police. When the Fort Lauderdale interviewer called Scott to say that Schaefer had complained about him and was looking for a job, Scott replied:

(Pavlein) *""I’d rather lose my own uniform than see him back on the street.""*

And with that, Schaefer had to give up his uniform and gun.

(Levi)  
But by June, Schaefer was back on the streets, wearing the uniform of the Martin County sheriff. Nothing significant happened until July, when Schaefer saw Paula Sue Wells (17 years old) and Nancy Ellen Trotter (18 years old) hitchhiking and decided to “help” them.

(Watson)  
I want to emphasize that Schaefer was on official patrol, inside a police car, in uniform.

(Levi)  
While the girls were in the car, Schaefer lectured them, scolding them about the dangers of hitchhiking. The girls told Schaefer that they were from Texas and Michigan, respectively, and that their final destination was Jensen Beach. Upon hearing this, John offered to give them a ride. The two accepted his offer, and they agreed to meet in front of a stage on East Ocean Boulevard at 9:15 AM.

The next morning, Schaefer arrived at the stage at the agreed time. This time, he was not in uniform and was driving his personal vehicle, but he still managed to convince the girls to get in. However, John didn’t take them to the beach—he took them to a remote, densely wooded area on Hutchinson Island. He threatened the girls with death and, according to their statements, with white slavery. He handcuffed them, tied them to a tree, and placed nooses around their necks.

Schaefer was about to kill them when he received an urgent call over the radio (looks at Pavlein):

(Pavlein)  
""Sheriff Schaefer, report to the police station immediately. It’s urgent.""

(Levi)  
And Schaefer told the girls:

(Watson)  
""Uh… I have to go! You two stay here, okay? Don’t run away… I’m just going to talk to the guy I’m selling you to… yeah…"" (not what he LITERALLY said)

(Levi)  
When Schaefer returned, he saw that the girls had escaped, so he went home to call the station… let’s hear it:

(Watson)  
""I did something really stupid, you’re going to be mad at me… I wanted to teach two girls a lesson about the dangers of hitchhiking, but… let’s just say I went a little too far."" (not what he LITERALLY said)

**ARREST & DISCOVERY OF OTHER VICTIMS**

(Watson)  
Officers found the girls running, terrified, through the swampy woods. They were still handcuffed.

Schaefer was charged with assault and released on a $15,000 bail. While free, he struggled to keep a job. On December 22, he pleaded guilty to an aggravated assault charge and was sentenced to six months in prison. He entered prison on January 15. While there, Schaefer spent a lot of time writing murder stories, which he would read to the other inmates.

On April 1, Schaefer heard on the radio that the bodies of two girls, whom he had allegedly been seen with in September, had been found. A fellow inmate said Schaefer tore his stories into tiny pieces and threw them in the trash.

The police confirmed that the two girls, Susan Place and Georgia Jessup, had been tied to a tree and then brutally murdered. Their dismembered bodies were buried near a scarred tree. The police immediately linked the case to Schaefer, noting similarities with his previous assault case.

(Pavlein)  
This led to a lengthy trial, which concluded on October 4, 1973, with a sentence of two life terms.

Confirmed victims? 2.  
Suspected victims? 28.

Schaefer always claimed he was innocent—except when confronted by Ted Bundy.  
Schaefer was extremely competitive and wanted to be the best. When Ted asked him how many people he had really killed, Schaefer replied:

(Levi) *""The police say 28.""*  
(Watson) *""I know… but I know the business… how many did you really kill?""*  
(Levi) *""The police say 28…""*

**DEATH (Pavlein)**

On December 3, 1995, Schaefer was stabbed about 42 times by Vincent Faustino Rivera. He was 49 years old. Apparently, they had been arguing over a cup of coffee.

**KILLER FICTION**

In 1990, a collection of Schaefer’s stories was published. The book is called *Killer Fiction*—a collection of fictional murder stories.

Yk, the whole “I’m still young, I can fix this” kind of thing. But deep down I’ve completely lost it.

Just in December 2023 I was obese, in summer 2024 i was underweight and severely disordered. I restricted myself so hard, I’d cry if I ate a bit over 1000 cals. And all that while I was working a job where I was upright and moving all day. (Literally from 10 in the morning to 10pm 5 times a week)

Now I’m almost (or maybe I already am idk) overweight again. Back then i’d break down if the scale didn’t go down while literally doing weight train at the gym - like ofc you’re not gonna lose 2kg in a week like you did when you’re building muscle.

My face looked off - it was too slender and my smile lines were pretty much engraved into my skin. I‘d constantly have bruises all over me and my skin looked disgustingly blue and dead. My period had been gone for over a half year and I was so fucking happy about that.

The binging started while I was still working. I‘d get a pack with 12 Castela cakes and eat them all during the first two hours of working. I constantly had a lollipop in my mouth to mildly satisfy my cravings even though I’d be in contact with customers all the time. Why did I not gain tho? I skipped meals entirely. I did not have a single warm meal in summer. I was severely nutritionally deficient and I had both low blood sugar and bradycardia. 

I constantly had to sit down at work from exhaustion to prevent blacking out. I was constantly tired and fell asleep on the floor because I couldn’t even make it to the couch. On the days where I knew I didn’t have to work the next day, I’d go to sleep with full face make up and I’d sleep till 3-5 in the morning, wake-up out of nowhere, go to the bathroom and go back to sleep. Then I’d wake up at 4pm, dehydrated as hell, looking like a mess, make an iced coffee (not more than 50cals of courseee), go to the bathroom, watch a bit of YouTube and go back to sleep. 

I was a mess, that’s what I’m trying to say. I constantly missed my bus to work cause I‘d sleep in which ended up in me getting fired… Yeah. 

I‘d even hit the gym atleast once a week with all that bs but the omg- I injured myself BAD. I fell down and ripped the entire skin off my left elbow. I went to work and my boss told me to keep working and go to the hospital on my day off. My arm got inflamed because I slapped some random ass bandage on it to stop the bleeding. I had my co-worker call my boss to convince him to let me go to the hospital.

What did I do literally 3 days later? Go to the gym. I couldn’t even move my arm but hey, I can still do cardio and hit legs, right?

I was crazy but I loved it n I still romanticize it. I want to get back there. But the worst part is, I was never happy with myself. I felt ugly. Not thin enough. Not fit enough. Not eating clean enough.
I‘d constantly crash out because I wanted more. I wanted to lose more, be smaller, be better, be thinspo. Looking back, I was, I just compared myself to bonespo on edtwt. Edtwt ruined me.

Whatever. Eventually I started to believe this whole narrative of me being fat so much that I became fat. I gained 10kg from September to January. How? I ate and ate and ate and I couldn’t stop. I‘d constantly be sick and in pain, so much pain I couldn’t move. I tried to make myself sick all the time but my body refused. So I opted for laxatives to make me feel a little less bloated… combined with Ana incontinence that was a little stupid at times…
Now I think I’m bulimic or smt cause nowadays my body doesn’t fully refuse but it‘s nothing to help me lose weight or whatever.. I’ll never get how ppl do it.

Anyways I’m fucked up. My face is bloated to the point I look like myself when I was obese and my body is literally just swollen and big. Back then I was worried about my chest bones not showing, not my collarbones are literally swallowed by the fat on my body.

I still go to the gym and I’ve doubled, even tripled the weights I use at the gym since summer cause my body has energy now. So I just look bulky and weird. My jeans don’t fit me anymore and I went up 2 sizes SINCE SUMMER. It’s hard to breathe, my skin is oily, I keep breaking out, my body is sore and I’m bloated all the time. My bracelets are tight on my wrist and worst of all, I got my period back. It‘s still unstable and doesn’t last longer than 3 days but the cravings, endless hunger, pain and discomfort is there and it’s worse than ever.

I can’t fucking handle this. I crave sweets and fatty food like nothing else. While I’m eating one, I’m preparing the other and i literally binge on the worst shit.

Wtf am I doing? I‘m rlly sorry cause this is a whole ass paragraph of me ranting and romanticizing my disordered body but idk who to talk to abt this. I don’t have access to therapy, I don’t have money to try online therapy and yes, I’ve even tried suicide hotlines and they just tell me to „find someone to talk to“ - duh?

My family/friends are the most judgemental and insensitive people in the world so I’m literally all by myself. The only sense of community I get is on forums and subreddits like these. Ty for reading.",1,1740252730.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

Some items I enjoy include but aren’t limited to lifting weights, cooking and learning. I struggle to engage with passive entertainment—TV, movies, music, video games, social media, etc. and prefer activities with clear and or tangible outcomes. Casual small talk and text-based communication often feel tedious; I value phone conversations or in-person interactions over surface-level exchanges when possible.

I’ve noticed a tendency to try to adjust my mannerisms or behavior to accommodate others, which has made forming genuine, lasting friendships or advanced partnerships challenging. I do not want others to feel uncomfortable around me. At times, social interactions have felt more like hard labor than a source of enjoyment.

I often find it challenging to discern whether someone regards me as a friend or is open to developing a friendship. For instance, I’ve recently engaged in an online knowledge exchange with an individual, which is a new experience for me. While our discussions have been enjoyable and stimulating, I’m uncertain whether to interpret this as the beginning of a sort of friendship or merely a collaborative interaction. Distinguishing between friendship, acquaintanceship, and simple collaboration aimed at achieving personal goals can be difficult. 

I do think it would be very nice to be able to have a coffee with a friend, acquaintance or other once in a while if at all possible.

I love baking and cooking so, if I ever try a new recipe, I’d like someone to test them out with! I love video games—I’ve recently been playing a game called Coffee Talk which is honestly really good—and music, particularly classic and prog rock. I also like puzzles like crosswords and word searches, as well as keeping up with the news and sports (I’m a Liverpool fan, if that helps my case!). I’m also trying to lose some weight at the moment so, if you have any advice, I’d love to hear it!

As for what I’d want in a partner, I just want someone kind and loyal who loves a good laugh! I’m not *that* fussy about specific looks, but I’d prefer someone a little shorter than me (I’m 5’7”). I’d also like someone who loves to talk about their interests, as I’d love to learn more about what you’re interested in. Oh, and I’d also prefer someone who loves hugs and physical affection if possible 😅

Anyway, if you’ve read this far, please leave a ✨ in your message if you want to dm me, and tell me about yourself and what you’re interested in. Either way, I hope whoever reads this is having a good day!",1,1740252538.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.99,False
1ivqv4s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivqv4s,Harira,"I used this recipe.

https://forward.com/food/455164/hot-moroccan-harira-soup-beats-cold-fish-for-yom-kippur-break-fast/

There are many, many other delicious styles of harira, but I was looking for a vegan one I could serve for breakfast on cold mornings.

To up the protein, I'll sometimes add collagen powder to my coffee, serve with a couple of eggs on the side, or top with leftover chicken breast. Obviously, this raises the calories from 260/serving, but still easy to keep under 400-500.

Low calorie, filling from the fiber, and extremely comforting. ",1,1740252530.0,Volumeeating,1,1.0,False

It all started when I was looking for a new hobby and found a random flyer on a coffee shop bulletin board. It just said:

💀 “Exclusive Midnight Gathering – For Those Who Seek the Truth.” 💀

I thought, “Cool, probably a book club or something.”

So I text the number, and they give me an address. It’s in a sketchy, abandoned-looking warehouse. Red flag #1.

When I get there, everyone’s in black robes, chanting something in Latin. At this point, I should’ve just noped out… but NOPE, my dumb self stays because I didn’t want to be rude.

Then, they circle me and ask: “Do you seek enlightenment?”

Me: “Uh… yeah, sure?”

Them: “Then the initiation begins.”

INITIATION???

I start sweating. Before I can say anything, they hand me a live turtle and tell me to “whisper the name of my greatest fear into its shell.”

WTF.

I panic and just say “Student loans.”

They all nod approvingly.

Then they give me a candle and tell me to walk through a door labeled “The Trial.” I step inside, and it’s just… a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit.

At this point, I realize I’m either in a cult or the weirdest escape room ever.

Soooo… am I in danger, or did I just get recruited into a society of ancient turtle whisperers?

1ivqpxm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivqpxm,I built an App for Fuel Prices - Pick a Pump,"Hey folks,

I’ve built Pick A Pump, a fuel price and station info app that’s new by already popular in Ireland & Northern Ireland and now expanding into mainland UK! We’re new here, but we already have most UK public stations and fuel prices thanks to UK Gov’s price-sharing mandate—plus features other apps don’t offer.

Why use Pick a Pump instead of PetrolPrices or some of the smaller sites that are popping up? Well firstly I think we’ve got the best UX, a founder (thats me) that wants users to be happy and have a good experience and save money - and I actually use the app like the users!

🔥 Why Pick A Pump?

✅ Covers UK, Northern Ireland & Republic of Ireland – unlike most apps, we don’t ignore NI & ROI.
✅ Live Traffic Cams & Warnings – currently in NI, expanding to the UK soon.
✅ See Station Services & Facilities – not just prices!
✅ Add Your Car to the Garage – track MOT, tax, and NCT (ROI).
✅ EChargers in ROI & NI – coming soon to mainland UK.
✅ Suggest Missing Stations & Report Data Issues – help improve accuracy.
✅ Support for Small & Independent Stations – we pull UK Gov price data but also want to build a community to add and promote local, family-run stations.

We’re still rolling out more updates in mainland UK, but our goal is to be the easiest and most useful fuel app out there. 

Would love to hear your feedback!

1ivqdws,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1ivqdws/blood_on_the_dance_floor/,Blood on the Dance Floor,"Greetings fellow Cainites.

As an aside before we get into things, negotiations have occurred between our Pack (via Baron Kendricks) and a local representative of Clan Hecata in regards to the recent violation of our domain. I won’t go into details for the sake of their privacy, but we’ve found the recompense to be satisfactory and are pleased that the problem has been dealt with. I thank Sparrow Ghiberti in helping us come to this mutually satisfactory conclusion.

The party I’ve been alluding to for a short time occurred last night… alongside a Camarilla counterattack upon the domain. I’ll get into details in a moment, but for now I’ll start with the less eventful portion of the party. 

The “Winter Bash” as the Baron put it, happened in a warehouse by the river; obviously harkening back to the setting of illegal raves and other such events held in similar locales. As we were informed prior, the event was exclusive to the Cainites and ghouls of the domain, with refreshments being provided by a group of Thinbloods that can apparently reinvigorate bagged kine blood. I tasted some myself and although it was not a perfect imitation of a fresh feed, it was certainly better than bagged blood usually is. Our entire pack attended the gathering and made the acquaintance of the rest of the domain’s Cainites, making our faces and deeds known throughout the crowd and setting up future deals. One interesting trade I have made is with a local Ventrue who runs a “gentleman’s club” and provides blood dolls to the rest of the domain. We came to an agreement to have me “refurbish” his employees in exchange for a fair number of Minor Boons as well as the ability to indulge in his services free of charge for half a year. My other packmates have made similar progress, making their own connections to further their personal agendas. It seems our recent successes have endeared us somewhat to the locals, as according to rumors there has been some dissatisfaction in the lack of progress in the war against the Prince; partly in this domain but mainly in Arlington. Our previous affiliation caused little issue (beyond a few rude remarks now and then) despite it being common knowledge by now, save for a small group of Cainites that glared at us from across the room. When I inquired about them, it was told to me that they were rumored to be part of some “cult” and when my peers spoke broadly of their practices it was reminiscent of Bahari rites I’ve heard tell of in texts before. I suppose their like could’ve experienced some persecution by Orthodox Sabbat in the past, although I personally have no issue with their faith. 

Now, I suppose I should get to the meat of the issue. The Baron had a private room overlooking the dance floor through a one way mirror set up in this warehouse in preparation for the party and was taking meetings with various Cainites throughout the night. I and Stella decided to avail ourselves of this opportunity and met with the Baron in a free moment to discuss business and countermeasures for a potential Camarilla counterattack while the rest of the pack continued to mingle. The meeting was nothing really to note, just setting up a few deliveries followed by some platitudes given by the Baron that he was “working on it”. The trouble began when, in a lull in the conversation, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end and I felt the familiar premonition of danger my Auspex has granted me. I stood up immediately and shouted for the others to get ready. Stella obliged, drawing her blade while I focused my blood to extend talons and assume my Zulo shape, but the Baron only sat confused and slightly terrified by our sudden change. 

Within moments, the door was kicked down and two figures entered the room. A man in a suit carrying a suppressed Uzi alongside a woman in practical work clothes carrying a blood slick machete entered the room, the man opening fire on me immediately whilst the woman rushed at Stella. The Baron on the other hand, was surprised when tendrils of shadow flew from under the coffee table before him, wrapping him in a crushing embrace on the sofa as a mobile shadow dripped through the ventilation duct and formed into a Cainite. The bullets fired upon me struck home and I was unpleasantly surprised to find they were tracer rounds, burning my flesh as the bullets bored into me. Thankfully, I was able to resist the burns inflicted with my minimal knowledge of Fortitude and the bullets themselves were stopped by my chitin. These weren’t quite as deadly as a proper incendiary weapon, but I certainly wouldn’t enjoy the prospect of experiencing that again. I strengthened and quickened myself through the blood and started by leaping on the Lasombra, aiming to kill him and free the Baron before dealing with the rest. I remember he had a dumbfounded look on his face before I swiftly removed it from the rest of his body. 

Stella on the other hand had conjured shadows of her own, attempting to bind the woman although this failed as the woman dodged her grasp. Clicking her tongue in exasperation, Stella rushed the woman herself and dagger met machete in their melee. I on the other hand had already started my assault on the Uzi wielding man, closing the distance and raining blows on the Cainite as he failed to get away from me. After the third strike, he fell into torpor as my strength rocketed his corpse through the one way mirror and onto the dance floor below to the shock of those below. The Baron, upon recovering from the hold drew his own weapon and moved to assist Stella alongside me. Although blows were traded by both sides, together we overpowered the woman and destroyed her, although all of us were afflicted by the vitae-grease on the woman’s blade to some degree. For us and Stella these were minor wounds at worst given we both have Vicissitude enhanced anatomies and Fortitude to help weather her strikes, but the Baron was barely conscious under the effects of enhanced blade when help from outside arrived. It was once I received a frantic call from my packmates upon reverting my form that I was informed that those weren’t the only attackers in the building. 

While my meeting was occurring, my packmates were having their own adventure. It seems that during the party, Adrian had by chance happened to pierce the Obfuscate based illusions of a particular individual, a wild eyed young man at the very edge of the party who eyed the crowd with obvious paranoia while he carried a duffel bag slung across his back. Thinking this incredibly odd, Adrian informed Quill, Jessie, and Gabrielle and the 4 of them followed the Cainite while hidden from sight by Quill’s own arts. The man kept himself inconspicuous and entered a series of backrooms, eventually heading to one where a group of ghouls awaited him. Three of Samantha’s ghouls were on the floor, their throats slit in a pile as the group traded clipped greetings while the Cainite sat down the duffel bag, unzipping it to reveal the obvious form of a bomb and began fiddling with the buttons on it.

Not wishing to wait a second longer, the pack engaged. Jessie reached out with her Necromancy, paralyzing the Cainite with a bolt of entropic energy from her hand as she spoke the Latin incantation required to inflict rigor mortis on the unliving. Adrian constantly dominated a ghoul to freeze him in place as the other two of our pack extended their claws, one of Protean, the other handcrafted through Vicissitude, leaping upon the unaffected ghouls and rending them limb from limb. When this bloody work was done, they did the same to the paralyzed form of the Cainite and drained the still frozen ghoul to recoup any loss of blood. 

Following this, Quill and Adrian turned to the bomb and began examining it as Jessie called me. Upon learning of the situation, and that the bomb’s timer was already ticking down, I ordered Quill to disarm the bomb as I didn’t feel we should risk the possibility of setting off the explosives should Adrian attempt burning out the detonator through Technomancy. I began heading downward towards them, yelling at the Baron to clear a way out from that room in case we would have to run it outside. Unfortunately, my judgement on the matter was right as Quill failed to disarm the explosive device in time; which induced Gabrielle to sigh and grab the duffel bag, pushing her Celerity enhanced form to it’s limits as she tore out of the warehouse through the gap in the crowd made by the Baron and I with only a minute left on the timer. It was, fortunately, just barely enough time for her to make it to the river and toss the explosive as far as she could into the waterway. Everyone in the party heard the muffled boom go off seconds later followed by an artificial rainstorm coming down outside as my blood covered, half frenzied Gangrel pack sister reentered the building and began screaming through her permanent fangs at the Baron demanding to know how he could be so negligent that this happened.

Once I had calmed her down, I stated bluntly that we would have to take our leave and bid the Baron a curt good night as our number left, putting the shocked crowd of Anarchs behind us. I for one, was quite fed up with having our pack seeming to be the only halfway competent Cainites in this entire damn territory. A club full of Cainites and not one could notice Samantha’s missing ghouls? No one noticed a bomb carrying, obviously shifty man only barely hidden through Obfuscate? An entire strike team of Camarilla breaching the building without a single witness? Even looking back, they had let a group of Camarilla known for violence set up a stakeout outside Samantha’s club, a known gathering place in the domain. Perhaps emotions are just running high, but I’m starting to feel as though my pack would be better off if we struck out on our own into Arlington. Still, I have connections here now. They just need to get their shit together so that they might at least be of some use to me. Perhaps this could finally serve as a shock to the system that could spur the Anarchs into taking their activities more seriously rather than simply running gangs and killing the occasional errant Camarilla Cainite. 

Regardless, now our number is safely at home recuperating from wounds incurred last night. Baron Kendricks called me earlier to inform me that the mess left behind at the warehouse had been cleaned up and the torpored Cainite, a Ventrue working in a coterie with one of the city’s Hounds (the Lasombra I killed), had been interrogated to great effect. It seems Baron Kendricks’ whole domain has now been Blood Hunted en masse officially by the Prince and he plans to ramp up the war against the Camarilla significantly as a response. A strike in the near future is being planned which he asked us to participate in, praising our combat abilities. I agreed, provided I help to plan the venture and receive significant recompense. I won’t risk the unlives of my pack in a foolhardy venture, so I’ll have to be the one to set them straight as to proper tactics I suppose.

It was also interesting that the Cainite Quill and Gabrielle slew activated the bomb before his associates had been in any position to evacuate. It seems my previous speculation about internal discord amongst the court was quite right after all. As Jessie has body parts from the ghouls and vanquished Cainite, should they leave behind wraiths I’m sure we can learn a fair bit about who exactly wanted this Hound and the rest of his coterie to die in that warehouse. I also plan to awaken our prisoners for another round of interrogation on this matter, so I’m sure new information will be incoming soon in one way or another. 

I also admit I’m hardly a scholar of Camarilla matters, but for those on here that are, aren’t the Prince’s actions in declaring a Blood Hunt so broadly fairly unusual? I was under the impression that such things were usually far more surgical in their applications, barring a few examples of historical note such as the Camarilla’s Blood Hunt of all Banu Haqim in the last days of the First Anarch Revolt. I would understand if just our pack and the Baron’s coterie had been targeted, but the whole domain? That’s reckless and risks provoking the other Barons as well, who as of yet are not that involved in the war against the Prince. Well, it’s not such a big deal regardless. It’s not the first time we’ve been under a Blood Hunt and I doubt it’ll be the last. Of course, this assumes that “Blood Hunt” was not just a fabrication by the Baron to drum up broad support for a more proactive war.

I suppose we will just have to see what occurs in the future, won’t we?

I wish you all well in your future endeavors.

I had to think it up and muster up the energy. Then I had to push myself for days just to finish the first page. And I had to do that 483 times. Do you know how long that took? I DO! That’s 6,279 days. Guess how many years that is. 

SEVEN TEEN.  17 years of my life that I have joylessly labored away. I Worked on that book every day since I was 19 years old. I just can’t understand why you wouldn’t read it. Did I not work hard enough for you? Did I not call you during the proper office hours?  Did I not Submit my manuscript the proper way?  Did I not pay for all of our lunch meetings?   How dare you lie to me with your half-assed impromptu notes and your unfounded criticisms.   Do you not understand how much those comments hurt me?  No, you don’t because you're just sitting there right in your big fancy house? Peacefully enjoying a quiet night in.  I’m glad I can’t see your smug face just sitting there watching that trash on TV. Or hopefully, you’re sitting there in your big cozy bed.  It’d be the perfect place to start what I’m going to do to you. 

I Remember you wearing a ring. Don’t remember you ever mentioning a husband or a wife though. Only one car in the driveway but you seemed like the type to carpool. Glad I got rid of your dog. It was a yappy little biter.  Nothing that a pillow case and Three swings against a tree couldn’t handle. Hope you enjoyed eating it. I’m excited to see how I cook it later. I don’t know how long Meat can sit in a cooler. But I hope you managed to scoff it down. That’s all I plan on feeding you at the moment. I’m coming cminside now. 

( Juno, ran away today. And I can’t take it easy on myself for forgetting to close the gate before I left for work. I was so certain that I closed it but I guess the coffee hadn't kicked in yet. This is what happens when you go on “Zombie walks” at 4 am every morning. Yeah that’s right keep calling yourself stupid over and over instead of falling asleep like a smart person. What time is it even? No, don’t look at your phone that’ll just make it worse. Just go to sleep now and then you’ll be able to find him tomorrow. He’s chipped and it’s a suburban area. Someone is sure to pick up a goofy little wiener dog with dumb little legs that can’t go that fast. Aw, shit what if he crawls into like a hole or something. Like a weird genetic memory thing. I’m not too worried about a rabbit or a groundhog he’s a tough little sausage. What if a raccoon gets him? Ahh, and then it’s all rabies and the shots. No, stop it he’ll be fine. He sticks to sidewalks when we walk and he stays out of the tall grass. He got picked up and now they’re just waiting to take him to the vet. He’ll be here by Tuesday. Right there on you’re right side scuttling around like a silly gas station hot dog. My little baby.)


The floor emits a flat but obvious creak.   

I knew you heard me but I was surprised you just laid there. Your breathing gave it away.  You were so tense.  They always talk about fight or Flight. But Freeze never gets a mention. I guess it’s too pathetic to admit or believe that when in a state of panic an individual is capable of doing absolutely nothing. But it makes sense in a way. You never Read my story and now you don’t even have the energy to resist me. I didn’t bring a weapon because I didn’t want to kill you. Just needed to smack you around enough until I got the tape on. The way you slowly turned your head to the doorway was so cinematic. Hell, I was scared too. Look at it from my perspective.  I took your key out, slowly unlocked the door, opened it quietly stepped into a black room.  Found the stairs, and tried my hardest not to trip. Waited for my eyes to adjust. Then had to check every door in the hall until it was the bedroom.  Closet, Bathroom, laundry machine, water heater, Then finally your room. And just when I thought I was at the finish line. Your crappy carpeted floor farts.  Then ten seconds later this creepy blueish little doll head slowly turns around and looks at you with its inhuman void eyes.  I screamed so loud I thought I was done but thankfully the punching and choking calmed me down. After that, the taping of your arms and head was a cinch. Then a quick slide into the sack and we were right at my Trunk. God the pure euphoria I felt when we got onto the highway. I hope you liked the music I found that it served to highlight the moment. Even on the off chance you escape, I hope hearing those songs again are enough to traumatize you. So glad we made it back to my place before the sun came up. I was really cutting it close. It’d be hard to explain to my neighbors what I was doing. Then I'd have to kill everyone on the street. Make you my hostage and then kill myself on national news during a stand-off with the police. Hopefully, it won’t come to that I hate cliches.

I’m not sorry for the smell. I wear that stench like a badge of honor not that you would understand. I dedicated myself to the craft and I'm not going to forsake my time by erasing all evidence of my toil. When you're a writer you have to spend all your time writing even when it hurts. You sit there and don’t stop until the work is done. But You wouldn’t get that because you probably haven’t even done a day of work in your life. You disgusting soft little fraud. Well, now that I have you in my cellar I’m gonna make sure to read every single page I write here. And if you feel like protesting or lying again there will be consequences.  Dandy Apple on the ridge, How many fish are in your eyes?  This one is a freebie say it so I know you read todays. We start officially tomorrow.

She looked very tired, sad and drained. She was wearing black sweatpants and a black oversized hoodie. I was wearing shorts and an oversized tee. 

She was surprised at how happy and free I was. I was still lonely, but not as much as she was. She asked how I did it, how I stayed strong, how I managed to stay alive despite the strong urge to end myself. I told her I survived because of her. I survived because she was strong and determined to live on. I survived because she saw a better future, the future I'm currently living. 

I told her I forgave her, she was young, she didn't know what she was doing. I told her to try be kinder on herself, mistakes happen. The most important thing is to learn from that mistake, not dwell in it and make it your whole personality. I told her she is not her mistake, her mistakes are building her to be a better person.

I know it's hard, I haven't gotten past it yet myself. I still have nightmares about that day, but I'm getting there. 

I asked her to keep living, keep holding on. Her family needs and loves her more than she can imagine. I told her to bear with herself and take it one day at a time. It takes time to heal and she can oneday be happy again. 

This whole time she was looking at me like my head fell off, tears in her eyes. She was looking at me like I was crazy. She said, ""How can I forgive myself for what I did? I caused the people I love great pain. Everyday feels like a knife to my heart."". I gave her a hug and told her it will be okay. Someday, the light will shine in her heart. Someday, she'll have the courage to smile again. I told her mom misses her smile and bubbly personality, her sisters miss her playful and annoying nature. 

I promised her everything will be alright. And one thing about me, I never make promises I can't keep. She then promised to try instead of giving up. I'm grateful she did try. I'm very thankful to her that she never gave up, no matter how hard it got. ",1,1740251136.0,u_MedicalTip1773,0,1.0,False

I met my gf almost 3 years ago and for a long time things were beyond wonderful (as they often are). She had two jobs, social media/data imputing for my mother’s business and part time retail. she comes from a decent amount of money (ex:mother two homes both worth over a million $)but her personal income was incredibly average. A year in to our relationship she was given a $800k condominium. No loans, no mortgage, just an HOA fee that her roommate covers as this is all she asks for as rent. after receiving the condo she only worked for her mother which is fine because she really only pays for groceries, some utilities and for her car payments. she makes around $20/hr but can choose to work full or part time. i noticed after a year that she didnt have any savings which was worrying because i knew she didn’t pay for housing and made around the same as i did. she would occasionally cry to me about financial stress when things did come up such as needed new tires or a high electric bill. i tried to give her both emotional and logistic support but i didnt want to pocket watch too hard. i layer found out she was in about $10k credit card debt and also paying around $400 a month for her car (lexus). i was really worried about this as her personal income and spending habits wouldn’t allow her to pay this off. I encouraged her to speak to her mother about the situation and eventually she did. 
      her mom paid off both her credit cards and closed one. i was so happy as this was going to be a new start for her. a year ago i became a flight attendant for a major US airline. it’s definitely rough the first year as the pay isn’t great for the hours you’re working but i love it. i work incredibly hard, i’m IN THE AIR on average 100 hours a month. i typically have 12 days fully off a month and each time i saw her things were worse and worse. her apartment was and is filthy, her car as well. she has struggled with mental health issues (as have i) and we are both open about it with each other. she takes medication and saw a therapist but doesn’t currently. i begged her to clean and have tried to help numerous times but each time we make a dent it gets worse and worse. the last time i was in her car it smelt so horrible i was gagging and she was offended! i assumed when i was away she was working remotely but i found out she’s been turning down hours and opportunities her mother has given her to earn more simply because she doesn’t want to do it. she refuses to work anywhere else except for her family. 
      i found out she had racked up debt again on her card, around 6k. she uber eats almost very meal bc she “doesn’t want to clean the pans again” and will cry over it. i can’t imagine how much she spends as these aren’t all cheap meals. i truly don’t even like being in her apt bc it’s so filthy.
       my job as a flight attendant allows us to fly nearly anywhere for free. we went to amsterdam and round trip was just $80 in taxes. she is currently in japan with her friend and paid $0 flying there for 13 hrs. she always promises to pay me back for the hotels on these trips but doesn’t fully or it takes far too long. she also did this to my roommate which was embarrassing. she will say she can afford something up front bc she wants to travel and then once we are there will either a) not be able to do anything bc she doesn’t have the money or b) someone covers her and we have to push and push for money back. i essentially have given her free access to the world and i feel disrespected. anytime i bring up these feelings she has a meltdown. 
        here’s the real kicked for me. christmas. we always send lists of gift ideas and i prefer useful gifts like items for my apartment. i got her everything on her list and more. i listed some furniture pieces but i mostly wanted a fully length mirror that is currently online for  $50. it’s feb 22nd and i still haven’t received a single gift. i reminded her she never got me a christmas gift a few days ago and she goes “i know i’m getting you a mirror” lol.
       now valentine’s day. i knew id be working the 14th so we spent 3 days together before. i went out to dinner with her and i assumed the bill would be split as this wasn’t intended to be THE valentines dinner. after a few drinks and apps she said “let’s make this v-day dinner” and i agreed so we got main courses as well. when the bill came the waiter goes “together or separate?” and she immediately says “together” and looks and me and says “thank you, for valentines !” i was truly stunned. the bill was around $120 which is a lot for me but it was okay because of the holiday. i was just shocked she suggested going all out and then handed it to me. i worked all day valentine’s day but the next day i had a long layover in miami (22 hrs). i straight up ASKED “what are you going to do for me for valentine’s day? because i’d really appreciate if you could possibly send me a little something, ill give u the hotel info” i RARELY ASK. i got nothing. not a coffee. not flowers. nothing. at this point i’m beside myself. two days later she flies to tokyo. i ask about vday and she says she will buy my gift there. so far she’s shown me some trinkets from the coin machines which i enjoy but don’t compare to what ive spent on her and the lifestyle she is living bc of my job. 
      i know the answer is obvious. the issue is she LOVES ME. i mean, when we are together, we have the most fun. she adores me and would never leave me which scares me. i’d never hurt her intentionally but i think she would stay if i did. she loves me but in the way a child loves. it’s not enough to sustain a lifetime together and she’s talking about marriage and telling my friends she wants to propose this year. she has no money. nothing. just debt and no plan after i’ve tried and tried. and i do love her. i love her so much i can’t even type the good things bc ill start crying. i don’t want this but im losing all compassion/empathy. i don’t know how to leave. she’s going to beg me to give her time to change again but she’s going to be 28 soon and i don’t see her changing. how do i start the discussion. how do i break someone’s heart.

Then I had to push myself for days just to finish the first page. And I had to do that 483 times. Do you know how long that took? I DO! That’s 6,279 days. Guess how many years that is.

SEVEN TEEN. 17 years of my life that I have joylessly labored away. I worked on that book every day since I was 19 years old. I just can’t understand why you wouldn’t read it. Did I not work hard enough for you? Did I not call you during the proper office hours? Did I not submit my manuscript the proper way? Did I not pay for all of our lunch meetings? How dare you lie to me with your half-assed impromptu notes and your unfounded criticisms. Do you not understand how much those comments hurt me? No, you don’t because you're just sitting there right in your big fancy house. Peacefully enjoying a quiet night in. I’m glad I can’t see your smug face just sitting there watching that trash on TV. Or hopefully, you’re sitting there in your big cozy bed. It’d be the perfect place to start what I’m going to do to you.

I remember you wearing a ring. Don’t remember you ever mentioning a husband or a wife though. Only one car in the driveway but you seemed like the type to carpool. Glad I got rid of your dog. It was a yappy little biter. Nothing that a pillowcase and three swings against a tree couldn’t handle. Hope you enjoyed eating it. I’m excited to see how I cook it later. I don’t know how long meat can sit in a cooler. But I hope you managed to scoff it down. That’s all I plan on feeding you at the moment. I’m coming inside now.

He sticks to sidewalks when we walk and he stays out of the tall grass. He got picked up and now they’re just waiting to take him to the vet. He’ll be here by Tuesday. Right there on your right side, scuttling around like a silly gas station hot dog. My little baby.)

I knew you heard me but I was surprised you just laid there. Your breathing gave it away. You were so tense. They always talk about fight or flight. But Freeze never gets a mention. I guess it’s too pathetic to admit or believe that when in a state of panic, an individual is capable of doing absolutely nothing. But it makes sense in a way. You never read my story and now you don’t even have the energy to resist me. I didn’t bring a weapon because I didn’t want to kill you. Just needed to smack you around enough until I got the tape on. The way you slowly turned your head to the doorway was so cinematic. Hell, I was scared too. Look at it from my perspective. I took your key out, slowly unlocked the door, opened it quietly, and stepped into a black room. Found the stairs and tried my hardest not to trip. Waited for my eyes to adjust. Then had to check every door in the hall until it was the bedroom. Closet, bathroom, laundry machine, water heater—then finally your room. And just when I thought I was at the finish line, your crappy carpeted floor farts.

Then ten seconds later this creepy bluish little doll head slowly turns around and looks at you with its inhuman void eyes. I screamed so loud I thought I was done but thankfully the punching and choking calmed me down. After that, the taping of your arms and head was a cinch. Then a quick slide into the sack and we were right at my trunk. God, the pure euphoria I felt when we got onto the highway. I hope you liked the music. I found that it served to highlight the moment. Even on the off chance you escape, I hope hearing those songs again is enough to traumatize you. So glad we made it back to my place before the sun came up. I was really cutting it close. It’d be hard to explain to my neighbors what I was doing. Then I'd have to kill everyone on the street. Make you my hostage and then kill myself on national news during a stand-off with the police. Hopefully, it won’t come to that—I hate clichés.

I’m not sorry for the smell. I wear that stench like a badge of honor, not that you would understand. I dedicated myself to the craft and I'm not going to forsake my time by erasing all evidence of my toil. When you're a writer, you have to spend all your time writing, even when it hurts. You sit there and don’t stop until the work is done. But you wouldn’t get that because you probably haven’t even done a day of work in your life. You disgusting, soft little fraud.

But as a longtime coffee industry watcher, I’m calling it now: **this plan is destined to flop**. Here’s why:

# 1. They’re Ignoring the Core Problem: They’re No Longer Special

Remember when Starbucks was a “third place” between work and home? Now it’s just another fast-food chain with overpriced lattes. Competitors like Dunkin’, local roasters, and even gas stations have closed the quality gap, while premium third-wave shops (think Blue Bottle, Stumptown) offer better beans and vibes. Starbucks is stuck in the middle—too expensive for convenience, not premium enough for enthusiasts.

# 2. The Menu Bloat is Killing Them

Starbucks’ 87,000 possible drink combinations (I wish I were joking) slow down service, frustrate baristas, and confuse customers. Meanwhile, their “innovation” is just sugar-loaded TikTok drinks that alienate their original base. Adding more seasonal unicorn frappuccinos won’t fix the fact that their core coffee is seen as mediocre.

# 3. Labor Tensions Are a Ticking Time Bomb

Starbucks’ anti-union crusade has backfired spectacularly. Over 400 stores have unionized, and morale is in the gutter. Baristas are overworked, underpaid, and fed up—and customers notice. No amount of app upgrades can compensate for burnt-out staff and inconsistent service.

# 4. The Digital Strategy is a Double-Edged Sword

Yes, their app drives 30% of sales, but mobile orders have turned stores into chaotic pickup hubs. The in-store experience now feels like a DMV line with a $7 latte. Plus, younger consumers are ditching apps for local shops with actual human connection.

# 5. They’re Chasing Trends, Not Loyalty

From olive oil coffee to $20 boba-esque “Oleato” drinks, Starbucks is throwing spaghetti at the wall. Meanwhile, their rewards program now prioritizes upselling over customer loyalty (RIP free birthday drinks).

But I also do NOT want a proffee. I know that would be “smarter” for my protein goals but I am sick of every item in my mouth being about a goal and I just want an enjoyable coffee for one second!

So, does anyone here drink decaf(or caffeinated- idc) coffee with creamer or milk? And if you do, do you count it as a fluid? Do you have to wait 30 minutes to drink a fluid after because it is NOT a fluid and would cause dumping?

I’ve read Redken Shades EQ may be a better option, perhaps with a volume 10 developer since I have fine/greying/brittle hair. Assuming Madison Reed’s developer was higher than 10.

Another option I’m considering is John Frieda’s Midnight Brunette line along with the Luminous Glaze for Brunettes. Since you have to let it sit in your hair for a while each time, I’m thinking this option may be too high maintenance for me.

A third is perhaps a natural option like coffee, but again, perhaps too high maintenance/annoying.

1ivq1d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ivq1d7/looking_for_handgrinder_advice/,Looking for hand-grinder advice.,"Without getting too much into my life story, I have some really annoying immune issues and coffee is something I've always liked but have been hoping to get more into for health reasons at a doctor's suggestion. I've been trying to avoid low-quality materials or anything that could risk leaching into my grounds - we now know that microplastics are a real concern and that other 'safer' plastics need to be more extensively studied to ensure that they're truly inert, and I know that aluminum's links to bad health stuff has been debated but I'm in a medical position where I'd gladly pay more money to not have to think about any of the above risks. As such, here's what I've put together for my pour-over ritual set-up.

•Capec Tsubame Wood Drip Pot

•Fellow stainless steel thermometer.

•Kalita Tsubame Stainless Steel 185

•Hario V60-03 'beehive' server (I never use the lid but am not inherently opposed to silicon as it seems inert)

•Duralex glassware

•Specialty beans (rotating - most frequently ordering from Subtext and Rogue Wave)

I'm happy with my above situation to various degrees, but I'm failing to get satisfying extraction. I assumed this was a skill issue (and I'm sure it still is to some extent as I'm only a few months into making pourover), but after testing some pre-ground beans for shits and giggles, it became very clear to me that my grinder isn't just the weakest link, it's actively making bad coffee.

I don't want to shit-talk the company that makes my grinder by naming them outright, but it's an adjustable ceramic burr grinder with a cast-iron hopper and glass grounds bin. I went for it explicitly because of the build materials (zero plastic and seemingly no aluminum used throughout) and with the knowledge that a ceramic burr would be making a degree of concession to grind quality, but evidently I didn't account for how severely of a negative difference that would be. The steps of adjustability don't have a declared micron level but also aren't labelled, which I've also learned from practical usage can become a real problem when trying to dial in a bean or adjust for other applications (I have a vintage Chemex as well as an immersion brewer). In any event, between all of this and recent issues that I've noticed with the iron from the hopper staining the beans (not concerned from a health perspective on that but it's palpably changing the flavour of my output), it's clear that I need a change, but it's very hard to find a grinder where the processing path both avoids plastic and avoids aluminum - plenty will make a point of advertising that they avoid one (Comandante especially advertise the non-aluminumial nature of their products, but use Tritan which has been linked to certain cancers, etc.), but not the other.

Which leads me to the main thing I'd love advice on: the Kinu M47 Classic seems to transparently deliver on a fully stainless-steel process from chamber to burr to grounds bin with the only plastic used on the product being a silicon thumb rest, which is fine for my purposes, but for every satisfied customer extolling the clarity, precision, and quality of experience with the unit, it seems like there's a few users who make a point of sharing that the company has terrible customer service in the event of an issue, that brewing with the M47 is actually inconsistent and muddy due to unpredictable fines, that the optional pourover burr (not an option for me due to the PVD coating as opposed to the standard burr which seems to be blued and not plastic-coasted, but correct me if I'm wrong) creates new problems instead of solving old ones, etc.

So, I'm sure this would be a considerable upgrade to my current grinder situation and it seems to satisfy the admittedly tall order I have for build materials, but the M47 isn't cheap and as a result, I'd prefer it to be the last grinder I ever buy unless someone eventually makes a flat burr grinder to the same standard at a comparable price (and if they have, please point me in the right direction). Would this be a wise move? Will I actually be able to make consistent, nuanced, enjoyable coffee with the M47 or is there something else I'm unaware of that satisfies my criteria that I should consider instead? Not looking to debate my criteria as those really are a health consideration inspired by sensitivities I possess, but just hoping to find a way to make great coffee in compatibility with that. Really appreciative of any and all insights, comments, and (hopefully) unbiased praise for the M47 that anyone has to share because I'm tired of setting my money on fire whenever I buy beans.",1,1740250421.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1ivq1d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBUX_SUX/comments/1ivq1d3/starbucks_sbux_is_overvalued/,Starbucks (SBUX) is Overvalued,"Hey, I’ve been analyzing Starbucks (SBUX) and believe the stock is significantly overvalued given its current fundamentals and macroeconomic risks. Here’s why I’m bearish and think the stock could fall to $28, representing a realistic valuation based on its challenges.

Declining Revenue and Same-Store Sales

Starbucks has been struggling with declining revenue and same-store sales growth. In its most recent earnings report, the company missed revenue expectations, and comparable store sales growth has been slowing globally. This is a red flag for a company trading at a premium valuation. If Starbucks can’t drive consistent top-line growth, its current stock price is unjustified.

Lack of Forward Guidance

Management has been hesitant to provide clear forward guidance, which is concerning in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for investors to gauge the company’s future performance, especially when coupled with declining sales and rising costs.

Exposure to China and US-China Trade War Risks

China is a critical growth market for Starbucks, but the company faces significant risks due to the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. Any escalation could hurt consumer sentiment and disrupt supply chains, further pressuring Starbucks’ already strained operations in the region. Additionally, China’s economic slowdown and competitive coffee market pose long-term challenges.

Unsustainable Valuation

Starbucks is currently trading at an extremely high PE ratio (over 30x), which is more typical of a high-growth tech company rather than a mature consumer staple facing declining revenue. For context, a more realistic PE ratio for a company with Starbucks’ growth profile and risks would be around 10x. Applying this multiple to its earnings suggests a fair value closer to $28 per share.

Debt Levels and Bankruptcy Risk

Starbucks has taken on significant debt in recent years, and with interest rates staying “higher for longer,” the company’s debt servicing costs could become unsustainable. If Starbucks’ turnaround plan fails to revive growth, the combination of declining revenue, high debt, and rising interest expenses could push the company toward moderate to high bankruptcy risk before 2030.

Target Price: $28

Based on declining same-store sales, a realistic PE ratio of 10x, and the company’s debt risks, I believe Starbucks is worth no more than $28 per share. This represents a significant downside from its current price and reflects the company’s challenges in driving growth and maintaining profitability.

Conclusion: Sell Rating

Starbucks is overvalued given its declining revenue, high debt levels, and exposure to macroeconomic risks. The stock is priced like a high-growth company, but its fundamentals tell a different story. Until there’s clear evidence of a successful turnaround, I’m rating SBUX a \*\*sell\*\* with a target price of $28.

- 2 bags of rice 
- 2 cans of beans 
- coffee 
- a couple cheap spice or flavor packets (taco seasoning, chili seasoning, bullion cubes, etc)
- a pasta or lentil
- 2 cans of tomato paste (I make a mean ketchup alternative)
- a cheap protein (meat on sale, tofu, dried beans, etc) and I package them all for freezing. 
- pet food 

Home prep: 
Again, budget permitting, I’ve bought a couple of items each pay check, and have stashed a collection of emergency items to have on hand that include:
- flashlights with batteries 
- hand crank flashlights that also charge phones
- portable phone batteries that are fully charged 
- toothbrushes and toothpaste
- sunscreen 
- a small solar-powered generator (very small)
- first aid
- N95 masks 
- bottles of 70% alcohol 
- hand soap 
- sanitary pads

Personal prep:
- Bear horns (not sure when I’d use these but they seem like a good tool to have to scare off the REAL predators, which we all know aren’t the bears)
- personal alarms, keychain size (they sell multi packs on Amazon)
- pepper spray 
- knives and pocket knives 
- we reactivated our ring-camera subscription
- sewing kit 

Skill prep:
- I’ve been learning to grow vegetables from whole vegetables you can buy at the store, as opposed to trying to start from seeds. You can do this with potatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, and dried beans. All you need is soil, a pot/box, and organic matter, like coffee grounds. I don’t even have a yard, just a balcony. 

My goal is to try and grow my own food/supply stores. and if it works and I have enough to go around, have some additional staples I can discreetly share with loved ones, should it come to that, like pads or veggies. 

I’d love to know your thoughts, or what you’d add!

The coffee spilled into the vent, behind the right back burner, and maybe two tablespoons on the counter that I was able to clean up. The oven was hot and an automatic cooling fan was on because I had just finished using the oven for baking. There was a brief 2 second sizzle of coffee during the spill (I assume from the coffee landing on hot implements inside or outside of the oven) and approx 2 minutes later, the two burners on the right side started clicking as if I were trying to ignite both right side burners at the same time. I tried to find the circuit breaker and failed. In a moment of panic, I used a Dyson hair dryer on the cool setting to hopefully help some of the coffee evaporate and the clicking slowed from 1-2 clicks a second to 1 click every 3-5 seconds. I then realized the circuit breaker was probably hiding behind wall art and then I was able to turn off the oven power from the circuit breaker.

I'm too scared to flip the power back on to the oven right now to see if the oven is still clicking. I know my next steps should be to pull out the oven, disconnect any gas lines, assess the spill and clean it up. Did I ruin the oven completely? Is it the pilot light that powers the igniter? Please advise. I'm still kinda shaken up as this is a 1 year old fairly new oven that I feel like I just ruined.

1ivpyrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/StocksAndTrading/comments/1ivpyrb/starbucks_sbux_is_overvalued_heres_why_its_a_sell/,Starbucks (SBUX) is Overvalued - Here's Why It's a Sell with a $28 Target Price,"Hey, I’ve been analyzing Starbucks (SBUX) and believe the stock is significantly overvalued given its current fundamentals and macroeconomic risks. Here’s why I’m bearish and think the stock could fall to $28, representing a realistic valuation based on its challenges.

Declining Revenue and Same-Store Sales

Starbucks has been struggling with declining revenue and same-store sales growth. In its most recent earnings report, the company missed revenue expectations, and comparable store sales growth has been slowing globally. This is a red flag for a company trading at a premium valuation. If Starbucks can’t drive consistent top-line growth, its current stock price is unjustified.

Lack of Forward Guidance

Management has been hesitant to provide clear forward guidance, which is concerning in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for investors to gauge the company’s future performance, especially when coupled with declining sales and rising costs.

Exposure to China and US-China Trade War Risks

China is a critical growth market for Starbucks, but the company faces significant risks due to the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. Any escalation could hurt consumer sentiment and disrupt supply chains, further pressuring Starbucks’ already strained operations in the region. Additionally, China’s economic slowdown and competitive coffee market pose long-term challenges.

Unsustainable Valuation

Starbucks is currently trading at an extremely high PE ratio (over 30x), which is more typical of a high-growth tech company rather than a mature consumer staple facing declining revenue. For context, a more realistic PE ratio for a company with Starbucks’ growth profile and risks would be around 10x. Applying this multiple to its earnings suggests a fair value closer to $28 per share.

Debt Levels and Bankruptcy Risk

Starbucks has taken on significant debt in recent years, and with interest rates staying “higher for longer,” the company’s debt servicing costs could become unsustainable. If Starbucks’ turnaround plan fails to revive growth, the combination of declining revenue, high debt, and rising interest expenses could push the company toward moderate to high bankruptcy risk before 2030.

Target Price: $28

Based on declining same-store sales, a realistic PE ratio of 10x, and the company’s debt risks, I believe Starbucks is worth no more than $28 per share. This represents a significant downside from its current price and reflects the company’s challenges in driving growth and maintaining profitability.

Conclusion: Sell Rating

Starbucks is overvalued given its declining revenue, high debt levels, and exposure to macroeconomic risks. The stock is priced like a high-growth company, but its fundamentals tell a different story. Until there’s clear evidence of a successful turnaround, I’m rating SBUX a \*\*sell\*\* with a target price of $28.

My bestie is having a baby girl YAY! This is her first kid- but her (25F) and her husband (27M) both have a TON of experience with children. They are heavily involved in the lives of other children in our town + have both even worked in fields where they’ve had to take care of children. Long story short- they are some of the most prepared parents out there. They also have a great community and family that I think will provide them with all the goodies that new parents need and want. 

Ever since my sister in law started having kids, I’ve tried to get her, and other new moms in my life, present that are for THEM. Whether it’s a spa night/ self care package, or something related to a hobby they are interested in- I try to give them something that benefits them as an individual, rather than just something for the baby. 

I also babysit a lot, and know about some gadgets that have been life savers for parents- like baby breezes, etc. so if there were any gadgets that were life savers I’d also love that input. 

I would love for input from moms and dads: what are things that most people don’t think of giving new parents? 
Are there any baby items that you wish you got before you had your baby?
Or are there any gifts that you received/ wish you’d received that helped you individually- even if it’s wasn’t baby related?

**Note 1:** We can have a conversation through call via Discord or Telegram if that's what you prefer. But if chat/message only is the best option for you, it's alright. We'll do what works for you. Your comfortability is my priority.

**Note 2:** I'll try to accommodate every single one of you. If I don't reply immediately, means I'm just occupied or busy at the moment. But I'll most likely respond (I reply fast haha) lalo na when I'm free already. Madalas every midnight ako free. If I can't accommodate you right away, it's because I'm already in a call with someone or my free time window has closed. But I'm willing to listen to you the next time around.

**Note 3:** I keep getting a similar question from y'all. ""Hindi ka ba na d-drain or napapagod sa kakakinig ng mga kwento, rants, problems, etc. ng iba""? Well, to answer the question — No. Big emphasis on ""no"". I'm emotionally and mentally stable. I've been doing this for years (probably around 10-11 years) already for people (mostly my friends) I value in my life. I never rejected to help them out; not even once. Because it doesn't feel like a chore; it feels natural. I'm always their one call away and I'll be there. I have high hopes for people and a lot of things. I believe that they just need someone to listen and guide them throughout the process. With all that said, yes, I can confidently say that I'm a good listener, my help is effective, and I do make a difference. I know I can't save everyone. But I've saved a lot already. Why not save a few more?

**Note 4:** My advice can be a hit or miss for you. To be honest, I just had an idea to try and help people that I don't really know. Thoughts like: ""Kaya ko kayang maging helpful in someones life lalo na kapag hindi ko kilala""? and ""Effective communicator din kaya ako sa hindi ko kilala or effective communicator lang talaga ako para sa mga kakilala ko""? — Gusto ko lang subukan limit ko. Maybe I can do so much more. Who knows, right? I love taking risks. I also see this challenge helpful to me as a writer/poet. As I can know more about peoples experiences and stories.

**Note 5:** Bakit nga ba for females lang 'yung post ko? Mas close and mas may connection ako with females. I have a lot of male friends too but mas feel ko mag start with females muna. Don't get me wrong ha? I'm straight as fck. Lol. If we vibe and click then maybe we can be friends irl too.

How can I do work to not be a trigger for him?,"Specific question: How are ways that I can bring up basically anything perceived as an issue in a way that won't explode? How can I become not triggering to my boyfriend? Am I the issue? How often do people usually bring up these issues to their spouses? I don't want to make him feel like he can never do right...

Relationship history: My boyfriend and I have been dating for two and a half years. In the first year, we got along perfectly and I felt like I could tell him anything without judgement and it seemed like the same for him. A little past then, we started having issues when I bring up any area that I have a preference he's not currently doing (ex. if I ask for favors around the apartment). Over the past couple of months, when I asked for something that requires change from him, arguments turn into me crying/yelling and him yelling/pacing/throwing jabs/laughing/mocking. He said my delivery is always terrible when I present issues to him and if I had said it ""this way"" and he tells me what would've worked for him, it wouldn't have caused a fight. For example, there were two major issues I tried to bring to his attention over the past couple of months. 1. I have been grocery shopping on Sundays and getting us food, and when I ask if we could have a plan for splitting groceries and to discuss finances, he got mad at me and said my delivery was meant to embarrass him and shame him. He said ""no one told you to get me snacks at the store, now you're holding it against me?"" but even when I get food for myself, he goes into the cabinets and eats it. I just feel like it's common courtesy to chip in a little. I have also been paying more in rent than him (65/35) to help him out, I pay for the gas, electric, and water. And he concluded that conversation with he doesn't have money for food. But he still makes sure to go on trips with friends (he borrowed from his parents) and can still go on FanDuel. 2. I asked him to help with cleaning around the apartment because he would quite literally drop things as he's walking and leave them there for over a week. When I brought up needing help cleaning because I do cooking and cleaning and it's becoming a strain on me and I could really use the help, he started naming all the things he does (a common thing he does in arguments) and telling me I'm wrong. I always say there doesn't need to be a right or wrong, I just wanted him to help and maybe we could discuss who does what chores. I got him to agree to sweep and wipe down the trash-- he still doesn't do either. I even tried waiting for 2 weeks and kept wiping the same spot off for myself to prepare our food. Through time, arguments progressed to me just cry-explaining my issue and him saying ""you should see how ridiculous you look right now"" or laughing when I'm explaining myself. I told him that if he continued to speak that way to me then I would leave the relationship to which he responded ""yeah right!"" and laughed. Later that day I decided to have a conversation with his mom about communication and how are effective ways they communicate at home. She asked for specific examples and I gave those two. Of course it backfired and he was outraged that I crossed the boundary of reaching out; I just didn't know what else to do besides break up with him. He now cleans around the apartment and buys some food occasionally which I always tell him how much I appreciate it. I started reading the book ""Let Them Theory"" that has helped with keeping things to myself and I can't control when he wants to do something so it's been better around the apartment.  But now we have what he calls our ""weekend fight"" because he said every Saturday I bring an issue to him. To me, I don't understand how it's an issue when it is a very resolvable thing.

Context of today's argument: This week, my boyfriend and I were making little accommodations for each other and getting along pretty well. He had taken out the trash, I bought him coffee, we were watching stuff together, and having time to ourselves which was great! I have told my boyfriend since day one that my top love language is physical touch. I just feel so loved, safe, blah blah blah. My boyfriend and I used to cuddle all the time. We also used to have sex. Now we do neither.. Well he lets me rest my head on him when we watch tv and he classifies that as cuddling but to me it's just kind of leaning on him and I don't feel as connected. This has been the case since September. This morning, like most weekend mornings lately, he was already up playing video games. I've mentioned it over like the past two months only on weekends saying ""I was hoping we could have a chance to cuddle"", or ""remember how last weekend I mentioned the cuddling thing?"" and today that absolutely ignited a fight. He started listing everything he has done for me over the past couple of days and how there's no pleasing me. He also brought up that I spoke to his mom a month ago and he also has had a stomach ache every Saturday and Sunday for months. Of course I started crying again (I'm just an emotional gal), and explained that I don't understand how bringing up cuddling is leading to this much anger. He said this was ridiculous and I can't keep doing this, but I wasn't trying to do anything, just be close. It's just so frustrating because as long as I don't make requests for anything to change or give any feedback, we're best friends. But if I bring up issues, then I'M bringing up issues and I'M causing huge fights and I end up crying and apologizing. It doesn't feel right; I just want to be able to have open discussions and be able to compromise! Like even if he said no but maybe at X time, that would be so much better than just rattling off every nice thing you've done for me. But also, I'm assuming I should've just not said anything about cuddling? I just wish we could have actual conversations and I don't know what to do.",6,1740249553.0,relationship_advice,50,0.88,False

1ivpoqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1ivpoqt/bourdain_on_chicago/,Bourdain on Chicago,"I spend a lot of my life — maybe even most of my life these days — in hotels. And it can be a grim and dispiriting feeling, waking up, at first unsure of where you are, what language they’re speaking outside. The room looks much the same as other rooms. TV. Coffee maker on the desk. Complimentary fruit basket rotting on the table. The familiar suitcase.

All too often, particularly in America, I’ll walk to the window and draw back the curtains, looking to remind myself where I might be-and it doesn’t help at all. The featureless, anonymous skyline that greets me is much the same as the previous city’s and the city before that.

This is not a problem in Chicago.

You wake up in Chicago, pull back the curtain and you KNOW where you are. You could be nowhere else. You are in a big, brash, muscular, broad shouldered motherfuckin’ city. A metropolis, completely non-neurotic, ever-moving, big hearted but cold blooded machine with millions of moving parts — a beast that will, if disrespected or not taken seriously, roll over you without remorse.

It is, also, as I like to point out frequently, one of America’s last great NO BULLSHIT zones. Pomposity, pretentiousness, putting on airs of any kind, douchery and lack of a sense of humor will not get you far in Chicago. It is a trait shared with Glasgow — another city I love with a similar working class ethos and history. But those looking for a “Chicago Show” on this week’s PARTS UNKNOWN will likely be disappointed. There are no Italian beef scenes, no hot dogs, no Chicago blues, and there sure as shit ain’t no deep dish pizza. We’ve done all those things — on those other shows. And we might well do them again someday.

I like Chicago. So, any excuse to come back, for me, is a good one. It’s not a “fair” show, it’s not comprehensive, it’s not the “best” of the city, or what you need to know or any of those things. If you’re gonna cry that I “missed” an iconic feature of Chicago life — or that there are better Italian restaurants than Topo Gigio, then you missed the point and can move right on over to Travel Channel where somebody is pretending to like deep dish pizza right now.

This is a show that grew out of my interest and affection for the Ale House in Chicago’s Old Town, and its proprietor, Bruce Cameron Elliot.

Ever since reading on the Twitter feed of the late great Roger Ebert that he read Bruce’s blog “ Geriatric Genius” every day, I have followed it faithfully. In fact, I went back years, tracking previous entries. It is in total, a breathtaking work, encompassing the daily lives (and deaths) and misadventures of the Ale House clientele — many of whom, I think it is fair to say, are heavy drinkers. Though cranky, occasionally pugilistic, opinionated, politically incorrect, sexually crude, and an awful speller, Bruce has, without judgement, chronicled the trajectories of a spellbinding array of characters. Whole lives pass, his characters rise and fall — and literally fall apart — as with one character, “Ruben 9 Toes”, who then went on to become “Ruben 8 Toes” then “4 Toes” before dying last year. Bruce’s closest associate, Street Jimmy is a crackhead who’s lived on the streets of Chicago (no small feat) for over a decade — and his Greek chorus of bar regulars offer a perspective on Chicago that I thought deserved highlighting.

We visit with hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco and his extraordinary family, with chef Stephanie Izard, legendary producer Steve Albini and others — but the beating heart of this show is the Ale House and its resident artist (Bruce’s paintings of his customers, living and dead — as well as his portraits of politicians of both parties often depicted being penetrated inappropriately are world famous).

I urge you to visit his blog. And to go back and start a few years back.

There is something about the Ale House — its willingness to accept all who stagger in its doors (though there is, famously a NO SHOT list), it’s morbid sense of humor, it’s never ending flow of opinions, well formed and not, its willingness to scrap — that serves for me, as a happy metaphor for a city I love.",2,1740249520.0,redscarepod,0,1.0,False

I woke up this morning, turned the PC on and went downstairs to make a coffee. Came back up and it was frozen on the ROG startup screen.

I thought ahh, no worries, let me just restart. Issue persisted. I thought maybe its the CMOS needs a reset, so I did that and then plugged everything back in... bam. New issue, even worse - yellow DRAM LED on. Did everything with the RAM, reseated, tried only one stick alternating slots and then the other. Still yellow LED.

Reseated my CPU, cleaned and applied new thermal paste. Still yellow LED -- then I saw someone suggest moving the GPU to another slot (by the way I also reseated the GPU at least 10 times in these 10 hours.. yes 10 hours) and then the PC loaded somewhat.

It was kinda janky though, most of windows wasnt loading and then it would black screen until I restart. System restored, then got BSOD every launch saying critical error or something along those lines, and then I system restored again to an earlier time and now trying to reset via cloud install in Recovery options.

Explorer not working either, PC suddenly functioning as if I've lost half of the system files. I literally dont know what to do.

Is there a solid reason why its happening? Is there a solution or am I fucked? And also its just so random that my GPU stopped working in the top PCIe slot but works in the bottom one.

I got 2/3 right. My first child renamed himself when he came out and started his transition. The other two haven't expressed any issues with their names. I picked names that could be considered gender-neutral for my first two kids so you would think this would be easy. But I'm actually struggling because I'm looking for gender-neutral names. I think if I was comfortable with a gendered name it would be easier. And I feel limited because I won't pick a name that is the same as another family member or friend. 

I have asked opinions of others but I think people just tell me the name they like of the list I give and not what name suits me. Like, if they didn't know my name, what name would they think fits me is what I want to know? And I rarely goes anywhere. I'm only at work once a week for them to try a new name. I don't frequent coffee shops that often. The people I see everyday call me mum.

There's so many names but none of them really feel right and the ones I like I don't have much option to try out.

And then I'm stuck in a body I'm not happy with because while I was contemplating top-surgery I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I opted for a double mastectomy because while it's not the same surgery it should've given me similar results. Except it didn't. My chest looks like a mess. I feel like I would've been better off having a lumpectomy then applying for top surgery. And trying to fix it has been so difficult.

She told me it was over on February 16th, so 6 days ago. She got distant in January. I asked if she'd lost interest 3 weeks ago because of that, she said no and she was just depressed. She has sunk into a bad depression hole, struggling to do things etc. She dumped me because she told me I was so great and deserved better, that her mental health is falling apart and that she loves me and always did, but she can't be the person I need/want her to be, and that I can do so much better than her. She was begging me not to leave her life, she said she knows everyone says it but she wants to stay friends because she doesn't want to lose me, she really doesn't want me to leave, she hopes I don't leave, etc. I think her attachment style is fearful avoidant. I'm anxious leaning secure because I'm in therapy and have been. She told me because she's depressed she has no energy for anything, like going on dates etc. She also told me she needed space and distance to realise this. She can't get out of bed and when she does for work, she goes home and just wants to lie and rot there. She said she has to work on herself and it's not fair on me so she needs to be alone to do it, and she can't put her baggage on me, and I deserve better. It was a long ass convo. I texted her later that night saying I felt like my time was wasted. She told me all the Same stuff again, but said she was sorry she was a waste of time and she doesn't want to lose me. I took hours to reply, and I said ""idk If I should respond to this because I don't want to look stupid."" And then I said that I didn't want to lose her from my life either, but I need space to get over this and focus on me. I said being friends right now isn't healthy for us. I then told her she wasn't a waste of time and apologised for saying that. I told her I love her and always will (probably a mistake but I was emotional). I told her I hoped she would message me whenever she's ready to talk, that I won't leave and if she needs me to just reach out. And when she's ready, just reach out to me overall. Which looking back, is very embarrassing because it comes off as begging. She didn't respond to it. She posted on her private story a few days later and I was on it still. It was a photo of coffee, then a video of her dog. I posted on my story today, and she looked at it IMMEDIATELY, like in the first 5 minutes of it being up. It was a bracelet my little cousin had made for me with my initial on it. It was so cute and I posted it because I thought it was cute. I said it was my cousin who made it for me. My ex has a bracelet with my initial on it herself, so I must admit, I posted that story to make her remember that. And just to see what she did. My plan is to stay no contact and not to post on social media, especially nothing about breakups or moving on etc. I know this entire posts makes me sound pathetic and ridiculous. I just feel like our relationship ended when it could have been fixed. I feel like if she works on herself, which will take time ofc, we could maybe come back together someday in the future. And obviously I need to work on myself too. I know it would all take time to work through. And I know I might sound completely ridiculous saying all this. I guess what I'm asking is, what do I do? It bothers me that I don't know what the future holds. But I can't wait for someone, and I also can't reach out because it needs to be her given all this context I feel. And I also need to respect her wishes. I just have hope in my heart that our story isn't over. I really feel like this is the love of my life. I'm trying to move on, but I hope she messages me at some point in the future. I haven't blocked her on anything but we're in no contact. I'm worried I made myself look stupid because I said some emotional stuff, but she was being emotional too. One of my loved ones told me it's a good sign she looked at my story. She looked at it really fast, less than 10 mins. But idk if that says much. I know this message is all over the place, thank you in advance if anyone reads it. I just don't know what I'm doing. I've had horrible breakups before but this one is different because I truly feel like this is the love of my life and there's still love between us. But I know that she needs to work on herself, for herself. And she has to be the one to reach out. I feel like I'm trying to move on with hope in my heart that we'll get back together someday. I feel like I'm doing stuff with that in mind. Like I'm staying no contact to respect myself and her, but also because I'm hoping it helps us get back together. I just don't know what I'm doing.

I was very fit from 2002 through 2020. I enlisted into the Army (19D) at 17yo a few weeks after 9/11. I was in from 2002 to 2006 and then did the National Guard from 2006 to 2010. I maintained the Presidential Fitness Award the whole time I was in I never scored less than a perfect 300 on the APFT. My scores usually were in the 320 range on the extended scale. (Even during my time as a NastyGirl, which is RARE) And oh man, ruck marching was my jam. I was a cav scout and could LRS with the best of them. If all that wasn’t enough, I started BJJ in middle school, and all the while, I was doin every bit of combatives/grappling/boxing and anything else I could get into until 2010. 

I moved more into lifting weights after I ETS’d and didn’t need to worry about maintaining my 2 mile run score and calisthenics performance. Nothing crazy, but I did eventually hit the 1/2/3/4 plate club. I’ve been in construction since 2006, and got a lot of steps and stairs in daily. I never messed with bulking and cutting; My diet was always simple yet pretty good. Meal prepped weekly. Plenty of calories from good food, minimal sugar, zero soda. If I had to label it, my natural diet tended towards Mediterranean. Lotsa unsweetened tea, black coffee and water. Never went too crazy with supplements other than an ON Whey shake post workout, ON Casein protein maybe 3 nights a week if I felt the need, fish oil and creatine. No habitual alcohol use (but I’ll cut loose for special occasions lol). 100% Drug free. Never even tried smoking pot. (no moral issue or anything like that, I’ve just been getting piss tested since 17 lol) Hell, I’ve never even taken a single puff of a cigarette. 

Then I fell off the horse in 2020 when gyms closed for Covid lockdowns and even a basic set of crappy Chinese dumbbells was going for $1k on eBay. Projects slowed down. Material deliveries stopped. Work came to a hault. Fortunately, my company didn’t want to lose me, and they were responsible with PPP loans and paid me to sit on standby in my house for months. Sounds like the dream until you live it. It’s one of the worst things that ever happened to me. 

I swear, I’ve rapidly fallen apart since then. I honestly feel like I went from 35 to 65 in the last 5 years. I think I feel depressed? I don’t know. I just don’t have the drive anymore. People tell me that’s depression. Everything hurts. I feel every joint and bone I beat and abused over the years. Every fight I’ve ever been in. Every motorcycle wreck. I feel every step I took humping my SAW and a hundred pounds of equipment up a mountain side in Afghanistan. I get sick all the time. Diet is garbage convenience food 50% of the time. I’ve gained weight. In 2020, I still had a 32” waist. Same as highschool. I’m about a 36” now. I was always a lean 183ish in the Army, and a solid 195ish when I was lifting. As I type this, I’m 225 and I know I’ve lost a ton of muscle mass. My BF% has doubled (if not tripled) 💀

I’m just about at the point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired. I’m thinking about trying to regain that motivation and discipline to get back at it, but damn I worry about if I can even physically do it. That, and my career…. While being something I’m very good at and has me on track for a very reasonable retirement, requires I work from sun up to sundown every damn day. 

+2 decades of tough living have finally caught up to me. I went from being the image of health and fitness to barely being able to put my own socks on. Plus, I just turned 40. I’m an old man now. I don’t know if I even have it in me anymore. This might just be a mid life crisis? Is TRT the answer? Is there even a point? 

I dunno. But I’ve trying to hype myself up. I’ve read that it’s much easier for people that lifted earlier in life to get back into it, and it’s much easier than if I were starting from scratch. I was just wondering if there’s any truth to that, or if anyone had a similar experience or insight? 

Thanks

1ivpjs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepwalkingstories/comments/1ivpjs5/sleepwalking_friend/,Sleepwalking Friend,"Just want to start by saying this was an experience I will never forget met this lady who sleepwalks. She is in her 72, I think. I'm' 38 and she taught me a great lesson in sex. I stopped by one day and rang the doorbell and she open the door and got a hand full of cock so she had me come in and hubby was going to the bath room when he walked away she pulled my shorts down and gave me a blow job wow at that point her hubby came back in the room and so I said I needed to leave. So, i became somewhat of a friend and had coffee with her husband and he told me about her sleepwalking, So we would go to the same gym so one day I saw him come in and we talked for a bit then I told him that I was done and was going home and he was just starting his workout. So I stopped by to see his wife so I kind of plan for about 45 min. of alone time with her. She let me in and the took me to their guest room and fucked she shit out of me wow it was great a good half hour. She started with a condom she pull it off and she said she would enjoy it more without one. So about five days later her husband found the condom on the floor in the guest room and ask her what the hell was that from. She told him she doesn't know, or she didn't remember. He knew something was up, so he asked me if I had stopped by and fucked my wife, so I told him she pulled me in and took charge and had her way. He knew what she was like when sleepwalking, so he wasn't mad at me, and we talked it out, so he was ok. In fact, about two weeks later we set a time to do it again but i was driving home on the highway and got in a accident a roll over and broke my back so no more sex. About a week later I found out she was waiting by her back window looking for me. we send pictures now and talk every so Offen and I can only remember what she felt like it was burned into my mind. I will update later.

1ivpjin,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1ivpjin/cheer_up_ad_revenue_based_valuation/,Cheer up - Ad Revenue based valuation,"I did a quick-and-dirty DCF and market sizing.

1. Points to $33B valuation with ""nominal"" work from Reddit i.e. ""don't fall asleep at the wheel, but sure - drive at a good speed and take your coffee breaks"".
2. Then there's the ""push"" scenario. I use the product a lot, so I understand where all the opportunities to show more Ads are. Therefore, all of these growth levers are there. Just see Quora - such a bad Ad-littered experience. Reddit doesn't have to go that far, and yet there's soooo much room. Here are ideas that are less talked about: Creating more ad inventory through new UI formats for comments & posts, Ads on Popular feed (in fact the top carousel prime spot is completely unmonetized), prime ad spots on daily trending articles, prime ad spots on ""evergreen"" posts - just pick the GOAT and YTD GOAT posts and auction off the top spot. E.g. The top r/pics post from this year doesn't have a single Ad on it!! It has 250K upvotes.

DCF parameters -

Reddit grew Revenue 61%. FCF is already at 20% in Q4. it will grow to 25% in 5 years.

Reddit has no risk from extreme AI investments, unlike Meta. It's in pure margin and revenue expansion mode.

The Ad market is rising to be 1T$. I've got to think that Reddit is getting at least 1% of that - $10B within the next 5 years. Yelp itself is over 1B$. Reddit should coast to 15x that. And that's not being aggressive for a top 10 global website/platform. Honestly it should be shooting for 50B-100B. Google and Meta are already circa 200B today.

At an FCF of 25% of 15B, we are at $3.75B. Just pure terminal value on that is 58B. Bring it to today and add in the next five years, we already get to $40B valuation today. This is where we were pre-earnings at around 220$/share

Now think if Reddit truly earns its keep and gets to $50-100B Ad Revenue range...",11,1740249155.0,RedditIPO,8,0.92,False

1ivpibd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandelaObscura/comments/1ivpibd/assignment_5272_dressed_to_kill_a_gms_session/,Assignment 52-72: Dressed to Kill (A GM's Session Recap),"Last week, I ran my first assignment with Candela. To be honest, it was my first time DMing anything properly. I’ve been a player multiple times for DnD mainly, but also two games of Call of Cthulhu and one game of BITD. Besides some short one-shots, I’ve always wanted to run something longer as a DM. A plan to run a long-running Waterdeep campaign for friends was nipped in the bud when pandemic hit. So, here we finally are. I ran the quick starter guide assignment, Dressed to Kill, but I had heavily homebrewed my notes in advance. 

Below are my epic long ramblings on the session as a whole. It’s going to be incredibly and ridiculously LOOOOOOOOOOONG, so you have been warned. Originally I posted this to the Candela Obscura discord but thought I might as well post it here too. Also, a lot of my recap will be under the Spoiler tag because of general spoilers for the quickstarter guide assignment.

**IMPORTANT:** If you belong to the Circle of the Illuminated Path *(Gavin Greyson, Dr. Nix, Rhine R.R. Johns, Stockwell Harley)*, turn back now in case I hint anything for future assignments!!

\---

**ASSIGNMENT OPENING**

>!The session began with a flourish as I delivered a flowery speech, setting the stage for the players’ immersion to the world of the Fairelands. Provided some points of interesting history such as The Shiver, the devastating legacy of The Last Great War, and mentioned some unsettling whispers about strange happenings deep within Oldfaire — things that only Candela Obscura has begun to uncover. *“But that, my friends, is a story for another time…”* I teased, setting the stage for the Circle’s journey.!<

>!I edited the original assignment intro, adding some details about the Briar Green district and Briarback College. Already, I felt that cinematic energy, that unmistakable vibe that Candela’s setting encourages. As a first-time GM, this was a fantastic way to ease into the role — and once Vera Montgomery’s body started disintegrating into a grotesque, bloodied mess of viscera, I knew the players were hooked. The looks of utter disgust and awe on their faces told me everything.!<

\---

**CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS**

>!Sadly, the player behind our Criminal - Galen Spak - was sick and had to cancel at the last minute. It was pretty unfortunate, especially as the opening assignment had several personal hooks tied to his backstory as a former smuggler in the Bridleborne Mountains. But, as is the way with TTRPGs, we carried on.!<

>!One-by-one, each player was given a moment to shine, introducing their characters and showcasing their personalities. One by one, they met the mysterious man, Soloman — a figure of few words, yet his presence spoke volumes. With his rich umber skin, broad shoulders and battle-worn face, they know him as the manservant and close confidant of their Lightkeeper. He delivered the initial missive from Candela Obscura, urging the group to act quickly.!<

>!Introducing our Doctor - Dr. Nathaniel Nix. The disgraced physician was found at his private residence in Ashridge (my version of the Coalridge district. The lingering ash from Westwreck is known to still travel on the wind and blanket the district like dirty snow). He was hard at work, deep in his research on Bleed-affected bodies, with a bitter herb tea at hand which he sadly had to leave behind untouched once he was called to action!<

>!Introducing our Journalist - Gavin “The Gab” Greyson. He was found at his family’s bustling fish stall in Hallowharbour. There, he was teaching his two youngest children how to gut fish. Once Soloman arrived, he quickly ushered his children inside. His youngest daughter’s obvious displeasure at being sent inside to his wife Maude was a cute moment. We also decided that Maude would forever remain a disembodied voice, much like Frozone’s wife in The Incredibles.!<

>!Introducing our Occultist - Rhine R.R. Johns . She was caught in a moment of solitude under one of Red Lamp’s many bridges. Low on funds and scarlet, Rhine was plucking riverbank reeds and grinding them for her pipe when a street urchin named Pig’s Ear whistled to grab her attention. Known to her as one of the Alleykin Irregulars, a faction of street-smart pickpockets and thieves who carry messages for Candela, for the right price. Called to action, she lit her pipe, took a strong drag. Savouring the buzz, she stumbled off down the street and out of the scene. !<

>!Lastly, introducing our intrepid Explorer - Stockwell Harley. As the remaining members of the Circle made their way to their base, Stockwell was found already at their Chapter House: Hargrave House. A grand, three-story large townhouse which originally belonged to the Hargraves - one of the oldest and most influential families in Newfaire. For over forty years, the house had served as the Chapter House. Stockwell, a distant relative, couldn’t shake the feeling that the long-dead Hargraves watched him and judged him from behind their painted portraits. Despite the oppressive atmosphere, Stockwell established himself as being far too comfortable in the notable chapter house, leaving a trail of chaos in his wake. Dirty boots scattered in hallways, plates of half finished food dotted in different rooms. A horrendous housemate, which was funny since he was being played by my actual housemate who is nothing like that.!<

>!With the Circle assembled and after some initial roleplaying between them, the Circle’s lightkeeper finally made her entrance. Lightkeeper Mathilde Thornbrooke is basically Maggie Smith. A severe-looking older woman; tall and lean in elegant Edwardian-style, midnight blue robes. Long salt and pepper hair combed back into a tight bun. She was a very active field agent in her youth because bleed tainted her right leg. Now, she uses a walking cane inscribed with Oldfairean runes!<

\---

**ACT ONE: THE EXHIBITION HALL**

>!The investigation itself began with little fanfare. Periphery police officers were already securing the scene, questioning witnesses and examining the body. Gavin the Journalist spoke with some of the remaining inventors, uncovering their theories about what had caused the Undark dress model to dissolve into a vile puddle of goo.!<

>!Dr. Nix was keen to examine the gooey remains, succeeding on a SWAY check with the leading police officer. As a result, the office recognised and remembered him by name from his work with the OUP in the past. However, she did NOT realise that he had been backstabbed by the OUP and branded an enemy. None the wiser, she gave him some breathing space and he was in a perfect position to use his Dissection ability to gild an additional FOCUS while interacting with the remains, learning some details and gaining a valuable Undark sample.!<

>!Meanwhile, Stockwell took a bleed mark as he used the Occultist ability Extend Your Senses (a little extra power gifted to him because he started with a Bleed scar after his backstory descent into Oldfaire that went bad). Using the power, his left eye clouded over in an unnatural white, and began leaking a single black, inky tear as he tracked the residual Bleed left by the dress, invisible to the naked eye. Through the stage, down a hallway, Stockwell and Rhine followed the trail to the Green Room.!<

>!However, Stockwell’s connection to the Bleed took a toll, and after a poor roll, he had to take a step back. I expected our Occultist Rhine to take the lead, but she hesitated, fairly concerned with taking damage. So, she surprisingly decided to retreat out of the classroom to fetch the Doctor. As a result, I reduced the consequence counter by two levels and added a sudden shift to the narrative. !<

>!Suddenly, the OUP burst through the doors of the Exhibition Hall in full force, storming the scene. Six agents, all dressed in black, began taking control, cordoning off the area and beginning to collect evidence. In response, the Doctor and the Occultist bolted down the hallway back towards the Green Room. To buy his teammates some time, the Journalist decides to cause a distraction. He punched one of the OUP, rolling a seriously lucky mixed success when rolling with disadvantage, knocking him down to the ground. To push the scene forward, two OUP agents took up pursuit and followed.!<

>!A chaotic series of rolls followed, and Stockwell single-handedly fought off two OUP agents with a fire extinguisher while his colleagues smashed through the windows of the classroom and scurried off to safety. Some incredible lucky rolls and more than enough critical successes later, the Circle disappeared while not a single adversary tracking them. The game was afoot.!<

>!I could easily ramble for hours about our session—it was honestly such a blast. There were so many memorable moments, but I'll focus on the key highlights.!<

\---

**ACT TWO: INVESTIGATING MORDANT SPRINGS** 

>!At the Bitter River Mercantile general store, Niko practically pleaded with the group to help her wife, Yael, who was devastated by the Green Fever. The mood turned tense when Dr. Nix, scarred from his time as a battlefield medic, outright refused to examine her. This took me by surprise, given his whole life’s research was investigating the effects of Bleed on the body. But he was adamant he could not and would not be able to assist her medically. He received a Brain mark as his wartime PTSD reared its ugly head. Undeterred, Rhine and Gavin went upstairs and were immediately unsettled by Yael’s grotesque, deformed appearance.!<

>!Later, to get some payback on Nix for his stubbornness, I decided to throw him a curveball and scare the living daylights out of him. When he broke off from the group and decided to investigate the local town doctor alone (his biggest mistake). Originally, the quick starter guide has a Radiance Corp Enforcer ransacking her house. Instead, I had the transformed doctor (what I was calling an Undark Husk) lurking in the upstairs bathroom before it suddenly jumped out and lunged directly at Dr. Nix with its elongated talon-like nails. Nix continuously rolled critical success after critical success on his MOVE checks, ducking and dodging every single attack from the monstrosity. He scrambled out of the house; miraculously, he hadn’t suffered a single mark. I couldn’t believe it!!<

>!The rest of Act Two was a weird mix of group discussion and the Circle piecing together scraps of information on what was happening. It ended up slowing things down as the Circle wrestled with indecision. For nearly 45 minutes, they debated what to do next, and the tension was palpable. !<

>!I tried to nudge them along by reminding them that sundown was approaching, and their options were to either head to:!<

>!**Location A: Hot Springs** *(where The Whispering Waters Retreat was located and where they knew a herbalist was working tirelessly to help the local community. An Undark Husk in the makeshift hospice would cause a fight but the Herbalist would have given a Bleed Ward afterwards and also perform first aid on one player to clear a Body mark)*!<

>!OR!<

>!**Location B: The Five Aces Tavern** *(where they knew could gather more intel from the off-duty miners who frequented there; this area also had the journalist Booker Davis, AND they could seek shelter here once the 8pm curfew came into effect).* !<

>!But the group remained paralyzed, stuck in a cycle of uncertainty. I even suggested splitting up into two groups to cover more ground, but that didn't fly either. Eventually, I told them I was taking a quick break to make a coffee for myself, and - when I returned -  to have a firm decision made. When I returned, they had discarded both options and demanded to head directly to the Radiance Corp factory. It was utter chaos. We were all laughing, but as the GM, I’ll admit it was a bit frustrating. I definitely should’ve been firmer, but the roleplay was so engaging that I didn’t want to interrupt it. Definitely, a lesson learned for next time.!<

>!Once they finally entered the factory, the stakes went up in a big way. Immediately, they were told that all rolls going forward were High Stakes. Regardless, the Circle pushed onwards.!<

>!I placed a few roadblocks in the way (a cold, unimpressed receptionist and some nosy guards) but their dice rolls were on fire. When it looked like they'd be denied access to the cable cars to ascend up the mountain to the main mining area, the journalist Gavin swiftly used his ability Insider Access to automatically gain access to an important place by using his Press Credentials gear, bypassing the obstacle and gaining them easy entry. !<

>!While I don’t particularly link the automatic success of this ability and prefer the other, more grounded, abilities on offer, it was the perfect addition to his super slick, smooth talking persona. So how could I say no? In the end, they snagged some Radiance Corp mining jumpsuits, which gave them the perfect disguise to blend in as they advanced deeper into the mystery.!<

\---

**ACT THREE: DESCENT INTO THE MINES**

>!As they ventured through the mines, Rhine had a very memorable encounter with the source of the thundering roars that echoed ominously throughout the cave system. Using her ability, Speak Their Language, she connected to the Undark Beast, an ancient and tormented creature. It’s guttural, agonised speech reverberated in her mind. The words were broken but filled with desperation: *“Paaaaaain. Huuuuumans. Traaaaaapped. Reeeeeelease me.”* With their telepathic connection, the player and I added rich details, having Rhine and the beast communicating through trading snapshot visions of their experiences.!<

>!At this point, I really wanted to introduce a new and sinister creature into the mix: Cave Wraiths - miners who succumbed to the corruption of Bleed, their forms disintegrated beyond recognition from Bleed. They now lay melded into the walls and floors of the cave, hungry to devour anything that passes. However, the session was starting to run long so I had to drop this idea. !<

>!Instead, down one route, they witnessed some more of the transformed Undark miner Husks feeding off spilled canisters of Undark. They wisely and carefully avoided this particular path, and continued their push forward. However, the heavy Bleed radiating this deep within the mines delivered a Bleed mark to all of them, which immediately knocked Rhine, at the front of the party, unconscious as she took her first Bleed scar.!<

>!Once the party reached the heart of the mines and encountered EONS and their cruel experiments, they realized they had to act fast. A failed SWAY roll from Stockwell, attempting to convince the EONS scientists that there was a Bleed leak coming from their own machinery, triggered a swift response. Enforcers, armed with rifles, descended on them. Dr. Nix was shot in the shoulder, but Stockwell managed to wrest a rifle from one of the enemies and Rhine pushed the now-unarmed enemy off the ridge where they all stood. That enemy was then unceremoniously stomped on and crushed by the Undark Beast with a splat.!<

>!Gavin attempted to summon the earlier seen Undark Husks to devour the scientists but failed his SENSE roll unfortunately. As EONS started to gain the upper hand, the party found themselves with dwindling options. They failed to release the Undark beast and, in the end, Nix was left with no other option but to topple over several barrels continuing the glowing green Undark venom, which Stockwell ignited by tossing his oil lantern. The makeshift laboratory began to be engulfed in green flames, trapping the screaming scientists.!<

>!The fire eventually reached the Undark Beast, which howled in agony as it attempted to establish a psychic link once again with Rhine, begging to be saved. But she could do absolutely nothing.!<

>!The creature was left behind, struggling its restraints, hammering its massive reinforced exo-skeleton against the rocks, forcing a cave-in. Three rounds of quickfire MOVE rolls as the party desperately attempts to escape the collapsing mines, with Nix crashing to the ground in the final round, only for Rhine to double back and pull him to safety just in time.!<

>!In the end, the party escaped and succeeded in stopping EONS and their experiments, but their victory felt bittersweet. Rhine, in particular, was deeply disturbed by their inability to save the creature. Subtracting a point from FOCUS and adding it to SENSE, she now experienced flickering flashbacks of the creature’s death cries and struggles to maintain her focus. Also, her skin gained a very faint, soft, sickly green hue to it.!<

>!Though the immediate threat of Undark - that insidious venom that ravaged the community of Mordant Springs - had been dealt with, the horror will never truly be forgotten by the party. This Circle was beaten and bruised. However, they had lived to fight another day. And with a short epilogue to discuss how they each returned to their respective routines, seeking solace and respite in their own way, we concluded Assignment 52-72: Dressed to Kill.!<

\---

**ENDING REMARKS**

It was such an amazing time, and we had a blast! As a GM, there were definitely a few moments and sudden twists that threw me a curveball, and I had to scramble to rethink how to proceed. But overall, the system is incredibly responsive and easy to work with. It really does feel like a GM and the players are really only limited by their own imagination. We’re all super eager to play the next game, and we haven't stopped chatting about ifs, buts, and maybes from the session. Always a sign of a good TTRPG session!!

Until then, the Circle of Illuminated Paths and this GM will rest.",3,1740249069.0,CandelaObscura,0,1.0,False
1ivpiav,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTimeStrategy/comments/1ivpiav/what_are_the_most_interesting_retroinspired_rts/,"What are the most interesting retro-inspired RTS that you played (or are, y'know playing right now)? My latest find is Retro Commander and it’s damn near amazing","This weekend I’ve been waxing more nostalgic than usual, though actually just continuing my streak with old school games in the genre. I’ve had a good 2+ years trying out everything that I couldn’t on my previous rig, and now slowly returning to my true loves — the classics from the golden age of RTS and unique/interesting indie takes on classic strategy.

My newest discovery on that front is [Retro Commander](https://store.steampowered.com/app/338820/Retro_Commander/), which I’ve been playing pretty much since I downloaded it to go along with my noon coffee today. And I’m in love with it already. In some ways it’s similar to its namesake, Supreme Commander but far from a carbon copy or anything. It has its own identity with faction specific flavours for different technologies (portals, shields, nukes), which can split in some really fun ways in multiplayer. What I like on a more mechanical level is that it takes a lot of the QoL elements from modern factory-building games, as in - not requiring micromanagement for every single detail, automated builder assignment, automated repair etc. Feels easier to switch focus from management to combat, which you’ll be doing *a lot*.

The campaign is also solid, and they follow that retro style (think along the lines of Caesar or Emperor) where each subsequent mission is “bigger” with more enemies, more objectives, and just amped up difficulty… though it can be quite dynamic too depending on how you approach the mission from the start (a little bit of trial and error in some cases). I also feel that the AI – which is hard enough on Casual (which I identify as) doesn’t necessarily cheat to win. It just does its best to produce as much s\*\*t to bury you in, but … heh, you can just kill their harvesters and cut off their resource production. It’s something I was more RTS (and TBS) games had, since in most cases they amp the difficulty just by changing a slider to -X% player handicap, “pumping” the difficulty by effectively making the AI cheat. It’s the easiest way, but it also ruins the immersion when strats that work on players — just don’t work on AI controlled bots who have infinite resources.

Anyway, I was barely into Mission 2 though before I was tempted to try the custom maps and mods and some of them were really good (my fave has to be the one called Evil Dolphins). In fact, it has real potential I think for player driven modding and expansion since the system is simple enough to work with, but has underlying depth - and plenty of it. 

Short of it is, if you like TA/Supreme Commander or even just Red Alert/C&C - you’ll probably like this too. The graphics are also surprisingly easy on the eyes (which can be sometimes a problem for me b/c of being spoiled by modern gaming), there’s a really smooth quality to the textures and models, and it’s just pleasant to look it… especially before you deploy a nuke >:)",6,1740249067.0,RealTimeStrategy,0,0.81,False

I went to the fridge a moment ago to scrounge up food / caffeine / stimulus of any kind.

I found most of a raspberry mocha in a to-go cup, from a local coffeeshop. My sweetheart had picked it up for me two days ago. It’s leftover from one of our happy routines: I nab a good table on the patio of a restaurant we love; he parks the car. I order our favorite dishes; he walks to the coffeeshop a few doors down. By the time he’s back with espresso for him and some overly sweet concoction for me, the food is on the table and the outdoor heater is on full blast. We eat, talk, box up the leftovers, take a walk, and then head home to pursue our separate enterprises.

As I poured the coffee into a microwave-safe glass measuring cup, I suddenly felt so rich! I have this wonderful, soon to be warm coffee available to me. I have a beautiful life with an amazing person. I’m so lucky! 

I said, “I love you, [Sweetheart]!” as the microwave whirred. (It’s my habit to say ILY when I feel it, even though the recipient of my love is usually not around to hear it.)

I still have a very long day ahead. But fueled by love, sugar, and caffeine, I’m sure I’ll make it to the finish line. :-)",27,1740248841.0,BenignExistence,2,0.94,False
1ivpcnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1ivpcnk/coffee_and_tea_consumption_and_glioma_risk/,Coffee and Tea consumption and Glioma risk,"**Background:** Research on the association between glioma risk and coffee and tea consumption remains inconclusive. This study seeks to present a meta-analysis of the relationship between coffee and tea intake and glioma risk.

**Method:** Relevant cohort studies that collected coffee and tea exposure prospectively were identified through searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Eligible studies included those providing adjusted relative risk estimates or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or data sufficient for such calculations. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, while the GRADE system assessed the quality of evidence. The analysis explored glioma risk concerning the highest versus lowest levels of coffee and tea intake, supplemented by a dose–response evaluation using a one-stage robust error meta-regression model.

**Results:** A total of nine studies, published between 2004 and 2020, were included. In a model comparing the highest and lowest levels of coffee and tea consumption, 3,896 glioma cases were identified among 2,648,468 participants. Correspondingly, the pooled HRs with 95% CIs were 0.98 (0.87–1.09) for coffee and 0.95 (0.86–1.06) for tea, respectively. Furthermore, no evidence of publication bias was detected for either beverage. The dose–response analysis indicated a near “L”-shaped relationship between tea consumption and glioma risk, with the most notable risk reduction observed in individuals consuming more than 2.5 cups of tea per day. However, additional tea intake beyond this threshold did not confer evident risk reduction. According to Grade scoring system, the quality of meta-evidence was classified as “very low” for coffee and “low” for tea.

**Conclusion:** This meta-analysis provides evidence suggesting a potential inverse association between tea consumption and glioma risk, while no such association was observed for coffee consumption. Given that the evidence for coffee was classified as “very low” and for tea as “low,” cautious interpretation of the findings is warranted, and further research is needed to validate these results.

Hey there! I’m 19, bisexual, and looking to meet someone who’s actually interested in dating with intention. I don’t mean rushing into anything, but I’m tired of the whole “talk for a week, then disappear” thing. I want real dates, real conversations, and the kind of connection that actually leads somewhere.

I’m a mix of affectionate and independent—I love the idea of having someone to share life with, but I also value people who know themselves and what they want. I’m drawn to confidence, kindness, and a little bit of old-school romance. Someone who isn’t afraid to plan a date, take the lead, and be consistent. That’s rare these days, but I know there are still people out there who believe in real relationships.

I’ve never been the type to play games, and I don’t have the energy for people who aren’t sure what they want. If you’re looking for someone who will actually care, who will show up, and who wants something deeper than just small talk, we might get along. I’m the kind of person who remembers the little things, who enjoys deep conversations, and who likes making someone feel special. I want to meet someone who does the same.

I don’t care too much about labels or timelines—I just want to meet someone where things feel right. I love going on fun dates, trying new places, and just spending time with someone I connect with. Whether it’s grabbing coffee and getting lost in conversation, taking a drive with good music, or having a lazy Sunday watching movies, I love the feeling of being with someone who actually wants to be there.

Personality-wise, I’m easygoing, a little sarcastic, and always down for a random adventure. I love when people are direct and upfront—if you like me, say it. If you don’t, no hard feelings, just don’t waste my time. I’m at a point in my life where I want to build something real, even if it starts slow. I’m not expecting to meet my soulmate overnight, but I do want to meet someone who’s open to the possibility of something long-term if things feel right.

I don’t have a strict type, but I tend to be drawn to people who are confident, know how to take care of themselves, and are emotionally mature. I’m not interested in chasing or convincing someone to like me—I’d rather meet someone who already knows they want something meaningful too.

So, if you’re tired of the same old dating cycle and actually want to meet someone who’s serious about finding a connection, send me a message. Let’s talk, get to know each other, and see where things go. Worst case, we have a good conversation, best case… who knows?",0,1740248548.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I’m a third year litigator, articled and practiced at a litigation shop, so unfortunately I didn’t get any exposure to corporate work. Litigation is not for me and I desperately want to switch to M&A/Capital Markets.

I’ve networked, joined practice groups and attended their talks, met with many associates for coffees, used recruiters, messaged on LinkedIn, read books and took certificates in subject area, even applied in person to smaller shops. I approached firms to take me on as a first year. I feel I’ve covered my bases and did everything. 

I get the same response that the market is slow, and a lot of firms over hired juniors during the peak and are actually downsizing some of their teams. Plus, with tariff threats and the guise of becoming a 51st state is creating market instability right now. 

Now I kinda feel stuck in a practice area I don’t want and fear that as the years go by, I’m going to get further pigeon-holed.

1ivp8rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leadership/comments/1ivp8rf/possible_to_escape_scapegoating/,Possible to escape scapegoating?,"From 15 years in leadership with a stellar reputation and track record to a short series of COVID-related job losses, I finally landed a General Management/Director (dual role) position interstate Australia with an American company. As you all know, senior leadership positions are very hard to come by, especially in the current state of the world. 

The team, let alone the company, is a total mess. I'm talking sales guys on just short of my salary not bringing in any sales in over 12 months, entitled engineers, service and support staff who haven't serviced customers in 3 years with 3 year contracts, servicing customers without contracts etc. 

2 months into the gig, VP gets me to cull 40% of the team without any consultation or choice in the matter. To make matters worse, it was off the back of incorrect data by the 'golden boy' who was in my position before me, who made a $7M loss, had multiple HR complaints and safety incidents and who then was in limbo for 6 months with a retention bonus, 'working from home' in another state and still getting paid significantly more than me. The whole cull was a total massacre without a plan. When the local team and I questioned the vision and strategy moving forward, the VPs words were ""the cement is still drying on that one"". 

You all know what happens next. Morale has fallen off a cliff, VP completely ignores the business and another 10% jump the sinking ship. No support from my manager (who reports to VP) whatsoever. My manager 'helps' by constantly requesting midnight meetings (my time, due to AU US time difference) to keep him updated on customer tickets etc. Some departments have no-one. I've even lost my administration staff so I'm stretched beyond - doing my GM/Director of Ops job whilst doing tasks that range from fielding all the reception calls to stocking and servicing the office coffee machines etc. 

Then due to the downsize, we're hit with an relocation which I do nearly completely on my own as the team are already drowning in covering all the work of their former colleagues.

I perform crisis management for 9 months and despite navigating the greatest challenges in the local team's history, we still managed to achieve $2M above target (50% over budget) and YoY $12M, 20% YoY aftermarket revenue and cut SG&A costs by $300k. 

I was completely fine with all that, it's what I do best - turn basketcases into high performing teams. Here's where it gets ugly for me. Bar the constant micromanagement and nitpicking from my boss, when I share the above 2024 results with the leadership team I not only get shot down immediately, I very directly get shafted. VP awards all the team's successes to another team altogether and said these successes ""have many fathers"" but all the failures of the team - especially with the severe decline in service, fall on me. Now remember, the service team was cut to bare bones and the remaining walked. And on top of that, boss pushes out communication to all the customers notifying them of the cull and suddenly they all rushed in with 3 years worth of complaints under their belt knowing there's only a few staff left so that they could be the first to get support. But since I'm the lucky bastard that's sitting in the chair - they are making it look like complaints only appeared since I arrived on scene. 

So the VP who literally won an award for spearheading this innovative business is completely butchering it and I'm charged with polishing the turd whilst being scapegoated for its ""total failure"". The 'golden boy' from yesteryear saw his relevancy in the company flash before his eyes and got into anyone with influence's ear (really knows how to play the game, manage up, and a very good sweet talker) and now I suspect I'm going to get fired or relegated for what they deem as 'underperformance'. They want my direct reports (managers) gone too so even though we were the ones that held the whole unit together for a year, I was forced by my boss to mark them as underperforming and now it's my head they want. The entire time I tried to play the game and manage up, but I could tell the tides were turning a few months ago and now I'm stuck in the rip. My morale has tanked and there's nothing out there in my industry (been looking the past month and scanning for the past year). 

Any advice appreciated.

1ivp6u0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivp6u0,Aiden vs xBloom Studio vs Melodrip Colum,"I had some fun doing a comparative test between these three brewing methods today - xBloom Studio, Melodrip Colum and the Fellow Aiden. The Aiden had an unfair advantage as this Utopian Obsidian coffee was purchased with the Aiden, and came with a custom brewing profile specific to the coffee. All three coffees were tasted at the same 136F stabilized temperature in three different Ember mugs to keep things consistent. Both the Melodrip Colum and Aiden also had an advantage in the grinder department - as I used my Pietro Pro for the two. As a little background - I’ve been home roasting coffee for over two decades and in a past life many years ago was a professional barista for four years and have been a coffee geek for over 20 - so I have an above average understanding of how to brew a good cup of coffee. 

Flavor:

Coming in third place = Fellow Aiden

The least flavorful and unremarkable cup of the trio. While I admit, I rarely drink dark roast coffees and they’re not my preference, this cup didn’t have the depth you’d expect from a dark roast of this nature. Only the toasted hazelnut notes were present on the palate, it was devoid of complexity and the coffee lacked body. It was a boring cup, with a slightly acrid finish. My wife agreed, it was by far the least impressive. 

Coming in second place = xBloom Studio

The xBloom had two key disadvantages in this test. First - I hit the easy button and merely selected “auto mode C” for dark roast, which selected the grind and handled all brewing characteristics for me, but not specific to this bean in particular. Second - the Pietro Pro grinder (with base) used in the other two methods, is more expensive than the entire xBloom Studio - and at least in my opinion is the king of pour over coffee grinders. Now to the cup. An elegant and refined cup, and by far the most approachable and crowd pleasing. It had a lovely mix of body, perfectly balance acidity and the pipe tobacco, praline and toasted hazelnut notes jumped right out and were beautifully separated.  It doesn’t matter how well trained your palate is, you’re going to easily pick out the tasting notes. Immensely impressive. My wife could not pick whether she liked this, or the Melodrip Colum more - it was a tie for her. 

First place = Melodrip Colum 

Pure drama. Huge, rich, unctuous body with big, bold flavors. It’s hard to believe this was the same grind setting on the Pietro that was used with the Aiden. All the tasting notes come thundering into the scene, whilst throwing elbows. The xBloom had already bested my Origami yesterday, so I pulled out the “big guns” with the Melodrip Colum. Truth be told - it was about a draw for me as well, and depending on my mood, I could see preferring the xBloom. 

Despite the Melodrip winning the flavor competition, overall I have to give the win to the xBloom. It’s zero effort, it shines MUCH brighter when you have a custom NFC recipe card, setup and clean up is an absolute breeze - it has the ability to use the pre-measured bean filter cups, which in a hurry would give you high end cafe pour overs with as much effort as making a nespresso, and the price is probably what seals the deal for me. The xBloom is less than 1/2 the cost of my manual setup, and there is a learning curve required to deliver consistently excellent results - particularly as you change to different coffees. 

In summation - the xBloom Studio is a very impressive piece of kit, and greatly exceeded my expectations. If I had a small portion of very rare/unique/expensive beans and didn’t have a custom profile for the xBloom Studio, I’d probably still pull out my manual equipment and make a traditional pour over… but if I re-did this test using say the La Muralla Aerobic Washed Papayo from standout coffee that I have an xBloom NFC recipe card for (which is f’in phenomenal) - it would best my manual effort.

Then my pal Riley, a dev with a janky survival mess, tossed a busted alpha on itch.io, “don’t play this crap.” Ten randos grabbed it, hacked it apart, rebuilt it on GitHub, spread it to 100 pals, saying “this is wild."" It hit 1.5k wishlists in three months. Launched to 5k downloads, $17k net, not a dime in ads spent. 

I’m over here, jaw dropped. Players don’t always wait for your hype, they hijack it. This is what I caught on to. My next game was a glitchy space shooter, which I “accidentally” leaked a broken build for on reddit pages, with a caption “oops, don’t touch.” 

Twenty pirates tore it open, “fix the thrusters."" My Discord flared to 200, people saying stuff like “this is nuts,” and they modded it, spread it to 500 people, and I hit 2k wishlists by beta. I nudged ‘em, “steal this, break it,” launched to 4k sales, $14k net. 

Another example. I made a platformer, and slipped a “cursed” demo to 15 testers, told them “it’s trash,” they messed with it, shared it with 150 people, “best glitches ever,” and it scaled to 1k wishlists, $7k net. 

Drop a broken toy six months early, 10-20 testers, call it “unplayable,” they’ll pirate it, fix it, evangelize it. 

I’ve seen $1k ads flop at 100 downloads, while reverse hype hit 2k wishlists free. 

Its crazy how players crave the forbidden, and not your polish.

This is just an example of how people truly want to be apart of your game's story. Promotions dont just start when your game is ready to launch, they start way before that.

I don't think I'll survive.,"​​The unspoken truth of every new job is that the spot you find yourself in once belonged to someone who fled or was taken out. Each office chair, an ergonomic headstone in a professional graveyard. 



But you never start a gig thinking of how it will end.



As I sat at my desk waiting to find out if I had reached my end at *Coastline Magazine*, all I thought about was my beginning.



In the six months since my graduation from journalism school, I received rigorous instruction on why I shouldn't have gone to journalism school. Fifty applications resulted in three interviews that resulted in zero job offers. 



Then *Coastline* called. 



*Coastline* was the magazine that got me interested in writing in the first place. When I was a kid, my dad would read me articles like they were bedtimes stories. I could rattle the names the staff writers off like they were superheroes. Peter Strum was my favorite. He'd spend months buried in research, unearthing incredible stories from the past, before laying out everything he learned in an article that read like a thriller. I can still remember the rush I'd get when my dad would return from the mailbox with a new issue, the smile on his face when he saw my reaction. Thinking back to those times is when I remember him the most clearly. 



The interview at *Coastline* went as the others had, so I wasn't hopeful. I sat in the uncomfortable chair across the HR lady as she scanned my resume, feeling like a kid who put on her mom's blazer to play work. She recited my greatest accomplishments back to me in a way that made me embarrassed by each and every one. 



""Editor of your college newspaper,"" she said. ""Very impressive."" My inadequacy was an old friend at that point.



I knew what came next. But instead of pivoting to a lament on the state of the industry, the HR lady asked about money. I was beside myself. Companies usually expect you to treat a salary like an incidental side effect of doing what you love—working for them. She, however, wanted to know how much I was expecting to make, like asking a starving person if they wanted fries with that. 



""I haven't given it much thought,"" I said. ""I guess I would say it's negotiable.""



""Well, let's negotiate.""



I sat for a long time, waiting for her to start. Then I said ""Forty"" with the hope that vomiting any number would bring me closer to leaving.



Her frown told me that I had aimed too high, so I decided that debasing myself was the only solution. ""But honestly, thirty would be more than generous.""



Her lacquered lips collapsed inward, disappearing as if to steel themselves before telling me to ""Get fucked.""



""Twenty seems fair,"" I said.

 

Her smile returned. We shook hands shortly after.



When I think back to my time at *Coastline Magazine*—all the late nights, demeaning tasks, the blood spilt, and lives lost—negotiating myself below the poverty line strikes me as an almost-charming detail.



\*\*\*



I should probably give you some context about *Coastline*. 



You see, a magazine was like a collection of articles that someone printed and mailed to you every month—sometimes even weekly.



It seems silly now, but there was a time when the words on those glossy pages mattered. That's what my dad thought, at least. He grew up dreaming of the world in a town that could only offer the drugstore magazine rack. Then he met mom, had me, and found whatever he was looking for, I guess. But in me, he saw opportunity and—unfortunately for both of us—hope. He knew that people could live adventurous lives, and the bylines in *Coastline* were proof of that. 



Then the world changed. Dad died, and the internet devoured most magazines. Losing him was made harder by the thought of saying goodbye to a thing we loved. That reckoning never came for *Coastline*, though. Through recessions and algorithm tweaks and pivots to video, its blend of center-left politics, celebrity profiles, and investigative longreads somehow endured as a last bastion of print media—unnaturally, some would joke. 



I, on the other hand, found ""unnaturally"" to be the case precisely.



My first day was the Monday following the interview. I had requested an additional week of time off before starting. When they asked why, the honest answer—""enjoying one last taste of freedom""—didn't seem prudent, so I said Monday would be great. 



The HR lady met me at the elevator at 10 and ushered me my desk. The newsroom for *Coastline Magazine* occupied the top floor of a converted textile mill. Old ductwork still hung from the ceiling, and if you looked closely, you could see scorch marks on the exposed brick wall from the fire that killed a couple dozen immigrants around the turn of the century. 



My desk sat at the very center of the open floor plan, one of a collection of six meekly divided workstations crammed onto two long tables. ""This is where our editorial assistants work,"" the HR lady said. ""Known affectionately around these parts as 'The Pit.' And these fine folks are the Pit Crew."" She signaled to the five hunched backs that surrounded us, each with the faint bluish glow of the computer screen just beyond it. Four turned to introduce themselves in a flurry of names I immediately forgot. 



But Kelsey's name I would remember. Settled deep into the seat next to mine, she didn't acknowledge me when I first arrived at my desk or after the HR lady left, instructing the rest of the Pit Crew to answer any questions I might have. As soon as she was gone, everyone returned to their work, and I was on my own.



Though the dull gray desktop smelled like it was freshly spritzed with green industrial cleaner, when I sat down I found that the drawers underneath it were still filled with the belongings from the previous tenant. There were breath mints, tampons, and a hoarded stack of Post-It pads. The personalized mug bearing the name Claire in friendly script held pens, their caps all nervously chewed.



The corner of a folded scrap of paper stuck out from beneath the mug's chunky base. I could lie to you and say that I thought the note might help identify the owner of the belongings, but I'm just nosy. And considering what I found on the paper, it served me right.



The creases across the yellowed page were deep, like it had been refolded again and again over years. There were only three lines of scribbled writing scrawled across its center. 



*I*

*Complete each task, for then sleep is earned.*



*II*

*Obey the foremen, for foremen shall you be.*



*III*

*Beware the Minder, for it knows not of mercy.*



As I stared at the lines, I knew I wanted nothing to do with whatever they meant. I turned to Kelsey. Her hard eyes were fixed on her screen. I couldn't decide whether they looked red because she had been crying or she was going for something with her makeup.



""Hi,"" I said tamping down the creeping dread with a smile. ""I didn't catch your name.""



""Kelsey."" There was no life in her voice. 



""Nice to meet you. I was just going through my desk. I think there's some stuff left from the girl who was here bef—"" Kelsey was out of her seat and gone before I could finish. 



With no one else to turn to, I emailed the HR lady about the unemptied drawer, doing my best to keep the email short and positive. I only apologized four times. 



It was Pit Crew tradition to get lunch together whenever someone new started. But Kelsey wasn't back by the time everyone was ready to go, and when someone mentioned that we had already wasted five minutes waiting, we left without her. Over an $18 salad, I fielded impersonal questions about what I hoped to do at *Coastline*. I said I wanted to be an editor, and the others exchanged looks. I didn't understand their meaning, but couldn't confuse their temperature as anything other than shady. 



Everyone got quiet when I asked what happened to Claire. ""She left,"" one of them said, almost defensive, after a long pause. I had figured, I told them, but I hoped to learn why, knowing that nothing engendered the new kid quite like shit talk. Once again, the Pit Crew clammed up. One of them broke the silence by saying we better get back. We'd been gone for 15 minutes.



Claire's drawer was empty when I got back.



That night I watched as my new co-workers left, one-by-one. Every ten minutes, I had to stand up and wave in the direction of a motion detector to turn the lights back on. But soon, without fail, I'd find myself once again submerged in darkness, the ghostly glow of my laptop screen the only light. I never shook the feeling that something was watching me in those moments.



At 9:30, there was still no sign of Kelsey. Her bag lay on her desk, exactly where it had been when she ran off. I was concerned—and also my mom had told me to not let anyone see you leave on your first day.



I did a lap around the empty office. Every light still burned, but not a soul remained. In the break room, I perused the ample snack cabinet and found Claire's left-behind belongings dumped out into the garbage bin, her chewed-up pen caps mixed in with the used K-Cups. The note, however, was missing.



Kelsey's Converse were sticking out from under one of the bathroom stalls when I poked my head inside the women's room. I entered the one next to hers and crouched beside our shared wall. Small sobs were the only sound that made it through. ""Kelsey,"" I said. ""It's Sam. Are you okay?"" 



I pressed my ear closer to the laminate divider. She sniffled. Her whispers were barely audible.



She told me I was going to die there. 



She said we all were. 



She was probably best friend I ever had.



\*\*\*



I was working at *Coastline* three whole days before someone screamed at me. There are four kinds of artificial sweeter, I learned. And apparently ingesting the wrong one is worth tearing into the new assistant—who, mind you, is a girl with three roommates and a shower curtain for a bedroom door. 



Whenever we could, Kelsey and I stole moments to talk. She was close with Claire, the girl who sat at my desk before me. But everything changed two weeks earlier, when Claire had spoken to one of the editors about a promotion. She returned to the Pit visibly shaken and refused to tell her friend any of what had transpired. Claire was gone a week later. Kelsey didn't know it was for good until they hired me.



I told her about the strange, scribbled note, but neither of us knew what to make of it. We decided the early scratchings of a YA novel side-project was most likely, since we both had our own. If Claire's request had been poorly received, that could account for her hasty exit, but not her complete ghosting of Kelsey. We theorized about explanations, compiled lists of the likeliest creeps on staff, and trolled the mastheads of other publications, praying to see her name appear.



But employment, like the inexorable march of time, flattens all things. Fears, passions, plans for retirement. Months slipped by without answers, the endless rhythm of work weeks pulling us through the end of the year like a riptide. There was too much else to worry about, deadlines to meet, and tantrums to manage. That was the nice thing about *Coastline*. Some new trouble always popped up to take the air out of the old.



Kelsey was a constant through it all. She could turn a day around with the precise timing of an eye roll. She knew where the editor-in-chief stored his special little snacks and how many we could take before someone noticed. She told me who to avoid and which happy hours specials we could take solace in when avoidance wasn't an option. 



The day we returned from New Years break—January 2nd—the Pit Crew were each meted out to senior writers like college-educated chattel to assist with long-term projects.



I got Peter Strum. 



In my six months at *Coastline*, I had yet to lay eyes on mine and Dad's favorite writer. He had apparently been off on assignment, but with the New Year was returning to the office to compile his research and start writing. I found his office door situated in the farthest corner of the floor, closed with a note stuck to it. ""Come on in,"" it read.



The space was more like a burrow than an office. The lamp on the desk illuminated only a fraction of the hundreds of books and antiquities crammed onto the shelves behind the desk. But without either Peter or further instructions, I was left with no choice but to look at all his stuff. Beneath a bejeweled dagger, a set of bagpipes, and an enormous conch sat a framed tintype photo. The four bearded men pictured stood side-by-side in a lush field. Their hollow cheeks were smeared with dirt. Their eyes were sunken and haunted. I couldn't look away.



""Now that's an interesting story,"" the voice behind me said. 



I jumped and said ""fuck"" too loudly. Peter stood in the doorway, an exact copy of the image I venerated in my mind for so long—pudgy, bespectacled, balding, a flat smile. Before I knew it, he was next to me, pointing at the image. 



Peter said that the guys were this reclusive group of Irish farmers from the late eighteen hundreds. When the Great Famine hit, they withdrew to the hills, completely cut ties with the other villages in the county. People said that these farmers had figured out a way to save their crops from the blight. No one was ever able to learn the truth. Villagers tried, but the farmers fiercely—sometimes violently—protected their crops and their secret. And so rumor, in the absence of fact, begot myth. There were whispers of an evil up in the hills. Something that granted good luck to all of the farmers' endeavors—for a price. Peter spent a lot of time looking into it, but the only lead he ever came across was two words: *dia nua*. 



It's Gaelic, he said. It means ""new god.""



A chill would have gone down my spine, but the office was already freezing. 



Once the blight disappeared and word of the farmers' success spread, they decided to capitalize on their infamy and publish an almanac, chronicling what they had learned—most of it anyway. Over the years, the almanac evolved, eventually becoming *Coastline Magazine*. 



Peter's eye flicked to the side to gauge my reaction to his kicker, but I didn't need to perform. The guy was good. I introduced myself and my fandom, trying my best not to scare him. He didn't seem to mind. 



We worked together nonstop for the next few weeks, me cataloging his notes and him laying out the loose structure of his eventual article. Sometimes we chatted. Others, he monologued about the state of the industry, how we were on the verge of losing something culturally that it was *Coastline*'s duty to sustain. I'd agree, and he'd admire my insight, before we returned to our quiet, focused work.



It was in those small moments when I felt most aware that I was actually at *Coastline*, doing work I was meant to, what my dad had dreamt for me.



After one late night in Peter's office, I returned to the Pit to find Kelsey still at her desk. She was the only assistant left, and the second I saw her, I knew she had been waiting for me. She said we needed to talk. When I didn't immediately know what we had to discuss, she got mad. Tom, one of the other assistants, hadn't been heard from since before the holiday, and when Kelsey asked his manager about it, she was accused of insubordination. 



""It's Claire all over again,"" she insisted. There *had* to be something going on here.



But I wasn't so quick to follow her down the rabbit hole. This industry is a tough one, I told her. No one gets into it to make money. And some people just aren't cut out for this kind of work. Tom could have just decided to move back home, and if I was being honest, that's probably what happened to Claire. 



Kelsey reacted as if I had just asked her to come in on a Saturday. I tried to assure her that that didn't have to happen to us, especially if we stuck together and Kelsey showed a little more hustle from time to time. But I only seemed to upset her more. She snatched up her bag and headed for the elevator before I could offer to put in a good word for her with Peter. 



Nothing could have kept me in the office after that—not even birthday cake in the breakroom. I waited just long enough for Kelsey to clear the building and subway, then got in the elevator alone. 



One floor down from *Coastline*, the car stopped, and the doors opened. No one was waiting to get on. I expected someone to hurriedly appear, having forgotten the one last email they needed to send and apologizing. But still, no one. I jabbed the close door button as if those ever worked, betraying how badly I wanted to leave. To be anywhere else but here—where I had let down my friend.



A *buzz* from the control panel startled me. Gears ground somewhere above. The elevator began to descend with the doors still open. A stumbled backward and cowered in the corner, as far from the gaping opening as I could get myself.



The floors passed slowly enough to glimpse the empty offices beneath *Coastline*, but too quickly to make an escape. A draft whipped through car with each new level. I tried to stay calm, reminding myself that the gusts were not pulling me closer and closer to the opening. It only felt that way.



A few floors from the lobby, I saw something that convinced me that fear had gotten the better of me. A figure sat cross-legged on the ground, facing the elevator in an almost childlike pose, lit dimly by the faint red light of a distant exit sign. The darkness and the descent didn't allow me much more detail than its ragged outline, a vague sense of its enormity, and the sudden smell of decay.



A chime rang out when the elevator reached the lobby. I still clung to the hand railing above me, my face buried in my shoulder. The security guard asked if I was alright and helped me up. He said he'd call maintenance in the morning. 



\*\*\*



I hardly slept that night. Kelsey plagued my thoughts, and my shower curtain door wouldn't close all the way because it had lost a ring. I spent the endless hours longing for sleep, yet dreading the day that slumber would whisk me toward even faster. At four, I gave up and showered. It felt like only moments passed before the subway car was hurdling past me, inches away, promising oblivion on either side of the platform's grooved yellow warning strip. 



The office was empty when I got in, and I lost myself in work for a few hours. Whenever a new set of footsteps approached, I braced myself for the slosh of her iced coffee and the crinkle of her take-out bagel bag. But when Kelsey finally did show up, I didn't notice until she was next to me. 



""Hey,"" she said, seeming as sleep deprived as I was. 



""Hi,"" I said. A weary, commiserative smile was all I could offer. 



I like to think she understood. 



The drumming started before we could say anything else. The steady beats were high and hollow, as if emanating from an ancient, tightly drawn skin. A voice over the intercom instructed the staff to gather in the conference room for an all-hands meeting. Terror filled Kelsey's eyes, and I applied baseless reassurances as we walked over together. The torrent of whispers around us was unintelligible beyond the fact that no one knew what was happening.



We assumed our positions, standing against the wall while senior staff sat in chairs, and waited for the editor-in-chief. He came in shortly thereafter, a politic expression on his face that was neither too sad nor joyful. His heavy watch thunked on the table when he sat down. 



The drumming continued as he spoke. He thanked us for coming on such short notice and said that he had some unfortunate news to share. The finance department had doubts about the forecast for the next fiscal year, so there would need to be cuts. He swore to us that these were his least favorite days, but were some of the most important for securing the future of *Coastline Magazine*. He thanked us again, asked us to keep up the hard work, and requested we return to our seats.



The HR lady was waiting for us in the center of the newsroom as we filed out. In a blunt voice, she ordered us all to resume work and to not—no matter what—look away from our screens. 



The room erupted in the sound of keyboards clacking. Through the din, I could hear the elevator rising to our floor, its motor straining loudly against an unusually heavy load. The happy *ding* of the elevator preceded the metallic slide of the opening door and the boom of enormous footfalls entering the office.



A putrid smell, like decaying produce, filled my nostrils. It grew stronger as the footsteps came closer. My eyes locked on my screen, I couldn't see whatever was behind me, but the dimming light told me it was tall. The HR lady explained that she had some questions about our recent performance and implored us to answer honestly. 



First, she wanted to know if Josh, directly behind me, had tried to start a union. When he said he had, I heard breaking bones muffle a scream. After Cindy, two seats over, admitted to printing her resume on a *Coastline* copier, her chair flew out of sight, and I never saw her again. Sara, immediately to my right, never stood a chance. She copped to requesting time off during the busy season. 



When the thing stopped behind me, a different voice spoke up. Peter cleared his throat and apologized for all of this nastiness. There was just one more question to answer. He wanted to know who I trusted more with the future of *Coastline Magazine*, myself or Kelsey. 



In the moment, it took everything I had to not look over to her. Now, I tremble at the thought of what I would have seen.



After it was all over, there was pizza in the conference room, and a few of the senior editors gathered around.



They said I had done well.



They said I showed initiative.



They said I had management [potential](https://www.reddit.com/user/MasterSmiley/submitted/). ",11,1740247828.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
