1h2k8st,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h2k8st/sharpspicy_espresso/,Sharp/spicy espresso,"Hello fellow coffee enthusiasts,

on my recent trip (spain/france/italy) I frequently came across a spicy quality in their espresso. It wasn't hot spicy like tabasco, but more in the front of the mouth like a fishermans friend. Darker roasts, on the bitter side, reasonably balanced; classic espressi.
I never had that taste on my machine. Where does it come from? Is it a brewing/prepping thing or just a quality of the beans?

Hope you can enlighten me!

Thanks

1h2k8mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h2k8mt/am_i_being_crazy_help/,Am I being crazy? HELP!,"My boyfriend has recently moved to a new city for a new job, over 9 hours away from me. We were both keen to do long distance because we both love each other and want to make it work. He knows no one in this city and thus has started becoming friends with his coworkers, however, the only ones around his age are girls (this is so fine with me - I will get to the real issue in a sec!) as the other men at his workplace are around late 30s and 40s ish. He started hanging out with this particular coworker, A, as they bonded over their similar music taste. I was so excited for him and even suggested he go to the movies or get a drink with her, and he decided he would (this was two weeks ago by the way!)

They went to the movies at 5pm and at 7pm I text him and asked him how it was going and if he enjoyed the movie, to which he did not respond (I was fine with this and just assumed he was busy), he then later sent me a photo of him and her alone in his living room at his apartment (that he lives at alone) drinking together. This was where I felt a little funny - I trust this man with my life, and I wasn't jealous or angry or upset, but I just felt slightly uncomfortable that they were alone together drinking at his place. I text him to ask if it was just them alone (for clarification) before I made myself feel weird over nothing, to which he again did not respond.

They then went out around 10pm, which I didn't know about, and I called him around 11pm trying to check if he was okay - he did not pick up. I thought he must be busy/heading home, so I waited around half an hour and called him again - he did not pick up again. By now, I started to get annoyed because he hadn't responded to me (properly) for like around 6 hours at this point (not even a ""Hey, I'm safe, just out with A right now will call you when I get home x""). I also started to worry, just because he is in a new city alone (and someone recently was found dead in the river near his house lol, sorry anxiety really took the reigns there), so I facetimed him this time and he finally picked up. He was out with A and everything was fine, but I was a bit frustrated so I told him to call me when he got home. He called me an hour later, and I said something along the lines of:

* I understand that you are trying to make friends, and I am so on board with that because I want you to be able to get through this tough move/new job with support. I was fine with the movie and going out for drinks afterwards.
* However, I felt slightly funny about you guys being alone at your house drinking together, especially because I don't know her - just felt like there were other things you could have done i.e. gone for a drink out, gone clubbing etc...
* For the period of 7 hours, you didn't respond to me (properly) once/answer my questions and it made me slightly worried (he was active on social media at points, actively ignoring my texts lol)
* When I called, you didn't pick up... (which was fine until he said what I mention below...)

I asked him if he thought I might have felt uncomfortable with him having her round, and he admitted that  he did think that I might be uncomfy with it, yet he chose to do it anyway. I asked him why and he claimed it was ""the only option"" as going out to drink was too expensive (even though he went out and did it later anyway) and he wanted to pre load so he could get drunk, to which I responded ""so what I'm getting from this is saving money and getting drunk is more important to you than how I feel?"" (kinda mean to say I will admit but that was just how I was feeling) and he went silent. He also told me he felt his phone vibrating and heard my calls but chose not to pick up because ""A's just sooo talkative, it felt rude to interrupt the conversation by replying to your texts or picking up your call/s"". I said there had to have been some point in the night where he would've had a moment to respond, or that he could've quickly said to A ""hang on, please hold that thought I don't want to be rude but I just need to pick up this call really quick!"" (these are literally all things I would've done lol). Anyway, we had a big old chat about it and squashed it. I said communication is more important now than ever since we are long distance, and he agreed and said that he wouldn't do it again and also he would be better at responding.

Fast forward to tonight, he's done the exact same thing except it's at her house now. They had a work christmas party and decided to go back to her place (across town from both the christmas party and his place) alone and continue drinking. I asked him (on snapchat) if it was just them two alone or if everyone else joined them, and he didn't answer my question (like responded to me with a snap and completely ignored my question). I proceeded to ask him again like an hour later on text to which he did not respond again. I started to get annoyed, and I text him and said ""you're doing the thing again where you aren't acknowledging my question..."" and he said ""what was the question? xxxxxxx"" and so I asked again to which he replied ""It's just A and I xxx"". I just got so disappointed because we already had this discussion and I tried to set a boundary with him. I literally said that he could go shopping, go to the movies, go out for brunch/lunch, get a drink, get a coffee, do all this stuff with her, but that I felt funny about them being alone with each other at night and drinking and would prefer if they didn't do that, and he still did it. This time he said ""I was just trying to kill time"" - it is now nearly 1am, like if you're trying to kill time go to sleep bro. Idk. Maybe I'm being crazy but I'm just bummed out and feel like he heard what I said last time but just didn't listen and/or doesn't care. Someone please tell me if I am being crazy lol, I have never been jealous before with him and I literally trust him so much I just feel slightly uncomfy with the situation especially because I don't know a thing about her. I feel like there's more context I am probably missing out so if anyone asks questions in the comments I can reply for more clarification.

  
Edit: More context. This time round he said ""I thought the issue last time was that she was at MY place and that I was shit at replying but I've done the reverse this time xxxx"". I said to him that just because it's at her house this time doesn't change anything, and that he was literally doing the exact same thing I told him I felt uncomfortable.",1,1732881527.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

ARIA'S POV

Grandmother’s funeral is being held on a gloomy day, much to my displeasure.

I listened to the weather forecast so I could choose the perfect day for the funeral, and according to the forecast, the day is supposed to be sunny and bright just like Grandmother. I feel duped standing by grandmother’s grave with the sky covered in clouds that only worsen the dark and depressing feeling that has settled in my guts since her death.

I have cried so much that I have no tears left to shed at grandmother’s grave and now have to wear dark sunglasses to hide how red and puffy my eyes are rather than to complement my black dress.

There are a few people hanging around the other graves in the cemetery to pay their last respects to their loved ones and at each grave, there are at least two people; couples holding each other, families comforting each other and even church processions.

I am alone, with no one to comfort me since no one else bothered to attend my grandmother's funeral. With her gone, I realize how lonely I actually am and the thought deals another blow to my already damaged heart. I try hard to get the heartbreaking events of the past few days off my mind and when I finally succeed, I turn my focus back to my grandmother.

She’s smiling in the framed picture placed by her tombstone and I force a smile as well as a fond memory of her slips into my mind.

“Aria, my child, you can’t frown like that everytime or you’ll get wrinkles like me before you are even my age!” She would say and then go ahead to spread my lips into a smile with her fingers.

Grandmother was a cheerful soul who would tell me stories, mostly the ones about my birth and how she knew from the very first day that she set her eyes on me that I was going to be a really beautiful and amazing child. I shared everything with her and talking to her about my marriage was one of the things that made it bearable. I don’t know what I’d do without Grandmother.

Tears start to gather in my eyes again and I take off the sunglasses to wipe them off before they start to fall. I already promised myself not to cry anymore; Grandmother wouldn’t want that.

Sniffling, I begin to place the things I brought with me by her grave; Tulips, which were her favorite flowers; Peaches, her favorite fruit and finally some sweets because grandmother had a really sweet tooth and never listened to me whenever I told her they were bad for her age.

“There are no sweets in heaven, Aria. It’s only right that I take as much as I can down here before the big guy calls me up there.” She would say at the same she unwraps another candy and tosses it into her mouth. She would talk on and on about ‘The big guy’ and ‘Up there’ like she was always prepared for the day she would die.

I can’t help it anymore, I burst into tears, falling on my knees by her grave as it dawns on me fully that she is really gone.

“I should have let you have all the candies in the world. I should have been there with you at your dying moment. I should have held your hands and told you it’s gonna be okay. I–” My voice breaks, the deep regret and tears choking me and making me lose my train of thoughts. I can’t think of a thing to say anymore and so I just cry, sobbing so hard my body shakes.

I hear confident footsteps approaching me and feel a presence behind me that causes my sobs to come to a pause. My heart races and hope swells inside of me when the person puts a hand on my shoulder. I whip my head around, expecting to see Adam but my hope quickly shatters when I see that it is Adam uncle, Regis.

“Regis.” I say, sniffing and wiping my tears in a rush.

“Here,” He hands me his handkerchief, stuffing it in my hand and closing my palm around it before I can even refuse. I say a barely audible thank you before I dab at the tears with the hanky that smelt like him.

“I came as soon as I heard, I’m sorry about your Grandmother, Aria.” He says in a sincere and kind voice. Regis has always been kind to me even when I was just a secretary.

Whenever he came to visit his nephew at the office, he would stop to say hi and hand me a canned coffee with a smile on his face.

However, he left the country to study a few days before our wedding and only returned not too long ago. This is the first time seeing him since his return and the kind look in his eyes assures me that if he had been around, I would have had another person rooting for me just like Adam’s grandfather.

“You didn’t have to.” I say quietly, trying to downplay how much it actually means to me that at least, one person cares enough to be here with me. Regis looks around as if searching for something and then he frowns when our eyes meet again.

“You’re alone? Where the hell is Adam?” He asks, his voice a little hard.
My cheeks redden in embarrassment. Regis has only just returned and probably doesn’t know anything yet. I am not willing to talk either. I force a smile and begin to pack the excess things I bought for my grandmother's funeral.
Regis joins me wordlessly and I sigh in silent appreciation of how he doesn’t ask anymore questions. He takes everything from my hands even before I can protest.

“Did you drive here?” He asks and I shake my head. I came here in a Taxi.

“C’mon, we’ll take my car.” He says and walks in front of me. I have no choice but to follow him.

We have just gotten outside of the cemetery when a car drives into the parking space right beside Regis’ car. The car is familiar and I keep doubting who it belongs to until Adam steps out of the car, eyes trained on me as he walks over. The first thing I notice is his Royal Blue suit and I feel the slow brewing of anger inside of me. How could he show up wearing that? It is like a blatant disrespect of my Grandmother and I can’t stand to watch her get disrespected even in her death.

It is clear that he came from the office; little surprise there and it would have been better if he didn’t come at all as I now realize how looking at him only infuriates me. He had managed to avoid me in the past three days since the hospital incident. Three days since Sophia announced that she was pregnant and shook my world. I didn’t need anyone to tell me who the baby belonged to as he walks towards me now, I feel nothing but resentment for him.

“Is it over? Crap, I must have lost track of time.” He says before turning to his uncle and giving him a tight smile of appreciation that I find nauseating.

“Thank you for being here with her, uncle.”
Regis merely crosses his arms, staring back at his nephew, “Care to explain why you are only just coming?” Regis thows the question at him and I face Adam too, crossing my arms.

“Yes, Adam. Tell me what was more important than being at my grandmother’s funeral.” I already know the answer but I still wait to hear him say it so I can have a reason to hate him even more.

“I really wanted to be here, Aria but you know…” He trails off, running a hand through his hair, “I had to be with Sophia.”

The sound of her name is what does it for me; the same woman who is the reason I wasn’t around to witness grandmother’s dying moments.
“Did you really come all the way here to tell me you were with another woman you slept with and impregnated?”

“What?” Regis is the one who speaks, his voice echoing his shock as he looks from me to Adam. Adam’s usual blank look remains as if he is unaffected by my words and the pain he has caused me.

“Let’s not do this here, Aria. You know I can’t just leave her.”

I scoff.

“I never stopped you. You know what? You should have never come here. You should have stayed with her since that is where your loyalties lie now and I am no longer in the picture.”

Adam frowns, moving closer and intimidating me just a little with his height and muscular frame, “What does that mean? You are my wife.”

“Ex-wife,” I say the words without even thinking. I didn’t think any of this through but I don’t care because my entire being seems to agree that this is what’s best for me,
“I want a divorce, Adam.”

His eyes grow wide, unable to contain the shock at my words and I am proud of myself that I finally got a reaction that isn’t anger or coldness from him.

“Both the divorce papers and my resignation will find their way to you soon.” I add before he can get over his shock and I don’t wait for him to reply as I turn to an equally stunned Regis.

“Take me home, Regis.”

1h2k4th,https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1h2k4th/i_tried_the_recipe_nanas_devil_chocolate_cake/,"I tried the recipe ""Nana's Devil Chocolate Cake"" from this sub and it was a success","Found this chocolate cake recipe on this sub and decided to try it out! The comments mentioned cake flour vs all purpose. I live in the UK and have never heard of cake flour but by chance I happened upon this pastry and cake flour by Caputo the Italian flour maker. I decided to give it a go with that. I also substituted the oil for butter. I started out by creaming the butter and sugar, sifting all the dry ingredients together, then pouring in the coffee/milk with each egg to the creamed butter and sugar and adding the dry mix gradually and whisking as I went.

The recipe yields a huge portion. I used a bundt cake tin and added cream cheese icing over the top to balance out the chocolate flavour. This icing with the cake was such a good combo and I would make add more icing the next time I make this cake. I would also like to see how the cake turns out with all purpose flour.

Overall a lovely recipe.

I didn’t believe it at first. Another supplement claiming to be a miracle cure, promising results that seemed too good to be true. But when I started using it, everything changed. I went from a life of constant fatigue, unpredictable blood sugar crashes, and stubborn weight I couldn’t shake, to feeling like I’d unlocked the energy I hadn’t felt in years.

For me, it started with curiosity. I’d heard about natural blends packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients like turmeric and cocoa extract, and how they could potentially stabilize blood sugar and boost metabolism. My energy was at an all-time low, and no matter how hard I tried to clean up my diet, I just couldn’t get ahead of the constant crashes. My cravings? Insatiable. That vicious cycle of eating something to stabilize, only to crash again, was exhausting.

The first week was subtle, but something felt different. I woke up feeling…lighter. Not in terms of weight—yet—but in terms of energy. My morning fog started lifting. By mid-afternoon, I didn’t feel that all-too-familiar slump that usually had me reaching for a sugary snack or another cup of coffee. It was like my body had hit a reset button.

By week two, the real magic started. My cravings? Practically nonexistent. I wasn’t obsessing over my next meal or battling the temptation of late-night snacks. My digestion, something I didn’t even realize was off, felt smoother. And the stubborn weight around my midsection? It began to budge. For the first time in years, I looked in the mirror and saw progress.

What blew me away most wasn’t just the physical changes—it was the mental clarity. When your blood sugar is balanced, your brain feels sharper. I was getting through my work faster, making better decisions, and, most importantly, feeling more present. It was a domino effect. Better energy led to better workouts. Better workouts led to better sleep. Better sleep? Game-changing.

I didn’t realize how much inflammation had been holding me back until I noticed the small things: less puffiness in my face, no random aches in my joints, and even my skin looked clearer. It wasn’t overnight, but it was consistent. I could feel my body healing.

Now, let’s talk weight loss. By the end of the first month, I’d dropped eight pounds. But what’s even more important? It stayed off. This wasn’t about a crash diet or a quick fix. It was about giving my body the tools it needed to function at its best. And when your body works the way it’s supposed to, everything else falls into place.

This isn’t just about numbers on a scale. It’s about feeling like yourself again. No more yo-yoing between energy highs and lows. No more wrestling with cravings or feeling guilty about what I ate. This was freedom. Freedom to live without constantly worrying about my health.

I’ll admit, I was skeptical in the beginning. I didn’t expect much. But this has been the single most transformative experience of my health journey. The best part? Knowing it’s backed by nature. With ingredients carefully chosen for their ability to support blood sugar, metabolism, and overall wellness, I finally feel like I’ve found a sustainable solution.

Looking back, I wish I’d started sooner. If you’re feeling stuck—whether it’s with your weight, your energy, or just the way you feel in your body—take this as your sign. Sometimes, the right tools make all the difference. For me, this was the breakthrough I didn’t know I needed. And now, there’s no looking back.

What’s truly remarkable about my journey is how grounded in science this entire transformation has been. This isn’t just another blend of random ingredients thrown together—it’s a carefully curated formula, rooted in research and designed to address the most fundamental issues behind blood sugar imbalances, inflammation, and weight management.

Let’s start with the cornerstone: **blood sugar stability**. The body’s ability to regulate blood sugar is at the core of so many health challenges—fatigue, weight gain, and even mental fog. CelluCare leverages ingredients like **gymnema**, an herb long recognized for its ability to reduce sugar absorption in the gut. It’s no wonder I stopped craving sugary snacks within the first two weeks—it was like my body naturally recalibrated its relationship with sugar.

Then there’s **turmeric rhizome**, a powerhouse antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Chronic inflammation is often the silent culprit behind stubborn weight, joint pain, and overall sluggishness. The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, works to neutralize free radicals and reduce inflammatory markers in the body. For me, this translated to less bloating, fewer aches, and a metabolism that finally felt like it was firing on all cylinders.

Another star player? **Cocoa bean extract**. Rich in flavonoids, this ingredient is a game-changer for blood circulation and heart health. Improved circulation doesn’t just mean better oxygen flow; it means your body can deliver nutrients where they’re needed most. That’s why I started feeling more energetic—my body was finally running efficiently.

But what sets this apart is how these ingredients work together. Take **berberine**, for example. Known for its ability to activate an enzyme called AMPK (often referred to as the “metabolic master switch”), berberine helps regulate glucose levels and enhance fat burning. Pair that with the effects of **cinnamon bark extract**, which has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, and you’ve got a one-two punch for optimizing blood sugar and reducing fat storage.

Even **banaba leaf extract** plays a critical role. This lesser-known plant contains corosolic acid, which aids in glucose metabolism. It’s no wonder my energy felt more sustained throughout the day—my body was learning how to use fuel more effectively.

And let’s not overlook the digestive angle. Ingredients like **bitter melon** and **ginger root** enhance gut health by promoting better digestion and nutrient absorption. A healthier gut means less bloating, improved mood, and even better immune function. It’s like every system in my body started working in harmony.

What ties it all together is the synergy. Each ingredient is effective on its own, but when combined, they create a holistic solution that addresses the root causes of poor metabolic health. This isn’t just about masking symptoms or providing a quick fix. It’s about restoring balance

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but I started noticing subtle changes within the first week—more energy and fewer cravings. By the second week, the shifts became more noticeable, and by the end of the first month, I had tangible results in both weight loss and overall wellness. Consistency is key, so stick with it!

**2. Are the ingredients safe?**  
Yes, absolutely. The formula uses natural, plant-based ingredients that have been scientifically studied for their health benefits. There are no harsh chemicals or synthetic fillers. As always, if you have specific medical conditions or are on medication, it’s a good idea to consult your healthcare provider before starting any supplement.

**3. Can it replace my current diet or exercise routine?**  
No supplement is a magic bullet, and this one is no exception. What it does is enhance and complement a healthy lifestyle. Pairing it with balanced meals, regular physical activity, and proper hydration will amplify your results. That said, I noticed that it naturally curbed my cravings and made sticking to healthier habits much easier.

**4. Will it work for everyone?**  
While everyone’s body responds differently, the formula is designed to target the root causes of common metabolic issues, which means most people will benefit from it. Factors like your current health, lifestyle, and consistency with the supplement will play a role in your results.

**5. Are there side effects?**  
In my experience, I didn’t notice any side effects—only positive changes. Since it’s made from natural ingredients, the risk of adverse reactions is minimal. However, some people with allergies to specific herbs or spices should carefully check the ingredient list.

**6. How do I take it?**  
It’s simple and fits seamlessly into your day. Just follow the recommended dosage on the packaging, typically with a meal to enhance absorption.

**7. Is it a one-time fix?**  
Think of this as a long-term investment in your health rather than a short-term solution. While I experienced quick wins, the biggest benefit came from sustained use, allowing my body to fully adjust and maintain balance.

**8. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
Here’s the good news: there’s no risk in trying it. Most companies offering products like this provide a money-back guarantee. This gives you the peace of mind to see if it’s the right fit for you without any financial stress.

The Mcdonald's I work at is at a pretty ""busy"" location. In the morning, office workers will come by to get a coffee or quick breakfast. By lunch, construction workers come in. 

I only work morning-afternoon, and this is my first week of working at McDonalds so this is my first ever job.

After researching a bit and finding out about stations, I really like being at the fries station since it's really just standing there and waiting for timers. It's not much of a hassle overall, and I don't mind the heat that some seem to complain about. 

Other than that, I haven't gotten training on the grill, assembly line, or maintenance/dishwasher yet. (I'm 17, so I'm not sure if I can work those areas but if they already had me work around piping hot oil for fries then surely it'd be okay.)

I just don't like doing the front counter because I'm not good with taking orders. This may be because I didn't really get any training and was just shoved in during a breakfast rush hour (I don't know the breakfast menu, as I don't go to Mcdonald's often. So I had a hard time taking orders and differentiating the meals.) and after 2 days of working in that area I already don't like it much. 

One thing I've noticed is that there are usually 3 (including me) people in the front doing all sorts of multi-tasking. They will be making drinks, serving the ice cream, bagging meals, and running. On what I've read, there should be enough people for each task so that nobody has to go out of their way to do something else. So I'm constantly being thrown around in a busy environment with no clue how to make the drinks, since we're always in a rush. This leads to my coworkers having to explain to me how to make each drink in the middle of a rush while they're working on their own thing. 

This is only my first week, so I'm expecting that I'd eventually get trained in the other stations but I am quite nervous. Will my managers just keep me in the front? The kitchen has tons of people, DT is covered and maintenance only has like 2 people at the back.

I've heard stories of people being kept in a station they don't like working or are bad at but have to stay there because every station is filled out. Or that particular station is understaffed.

I would much rather prefer being in an area where I don't have to speak with a customer directly. Which is why I'm really hoping I'd stay on fries or do assembly or even maintenance. I feel like I'd be more productive and happier in those stations. Would it be okay for me to ask my manager despite it only being my first week?

I met her online few months ago from a post of a mutual friend. Out of curiosity I sent a dm, she responded and that's how it began. At first I wasn't really that attached, I just find her cute, then our convos got longer and longer day by day, we decided to go discord since it's much easier for calls also for playing games with her as well. 

From messaging video call became our most common way of communicating averaging calls of  4 hours a day during weekdays, 12-18 hours on weekends (usually just idling around while we do other stuff). 

We then go to coffee dates, malls, etc. Us having a lot in common especially anime and music means we never ran out of topic, she's also very clingy. 

One morning I overslept for 30 minutes from my usual alarm, I woked up to no exaggeration but 22 messages and 6 missed calls. I had to stay that morning for a while to comfort her and that I didn't leaved. 

From this moment onward I pretty much got attached, it started from being worried to becoming attached. I ignored all the signs and just continued as I was happy and comforted when I'm with her.

Then out of nowhere it all just ended, I woke and all the messages are gone, I'm blocked and that's the end of it. 

It fucking destroyed me, weight and appetite lost, work performance, even my family was worried. Those 3 months was the happiest I've ever been, and yet the worsed next months after. 

It thought it was a joke at first, kinda like a stereotype. But I guess they're called Jirai Kei or ""Landmine girls"" for a reason. ",5,1732880162.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

1h2jvwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/1h2jvwu/eating_disorder_as_an_addiction/,Eating Disorder As An Addiction,"I jotted this down within my journal earlier, and I am curious to know others experiences, thoughts, or recommendations.

I feel like my eating disorder is an addiction. Right now I am in a bad relapse with my eating disorder. As I am working on final exams and projects for the end of the semester, I have found that coffee suppresses my appetite a bit too well...

I am now going back to days/a day without eating. I have been reading this book called ""Sick Enough"" (By Jennifer Gaudiani). It has a lot of information on recovery and the medical effects of eating disorders. As someone with anxiety, that has been quite scary for me for multiple reasons.

1 thing I feel like this book made me realize is that if I actually want to recover, I can't do it on my own. I would need help, like, medical, professional help. I currently don't have access to that and I won't for a bit.

But the other thing that concerns me if that if I were to have access, I am not sure if I would automatically pursue it.

As I was walking back from class this afternoon I realized something... that for me this eating disorder is an addiction. For example, I was feeling really bad yesterday. I kept saying to myself, ""Don't worry, I just gotta hold on until tomorrow (today) and l'll have a little meal."" Today comes and after I had my usual coffee I need to get to class and my hunger a bit disapated, I thought today ""What if... I could go another day? (Without eating)""

It's an addiction of willpower and accomplishment. When I show myself that I pulled through and have the strength and willpower to keep going, I feel validated. Worthy. Better about myself.

Not only that, but when I commit to this addiction of willpower, I get: weightloss. Something I've been wanting since I was a little girl (I was often bullied for my weight since childhood). It also results in me feeling safer in society. Me feeling appreciated in a world that has always invalidated me before.

I'm addicted. I keep relapsing, and I don't know if I can or even if I want to get out.

As with most addictions, they prove to be harmful. The thing is, addicts know that their behaviors can be/are detrimental to not only them but to those around them. But still, it is just so, so hard to stop. Especially if one needs medical help to stop.

I cried to myself last night over this. I said to myself ""I know this is not good for me... but I just. can't. stop.""

When it comes to this situation of an eating disorder being an addiction, I don't know how to even begin tackling this. I have also been reading some self help books on trauma and healing lately, so I don't know if I need to address the addiction counterpart of this eating disorder first, the trauma part, the nutritional part... I'm not sure whether to treat this as an addiction or as an eating disorder. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences or thoughts? I feel really lost right now and I think talking some of it through might help.",5,1732880074.0,fuckeatingdisorders,4,1.0,False
1h2jvvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h2jvvb/looking_for_a_coffee_grinder_150/,Looking for a coffee grinder [<150€],"Hello,

  
I have just joined this subreddit as I am a new joiner of this hobbie. I have been using a nespresso machine (that is lasting a lot) for 9 years and I have decided to make the switch in 2025. I was waiting for my nespresso to break but this has not happened yet, so I'm doing it anyway.

  
Important to say, I am based in Spain, hence why my budget is in euros. I would like to spend around **125-150** (even less but I am aware that I would not be getting good coffees, in that case). I can stretch it a little bit, of course, in case to be worth it.

  
I have just bought a new coffee machine, the **Sage/Breville Bambino**, and now I am looking for the right coffee grinder. Few options I have found out:

* **Sage/Breville Dose Control Pro**: I can buy it at 126€. I have read in few places, including here that it is not a good option and there is better options for the same price
* **Baratza Encore ESP** at 175€. I have read that the plastic ring breaks quite easily, not sure if that is the portafilter holder, if so maybe is not a super deal breaker. Baratza Encore (no ESP) is meant to be a bit cheaper, I have read it performs not as well for espressos. Also I am struggling to find somewhere to buy it.
* **Delonghi Dedica**: KG521.M at 180€, KG520.M at 137€.
* **MiiCoffee PT1** Portable Electric Coffee Grinder MiiCoffee PT1 Portable Electric Coffee Grinder : seems to be a nice option as it works quite well, according to reviews on their website, and it comes at 58€ but it applies heavy shipping fees of 25€ (as being sent from US). From Amazon Spain it is at reasonable 60€ but right now out of stock and no news when it will be.
* **Zwilling Enfinigy** at 130€, I have read it is ok-ish for the price range, it has some faults, but you can get something decent
* There's a variety of grinders in the region of 60-140 in the biggest department store, and even more in Amazon.es. I am trying to review them and short list them. So far all I have checked could be discarded 



Open to anything else that I may have missed. 



Thank you all for your time!

1h2jvkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1h2jvkc/femboy_capitalism_a_revolution_in_thighhighs/,Femboy Capitalism: A Revolution in Thigh-Highs,"Femboy capitalism is not just an economic philosophy; it is the glorious fusion of elegance, efficiency, and unapologetic self-expression. It is a system where thigh-highs and balance sheets coexist in perfect harmony, where eyeliner is as sharp as our profit margins, and where the only thing softer than our skirts is our ability to dominate the marketplace with style.

In the world of femboy capitalism, we reject the dull monotony of outdated corporate culture. Gray suits and power ties? *Obsolete.* In their place, we bring skirts that flare like trumpets announcing revolution, stockings that whisper secrets of economic dominance, and boots that echo power in every boardroom.

  
The Tenets of Femboy Capitalism

	1.	Dress for Success, Redefine the Standard:

Why should ambition look boring? Our attire is not just fashion; it is a declaration of identity. We walk into every negotiation wearing thigh-highs that scream confidence and mascara that disarms even the shrewdest competitor. Femboy capitalism knows that looking good is step one to winning big.

	2.	The Grind, But Make It Cute:

Femboy capitalists hustle hard, but we do it with grace. We wield laptops like swords, type with nails painted in the colors of success, and sip iced coffee as if it’s the elixir of life. The 9-to-5 grind becomes a runway when you’re living your truth.

	3.	Luxury With a Purpose:

In the femboy capitalist economy, every dollar is a tool, every investment an act of self-love. We don’t just make money; we turn it into art. High-quality skirts, custom tailoring, premium makeup palettes—we invest in ourselves because we are the most valuable asset.

	4.	The Soft Power of Silk:

Femboy capitalism knows that power is not always loud. Sometimes, it’s the quiet confidence of a well-fitted outfit or the unspoken elegance of soft-spoken determination. We charm markets, disarm competitors, and win loyalty with the poise of silk wrapped in steel.

**The Femboy Marketplace**

The femboy capitalist marketplace is a wonder to behold. It’s a bustling utopia of creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs—all driven by the same ethos: *work hard, look good doing it, and lift others as you climb.*

Stockings and skirts are sold alongside stock portfolios. Eyeliner tutorials share space with investment strategies. It’s an economy of both beauty and brains, where aesthetic excellence and intellectual rigor are the ultimate currency.

**The Future Is Femboy**

Femboy capitalism is not a phase; it is the next stage of human evolution. It is a system that proves you can be soft and strong, fashionable and fierce, glamorous and grounded. It is the dawn of a world where the markets bow not to brute force, but to beauty, wit, and unrelenting self-belief.

We are femboys. We are capitalists. And we are unstoppable.

The future wears thigh-highs.

Lately it has been getting worse and painful. Need advice.","Hi all, in May 2024, I (30, M) was prescribed a combination of levofloxacin (250 mg) and flagyl to be taken twice a day for 10 days (This was to treat a H.Pylori infection which was not eradicated by the usual triple therapy). At the end of the first day (2 pills in), I started getting many symptoms of being floxxed (I was not aware of this before, but found out the night I was having all these symptoms - twitching of muscles, tingling feeling all over the body, cold sweats, sleeplessness, high heart rate, etc). The next morning, most of my symptoms had cleared but just had a stiff left ankle. I went to the doctor reporting my symptoms. He said it is uncommon to get a reaction to these pills but anyway advised me to stop these meds. I stopped them, and in a couple of days, the stiffness reduced. I felt almost normal (but felt slight stiffness when I walked barefoot but it never bothered me and no foot pain). Life carried on, I used to walk everyday for 30-60 mins and never had any problems.

Fast forward to August 2024. I started having slight heel pain (left foot) in the mornings when took my first 5-10 steps and it would clear up immediately and did not have any problem for the rest of the day. The ankle stiffness was still the same, barely noticeable but it was there. Since then the stiffness and pain progressively kept getting worse slowly but surely. Anytime I consult a doctor about this, they just do not admit that it is because of being floxxed. They just prescribe painkillers and suggest stretching exercises. And having read people's experiences here, I realised there is no point in seeking traditional medical help for this.

This last week (Nov 2024) has been very bad. I started having all symptoms of plantar fasciitis and I am not able to walk without limping anymore. In the morning, I have shooting pain in the heels, later, the pain moves to the sides of the heels. My achilles tendon never really pained, not even now. I am scared to do any stretching exercises. I have been eating healthy (except during vacations). And I just learned about how magnesium can help with recovery, so I started taking magnesium supplements (250 mg) on a daily basis. I know it is going to be largely a waiting game. But right now I am in a situation where I want to decide whether to keep moving around without straining my ankle too much or just get into bed rest and not walk apart from going to toilet and to take bath. It is a big decision to take and it can affect the lives of people around me because I do not know how many \*months\* it is going to be. I need advice from this community.

I do not drink alcohol, stopped coffee 2 years back when I started having stomach issues.

I wanted to be a clinical psychologist but have reflected a lot on what i want and i think i’m just realising that i just don’t think i could work in environments where i’m at risk of verbal and physical assault. Obviously working in mental health, i suppose it kind of comes with the territory.

I’m basically trying to work out whether the reality of working in mental health is something i could do. because i’ve worked as a hca in inpatient eating disorders for a couple years and i find this fine because the type of clients don’t typically present with aggression etc. i always get told by people that they would not recommend me to work on acute because i don’t have the right temperament for it because i am a quiet/calm person, and they’re right as i’m not a very assertive person and i would be very easily intimidated by someone who was threatening me or speaking to me in a certain way. If some man on a picu was making inappropriate comments to me and shouting at me i probably would cry not going to lie… and i’ve heard things from my local acute ward from bank staff who come and work on our ward, that really make me think god i could not handle that - like someone having an iron thrown and their head and they still have a scar, plates thrown at them, boiling coffee poured over them, ran at with a knife/screwdriver. i absolutely do not want to spend my life working in this kind of environment. and i know i could just stay away from acute, but i feel like that’s not right because even if i were to work in the community, at some point i may be working with people who were once in acute and i don’t like the idea that i would avoid working with certain people because i’m scared of them, and i’m selective about who i’m willing to work with and only work with those who don’t present in a certain way, as i don’t think that’s a great perspective of someone who is meant to be providing care for people and it’s quite  a judgemental attitude.


and i don’t think it’s unreasonable to not want to work in a place where i might be physically/verbally assaulted. i also don’t think i’m resilient enough to cope with that. i suppose i’m just asking, if i don’t want to work in these kind of environments then is working in mental health probably not for me realistically- or can you get better at dealing with it? because i guess maybe that just is a part of the job. 

i’m still only in my early twenties and i’m just trying to work out whether it’s realistic for me to work in mental health given these things that i don’t think i could manage and i don’t feel willing to put up with…or whether i should consider other careers…

i don’t know if maybe i just need better social support or coping mechanisms and maybe i’m just a bit immature and need to develop thicker skin and toughen up, but i just don’t think i would want to live my life constantly being exposed to threats and abuse. But maybe over time i would be able to deal with it better, idk. it’s just a shame because i do love psychology and i’m no where near as interested in anything else, it’s just maybe i’m not cut out for the reality of what it means to work in mental health.",2,1732879722.0,ClinicalPsychologyUK,1,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waste management is crucial for a clean environment and a sustainable future. Many people often wonder what the most effective natural methods for waste management are. Implementing these methods can help you reduce waste, conserve resources, and protect the planet. Below are some practical strategies you can start using today to manage waste naturally.

###  Composting: Transforming Waste into Resources

Composting is one of the most efficient natural methods for waste management. This process involves recycling organic materials, such as food scraps and yard waste, into valuable compost that can enrich your garden. Here’s how to get started:

- **Choose the Right Location:** Select a dry, shaded spot in your yard for your compost pile or bin.
- **Add Green and Brown Materials:** Mix green materials (like vegetable scraps and grass clippings) with brown materials (like dried leaves and cardboard) to create a balanced compost.
- **Aerate the Pile:** Turn your compost every few weeks to introduce oxygen. This speeds up the decomposition process.
- **Monitor Moisture Levels:** Keep the compost pile moist but not too wet. Aim for a sponge-like consistency.

Once your compost is ready, you can use it to nourish your plants, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

### Recycling: A Simple Step Towards Sustainability

Recycling is another natural waste management method that can significantly decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills. Here are some tips to effectively recycle:

- **Know Your Local Recycling Policies:** Different areas have varied recycling rules. Familiarize yourself with what materials are accepted.
- **Sort Your Waste:** Create separate bins for paper, plastics, metals, and glass to make recycling easy and efficient.
- **Clean and Prepare Items:** Rinse out food containers and remove labels where possible before placing them in recycling bins.

Recycling not only reduces waste but also conserves natural resources. Every item recycled is a step towards a greener planet.

### Reducing Single-Use Products: Make a Conscious Choice

Another effective method of natural waste management is reducing the use of single-use products. By making simple changes in your daily habits, you can significantly lower the quantity of waste produced. Consider these strategies:

- **Use Reusable Bags:** When shopping, bring your reusable bags to avoid using plastic bags.
- **Opt for Reusable Containers:** Store food in glass or metal containers instead of plastic wrap or aluminum foil.
- **Invest in Reusable Straws and Utensils:** Carry stainless steel or bamboo straws and utensils to eliminate disposable plastic ones.

By choosing reusable options, you help decrease the demand for single-use items, which are a major contributor to waste.

### Community Clean-Up Events: Engage and Inspire

Participating in or organizing community clean-up events can be a fun and effective way to manage waste naturally. These events raise awareness and encourage others to take action. Here’s how you can help:

- **Join Local Groups:** Many communities have organizations focused on keeping areas clean. Joining them amplifies your impact.
- **Host Your Own Event:** Gather friends and family and choose a location that needs cleaning, making it a community affair.
- **Educate Others:** Share tips and information on waste management during these events to inspire positive change.

Through collective efforts, communities can significantly reduce litter and promote a culture of responsibility towards waste.

### Empowering Yourself: Educate and Advocate

To maximize your impact on waste management, educate yourself about environmental issues and advocate for better waste management practices in your community. Here are a few ways to do this:

- **Attend Workshops:** Participate in local workshops about waste reduction and sustainable practices.
- **Support Green Policies:** Advocate for policies that promote recycling, composting, and waste reduction within your community.
- **Share Your Knowledge:** Discuss what you learn with friends and family to create a ripple effect of awareness and action.

By taking these natural approaches to waste management, you not only contribute to a healthier planet but also inspire others to follow suit. Each small change adds up to make a significant impact. Start implementing these effective methods today for a cleaner, greener future.

The Benefits of Composting: Transforming Waste into Valuable Resources
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Composting is an excellent way to manage waste while enriching the soil. This process of breaking down organic materials has numerous benefits, making it a valuable practice for individuals and communities alike. By transforming kitchen scraps and yard debris into nutrient-rich compost, you can not only reduce waste but also enhance your gardening efforts and contribute positively to the environment.

### Understanding Composting

Composting is the natural process of decomposing organic matter. It involves microorganisms breaking down food scraps, leaves, grass clippings, and other biodegradable materials. When these materials decompose, they create a dark, crumbly substance known as compost.

### Key Benefits of Composting

There are several key benefits associated with composting that make it an appealing choice for waste management:

- **Reducing Waste:** Composting significantly decreases the amount of waste sent to landfills. Approximately 30% of the waste in landfills is organic material. By composting, you divert this waste from landfills, thus minimizing overall waste production.
- **Enhancing Soil Quality:** Compost is a fantastic natural fertilizer. It improves soil structure, texture, and aeration. When you mix compost into the soil, it provides essential nutrients for plants, helping them to thrive.
- **Retaining Moisture:** Adding compost to your garden soil helps retain moisture. It reduces the need for frequent watering, which is beneficial in areas with water scarcity. This property of compost also supports plant health and growth.
- **Reducing Chemical Use:** By using compost, you can limit the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Compost naturally enhances soil fertility and deters certain pests, creating a healthier garden for both plants and beneficial insects.
- **Supporting Biodiversity:** Composting encourages a diverse range of soil organisms. These organisms contribute to a healthy ecosystem, promoting the decomposition of organic material and the cycling of nutrients.

### How to Start Composting

Getting started with composting is easier than you might think. Here are some simple steps to create your compost pile:

1. **Choose a Location:** Find a dry, shaded spot in your yard, or use a compost bin if you prefer a neater appearance.
2. **Gather Materials:** Collect organic materials, including:

- Fruit and vegetable scraps
- Coffee grounds and filters
- Eggshells
- Grass clippings
- Dry leaves
- Small branches and twigs
 
35. **Avoid Certain Items:** Do not include meat, dairy, or oily foods, as they can attract pests and create odors.
36. **Layering:** Build your compost pile by layering green materials (nitrogen-rich) and brown materials (carbon-rich) to maintain balance.
37. **Turning the Pile:** Every few weeks, use a pitchfork or shovel to turn your compost pile. This aerates the pile and speeds up the decomposition process.
38. **Monitor Moisture:** Keep your compost moist but not soggy. If it’s too dry, add some water; if it’s too wet, add dry leaves or straw.
### Using Finished Compost

After a few months, your compost will be dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling. This indicates that it’s ready to use. Here are some effective ways to incorporate compost into your gardening or landscaping:

- **Mix with Garden Soil:** Blend compost into your garden beds before planting to enrich the soil.
- **Top Dressing:** Spread compost on top of your established plants to provide ongoing nutrients throughout the growing season.
- **Potting Mix:** Use compost as part of your potting mix to improve drainage and provide nutrients to potted plants.

By adopting composting as a waste management practice, you not only contribute to environmental sustainability but also create a thriving ecosystem in your backyard. Embrace the concept of transforming waste into valuable resources and watch your garden flourish!

### Conclusion

Embracing effective natural methods for waste management is more than just a responsibility; it's a lifestyle change that benefits both you and the environment. By implementing strategies such as composting, you can significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills while simultaneously contributing to healthier soil and vibrant plant life. Composting not only transforms organic waste into valuable resources but also encourages a more sustainable cycle of consumption.

When you start composting, you're not just getting rid of kitchen scraps; you're nurturing the earth. This process enriches the soil, boosts plant growth, and minimizes the need for harmful chemical fertilizers. It’s a simple, rewarding practice that anyone can adopt. Additionally, it helps you become more mindful of the waste you produce, leading to further sustainable habits, like reducing plastic and recycling actively.

1h2jfws,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h2jfws/messy_breakup_long_drama_story/,Messy breakup - long drama story,"Kinda scared what people on here think but here it goes. This is very long and it's more therapeutic than anything but I'd like to hear people's response if they had time to read. 

So I met someone on tinder while I was going to college and it was pretty casual at first. She lived about a 45 min drive away, I was going to school, she worked and has her own house so eventually I was staying there for a weekend or a week at a time and it seemed like it was going somewhere. I  was really starting to fall for her but she would blatantly talk about her ex and would consistently text other guys. Of course I saw this as a red flag and pulled back, but she assured me that it was nothing and she wanted to be with me. So foolishly I trusted her. 

A few months go by and she ended up getting pregnant. I was still in school for another year, and with limited opportunities for work in the area it was going to be tough making things work but I loved her and I wanted to do the right thing and keep the relationship going and be a father. I was already spending a lot of time with her at her house and I wanted to help her during pregnancy and be close so I discussed moving in with her. (Probably looks like a red flag on my part) She didn't want me to pay to live there, but I still gave her money. In her words, she just didn't want me to have claim to her house, which is fine, I wouldn't do anything like that anyways.

I think our relationship was the best during that time, we loved eachother, supported eachother, it just seemed great. But there was a feeling like the relationship was a bit forced because we were going to have a child together. 

About 9 months after our daughter was born is when things started getting bad. I finished school and started a contract job right after, while she was on maternity leave. I think we were both getting burnt out and stressed, arguments started over petty things. Well, the one day we made plans to get family photos done, and we were running late. She insisted on driving but she's always been a speeder and I thought she'd be a bit reckless with our daughter in the car, so I drove instead. We ended up being too late and missed our time. She was PISSED. Started to blame me for not driving fast enough or passing vehicles. I couldn't calm her down and I felt I had to defend myself so we argued the whole way back. While driving back she told me she wanted to break up over it.. I thought it was ridiculous, I couldn't take her seriously. But I begged her not to do that to us. She calmed down eventually, but that was our first big fight. Things were never the same after that. Any disagreements led to arguments and threats of breaking up and kicking me out. But then when I had enough and started to make plans to leave, she would make me feel like I was abandoning them and reel me back in. 

It probably would have been better if I left during that time for both of us but I loved her and I wanted to be there for my daughter and didn't want to miss out on being there watching her grow up. I did that for about a year until my contract ended.

 She returned to work, and I was looking for work. One day last summer, after interviews and I found out I didn't get a job I was applying for, she came home and was mad that I hadn't done more around the house. She threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave so I left. I stayed at my grandparents for about a week until she wanted me to come back. I told her that if I'm coming back we need to work on things, I could have been doing more, showing more love and appreciation and I wanted her to work on her communication and not overreact. The whole situation was starting to break me at this point. I felt like anything I did wasn't good enough. And it was starting to take a toll on my mental health. I started to distance myself, cared less about personal care, sleepless nights, always walking on eggshells around her so she didn't get mad. I didn't know what to do anymore but I was still blamed for not treating her special or loving her enough. 

I started working again a few weeks after going back that summer. We had some pretty good times, it wasn't all bad. I thought things were getting better again actually. But the job I had sucked. 10 hour days and an hour commute back and forth and it just wasn't fulfilling. At this point, her original red flags started to surface again. I would catch her texting another guy that was ""just a friend"" and it really started to bother me and she honestly enjoyed how jealous I was getting. Idk why I couldn't just leave but I felt stuck, I just had to put up with it. That's when she started to tell me she fell out of love and she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. There wasn't anything I could do, I tried but there wasn't much reciprocation and I was starting to feel the same. 

We still did things as a family, and we slept together, had sex but it wasn't the same anymore. I still wanted to be with her and I loved her but it was a rollercoaster of highs and lows of her loving me back and then being angry or rude. She would accuse me cheating, disapprove of the clothes I wear, make fun of my body or appearance, and challenge me on parenting. She would embarrass me by making videos of me and send them to her new friend. She enjoyed making me mad and upset.

I decided to take another job this past April that was more in the field of what I went to school for. However, it required me to travel and be gone Monday to Friday. We both thought it might help our relationship at the time, giving us some time apart. It didn't. We were on undetermined terms at that point, I wasnt sure if we were together or broken up but she wasn't threatening to kick me out again so I thought we were still together.

Anyways, I planned a trip away for a weekend just the 2 of us and I saw it as a chance to rekindle our love for eachother. We had a great time, and I thought we would return home stronger. We talked about my plans for work after the summer was over and I brought up maybe I could return to university using a transfer agreement with my college diploma I could continue school and have a better chance at getting a better paying, full time job. Obviously I would need her support on that decision and she agreed. Then on the ride home another petty argument over the GPS ruined an entire weekend. And it seemed to have not changed anything and solidified that we were still no longer together.

I still continued my plans to return to school and was attending for a couple weeks. Then one day on my way to school, I saw them together. It almost seemed planned. I always grab a coffee on my way out of the village and there they were. She had been talking to this guy for the past year, that was on house arrest for domestic violence, having some sort of fantasy relationship with him. I was shocked and avoided confronting her and just drove away. But I texted her and she confessed and said she saw me and contemplated on kissing him in front of me. That broke me. I was done. I went back and started packing my shit, not knowing what I was going to do or where I was going, I was angry. And she was so unfazed by it all. I don't know why I was so surprised but I just couldn't believe it. I had to drop out, wasted my money, and I started looking for a job. 

I stayed at my aunt's house a couple hours away. For a few days she would text me asking me where I was and if I was coming back. She didn't really care where I was, she just wanted to know if I told my family what happened because she didn't want to look bad. This is when I really started to get toxic. I wanted revenge for how she treated me. It was the only thing I thought I could do that I knew would piss her off or be mad about. Her friggin monopoly go account she was using under my Facebook account. It seemed harmless. I logged on and used up everything she was saving. She spends so much time on that game, I felt it even impacted our relationship. Well, that did not help. She was so mad she started threatening to not allow me to see my daughter anymore and I'd have to take her to court. I have all the text messages. Over a stupid game. (No offense to anyone that plays)

It killed me. I thought I was losing my daughter now too. I stopped eating, stopped sleeping. Begged her not to do that to her, I'm a good dad, I want to be in her life and support her, I love her.  

That's when she felt the control, she could use that against me and I'd have to abide by her rules now. I became depressed. This was about 2 months ago. 

The loss of the relationship started to get to me. I felt free at first but after a week or so I felt so lost without her and it was sinking in that this was the end. I cried, I begged her to take me back, I felt weak and had no control. She didn't budge. 

I had to go back. I was missing my daughter and I had an interview for a job in the area. Beginning of October I found a room for rent at a house not too far from them, where I currently stay now. This is when I started to read up on no contact. So that's what I did. Stopped pursuing her and just focused on being there for my daughter. The day I came back to the area and moved in, I wanted to spend some time with my daughter and it worked for her because she was going out with a friend that evening. It was so great to see my daughter again, I took her out to eat and we played at the playground, finally some joy again. 

I brought her back home and we played in my daughter's bedroom while we waited for my ex to return. When she returned, she was nicer than I expected. I tried to avoid conversation and not let her get in my head. But that's what she did. She knew she could have her way with me. 3 weeks with no sex for either of us it was hard to say no. She said she missed me, and when she came home everyday she expected to see my car there. She saw I was still upset about everything so she was testing me, touching me and kissing me, I fell for it all. Then the discard. In the morning, she wanted me gone again. It was like breaking up all over again. I was pissed at myself for letting it happen, I felt used. 

Then she calls me the next night. She was upset because she told her pen pal fantasy boyfriend that we had sex and he didn't want to talk to her anymore. I really don't understand their relationship, literally all over the phone and shes obsessed with him. Only ever saw him a few times with his surrity with him. There's really nothing great about him, he just seems vulnerable because of his situation. Acussed of beating his baby momma after she cheated on him and now he doesn't get to see his kid. It's honestly pretty psycho. But all I could think was yes it's over! 
That lasted a day. 

But she still wanted sex. We had talked about having another baby for a while, and she still wanted me to get her pregnant again so she could take more time off work. Her exact words not mine. I knew it wouldn't be good for me. But with my will to say no and my non-existent self esteem I did it anyways. Not to get her pregnant but I thought it would make her want me again. It was foolish. And it made it worse on myself so I avoided seeing her.

The following weekend I took my daughter to see family and we had fun. Played lots and I took her fishing for the first time. It was great. 

A couple days go by and she calls me late asking me to come over. I couldn't do it, I had to say no if I wanted to restore any dignity. She sounded upset and I didn't know why but I felt bad for her. 

I felt something had happened between them again. So the next morning I bought some flowers and left them by her front door for her. I'm dumb and desperate, I know. I didn't even do it expecting anything to happen out of it and when she asked about it I told her that they were from me and I just wanted to surprise her and make her smile. I'm an idiot.  

Well, that night, while I'm video calling my daughter she decides she has to tell me why she was so sad. I thought it was inappropriate to make it about her while I just wanted to see my daughter and said if it doesn't have anything to do with me than no I don't want to know. She tells me anyways. The guy she was so obsessed about being with wasn't talking to her again because the weekend prior while I had my daughter, she had met someone from the bar, brought him home and slept with him. I was devastated. It was one thing that she was talking to someone else but now she actually slept with someone. Then she has the nerve to tell me about it. 
Then the manipulation started to be apparent. I just started watching videos on narcs and attachment style theory and it was starting to make sense to me. 

I don't remember what was said, my ex was talking to my daughter and was like oh daddy's sad I think he wants a hug. And it was just too hard to focus anymore. Then she told her to ask if I wanted to come over and I remember that. So I said ""you're sayong it's okay to come there right now"" and she said she didn't care. So I went there. Idk what for, I didn't know what I was going to say but honestly with how she was treating me, the threats and psychological shitnshenwas doing to me and now my daughter I wanted to start documenting our interactions. So I went there and recorded our whole conversation. A lot of it is just me trying to understand why she's acting like this. Like she was finally showing me her true self and wasn't holding back. She got under my skin, and she knew how to do that. Gaslighting, undermining our relationship, and her ego was really showing, she admitted she just likes to have control over people. Then she still wanted to have sex with me to get her pregnant, I was disgusted said a few insulting things to her and left mad. 

I wanted to figure out how to get back at her. She still wanted house arrest guy but she told me that night that she doesn't want a relationship with him. Just sex and to be with her so she's not alone. So I found his social media and started talking to him and how crazy she is but he was already finding that out. My mistake was telling her. Because then she blamed me for sabotaging her thing with him when she had already done that. So she was threatening not to let me see my daughter again. But they were done.  Down to one guy. 

The following weekend I was duck hunting with her uncle and when I came back I had to go see her. She blocked me on everything. She wouldn't talk to me at first. Shewed our daughter out the door and we played outside for a bit. At some point she wanted to go back in. And while the door was open I told her she's not going to look good with all these messages and the recording of our conversation. Told her I'll get a lawyer and spend all my savings to take her to court if that's what it takes but you'll have to pay for one too. And she folded. Oh I would never actually do that she says. You think I would do that?  Ughh

She insisted on seeing the messages between me and her house arrest friend ""to get over him"". I was hesitant but agreed. Then it was like a switch, suddenly she wanted me back. ""Come lay with me"" ""come spend the day with me"" ""move back in"".  And at this point I think I'm becoming a masochist of some sort because I agreed and fell for it. We spent the day together and it felt like normal again. Like we were actually together again. But there was a silence between us. And I thought wow is this What I really want? How do we recover from this and be able to talk like we're friends again? It was hard. On the way home she wanted to read the texts again and I should have just deleted them. She went from social media messages and then started looking at text messages. And I thought oh shit there is more I didn't show her before. There were a few insults about her in there from both parties and I tried to warn her. I said it because I was upset and a bit drunk that night I was messaging him. I didn't mean it. But that wasn't enough, she was done once again. We went back to no contact again after that for about a week. I went up visit my brother. 

While I was up there, I would still video call my daughter every night. But I would avoid talking to my ex, even when she sent me messages. She went to a Halloween dance and was sending me pictures of her night and ""what I'm missing out on"". Very manipulative, looking for a reaction. 

I had changed my a profile picture and she unblocked me, sent me a friend request and messaged me ""nice pic"". When I ignored that I got ""I compliment you and you ignore me"". Still trying to get a reaction. Then she sent a post about a concert next summer. And I was like okay what's this about. ""So you know when to watch your daughter because I'm going 100%"". But that's not how this works right? How can I agree to something 8 months from now when idk if I even could. That's when I suggested a schedule of some sort. Every other weekend and visits during the week, 50/50 or something. She lost it. Guilt tripping me because I can't agree to watch her when it's convenient for her so I got uninvited to trick-or-treating this year. She was always bad at guilt tripping me. I called her out for it all the time. The biggest guilt trip was that I walked out on her, like I had a choice, like she didn't threaten to kick me out constantly and wanted me to leave. She said I could have stayed and continued going to school until house arrest guy came to move in. Sickening. 

This month has been a mess. She found out I was talking to someone new. We met on Facebook dating and it turned more into a friendship bond over narc ex's. But my ex found out by snooping my phone while I was asleep. I was watching my daughter at her house while she was at a concert. That pissed her off because she saw all the messages I sent about her. Screenshots of her messages too. Ya that was bad. But the jealousy, holy. She expects me to sit around and be miserable while she fucks bar guy once a week, and still calls me over on the other nights. Drives me crazy. It's not even like I've met this other woman but she compares that to her sleeping with someone else. I can't have both lol.. 

One night I was there and she was saying it was done between them. And I watched her say bye and block him. So convincingly. ""Okay your turn"". I believed her (I'm so gullible and naive, I know). So I blocked the person I was talking to. Well that lasted a day. My ex was talking to bar guy again. And it pissed me off because in the morning she had kissed me goodbye said ""I love you"" and brought me a coffee before she went to work. 

This push and pull had driven me crazy. I'm getting discarded over and over again. And I can't stop going back. I'm addicted. And when I'm not with her I can't stop thinking about her with him. It's torture. She's told me about this guy enough. Guy split up with his baby's momma because she cheated on him for one of his friends, he was suicidal at some point or something, on meds he doesn't take. Not someone I want in the same house as my daughter. I already convinced one guy to leave her alone, so why not try again? I know I'm being toxic, and I've even considered I'm even thinking I might be narcissistic myself. But I'm hurt, I need this to end and I'm not going to be the one that walks away. 

So I find him on social media. Message him. No response. But he tells her about it. And then I'm the crazy one. I admit, it doesn't look good, but I feel like it's pretty rational for what I've been out through. I tried doing this twice this month after being discarded. Nothing happens. I think to myself: how can a guy that's been through what he's been through do this to other guy? How can he play a part in it? Says a lot about his character. So I start thinking that maybe he's the cheater. So the other day I found his baby momma on social media. I send her a message to tell her what he's been up to. She responds. She tells me that they've been split up for about 2 months, and he was cheating on her first but they both cheat but he's there every day begging her to take him back, it was very confusing lol. I didn't know what I expected to happen. But she did offer to try to help get him to stop talking to her. Idk what she said but it worked. He knew it was me and my ex lost it on me. Now he wanted to talk to me. We had a civil conversation on the phone and we agreed to leave eachother alone. But my ex was sooo pissed. Don't recommend. I took all her supply away and I triggered narcissistic collapse. I've never even seen her cry before the other night. She has said some shit to make me feel bad before but this was evil escaping. She turned physical and kicked me the chest a few times. She threatened suicide too. It was so bad, I never expected that. I didn't even do it to hurt her, I did it to try to get back at him. I honestly felt terrible. But there was nothing I could do. She screamed at me to leave so I left. 

She has been talking to house arrest guy again lately though so I think she'll be alright. 

She has completely ignored any attempt for me to try to talk to her. But she still let me video call my daughter for over an hour. Longest one yet. And I'm supposed to have my daughter over Saturday so she can go to bar again. She's been planning a pub crawl with her cousins for weeks now. I'm guessing she's going to have a new victim or 2 after Saturday. 

Lessons I'm trying to learn: 

1. Don't react, be the bigger person, don't act immature to immature behavior 
2. Go no contact or go crazy 
3. Don't fight fire with fire against a narc
4. Avoid causing narcissistic collapse 
5. Just move on. She's not going to change.

I’ve built a successful business, successful investments, and worked my way up from nothing, but I understand how overwhelming it can be when you’re just starting out or maybe even feeling a bit lost in life.

I travel a lot for work, so I mostly prefer connecting online, but there may be chances for us to meet up for coffee or dinner if our paths happen to cross. What I’m really looking for is someone in the 18-24 age range who is just starting out on their own and might need guidance, someone who just wants a listening ear, or even someone who feels a bit lost and wants to talk things through with someone older for a different perspective.

Personally, I feel I connect better with females. Conversations tend to feel more natural for me, and I find it easier to build friendships without any awkwardness.

If you’re just trying to figure things out — whether it’s about finances, relationships, work, or just life in general — I’d be happy to offer advice or just listen. I’ve been through a lot, and I’m happy to share what I’ve learned. Maybe you need help making a big decision, like buying your first car or navigating a tough situation. I can be there for that too.

I’m not looking for anything romantic. Just someone who could benefit from an open, non-judgmental conversation with someone who’s been around a little longer and can offer some insight. If that sounds like it could help, feel free to reach out. I’d love to chat and see if we can work together to make life a little easier for you.

He then proceeds to ask if I was cheating on him (he does this every day) I confirm I am not cheating and I have no desire to cheat.
This isn't even the first time I've caught him doing this, he's been doing this quite alot over the last few weeks and it's making me VERY uncomfortable. I feel like I have no privacy... 

It does make me wonder if he actually unlocks my phone when I'm away from my phone for longer e.g. in the shower, and goes through whole conversations?

1h2j6di,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2j6di,"AIO My ex of 8 years accused me of doing meth, then said he knew I wasn't and was committed for life, then dumped me less than a week later, slept with me thw night after and I caught him cheating cheating thw next day. ","Okay,  bare with me, folks , this is lot. I smoke cbd isolates when im under a lot of stress, it helps with anxiety  and helped me to quit smoking  cigarettes. One in a while I misplace my CBD pipe (actually dab pipe) and MacGyver a piece of tin foil into a pipe. (that fact will make sense soon.)  Well, in April my boyfriend (m39) convinced me to quit my job, cash out half of my retirement and take a year off. This was a big big decision. I loved my job and made good money, but the environment was toxic and we worked together. I was legit depressed for like 3 months. Then in July, my close friend died suddenly, this was hard. She was an amazing human and we had big business plans for next year. This was hard  I'm still not completely over it. Then comes September and it's time to take my first born son to trade school in a major city in the lower 48, after raising him on a rural island in Alaska. He is also on the spectrum.  Let me tell you all,  I was definately smoking some cbd. After coming home from that trip,  I was ready to clear my head, work through all of this sadness  and anxiety, and start in on a few projects.  One of which was to finally begin forging 5 matching damascus hunting knives, with warthog tusk and water Buffalo horn handles.  (We all used to watch forged in fire and I wanted to be  bad ass mom and gf) 1 knife for each of thw men in my life,  my bf, his 2 sons, and my 2 sons. The guy who owns the knife shop was teaching me how to forget and little by little over the last year,  I had gathered all the supplies. So now comes October. I'm working on a mural project and occasionally going to the shop to get some forging time in. (I ended up choosing to add copper into the center of the blades because that's one of my exes favorite esthetics.) One day, he takes his youngest son (age 11) to his mom's house and the playfully calls me into the bedroom, I was just getting ready to finally clean out my sons room who  was in trade school. I went into the bedroom where he was and this dude slammed the door and began  screaming at me. ""You need to come clean, I know you've been doing hard drugs the whole time we've been together, you're a liar! You hide things!"" And it went on.... it was brutal. And it pissed me off. I looked him right in the face and asked him wtf he was talking about. He said he found burnt foil in the garbage. I explained what it was. He still freaked out and told me how he asked reddit and everyone said it looked like drugs, he said all the people he showed the pictures to said the same. He even discussed this with my friends... WTF?!  He tested the foil, it came back negative. He found and tested a broken pen, negative. He tested the mortar that I used to crush a Sudafed to add to my tea, and that came back positive, but it was pseudo ephedrine, so I wasn't suprised, I can't take my prescribed aderall and my allergy meds at the same time. So I crush my allergy meds and put it in my tea or coffee. ... this was like a lottery ticket for him. I asked him, ""we spend every night together,  we cook together, we eat together,  we watch TV with the kids together and we go to bed together. Don't you think you would know if I was in drugs?"" His reply was ""not everyone is effected the same"" then he explained that his mom had a meth problem when he was in high-school and he never knew. ~ding ding, projecting~ at this point I was seriously  insulted,  I didn't even want to look at him. I mean, I'm thick,  I have great skin, all my teeth and would probably have a heart attack if I did meth. So, a day later he tells me that he knows I'm not on drugs and that he's in it for life,  he's pushed his chips to middle and he loves me. A few days after that he finds my cbd pipe, and it's the same ordeal except this time he's leaving, he's done. The day after,  a friend sys he's sleeping in my car in a local parking  lot , i go tell him he doesnt have to do that,  he  legit breaks down, crying and shouting ""i hate myself, Im a piece of shit ) i calm him down, he comes home, crawls into bed with me, and the next day i catch him (in the act ) with another woman. He followed me home and tried to tell me that it wasn't what it looked like.then he left for work. I rollwd a joint, went back to her house, ebraced her and told her it wasnt her fault that i didnt blame her. We smoked that joint, compared timelines, read eachothers message streams and cried, he had lied to us both, he wasnt just cheating, he was building a whole new relationship. He made me out to be some druggie monster. Come to find out, this is his MO. He's cheated on his 1st with the 2nd, the 2nd with the 3rd, the 3rd with me, and then me with  my friend Then , after 8 years,  he carries out a textbook narcissistic discard.... my best friend and lover, my entire world. ..now hes talking sh!t about me around town, and angry that I won't give him space because I text him every day wanting him to take accountability, go to therapy and make peace. He acts like a completeky different person. talks down to me and says he doesn't know if he can forgive or be my friend.  I am about to lose my patience. He leaves something behind everytime he gets his stuff,  do I just block him? And throw the rest of his stuff on curb?

Well we survived the holiday, and hopefully everyone has at least a relaxing day or slow day at work. Not exactly sure why I'm up so early, but it is the morning so might as well have some coffee while I wait for the sun to come up. I do love relaxing cup of coffee in the morning.
Anyway, figured it was a good luck to pop on us up for a little bit of chit chat. Doesn't matter who you are where you're from, as long as you're an adult. Any kind of conversation is fine as well from very specific topics to just shoot in the breeze about our days.
Myself, my interests are reading, tv, and movies, mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and horror. Love being outdoors, especially now that it's cooler. The hot weather is not my jam. Also learning to play all sorts of instruments, I know a bit late in life but whatever.

1h2j3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1h2j3ac/i_dont_have_a_best_friend/,I dont have a best friend ,"This is a story of solitude and peace. Somehow i managed to lose my best friend in my late 20s. The best is additional, because we fought a lot. And it took me a lot time to realize: we don‘t have to. Just because at some point we decided that we were best friends, didn‘t mean we were. We just had a lot of time on our hands and chose to spend a big chunk of it with eachother. Now, in retrospective, i can see the underlying codependency. That friendship shrunk me, i was insecure, resentful and uninspired. To be fair: she was the one, cutting me out first. She had her own reasons. I was hurt, but i stood my ground. I was proud of how i handled the situation. Very mature, no accusations. Just wishes and boundaries. I saw, that eventhough she‘s been my best friend for over 8 years, she never saw me for who i was. She didn‘t support me in my dreams, she didn‘t understand me, she underestemated me. And her words and validation hold weight, they meant the world at some point. 

Fast forward: we reconnected. We both know, we can‘t and shall never go back to the place we were. But we keep in touch, here and there a text, sometimes we meet for a coffee. It‘s nicer this way. 

I managed to make my own opinions, my own thoughts and my own judgement the most important to my life. It wasn‘t always like that. And that doesn‘t mean, i am not open to learn from people. It just means that my views are just as important and should be respected and considered. 

I do have some amazing friends in my life, who inspire me, who always treat me with kindness and hold good values. I feel full when we spend time together. Nothing feels „off“. None of them have the title of a „best friend“, they themselves have their title-persons already. And that‘s fine. But they show me what peacefulness means and i am thankful for that.

After that day, we spent much time together. 
Before I went back to my country, I said it’s better to be friends for us, although I also developed crush on you. 
Because I’m not poly but you are. 

We’ve kept in touch so far. 
However, you’re not longer into me.
I can feel.

You said I should had been transparent.  But I can’t. 
I know we are not in the same level of feeling to each other now, so I suppress myself. 
What I can do is remain current and not to express.
I think the main reason of my choice is fear toward unknown future.

1h2j2uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1h2j2uy/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I’m currently looking to upgrade my manual grinder, and I’m torn between the KINGrinder K6 and KINGrinder K2. My primary focus is on espresso shot

Here’s what I know so far:
	•	K6: Has a 48mm titanium-coated burr, offering more precise adjustments for espresso. Slightly more expensive.
	•	K2: 38mm burr, versatile across multiple brew methods, and is more budget-friendly.

For those of you who’ve used either (or both), which grinder would you recommend? Is the extra precision of the K6 worth the price bump if I’m primarily using it for espresso? Or should I go with the K2 for its versatility and affordability?

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or any other grinder recommendations!

Do you ever wonder why you hear so many stories about people having been presented the opportunity of Shib or Doge that then soon faded and jeeted right before the run up?

My $2000 went down to $1000 so I had to sell! if only I didnt it would have been worth 2.3mil!

Do you think these people would have sold if Shib went up in only a straight line?

\-----

The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.

An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.

It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.

Here in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.

I know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. ""I faded kendu, i could have had millions""

Buy the blood, reap the rewards

# So why $KENDU?

There is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs ""Chads"", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach.

We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.

Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU

https://preview.redd.it/ahw1yclmft3e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=0051cf90f0f245cf4ae90ae9f5c71829858f9c3a

We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.

This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.

We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

So, will you join the movement anon?

The infamous ""I think you’re too nice for me."" (What does that even mean?!)

Or when a date turned into a networking meeting because she wanted to collab on a project.


We’ve all been there, right?

But the wins? Oh, they’re worth it.

The first time I held a girl’s hand in public.

A second date that lasted 10 hours because we didn’t want it to end.

That random “I thought I’d try messaging you” that led to a relationship.


Let’s be real: queer dating is messy. But it’s also amazing. It’s finding people who get you. Sometimes they’re your future girlfriend. Sometimes they’re your platonic soulmate. Either way, the stories stick with you.

So, here’s what I want to know:

What’s the funniest/weirdest thing someone’s said to you on a date?

What’s your best first date idea?

What’s a queer dating win you’ll never forget?

Styling Tips for Incorporating Loveseat Recliners into Compact Living Areas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking to maximize comfort without losing style in your compact living area? Loveseat recliners are an excellent choice for small spaces. They offer relaxation and flexibility while being compact enough to fit neatly into your existing décor. Here are some styling tips to help you seamlessly incorporate loveseat recliners into your living area.

### Choose the Right Size

Before you pick a loveseat recliner, measure your space carefully. Ensure that it won’t overpower your room or block pathways. A well-chosen size can enhance your space rather than clutter it. Consider the dimensions of your loveseat recliner in relation to other furniture pieces, keeping a balanced look in mind.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/wall-hugger-loveseat-recliners-small-spaces  
  
### Select the Right Color and Fabric

Color plays a significant role in how furniture impacts a space. To make a small area feel larger, opt for lighter shades like cream, pale blue, or soft gray. These colors reflect light, creating an airy atmosphere. On the other hand, darker shades can add sophistication but may make the room feel cramped.

Additionally, the fabric you choose is crucial. Leather or sleek synthetic materials can provide a modern look, while fabrics like cotton or linen offer a cozy vibe. Make sure the fabric is also easy to clean since small spaces can often see a lot of traffic.

### Consider Functional Features

One of the main benefits of loveseat recliners is their functionality. Look for options with built-in storage, like cup holders or side pockets, to keep your living area tidy. Recliners with swivel bases can also offer added versatility, allowing you to face different directions based on your needs.

### Layer with Accessories

- **Pillows:** Add decorative pillows in varying sizes and shapes to enhance comfort and style. Choose colors that complement your recliner.
- **Throws:** A soft throw blanket draped over your loveseat recliner adds warmth and texture.
- **Rugs:** A well-placed rug can define the area around your loveseat recliner, creating a cozy nook.

### Utilize Vertical Space

When dealing with small living areas, think vertically. Install shelves above your loveseat recliner to display books, art, or plants. This draws the eye upward, making the space feel more expansive. You can also use wall-mounted lighting to highlight your loveseat and the surrounding decor.

### Create a Focal Point

Your loveseat recliner can be the star of your living area if styled correctly. Consider setting it against a statement wall with bold paint, wallpaper, or artwork. This will create visual interest and draw attention to your furniture piece.

### Think About Arrangement

The way you position your loveseat recliner can also influence the flow of your space. Here are some ideas to consider:

- Place your loveseat recliner across from a small coffee table for easy conversation.
- If you have a corner in your living area, use a corner loveseat recliner to maximize seating.
- Pair it with a slim console table behind the loveseat to create extra space for drinks or decor.

### Limit Additional Furniture

In small spaces, too much furniture can make the area feel cramped. Keep other seating minimal. One or two accent chairs can complement your loveseat recliner without overwhelming the room. Opt for pieces that can easily be moved if you need extra space for entertaining.

### Personalize Your Space

Add personal touches to make the area feel like home. Incorporate photographs, artwork, or items that are important to you. Whether it’s a cherished piece of art or a fun trinket, these details reflect your personality and make the space uniquely yours.

Styling your loveseat recliner within a compact living area doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By choosing the right size, color, fabric, and accessories, you can create a cozy and functional space that showcases your personal style. Remember to keep the arrangement thoughtful and avoid overcrowding, and your small space will become a charming retreat you can enjoy for years to come.

### Conclusion

Finding the perfect furniture for small spaces can be a daunting task, but wall hugger loveseat recliners provide an ideal solution. These clever designs not only maximize your seating options but also minimize the space you need to operate them. With their unique ability to recline while remaining close to the wall, they’re perfect for cozy apartments or compact living rooms. The benefits of these recliners extend beyond functionality, offering comfort and style in one package.

Loveseat recliners into your small area can enhance your space without overwhelming it. To achieve this, consider versatile styles that match your current decor. Use bold colors or patterns to make a statement, but also think about lighter hues for a more open feel. Accessorizing with decorative cushions or throws can soften the look while adding personality. Positioning your recliners strategically can help maintain flow within the room. For instance, placing one near a window creates a cozy reading nook, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics.

1h2izg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1h2izg7/portable_wifi_hotspots_for_travel_why_theyre_a/,Portable WiFi Hotspots for Travel: Why They’re a Must-Have,"Hey Reddit!  
If you’ve ever traveled and struggled with unreliable WiFi or expensive roaming fees, you’re not alone. I’ve been there too—constantly hopping between coffee shops for free WiFi, only to deal with slow speeds and security risks. That’s when I decided to invest in a **portable WiFi hotspot**. Spoiler: it’s been a total game-changer.

Let me walk you through why portable WiFi hotspots are a must for anyone who travels and why I personally recommend checking out the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**.

# What Is a Portable WiFi Hotspot?

A portable WiFi hotspot is a small device that creates a private WiFi network by connecting to cellular towers, similar to your phone. It’s like having your own pocket-sized router that you can take anywhere. It’s great for:

* Avoiding public WiFi networks (which are often unsafe).
* Saving your phone’s battery by not using it as a hotspot.
* Keeping all your devices connected at the same time.

I decided to try one for a few reasons: I travel a lot, work remotely, and need a reliable internet connection no matter where I am. After some research, I landed on the **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi**, which has been surprisingly reliable.

# Why I Chose MUAMA Ryoko WiFi

There are plenty of portable WiFi hotspots out there, but **Ryoko WiFi** stood out for a few reasons:

1. **Global Coverage**: It works in over **76 countries**, including most of North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. No more buying local SIM cards in every country I visit.
2. **Secure Connection**: Public WiFi networks are a goldmine for hackers. Ryoko creates a private, encrypted WiFi network, so I don’t have to worry about data theft.
3. **Multiple Device Support**: It connects up to **8 devices**, so I can stay online with my laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously.

If you want to learn more about the device and its coverage, check this out: [**Details on Ryoko WiFi**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

# How It’s Helped Me While Traveling

I’ve used the **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi** on several trips, both locally and internationally. Here’s how it’s made my life easier:

# Reliable Internet Anywhere

Whether I’m on a train in Europe or camping in a remote location, Ryoko connects to the nearest 4G LTE tower. Speeds are impressive (up to **150 Mbps**) in most areas. It’s perfect for streaming, video calls, and even online gaming.

# Saves Money on Roaming Fees

Before getting Ryoko, I racked up hundreds of dollars in roaming fees on international trips. Now, I just top up the included SIM card or use a local one, and I’m good to go.

# Long Battery Life

The battery lasts for **12-15 hours**, which means I can stay connected throughout the day without needing to recharge. Compare that to my phone’s hotspot, which dies in 3-4 hours.

# Great for Groups

On a recent road trip, my friends and I used Ryoko to keep all our devices connected. With support for 8 devices, everyone could stream, browse, and post on social media without any issues.

# How to Use Ryoko WiFi

The setup process is super simple:

1. **Turn it on** using the power button.
2. **Connect your device** by scanning a QR code or entering the network details manually.
3. Start browsing on your own private, secure network.

Even if you’re not tech-savvy, setting up **Ryoko portable WiFi** is a breeze.

# What Are the Downsides?

While I’m a fan, there are a couple of minor drawbacks to keep in mind:

* **Initial Data Limit**: The included SIM card only comes with **500MB of free data**, so you’ll need to top it up for extended use.
* **No Built-In Display**: There’s no screen to show signal strength or data usage. You’ll need to check these through an app or browser.

That said, these issues haven’t been deal-breakers for me. The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

# Who Should Get a Portable WiFi Hotspot?

If you’re considering a portable WiFi hotspot, here’s who it’s great for:

* **Frequent Travelers**: Avoid public WiFi and save on international roaming fees.
* **Remote Workers**: Reliable internet for work, even in remote locations.
* **Families**: Share a single connection with multiple devices during trips.
* **Students**: Perfect for studying in libraries or cafes with bad WiFi.

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?

In my experience, having a **portable WiFi hotspot** has been a game-changer for travel and work. It’s given me the freedom to stay connected wherever I am, without relying on sketchy public networks or draining my phone battery.

The **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi** is one of the better options I’ve tried. It’s easy to use, works in multiple countries, and provides a secure and stable connection. If you travel often or need a reliable backup for internet access, I’d definitely recommend giving it a shot.

What about you? Have you used a portable WiFi device before? Would you consider trying one? Let me know—I’d love to hear your thoughts!",1,1732876270.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

My $2000 went down to $1000 so I had to sell! if only I didnt it would have been worth 2.3mil!

Do you think these people would have sold if Shib went up in only a straight line?

The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.

An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.

It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.

Here in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.

I know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. ""I faded kendu, i could have had millions""

# So why $KENDU?

There is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs ""Chads"", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach.

We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.

Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU

We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.

This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.

We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.

So, will you join the movement anon?

I've always had a knack for creativity, so as I dived into what I could do, I stuck with my skill being art. I ran across Printify and after three months, I created 70+ products ranging from coffee, mugs, stickers, and tote bags. Sadly, I've only made 3 sales and they were all from a friend of mine. I've sent the message about my company to everyone, but only a few reposted or even responded. I'm broke and I'm honestly coming closer and closer to rock bottom. I love designing. I love what I've created, but I'm scared. I want to live on-campus this winter, since I have a chance at upgrading Kae Jae as a whole, but I owe $135, and if not paid by the 1st of December, I won't be eligible to have housing. Not only does not sleeping on the couch for the 5th year in a row sound amazing, but my own space I've cultivated on-campus is one of the only things keeping me and my creativity sane. Kae Jae is my insanity made to be sane, if that makes any sense. I've ran the numbers and all I would need is 20 sales to make the quota. I have 2 days to make something shake and nothing to lose at this point. Here's the link to my business: [https://8k8jz0-b0.myshopify.com/](https://8k8jz0-b0.myshopify.com/) and the link to my business instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/kaejaeofficial/](https://www.instagram.com/kaejaeofficial/) I'm open to advice, collabs, networking, and definitely sales.

The result I can say 70 points if made into a latte compared to the best latte I have tasted. If get rid that slight burnt taste, I probably can rate myself 90. But interesting thing come this morning.

As usual I pull a shot for myself for practice, I use the same grind size where I leave yesterday and same beans. But i forgot to preheat my portafilter. 20g in and the pressure I don't know why goes above 10 bar, so I immediately close down some water flow using the flow control pad to maintain around 9 bar. This turn out to be very little liquid come out, and even worse when the 4 bar low pressure kick in after 16s. It's almost stop dropping coffee down. So finally I got 35g in almost 50s and thinking this must be a fail, but I still prepared some milk and taste it and oh my god, the best taste latte I got so far. Not a little unpleasant smokey taste and a little pleasure sour taste, and a lot of sweet compared to what I pull before and later for compare.

I am now really confused, I maybe can duplicate that process to discover more but I feel lost of direction. As usual smokey taste ref to over extraction and I should go coarser and get flow quicker, but why such a long shot like this get better? It should be bitter if I guess.
