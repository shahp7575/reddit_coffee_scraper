1ovxfkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingMentor/comments/1ovxfkv/outdoor_advertising_still_relevant_in_2025_heres/,Outdoor Advertising: Still Relevant in 2025? Here’s What Actually Works (and What Doesn’t),"Hey folks,

I’ve been diving deep into **outdoor advertising** lately — billboards, transit ads, digital displays, even wild postings — and wanted to share what I’ve learned (and hear your thoughts).

Despite all the hype around digital ads, outdoor media is *quietly thriving*. Why? Because it’s one of the few channels that’s **impossible to skip**, and when done right, it can make a real impact on brand recall and credibility.

Here are a few insights for anyone considering it:

# 🧠 1. Think “Location Strategy,” Not Just Placement

Don’t just pick a billboard because it’s cheap or nearby.  
Ask: *Who* drives or walks past it? *What are they thinking about at that moment?*  
Example: a local coffee brand buying space near commuter train exits — perfectly timed for morning cravings.

# 🎨 2. Simplicity Wins Every Time

People only look for about 5–7 seconds while passing.  
→ Keep it under **7 words**  
→ Use **one bold image**  
→ Make your **logo legible at 100 ft**  
→ Bonus: clever copy or humor works way better than cluttered “info dump” boards.

# 📱 3. Combine Outdoor with Digital Retargeting

The magic happens when you pair outdoor impressions with **geo-targeted digital ads**.  
Someone sees your billboard → goes online later → sees your brand again = stronger recall + higher conversion.

# 💡 4. Measure What You Can

Old-school doesn’t mean untrackable.  
You can:

* Use **QR codes or short URLs** (for local promos)
* Track **lift in Google searches** near the ad’s location
* Compare **foot traffic data** if you have a physical store.

# 🚫 5. What Doesn’t Work

* Too much text or “brochure” style designs
* Ads placed where your target audience never goes
* Forgetting to rotate creative — even a great ad gets stale after 3 months.

If you’ve run or seen an outdoor campaign that actually worked (or flopped spectacularly), I’d love to hear your experience.

Do you think outdoor advertising still has a strong ROI in 2025, or is it just brand vanity at this point?

**TL;DR:** Outdoor advertising isn’t dead — it’s just smarter now. Combine great design + data targeting, and it can punch way above its weight.",1,1763028818.0,MarketingMentor,0,1.0,False

The goal is to build a franchise with future plans to develop games, merchandise and other related content.

The problem at which I'm currently on is that I am confused about a monetization strategy at this early stage. 

What I have thought of are basically these 3 options but again I'm unsure

1- keeping my story behind a paywall ( I mean that's the simplest approach but I wanted it to be free so I could build a community around the story itself )

2- donations ( a very idk I never tried asking for donations like buy me a coffee or support me on Patreon I don't even know if it's reasonable or not)

3- seed round? ( I have no idea how to go through a seed round because once a seed round is done we actually have to give some sort of equity? Idk) 

I'm open to get recommendations. Also the website is live the socials are getting ready I'm really in a very very very intial stage. ",1,1763028763.0,Entrepreneur,2,1.0,False

The kind of rain that feels personal, like the clouds had a grudge or were making me question all my life choices 😅.

I didn’t have an umbrella, just my waterproof jacket, my little one, and her book bag which, of course, was getting soaked too. I tried my best to save it from the rain, but I couldn’t. I still feel sorry for her class teacher.

While I was rushing, my little one was busy splashing in puddles, giggling like it was a festival. And there I was saying for the hundredth time, “Please stop, it’s raining, we’ll be late for school!” But she was living her best rainy-day life while I was living my “why me?” moment 😂.

We finally got into a taxi, half soaked, half laughing. When we reached, my phone decided to misbehave, payment wouldn’t go through.  
I smiled awkwardly and said, “I think there’s some network issue.” Then asked the driver, “Would you mind dropping me back home? I’ll grab cash and pay you there.”

He just smiled the kind of warm, patient smile that instantly puts you at ease and said, “Of course, no problem at all.”

On the way back, his phone rang. He answered on speaker it was his girlfriend. She called him “handsome,” and I just grinned, thinking, well, she’s not wrong! He looked over, grinning, and soon we were both laughing like old friends. Just two strangers sharing a happy, silly moment in the rain.

When we reached home, I paid him double and said with a smile, “Have a coffee, handsome.”

He laughed and said, “Are you sure?”  
And I said, “Yes, you’re handsome 😂., and kind. Thank you for helping me out.”

He drove off smiling, and I stood there in the drizzle - wet hair, muddy shoes, but a heart completely warm.

Two people from different worlds but that morning, kindness spoke louder than anything else.

Because sometimes, it’s not the sunshine that makes your day bright…  
It’s the small acts of goodness that remind you humanity is still beautiful. ☔💛",1,1763028654.0,u_Additional-Gain-5886,0,1.0,False

1ovxbgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ovxbgy/only_once_have_i_seen_the_door/,Only Once Have I Seen the Door,"Hey everyone. My name’s Jack. I’ve decided to write all this here. Maybe it’ll help me make sense of it all and keep a solid track on my chronology of things. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar. I doubt it, but hey, the internet can be a strange place.

First, some background. I’m not a crazy person. At least, I’d like to hope I’m not. I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m going to college. I have a part time job at a fast-food place, I’ve got ex-girlfriends, I drive a ford focus, blah blah blah. But, my whole life, I’ve had these moments. They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.

I have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.

Sometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.

It usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or intoxicated. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.

I’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”

I’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.

How it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.

We stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”

While everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

Now, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.

The come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.

It was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.

“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”

 I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.

“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”

That’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity - and then - I remembered.

Something about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.

The man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.

“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”

Anthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”

I didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.

*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?

As I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”

The real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.

Anthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.

Coming down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.

The problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.

The first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.

I could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.

*Ask your grandpa*

I stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.

So I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.

I gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.

“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.

“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”

I leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.

“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.

“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.

“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no walls. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”

Grandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.

“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.

“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.

“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?

“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.

I tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.

Petey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.

I only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He'd no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of weird playing cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.

When I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.

The first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.

Douglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.

He'd sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they thought he prized, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.

Once, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.

One day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.

I suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”

Dell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He's never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.

I’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.

I dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.

It's hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.

That made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.

And then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.

This type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.

And maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.

Anthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”

I heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.

*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*

I didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.

The signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.

*The map the third drawer the green circle*

I walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.

That brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.

I went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.

It was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.

As I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.

The signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.

The part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.

I made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.

I am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.

That’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.

The world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.

I saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.

I am safe. I am sane. I am empty.

The door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul. And I am filled with the most profound anguish and regret, so profound it feels almost alien, not for what I found but for what I had to destroy in myself to get away from it.

Don’t look for the door. If you hear the static’s hum, learn to live with it. The only thing worse than hearing that signal is the silence you have to create to make it stop.",1,1763028394.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1ovx9y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1ovx9y7/almond_oak_expandable_travel_backpack_review/,Almond Oak Expandable Travel Backpack Review,"I'll be honest—when Dylan from Almond Oak first reached out about reviewing his new expandable travel backpack, I was skeptical. Another Kickstarter bag promising to be ""the only backpack you'll ever need""? I've heard that line before, usually right before discovering yet another pack that sags like a deflated balloon when half-empty or costs more than my first car.

But here's what caught my attention: the price. At $129.99, this thing costs less than half what I paid for my Able Carry Daily Plus. And after spending three weeks testing it—including a chaotic weekend trip to Chicago where I managed to both overpack and underpack simultaneously—I've got some thoughts.

# What You're Actually Getting

The Almond Oak Expandable Travel Backpack is Dylan's first product launch, born from his own frustrations as a one-bag traveler. It's a 25-liter backpack that expands to 30 liters, weighs just 1.86 pounds, and measures 17"" x 13"" x 7"" (expanding to 9"" deep). Made from 280D nylon with a PU water-resistant coating and a 100D nylon interior, it's built around one core idea: shed every possible ounce while keeping the features that actually matter.

Current price: $129.99 (originally $85-$99 during the Kickstarter campaign). Ships from China in 5-11 business days. 28-day return policy, but no formal long-term warranty—more on that later.

# The Weight Thing Is Real

Let's talk about that weight first because it's genuinely impressive. Under two pounds for a 30-liter travel backpack is borderline ridiculous. I weighed it three times because I didn't believe my scale. For context, my Able Carry Daily Plus—which holds slightly less at 21 liters—weighs 2.6 pounds. That 0.74-pound difference might not sound like much, but when you're sprinting through O'Hare trying to catch a connection, you feel every ounce.

This lightweight design comes with a trade-off though. The 280D nylon fabric is noticeably thinner than what you'd find on most travel backpacks. Run your hand over it and you'll feel the slickness of the PU coating, which wipes clean easily but also telegraphs that this isn't bombproof Cordura. Multiple reviewers have flagged durability concerns, and I get it. I wouldn't want to check this bag or toss it carelessly onto concrete repeatedly.

That said, the fabric has structure. Even when the main compartment is nearly empty, the bag stands upright thanks to the EVA foam back panel and internal liner. It's just that when you pack it loosely or partially—say, after pulling out a sweater at airport security—it can look a bit saggy and lumpy. Not a dealbreaker, but if you're someone who likes their pack looking crisp and professional at all times, you'll need to pack it thoughtfully.

# The Expansion Feature Actually Works

The expandable zipper runs around the perimeter of the main compartment, adding that extra 5 liters when you need it. I was skeptical about how useful this would be, but it turned into my favorite feature. Start your trip at 25 liters to stay under strict personal item dimensions (it easily fits under most airline seats). Then expand it on the way home when you've inevitably bought too many local snacks and a ""small"" souvenir that's somehow the size of a shoebox.

One caveat: fully expanded, you're pushing the limits of personal item compliance on budget airlines. At 9 inches deep, it exceeds some carriers' 8-inch maximums. Keep it compressed for boarding, then expand once you're settled.

# Organization: Thoughtful But Not Perfect

The clamshell opening is clutch—I'm done with top-loading backpacks that turn into archeological digs every time I need something at the bottom. Pop this open and you see everything at once. The main compartment is intentionally simple: one big space for packing cubes on the left, a large mesh zippered pocket on the right for a jacket or dirty clothes.

The tech compartment (accessed separately from the top) fits a 16-inch MacBook Pro with padding and a false bottom for drop protection. There's also a tablet sleeve. Both compartments have dual zipper pulls, so you can lock them together with a small travel lock.

The front admin pocket surprised me. It's tall enough to hold documents without folding them, and inside you'll find a zippered pocket plus a stretchy mesh slip pocket. I kept my passport, AirPods, and charging cables here. The side-opening design (opens from the right when you swing the pack forward) is genuinely convenient when you need quick access.

Here's what's missing: a quick-access top pocket. If you're someone who constantly grabs sunglasses, headphones, or snacks, you'll wish for that grabbable stash spot. The workaround is using the hidden side passport pocket (yes, there's a secret pocket!) for smaller items, but it's not quite the same.

# The Hardware Punches Above Its Weight Class

This is where Dylan clearly didn't cheap out. YKK #8 zippers throughout—the same ones on bags costing twice as much. They glide smoothly even when the bag is fully packed. The Fidlock magnetic sternum strap is a legitimately premium touch; it snaps together with one hand and releases just as easily.

But here's a quirk: that sternum strap can pop off. It's mounted on a sliding rail system that allows vertical adjustment, which is great for dialing in the perfect fit. The downside? In crowded spaces, I had it accidentally dislodge twice. Once at a subway turnstile, once when someone's roller bag bumped into me. Not a deal-breaker, but be mindful when navigating tight spots.

The Hypalon zipper pulls are grippy and feel quality, though they're thin enough that I'm monitoring them for long-term wear. Three grab handles (top and both sides) are padded just enough and make the bag easy to maneuver. The luggage passthrough on the back lets you slide it onto a suitcase handle vertically, which I vastly prefer to horizontal mounting.

# Comfort: Good Enough, Not Great

The 5mm EVA foam padding in the shoulder straps and back panel does its job for a bag this size. I carried it fully loaded (15 pounds) around Chicago for two days without shoulder pinching or discomfort. The back panel is firm—almost stiff—which some people won't like. There's minimal ventilation, so if you're prone to back sweat or hiking in hot weather, you'll feel it.

No hip belt, no load lifters. For a 30-liter personal item bag, I didn't miss them. If you're planning to pack this to maximum capacity and wear it for hours, the minimalist harness system might fatigue you faster than more technical packs. But for airport-to-hotel-to-daily-exploration use? Totally fine.

One pro: it fit comfortably on both my 5'10"" frame and my partner's 5'4"" frame. The simplicity of the harness means it adapts to different body types without complex adjustments.

# The Water Bottle Pocket Dilemma

The side water bottle pocket is made of stretchy mesh and easily holds a standard 21-ounce Hydro Flask. Larger 30-ounce bottles? Hit or miss depending on how full your main compartment is. The pocket opening is narrow enough that I fumbled a few times trying to insert my bottle quickly.

Opposite side: another slip pocket designed for a passport, notebook, or very slim items. I used it for boarding passes and a pen. It's not big enough for a camera or anything bulky.

# What It's Really Like Using This Thing

Let me paint a picture. Friday morning, I'm packing for a weekend in Chicago. I load my Almond Oak with: two packing cubes of clothes (enough for three days), toiletry bag, 16-inch laptop, iPad, charging cables, a book, my travel pillow, snacks, and a water bottle. Everything fits at 25 liters with room to spare.

At O'Hare, it slides under the seat with zero drama. TSA is smooth—laptop and tablet come out easily from the top-access tech compartment. Walking through downtown Chicago, the pack disappears on my back. It's so light I forget I'm wearing it.

Sunday, heading home, I've picked up two bags of Garrett Popcorn (don't judge me) and a Cubs cap. I expand the zipper, toss the extras in the main compartment, and compression-strap everything down. The bag now looks noticeably fuller and slightly less sleek, but it still fits under the seat.

Here's where it fell short: digging through my front pocket for my boarding pass while juggling a coffee, I wished for a quick-grab top pocket. And when I set the bag down in the airport food court, I noticed a small scuff on the bottom panel that I don't remember causing. Thin fabric shows wear faster.

# The Elephant in the Room: Durability and Warranty

Dylan is refreshingly honest about this: there's no formal long-term warranty. If your bag arrives with a manufacturing defect (broken zipper, stitching issue), he'll take care of it. But with razor-thin profit margins on this first launch, he can't offer the multi-year coverage that established brands provide.

This matters. Able Carry offers a limited lifetime warranty. Tom Bihn is legendary for standing behind their products. With Almond Oak, you're taking a small gamble on longevity. The fabric, while functional, is thinner than I'd prefer for a bag I plan to travel with weekly for years.

That said, early users report the bag holding up well after 5+ days of travel. And honestly, at $129.99, if this lasts me two solid years of regular use, I've gotten my money's worth. Your risk tolerance may vary.

# How It Compares to the Competition

**Able Carry Daily Plus ($198):** More capacity (21L vs. 25L base), premium X-Pac or Cordura materials, thicker and more structured, excellent organization, removable sternum strap with better anchoring. But heavier (2.6 lbs) and $68 more expensive. Buy this if you want premium durability and don't mind the weight.

**Tom Bihn Synik 26 ($340):** The gold standard. Impeccable construction, brilliant organization, will outlast you. But costs nearly three times the Almond Oak. Only makes sense if you travel constantly and want heirloom-quality gear.

**Budget alternatives ($50-$100):** Bagsmart Faro 29L, various Amazon options. These are lighter on your wallet but often use cheaper hardware, lack refined organization, and won't feel as considered. Almond Oak splits the difference—budget-friendly pricing with mid-tier features and materials.

# Who Should Buy This (And Who Shouldn't)

**Buy the Almond Oak if you:**

* Prioritize weight savings above everything else
* Pack light and want flexibility (25L or 30L)
* Appreciate quality hardware on a budget
* Trust yourself to treat gear carefully (not throwing it in overhead bins aggressively)
* Want to support an independent designer making thoughtful products
* Need a personal item bag that occasionally expands for short trips

**Skip it if you:**

* Travel weekly and need guaranteed durability
* Want bulletproof materials and long warranty coverage
* Pack heavy and need premium harness comfort
* Require a quick-access top pocket
* Like bags that look crisp even when half-empty
* Prefer established brands with proven track records

# The Verdict: A Compelling Budget Option With Caveats

Is the Almond Oak Expandable Travel Backpack perfect? No. The thin fabric raises durability questions, the sternum strap can pop off, and there's no quick-access pocket. At 80% packed or more, it looks and performs great. Below that, it loses some of its polish.

But here's what it gets right: featherweight design, smart expandability, quality hardware, thoughtful organization for the price, and a founder who's transparently building something from scratch. For $129.99, it delivers features and functionality that usually cost $200+.

I'm keeping mine for shorter trips and as my go-to personal item bag. For longer journeys or rough-and-tumble adventures, I'll still reach for my more robust (and heavier) options. But when I want to travel stupid-light and don't need a bag to survive a war zone, the Almond Oak is going in my rotation.

If you're a one-bag traveler who packs thoughtfully and values weight savings, give this a serious look. Just know what you're getting: an excellent value pick that makes smart compromises to hit an aggressive price point, not a tank that'll last decades.

1ovx4t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1ovx4t5/tom_bihn_tristar_review/,TOM BIHN Tri-Star Review,"I'm going to be honest with you right up front: I wanted to love the TOM BIHN Tri-Star more than I actually do.

Don't get me wrong—this is an exceptionally well-made travel bag that will probably outlive your career. But after diving deep into years of user reviews, pilot testimonials, and forum discussions spanning over a decade, I've realized the Tri-Star has a very specific personality. And like that friend who color-codes their sock drawer, it's not for everyone.

# What You Need to Know First

The Tri-Star is a 33-liter carry-on bag with three equal-sized compartments, built like a tank from 1050D ballistic nylon (the stuff originally designed for bulletproof vests), and handmade in Seattle. At roughly $250-320 depending on configuration, it costs about as much as a decent rolling suitcase—but this thing converts from briefcase to backpack to shoulder bag.

Here's the part nobody mentions in the glossy product photos: **This bag demands you be organized.** Not ""maybe put your socks in one place"" organized. We're talking ""each compartment gets specific packing cubes and God help you if you just throw stuff in"" organized.

# The Build Quality Is Ridiculous (In a Good Way)

I'll give TOM BIHN this—they don't mess around. Multiple users report bags looking new after 5+ years of weekly business travel. One airline pilot flies 200+ days a year and his Tri-Star still looks pristine. The ballistic nylon shrugs off airport abuse like it's nothing, the YKK zippers feel overbuilt (because they are), and the stitching is the kind you'd expect from gear made to last decades, not seasons.

This is legitimately buy-it-for-life territory. Users aren't exaggerating when they say these bags last. Several reviewers specifically mention selling their other travel bags after getting the Tri-Star—not because it wore out, but because they didn't need backups anymore.

# But Here's Where It Gets Complicated

The Tri-Star's three-compartment design sounds great on paper: work in the middle, clothes on the sides, everything organized and accessible. In practice? It's more nuanced than that.

**The middle compartment** is designed for a laptop (up to 17"") and works brilliantly with TOM BIHN's Cache laptop sleeve system. It has O-rings you can clip accessories to, and users love how quickly you can pull out your laptop for security.

**The front and back compartments** are identical in size and can clamshell open flat like a suitcase. Great for business shirts and dress pants. Less great if you're a casual packer who likes throwing in jeans and t-shirts.

Here's the catch that keeps coming up in reviews: **when you pack one compartment full, it bulges into the others**. Multiple users mention this. Fill the back with clothes, and suddenly your middle laptop compartment feels tighter. Overstuff one side, and the front external pockets become almost impossible to access.

The solution? TOM BIHN's packing cubes. But now you're spending another $80-150 on organizational accessories for a bag that already costs $250-320.

# The ""Dad Bag"" Thing Is Real

Let's address the elephant in the room. The Tri-Star looks... practical. Utilitarian. Like something your engineering professor would carry. Pack Hacker called it ""definite dad bag vibes"" in their 2025 review, and honestly, that's generous.

If you're the type who cares about bag aesthetics—sleek, minimal, Instagram-worthy—this isn't it. The Tri-Star embraces its function-over-fashion identity completely. Multiple zippered pockets on the front give it a busy appearance. The ballistic nylon, while bombproof, has that ""techie"" look some people dislike.

One user on FlyerTalk specifically chose lighter-colored bags because the dark ballistic nylon shows dirt badly. Another mentioned his bright red Tri-Star looked gorgeous new but became a dirt magnet within weeks.

# The Backpack Straps: A Mixed Bag (Pun Intended)

The Tri-Star can be carried three ways: dual handles on top, a shoulder strap (sold separately, $45+), or hidden backpack straps. The handles work great. The optional Absolute Shoulder Strap gets rave reviews for comfort.

The backpack straps? Multiple reviewers set a 30-minute limit before their shoulders start hurting. This is not a hiking backpack. It's a briefcase that *can* be worn as a backpack for airport terminals, but don't plan on walking across Venice with a fully-loaded Tri-Star on your back.

Several users specifically mention the lack of hip belt and the boxy shape make extended backpack carry uncomfortable, especially when fully loaded at 20-25 pounds.

# What It Excels At (And It Really Does Excel)

Despite my complaints, the Tri-Star absolutely crushes it for **organized business travelers doing 2-7 day trips**.

An international 777 pilot uses it as his personal item alongside a rolling carry-on and calls it ""perfect"" for his needs. He fits work iPad, paperwork, camera, inflatable mattress, AeroPress coffee maker, and more—keeping everything compartmentalized and accessible at 35,000 feet.

Multiple business travelers mention going plane-to-meeting without hotel stops because the middle compartment keeps work separate from clothes. The organized layout means you're never digging through rumpled shirts to find your laptop charger.

For flat packing dress shirts and suit pants, users consistently praise it. The clamshell design and structured compartments keep business clothes wrinkle-free in ways duffel-style bags can't match.

# The Honest Downsides

Beyond the backpack comfort and aesthetic issues, here are the real problems users report:

**Rain guards peel off.** Multiple forum posts mention the rubber rain guards on zippers slowly peeling away, exposing zipper teeth. This seems common enough to be a design flaw rather than isolated incidents.

**No luggage pass-through.** That airline pilot's biggest complaint? No sleeve to slide the Tri-Star onto a rolling suitcase handle. If you're pairing it with a roller, you're hand-carrying it separately.

**The front pockets become useless when full.** Nearly every long-term reviewer mentions this. Those four external zippered pockets sound great, but pack the bag fully and they're impossible to access without unpacking.

**It's heavy empty.** At 3 pounds 6 ounces (ballistic version), you're starting with significant base weight before adding anything. The lighter Halcyon fabric version saves about 10 ounces but sacrifices some structure.

**Size 13 shoes don't fit.** Several users with larger feet report their shoes simply won't fit in the compartments, even the ones supposedly sized for shoes.

# Who Should Buy This

You're an ideal Tri-Star candidate if you:

* Travel for business regularly (2-4 times monthly)
* Pack dress shirts, slacks, business attire
* Already use packing cubes religiously
* Value organization over quick-grab accessibility
* Don't care about bag aesthetics
* Rarely walk more than 30 minutes with your bag
* Want something that'll last 10+ years
* Fly mainly on US domestic carriers (personal item sizing)

# Who Should Skip This

Look elsewhere if you:

* Like throwing stuff in and zipping up (try the Aeronaut instead)
* Need stylish/minimal aesthetics
* Plan lots of walking/hiking with the bag
* Want a casual weekend bag
* Refuse to buy into the packing cube system
* Need room for size 12+ shoes
* Want true backpack comfort for extended wear
* Fly Ryan Air or similar strict European carriers regularly

# The Verdict: Exceptional at What It Does

Here's my take after analyzing hundreds of user experiences: The Tri-Star is genuinely excellent if you fit its specific use case. For organized business travelers who value compartmentalization, durability, and quick airport security access, it's hard to beat.

But it's unforgiving if you're not that person. The organizational system that makes business travelers swoon will frustrate casual packers. The structure that keeps dress shirts pristine adds weight and limits flexibility. The three-compartment brilliance becomes three-compartment tyranny if you just want to grab-and-go.

At $250-320+ (once you add the shoulder strap and inevitable packing cubes), this is an investment. The good news? Multiple users report 5, 10, even 15+ years of regular use with bags still looking new. If you travel for work frequently, that cost-per-trip drops to pennies.

One reviewer put it perfectly: ""It's not my perfect travel bag, but it comes very close."" That's the Tri-Star in a nutshell. It's 90% of perfect for its target audience, which is actually remarkable. But that remaining 10%—the aesthetic, the backpack comfort, the packing cube dependency—will either not bother you at all or drive you crazy.

**My advice?** If you're reading this review and thinking ""but I could make it work,"" you probably can't. The Tri-Star works brilliantly for people who naturally organize everything and need structured business travel gear. If that's not already your personality, this bag won't change you—it'll just frustrate you.

For everyone else considering one-bag travel? Check out the TOM BIHN Aeronaut or look at Peak Design's Travel Backpack instead. They're more forgiving of human chaos.

**Bottom line:** An exceptional business travel bag for organized packers who value durability and compartmentalization over flexibility and style. Just make sure you're buying the bag for what it actually is, not what you hope it might be.

1ovx1l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1ovx1l8/matador_refraction_pro_packable_backpack_review/,Matador ReFraction Pro Packable Backpack Review,"Here's my verdict: the ReFraction Pro is the first packable backpack that doesn't make you choose between ultralight portability and actual usability. At $85, it's not the cheapest option out there, but it's the first time I've unpacked a 10-ounce bag and thought ""wait, there's a dedicated laptop sleeve AND an admin pocket?""

I've owned five packable backpacks over the years. Every single one lived at the bottom of my travel bag until I desperately needed it, then disappointed me with its complete lack of organization. The ReFraction Pro is different—it's a collaboration between Matador and Pack Hacker that took over a year to develop, and you can tell someone actually thought about how people use these bags in real life.

But before you rush to buy one, there's a catch: this is a limited-edition release. Once they're gone, they're gone. And there are legitimate reasons you might want to skip this and save your money.

# What Makes the ReFraction Pro Different

Most packable backpacks are basically fancy grocery bags with shoulder straps. They compress down beautifully but feel terrible to actually use. The ReFraction Pro breaks this pattern by adding features that normally only exist on full-size backpacks while keeping the same 8×5.5×3-inch packed size as the standard ReFraction.

The admin pocket is the star upgrade. Inside, you'll find a location tracker sleeve sized for an AirTag or Tile, two mesh pockets perfectly dimensioned for passports, and a rear zippered compartment for cables, dongles, and other small tech accessories. That zippered section doubles as the stuff pouch when you pack the bag away—clever design that adds function without bulk.

The externally accessed laptop sleeve fits devices up to 15 inches and features dual zippers so you can reach your laptop from either side. I've used this feature constantly at airport security and coffee shops. No digging through your main compartment, no unpacking everything to grab your computer. The sleeve doesn't steal space from the main compartment when empty, and I've even used it to protect large documents in a pinch.

The bag weighs 10 ounces (283 grams)—2 ounces heavier than the standard ReFraction's 8 ounces but still impressively light given the added features. Unpacked dimensions are 15.8×9.8×7 inches with a 16-liter capacity. The exclusive Pack Hacker colorway features black fabric with distinctive teal zipper pulls and accents that look sharp without being obnoxious.

# The Experience: What It's Actually Like to Use

I tested this bag for three weeks as my daily carry around Seattle and on a quick trip to Portland. The first thing that surprised me was how structured it feels compared to other packables. The 100D recycled nylon and 70D Bluesign span materials have enough body that the bag doesn't completely collapse when partially loaded—a common problem with ultralight packables that makes them frustrating to use.

The shoulder straps are legitimately comfortable. They include lightweight padding throughout with hidden internal structure that prevents them from pinching inward or digging in. The sternum strap helps distribute weight when you're carrying heavier loads. I loaded this thing with my 14-inch MacBook Pro, a jacket, water bottle, snacks, and miscellaneous gear—easily 12-15 pounds—and wore it comfortably for several hours exploring Portland's Powell's Books.

That said, there's no structured back panel. Pack a water bottle wrong or jam a camera body against your back, and you'll feel it. This isn't a hiking backpack—it's a daypack that happens to compress incredibly small. Load it thoughtfully and you'll be fine. Load it carelessly and your back will remind you of your mistakes.

The main compartment opens wide via a clamshell-style zipper, making it easy to see and access everything inside. The YKK zippers are now upgraded with AquaGuard protection (the standard ReFraction only has PU-coated sealing zippers). They're smooth and reliable, though they do have that slight stickiness that comes with water-resistant coatings.

Two external mesh pockets stretch to accommodate water bottles up to one liter. They're positioned well and actually hold bottles securely—I've never had one fall out, even when scrambling up stairs. The mesh also works for slim umbrellas, which proved useful during Seattle's unpredictable weather.

Hypalon tether points on the exterior let you attach extra gear. The included anodized aluminum carabiner is sized for PALS webbing (that's the standard loop system you see on tactical gear), and it works great as both a compression strap when the bag is packed away and a key leash when deployed. Small detail, but I use it constantly.

# The Downsides: What They Don't Tell You

Let's talk about what's not great, because no bag is perfect.

**The grab handle is thin**. When this bag is fully loaded, carrying it by the top handle can dig into your hand after a minute or two. The standard ReFraction actually had a wider, more comfortable grab handle according to some reviewers. This is a minor annoyance but worth noting if you frequently carry bags by hand rather than wearing them.

**It's not truly waterproof**. Despite water-resistant materials and AquaGuard zippers, this bag is designed to handle light rain, not torrential downpours. Matador themselves recommend their Advanced Series if you need serious weatherproofing. I got caught in a Seattle drizzle for about 20 minutes and everything stayed dry, but I wouldn't trust this in a tropical rainstorm.

**The admin pocket isn't huge**. While it's perfect for passports, cables, and AirTags, don't expect to fit a full tech pouch in there. It's designed for organization, not bulk storage. If you're the type who travels with twelve different dongles and adapters, you'll still need a separate tech organizer for your main compartment.

**No returns on limited editions**. Matador's policy states that limited-edition items like the ReFraction Pro are final sale. You can't try it, decide it's not for you, and return it. At $85, that's a meaningful commitment, especially for something you can't test drive first.

**16 liters might feel small**. For day trips and airport duty, it's perfect. For longer excursions or if you're someone who always overpacks ""just in case,"" you might find yourself wishing for more capacity. Compare this to alternatives like the Bellroy Lite Ready Pack (20L) or Aer Go Pack 2 (20L) if you routinely need more space.

**Limited availability**. This is a limited run. When stock runs out, you won't be able to buy this exact version anymore. The standard ReFraction will still be available, but it lacks the laptop sleeve and admin pocket that make the Pro special.

# How It Compares to Alternatives

At $85, the ReFraction Pro sits in the middle of the packable backpack market. The standard Matador ReFraction costs around $60-70 but lacks the laptop sleeve and admin pocket. The Aer Go Pack 2 runs about $95-100 and includes more padding and structure but weighs significantly more and doesn't pack as small. The WANDRD Veer Packable Daypack ($80-90) features an inflatable back panel for extra comfort but feels less refined overall.

The Bellroy Lite Ready Pack ($99) is probably the closest competitor—it's packable, has 20L capacity, and offers more color options. It also features sturdier fabrics if you're rough on gear. However, it doesn't pack down quite as small as the ReFraction Pro, and it lacks the dedicated admin organization.

What makes the ReFraction Pro unique is that balance: it compresses to the size of a softball (same as the $60 standard version), but opens up with organization features you'd expect from a $100+ daypack. It's the Goldilocks bag for travelers who want both packability and usability.

# Who Should Buy This (And Who Should Skip It)

**Buy the ReFraction Pro if you:**

* Travel frequently with a laptop and need quick security checkpoint access
* Want a packable daypack that doesn't feel like a garbage bag
* Appreciate thoughtful organization in your travel gear
* Can work within 16 liters for day trips
* Don't mind the no-return policy on a limited edition

**Skip it if you:**

* Need serious weatherproofing (get Matador's FreeRain24 2.0 instead)
* Want maximum comfort for heavy loads or long hikes (check out the WANDRD Veer)
* Require more than 16L capacity (consider the Bellroy Lite Ready Pack at 20L)
* Prefer to try before you buy (the final sale policy is a dealbreaker)
* Are on a tight budget (the standard ReFraction at $60-70 is still excellent)

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth $85?

The Matador ReFraction Pro is the first packable backpack I've tested that doesn't feel like a compromise. It genuinely works as both a highly compressed travel essential and a functional daily carry. The laptop sleeve alone justifies the $25 premium over the standard version for anyone who travels with tech, and the admin pocket is the kind of detail that makes you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.

But here's the thing: the standard ReFraction is still an excellent bag at $60-70. If you don't carry a laptop in your packable or don't care about the admin organization, save the money. The core experience—comfortable straps, quality materials, reliable compression—is the same. The Pro is about refinement, not revolution.

For me, the laptop sleeve sealed the deal. I've wasted countless hours at airport security fumbling through unstructured packables to find my computer. The ReFraction Pro eliminated that frustration entirely. It's become the bag I reach for first, not the bag I tolerate when I need extra capacity.

The limited edition aspect adds urgency but also risk. At $85 with no returns, you're betting that this bag will work for your travel style without trying it first. For most one-bag travelers and frequent flyers, I think that's a safe bet. For everyone else, the standard ReFraction is still sitting there, patient and capable, at a lower price.

**The bottom line**: This is the most thoughtfully designed packable backpack currently available, but it's not for everyone.

1ovx1l7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovx1l7,Atomix ** New York City (August 2025),"**What/Impressions**: I would say Atomix was good, but did not live up to the hype being 12th on the world 50Best or 1st on the North America 50Best (yes, I know the list is not reliable). I get the feeling the menu changes and seasonality could drive certain menus to certain subjective tastes.  The menu is on the lighter flavor intensity side, Korean, but more focused on letting ingredients shine through.  Both Mingles and Eatanic Garden in Seoul far exceeded Atomix for my tastes.  I’ve heard menu changes can be significant, so maybe another shot is needed.



**Favorites/Standouts**: 

* King crab, caviar, with the carrot curry was spectacular. Really good balance of curry and carrot sweetness with the crab.  Favorite course of the night without question.  The pine nut cream was a very clever addition and added a lot.   
* The lobster and lobster mandu were both excellent. The slight fermentation in the cherry and rich lobster stock foam with cream complemented each other well. 
* As quaint as it may sound, the squab fried rice with egg at the end of the meal was perfect and a really great end of the savory. 
* Hyssop and pear ice with coconut sorbet and honey was a perfect dessert opener with brightness, citrus, and savory-sweetness of the coconut. The rice ice cream to follow was also very good.



**Least Favs**

* The whiting was an OK course and I appreciated the hot sauce in the dish with ginger, but not special
* The tilefish dish was also not particularly strong for my tastes

  


**Atmosphere/Staff**: 

* Staff was all great.  Fun, engaged, and funny.  They explained things well and gave background into Korean cuisine and traditions.  Also special shoutout to the cards with descriptions and background.  Nice takeaway!
* Atmosphere was also quite nice.  Intimate setting without being too close to other parties. 



**Revisit**: 

* Yes, but I think I would wait quite a while before checking other NYC boxes and would probably try to scout the seasonal menu first.  Would like to try Jungsik to compare to what I had in Seoul. ",2,1763027366.0,finedining,1,1.0,False

Most students treat it like a list-making exercise - come up with a few topics, point out similarities and differences, and be done. But the truth is, the best compare and contrast essays aren't about structure like they are about insight.

I once asked a student to compare working part-time and studying full-time.  Like, It looked boring on paper. But her essay showed how both shaped her time management and identity. That's what makes a compare and contrast essay stand out - going beyond the obvious.

When students ask how to write a compare and contrast essay, I always say: start with a real question, not just a topic. Forget random compare and contrast essay topics like “cats vs. dogs” or “coffee vs. tea.” Instead, find something that actually challenges your thinking. The best topics for compare and contrast essay reveal something new about you or the world.

If you’re stuck, reading real compare and contrast essay examples can help a lot. I’ve seen many students use platforms like [Helpwithessay](https://helpwithessay.org/?utm_source=post61&utm_medium=post) \-  not to outsource writing, but to explore strong samples and structure ideas. Sometimes one well-written example sparks the “aha” moment you need.

And please, don’t skip the title. Titles for compare and contrast essays can set the tone instantly. Instead of “Compare and Contrast Essay: Online vs. Offline Learning,” try “Lessons Beyond the Screen.” It feels human - and that’s the point.

1ovwyzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1ovwyzr/alpaka_metro_sling_max_review/,ALPAKA Metro Sling Max Review,"I stuffed my Nintendo Switch into the wrong compartment on day one.

Not because the ALPAKA Metro Sling Max is confusing—it's actually dead simple with just two pockets. I did it because I was rushing through airport security, and the bag was standing upright on the conveyor belt like it owned the place. That structural confidence? It's the Metro Sling Max's superpower and, occasionally, its Achilles heel.

Three weeks of daily carry later—through airport terminals, coffee shop work sessions, and one very sweaty train commute—I've learned exactly what this 3-liter sling does brilliantly and where it stumbles. Spoiler: it's not the bag for everyone, but for the right person, it's borderline perfect.

# What You're Actually Getting

The Metro Sling Max sits in ALPAKA's ""Max"" lineup for a reason—it's the biggest of their Metro slings at 3 liters. That sounds small until you realize it comfortably swallows an iPad mini, over-ear headphones, and a Nintendo Switch simultaneously. The ""Max"" moniker feels slightly oversold though. At 3L, this is more ""reasonably spacious"" than ""maximum capacity.""

Available in either Axogrid (ALPAKA's custom recycled laminate) or X-Pac VX21 fabric, mine came in the Axogrid version. The material has that technical outdoor gear texture—rugged but refined, with a subtle crinkle that doesn't sound like you're carrying a chip bag. YKK AquaGuard zippers glide smoothly, sealed against surprise rain showers.

Price sits around $74-89 depending on fabric choice and sales. Not cheap for a 3L sling, but not Peak Design territory either.

# The Structural Advantage Nobody Talks About

Here's what nobody tells you about sling bags: most collapse into sad fabric tacos the moment you set them down.

The Metro Sling Max doesn't do that. The structured shape means it stands upright on its own—on desks, cafe tables, airplane tray tables. This sounds trivial until you're frantically digging for boarding passes with one hand while holding coffee with the other. Set it down, unzip, grab what you need. No fumbling, no flopping.

That rigidity comes from the Axogrid fabric and internal structure. It holds its rectangular portrait shape even when empty, which makes packing intuitive. You always know where things will land inside.

The downside? When worn across your front, it feels a bit boxy. Tightening the strap doesn't make it contour to your torso—it just sits there like a small messenger bag. Not uncomfortable exactly, but not body-hugging either. If you want that sleek, barely-there sling aesthetic, look elsewhere.

# Two Compartments That Share Internal Real Estate

The organization is intentionally minimal. Front quick-access compartment with a mesh zip pocket inside. Main compartment with a soft-lined tech sleeve, four narrow pen slots, and two small slip pockets. That's it.

What ALPAKA doesn't advertise clearly: these two compartments share the same internal space. Overstuff the main compartment, and the front pocket gets squeezed. Pack the front pocket thick with a wallet and power bank, and your main compartment loses volume. It's not a dealbreaker—you just need to pack strategically.

The front mesh pocket became my dump zone for earbuds, lip balm, and those random receipts I swear I'll expense later. The magnetic key holder sits here too. It's clever—strong magnet holds your keys in place, release is one-handed and smooth. But heavy key sets? They've popped loose on me twice during aggressive movement. Not catastrophic, but worth noting if you carry a janitor-level keychain.

# The Main Compartment: Thoughtfully Imperfect

Unzip the dual YKK zippers and the bag opens wide, giving you a clear top-down view. The soft-lined sleeve is slightly elevated off the bottom—nice touch for protecting your iPad mini or Kindle from impact. It's not heavily padded, just lined, so don't expect bombproof protection.

I tested ALPAKA's claim about fitting an iPad mini, Nintendo Switch, and over-ear headphones simultaneously. It works, but it's tight with larger cases. Remove the Switch case and it's more comfortable. The four pen slots are hilariously narrow—they hold ultra-slim pens or styluses but reject anything chunky like a Sharpie. The small slip pockets work for cards or transit passes, nothing bulkier.

The open main area easily handled my Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, sunglasses case, and a compact camera. One unexpected use case: it holds a 500ml water bottle in a pinch. Not ideal for all-day carry because accessing anything else means removing the bottle first, but it works.

# The Strap Situation: Houston, We Have a Problem

Let's address the elephant in the room—the strap.

It's narrow. Like, suspiciously narrow for a 3-liter bag. The closed-loop nylon strap is durable and adjustable, but there's zero padding. When the bag is lightly packed (just essentials), it's fine. When you stuff it with the full iPad-Switch-headphones combo? That narrow strap starts digging into your shoulder after about 45 minutes.

This isn't unique to my unit. Multiple reviewers mention the same issue. One user perfectly summarized it: ""The shoulder strap for such a large bag is too narrow. If you fully pack it with items like a gaming console, multitool, water bottle, and smaller things, it becomes quite uncomfortable to carry for a long time.""

ALPAKA's response? The strap is detachable and interchangeable. You can swap it for aftermarket straps with better padding. That's... something. But it feels like they should've just included a wider, padded strap from the start for a ""Max"" capacity sling.

Adjustment can be finicky too. You need to finesse it to get the perfect fit, and once set, excess strap just dangles. It stays put once adjusted, which is good, but the initial setup requires patience.

# Eight Attachment Points for Maximum Customization

Both sides of the bag feature four webbing loops each—eight total. These integrate with ALPAKA's Hub carabiner system, but you can clip on standard carabiners, keychains, or whatever you need.

I clipped a small water bottle on one side and my keys on the other. Worked great for quick access without digging inside. If you're into the modular accessory ecosystem, these loops are goldmines. If you're not, they're just there, not getting in the way.

# The Detachable Advantage

Pop both ends of the strap off and suddenly you have a tech pouch. Toss it in your travel backpack, use it as a desk organizer, throw it in your car. This is genuinely useful for travel—use it as a sling at your destination, stow it as a pouch in your main bag during transit.

The top carry handle is simple webbing, unpadded but functional for quick grabs. It doesn't add bulk, which I appreciate.

# What's Missing (And Noticeable)

No rear slip pocket. Most slings have one for quick phone or card access. The Metro Sling Max doesn't. This means accessing your phone requires swinging the bag around and unzipping the front compartment. Not tragic, but noticeably less convenient than competitors.

The zippers on the quick-access pocket can be slightly stiff to open one-handed. The pocket flexes inward toward the main compartment, creating resistance. After a few weeks, I learned the technique—pull diagonally rather than straight—but it shouldn't require learning a technique.

# Weather Resistance That Actually Works

I got caught in a downpour walking from the train station. The Axogrid fabric and AquaGuard zippers kept everything inside completely dry. Not just ""mostly dry""—bone dry. This isn't marketed as a waterproof bag, but the weather resistance is genuinely confidence-inspiring.

# Who This Sling Works For

**Buy this if:**

* You carry tech daily (iPad mini, Switch, e-reader, headphones)
* You want a bag that stands upright for easy access
* You value minimal organization over compartment overload
* You're okay swapping straps for better comfort
* You need weather resistance without bulk
* You're looking for a sling that doubles as a tech pouch

**Skip this if:**

* You plan to fully load it daily (that narrow strap will haunt you)
* You need a rear pocket for quick phone access
* You want body-hugging, low-profile aesthetics
* You prefer heavily padded straps out of the box
* You carry bulky items that need structured protection

# The Competitors Worth Considering

At this price and capacity, the **Peak Design Everyday Sling 3L** ($50-70) offers more structure and better padding, but weighs more. The **Chrome Sabin 3L** ($49) is lighter and cheaper but lacks the weather resistance. The **WNDRD ROAM Sling 3L** ($119) is purpose-built for cameras with superior protection but costs significantly more.

The Metro Sling Max sits in an interesting middle ground—more structured than budget options, less specialized than premium competitors, better weather protection than most at this price.

# The Honest Verdict

The ALPAKA Metro Sling Max is 85% of an excellent sling held back by 15% of questionable decisions.

The structural shape, weather resistance, and detachable versatility are genuinely excellent. The magnetic key holder, attachment loops, and soft-lined tech sleeve show thoughtful design. For light-to-moderate daily carry, it performs beautifully.

But that narrow strap for a ""Max"" capacity bag? It's a legitimate issue that forces you to either pack light or plan for discomfort. And skipping the rear slip pocket feels like leaving money on the table—it's such a standard feature that its absence is glaring.

Three weeks in, I still reach for it most days. But I've learned to keep the load reasonable, and I'm eyeing aftermarket straps. It's an excellent sling that could've been near-perfect with better strap design.

**Rating: 7.5/10**

*Current price: \~$74-89. Available in Axogrid or X-Pac fabric.*

**Bottom line:** A thoughtfully designed tech-focused sling with excellent weather resistance and structural advantages, undermined by a too-narrow strap that limits its ""Max"" potential. Great for moderate daily carry, frustrating when fully loaded.

1ovwut1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1ovwut1/pfo_closure_my_story/,PFO closure - my story.,"Hey, I had a stroke in Summer. No proper reason why clot was formed, but it might be several reasons: weight loss (lost 20kg in 3months), Lyme disease caught, very hot summer, dehydration and so on. 

*It seems to me zero people are talking why the clot even formed.

Then they found PFO and I had closure after 3months, now 1week passed after closure. During the waiting of PFO closure, I had aspirin+atorvarstatin (whats the point of clopidogrel during that time, no idea, but some people gets that, wtf)

*Some doctors recommended to use statins, others didnt understand why I even take it, so in hospital after PFO closure, the cardiogolist said “dont take atorvarstatins anymore and keep as all world people should keep your cholesterol low with mediterranean food, omega3, active lifestyle, low sugar and so on.

As I see in many reddits posts people are getting statins like candies. Do people even understand the meaning of statins? It looks like in USA doctors just give it to people without even understanding the reason or making sure it is needed. I’m from Europe and it looks to me here doctors watch much more closer to each individual as different case.

Plus I was told that your liver get used to statins overtime. What you will do when you get older and you will need for sure to use statins and low doses wont work anymore?

I was given Clopidogrel for 6months and Aspirin for 5 years. Also what I saw on posts, most people get Aspirin for life? What is the reason? Do you have all thrombosis mutations (doctor of genetics said even mutations dont lead to blood clots, the most recent studies shown). Or what is the reason of aspirin for life? You have closed PFO, no option to pass any clot - case closed. What is the point to use Aspirin for life? Maybe when you get older, because blood gets thicker when you are older. It irritates a stomach as well - remember. 

Hydrate yourself (2.0-3.0l of water, not coke, not coffee or random stuff, but water). It is a natural anti-clot medicine. Move as well 6-10k steps each day. Most people don’t even get to 3k daily…

It seems to me in USA people are just over of medicines/drugs rather than changing lifestyle and question reasons why they even take that drug, what it does, how it helps, what are side effects and so on.

Now about palpitations/extrasystoles. I also have them as others. Like at first 3 days up to 10 times (one each time), now 1-3 after one week. I read that 2 weeks is a mark when you get more, so I will see how it goes. I take from the beginning magnesium 400mg to help me. I also have beta-blockers just in case my palpitations will be out of hands. But also not recommended to take beta-blockers, it also have a lot of side effects. Try magnesium firstly and if you feel just a little extrasystoles - don’t worry.

Also, I see a lot of people get anxieties and so on. Try to find good psyhology doctor which can help, because in the end it is related to a health trauma.

Thanks.

Despite this I have always avoided it before bed because all you hear is that it keeps people up all night, and I am an insomniac.
So anyway, I bought some paracetamol (acetaminophen) from the shop, and it turns out I got the ‘plus’ version which includes caffeine. 

So the day before yesterday I took it before bed because I was in too much pain not to… and I actually stayed asleep for an extra 2 hours, and, after months of nightmares, slept soundly that night. I repeated the same experiment last night and the same happened. Nothing else has changed. 

My theory is almost certainly that it is related to my ADHD, does anyone have a similar experience? Do I just start having caffeine before bed? Does anyone have any knowledge about theoretical optimal dosing? I’m not a huge coffee fan, so I’ll probably just buy caffeine and glucose tablets. 

Also, I’m wondering if I should seriously look into ADHD meds, mainly to help my crippling executive dysfunction, but if it possibly will also stop me from being terrorised in my sleep and restless, because it is theoretically the stimulant properties of caffeine helping me. I know people usually only take meds in the day, but are there extended release dosages that last into the night also? 

Finally, does anyone have advice as to how to approach asking for medication from your psychiatrist in adulthood when you were diagnosed in childhood but have never tried meds before? Also when you have things that seem to be clear ‘contraindications’ for stimulant meds, and your psychiatrist is from the bad old days of an inaccurate perception of neurodiversity.

I'm only 46 and I don't fully trust the doctor last time I talked to him he gave me a referral to talk to a mental health nurse and gave me the wrong address.  thankfully she agreed to see me even tho I was late, she was the one who recommended I get a blood test and ECG (still waiting on the results of the ECG, I've had to retake that 3 times because the results were not clear).

I researched everywhere to figure out what I should do or consume in order to feel more charged up during my morning sessions.

Some said to have a banana, but it takes around 30–40 minutes to show its effects. Others suggested espresso, but I really don’t have time to make a hot one and wait for it to cool down.  
I also looked into pre-workouts, but I didn’t want to start my day with those, plus, a lot of people said they gave them jitters and took a while to kick in anyway.

So today, out of nowhere, I thought of chugging instant coffee with cold water, and oh boy, oh boy, my leg workout today was something else! It felt like I was in a war, and I was just winning.

1ovwm73,https://www.reddit.com/r/wolffparkinsonwhite/comments/1ovwm73/its_back/,Its back...,"Well, you saw the title, my WPW reoccurred 3 years after my catheter ablation.

The ablated pathway I had was a right-sided postersptal accressory pathway right near my coronary sinus artery. I was passing out a lot but had fewer symptoms and could enjoy a lot of things like coffee, alcohol, exercising, energy drinks, etc. I could at least still live a life with it, my heart beat only going to 160bpm.

Sadly, not this time...

It has come back more sensitive to almost everything I do, and it's massively hindering my life. I know, I can't even walk up a flight of stairs without needing to take breaks..

The funny thing about my WPW is that it's hard to spot; you need to zoom in on my ECG to see my delta waves and short PR interval. Luckily, my new doctor followed my advice and found them on an ECG she performed; they were seen in the AVF, V3, and V6 leads. She sent an urgent letter to a cardiologist with the instructions to zoom in. I'm being fitted with a 7-day monitor by the cardiologist this Monday. This is happening because the first 24-hour monitor from the hospital back home ( im at university, away from home) showed my sinus was normal, but my heart rate was 181 bpm at rest. This is because the first cardiologist didn't know she needed to zoom in to see my delta waves, as they are slight. However, you can still tell it's a delta wave. My new doctor, now knowing those results were incorrect, has seen them on her ECG, which she did on me, and is taking this further and said to me that if she followed 24-hour monitor results, I could be at high risk of developing Afib due to my frequent symptoms.  I've been advised not to drive, nor take the medications I was taking, nor do excessive exercise.

They reckon that because my symptoms differ from those in my first pathway, it might not be the ablated pathway causing these current episodes. I could have another pathway that's recently become active. My new ECG shows signs of a left-sided pathway, but until the cardiologist sees the results of my new heart monitor, we still dont know. Since my surgery was during COVID, I didn't go through the tests or evaluation I was meant to.

I won't say this really sucks, I miss the axneity-free life I was given after the surgery, not worrying about when my next episode is going to happen, having to stop doing, drinking or eating things I used to enjoy.",2,1763025641.0,wolffparkinsonwhite,0,1.0,False

There are certain sounds that bother me a lot, like the noise from cafes or motorcycles, and I hate not being able to hear my friends' conversations properly when I go out to eat.

I've been thinking about buying Loop earplugs. The chat recommended the Engage. I bought some cheap ones from AliExpress to test their comfort, and I like them. In this case, they don't have a hole or membrane; they're just the earplug itself. They isolate some of the noise; I was able to have a coffee peacefully and hear the conversations of the people nearby. But, when I speak I have that feeling of my ear being blocked, which the Engage are supposed to minimize. I'm afraid they might not be enough, but the Experience might be too much.

1ovwkew,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ovwkew/its_kind_of_a_weird_experience_when_youre_into_a/,"It's kind of a weird experience when you're into a subreddit, make a post, and it's getting comments and upvotes, but then it gets taken down...","I think people focus on the karma number, and we all laugh about how the points mean nothing, but in fact, reddit can be a harsh place, and making a successful post or comment isn't easy. 

It usually means becoming a part of a community, lurking, slowly starting to make comments and learn the inside jokes, and eventually, taking the risk to make a post yourself, knowing that there are basically three possible outcomes:

One, most likely, it gets ignored.

Second, it goes sideways, and people just make fun of you or troll you.

Third, what you hope for: People comment on the post, and maybe even upvote it, and there's a little discussion, and you feel some feeling of happiness for a day or two, or an hour or two

I think why #3 feels good is that it's the feeling we all want: of acceptance, of friendship, of feeling like we're IN with a certain group. So the karma points are actually just a mark of something deeper, the feeling of acceptance.

And then, I guess the reason I made this post, is a rare scenario. #4. You're part of a community, you feel like you've got the vibe and the humor, and you make a post. Miracle, it's actually going well, getting comments and upvotes, but then, after a couple hours, it gets taken down by the mods.

This is kind of sad. For one thing, you normally get no notification that this has happened. Sometimes there's a comment from the mods, sometimes not. So unless you go to the ""new"" queue and look for your post, you have no way of knowing this happened.

And then, to #3, you feel like ""hey, the community was digging this, why would you take it down?""

I'm not saying anything upvoted should remain, just that sometimes, if a post falls into a gray area, if the community is into it, that should count for something. 

I've been a mod/admin of online communities before, and I know it's not an easy task. These are volunteers who are trying their best. But sometimes they can be harsh, enforcing vague rules strictly, and not willing to listen to pleas for nuance. 

I'm not proud that I've argued with mods on a couple occasions. On one sub, I was legitimately confused about what posts would be allowed. My post that was taken down whilst upvoted seemed very similar to popular ones. After going back and forth with the mods in DM, I made a post like ""I don't understand what a good post on this sub should be,"" and they banned me for a week.

It made me wonder, should ""meta"" posts about the state of the sub be always allowed? Mine was not the first meta post like that on the sub, and I saw another similar one not long after, and it was locked (and upvoted). 

I know complaining about reddit mods is old news, and I'm not really trying to do that. (Maybe a little.) I'm just wondering, is there any democratic process in place for subs? Or only if there's huge abuse happening?

It's also interesting to look at what should be flagship subs, like r/coffee, that seem to be held hostage by super-strict mods. I wonder why reddit hasn't sort of cracked down on that...",1,1763025442.0,TheoryOfReddit,2,1.0,False

**All characters in this story are 18 or older.**

He had seen me watching him, yes, there had been eye-contact. But I got the fucky out of there as fast as I could, eye-contact or no eye-contact, I did not want that girl, or anyone else, to know what I had just seen.

I had learned for myself just how deep this thing was; brazenly walking through the girl's locker room, brazenly receiving blowjobs from students at 4:47 in the afternoon.

This guy had balls, huge balls, enormous balls. I had just seen them, but I must not have seen them clearly, because his balls had to be as big as basketballs.

Either that or he had a stranglehold on the whole system, the goods on someone, or he was paying someone off. Who knows? But something was going on, some kind of conspiracy, I didn't know what exactly, but it was something dark and deep and mysterious.

Driving home, I felt guilty, if you can believe that. It was he who was receiving a blowjob from a student, in his office, on government property, at 4:47 in the afternoon, yet it was me who was feeling guilty. How fucked up and cowardly is that?

I decided right then that I would say nothing about the blowjob, at least not yet. I would get to the bottom of this, the full story, every detail, but until then, I would say nothing about witnessing blowjob.

Reagan was probably home at that very moment, doing her homework. I had to appear calm. As a father, my job was to help her stay in that beautiful innocent world of hers for as long as possible. At least I hoped it was still innocent.

Driving down my street, and then pulling into the driveway, I parked the car and took several deep breaths before climbing out.

Entering through the back door, I walked into the kitchen and found Reagan sitting at the 'big table' working on her science project.

We have two tables; the 'big table' and the 'little table'. The big one is an oak table which we use for dinner. The little table is just a small patio-looking thing we bought from IKEA and use for breakfast and snacks.

Since Karen was out of town, I was allowing Reagan to use the entire 'big table' to spread out all her materials. She had all kinds of crazy shit spread all across it; papers on top of papers, but also her laptop, her printer, straws, markers, crayons, and Popsicle sticks. She was really going to town on whatever it was she was creating. She was a great student and almost always received As in her classes.

""Hey sweetie."" I said.

She looked up from the table and gave me one of those deep-in-thought looks, then responded,

""Hey, dad.""

I walked closer to her.

""Boy, that is quite the science project you've got there. What are you building, an atom bomb?""

She gave me the sincere chuckle I was hoping for.

I moved in and sat across from her. She was wearing the standard white Polo shirt with the school's logo over her left breast. There were at least ten identical shirts hanging in her closet. I could barely catch a glimpse of bra cups against the swell of a large breast.

We talked for a minute or two. I learned she was building a model comparing predators to prey in the animal world.

Suddenly the phone in the pocket of my shirt made it's noise. Pulling it out and glancing at it, there was a number on the screen I did not recognize.

""Hello"" I answered.

""Hello"" the voice on the other end responded, ""This is Travis Johnson, Reagan's coach. Am I speaking with her father?""

*Dear God*

""Oh, hello. Yes it is."" I managed to say.

The voice continued, ""Would you mind if I stopped by your home in the next few minutes to have a word with you? It should not take long?""

*Dear fuck*!

I should have told him that now was not a good time. I should have told him he was a perverted fuck who would be fired once I was finished with my investigation. I should have told him one of a dozen things. But before I knew what I was doing, these words were exiting my mouth;

""Why yes, now would be a fine time for a visit.""

""Great, I should be there in about five or ten minutes."" He said.

""Sounds good, see you then.""

Then I pressed the red button on the phone's screen and ended the call.

Slowly I placed the phone back in my pocket.

Ok, just stay calm, you must appear calm and uninterested when you mention it to her. You are a man who did not just see her coach receiving a blowjob from a cheerleader.

""Who was that?"" she asked.

""That, Sweetie, was your gymnastics coach."" I answered.

I might as well have told her a tidal wave was about to hit the house. Her head shot up from what she was doing. Staring at me, her eyes were wide, almost terrified.

""Coach is coming here?""

""Yes,"" I said with an authentic chuckle. ""I figured that was OK. Are you OK with that?""

She looked away and started to back-track, ""Oh, well, of course it's OK. I'm just busy with this.""

In a fatherly tone I said ""Well, he actually didn't even mention anything about you. He wants to speak with me."" I said it as if she might not even be invited to sit with us.

Trying desperately to hide her anxiety, she asked, ""So, he said nothing about me?""

""Nope, not one word."" I answered.

There was an odd moment of silence, then I asked,

""Sweetie, you seem to get really nervous when the subject of 'the coach' comes up, is everything OK between you two?""

*Are you also giving him blowjobs at school while wearing nothing but your panties?*

""Yes, everything is fine,"" she sighed and looked down, ""It's just . . . he is a man who demands a lot from his students and I get anxious when I interact with him outside gymnastics.""

Good, good, this is good, she's not bullshitting me, she is finally speaking openly and freely about this.

But I was still nervous, ""I understand. Well, if anything weird ever happens, you know you can always talk to me about it? I'm your dad, that's my job.""

""He doesn't do anything weird,"" she said, almost in a chuckle. Then, with her eyes lowered and focused on nothing at all, she added, ""But he has enlarged my mind, I suppose that could be considered weird.""

*Man, this guy really has his hooks in her.*

Suddenly a feeling came over me that the answers to the questions I was asking would be more awful than the situation in the locker room. She spoke about the man as if he were something from the supernatural world, a warlock or a necromancer or a man-god, something to lift up, bow down before, and offer sacrifice to.

Perhaps this thing was even bigger than I had suspected.

Changing the subject and slowly standing up, ""Well, he will be here soon. Let me check the front room and make sure there is no clutter in there.""

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang. Reagan had gone up to her room to wait. She was probably listening from the top of the stairs.

When I opened the door, there he was. The dark glasses he always wore made his seem a charismatic 'Jim Jones' Messiah type.

Wearing a red exercise suit of some sort, he seemed much larger than before and seemed to fill the entire doorway.

""Hello."" He said as he stepped forward respectfully.

""Hello."" I answered as I held the door open for him.

We shook hands, both of us were thinking of the blowjob we had just witnessed but were pretending we were not.

I invited him into the living room and we sat across from each other. Ten feet or so of space plus a coffee table separated us.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable small talk, he decided to broach the subject,

""Well, I don't want to take up too much of your evening. I suppose I called because I felt it necessary for us to discuss what you just witnessed back at the school.""

""All right, please do."" I said.

I was trying hard not to appear a detective interviewing a culprit, but that's how I felt.

""But before that, I would like to speak with Reagan for a minute. Is she home?""

I felt a twinge of apprehension sweep up from my guts and clutch at my heart.

""Uh, sure."" I said while reaching for my phone. ""She's upstairs, let me send her a text.""

It did not take long for Reagan to enter the room, the coach remained seated as he spoke,

""Hello, Sweetie.""

""Hi, coach.""

She was still wearing her school uniform. A white polo shirt tucked into a blue-plaid skirt. She had not removed her shoes; blue high tops. Her hair was brushed back, but was no longer in a ponytail like it had been before she went upstairs.

""Why don't you come over here, Sweetie. Come stand next to me.""

As she walked towards him, her shoulders were hunched more than they normally were.

Once she was within arms length he slowly reached around her waist and turned her towards me.

Gazing at her face, he reached up and gently caressed her cheek as he spoke,

""You truly are a beautiful young lady.""

""Thank you."" She answered softly.

Lowering his hand, he turned to me and said, ""The school's dress code for many years has stated that girls must wear the standard uniform. The problem has been the boys. They love to lift up the girl's skirts and expose their panties. So years ago the girls started wearing shorts beneath their skirts.""

I nodded in comprehension but wondered where this was going.

He continued, ""The problem is, the girls are not learning to sit like ladies, they sit with their legs spread all over the place. So I demand that my girls wear nothing beneath their uniforms but a matching pair of bra and panties. No shorts, no under-shirts, no thongs, no sports bras.""

He turned to Reagan, ""Isn't that right, Sweetie?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Have you been following the rules?

""Yes.""

""What do you have under your uniform?""

""A pair of bra and panties.""

""Matching?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Good, very good. But let's just have a quick look to make sure.""

I felt a pleasant stiffening in my dick. My balls began to churn.

Gripping the bottom of her skirt, her body stiffened and she looked to me, then looked away.

Without any hesitation the coach began lifting the skirt and soon the tops of her thighs were exposed. But the skirt continued riding upwards until her white panties were completely exposed.

There was a pause of profound stillness. I was amazed by his boldness, but my prick was throbbing, it was hard and pointed downwards into my underwear. My balls quivered and ached.

Holding the skirt up, we both took in the view of her beautiful panties. Just plain white panties, but they were clean and new as if she had just removed them from the box she had bought them in.

The skin around the panties was flawless without a hint of cellulite anywhere. Her pussy-area was beautiful and tight, and the cotton material stretching across it was filled nicely to its limits.

Focusing on her pussy, in admiration the coach finally spoke, ""Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.""

He was enjoying the fuck out of this.

""Good job, Sweetie, only panties. Do the boys lift your skirt as you walk past?"" He asked.

""Yes.""

""And sometimes they take pictures don't they."" He said.

""Yes.""

""What do you do?""

""There's not much I can do. It's always the same boys, so when I see them coming I just put my hands by my sides to hold my skirt down, then I start running.""

""Yes, those boys can be rascals"" He said as he lowered the skirt.

Glancing to him to see what he would do next, I watched his focus shift upwards, his dark eyes roved back and forth across her breasts.

A silence hung in the room. Reagan's breasts were rising and falling in a solid rhythm; swelling outward and tightening the material of her shirt before deflating back. It seemed the entire universe was focused on her tits.

""All right, how about the bra, does it match the panties?""

Softly Reagan answered, ""Yes.""

A part of me hoped the man would believe her, another part hoped he would not.

""Well, let's have a look to make sure.""

*Oh Fuck*

Reaching up, he pinched that portion of shirt just above her waist and began tugging it out of the skirt. When the hem of her shirt came loose, a flash of pale stomach presented itself then was gone.

Glancing to his face, it held an amused aspect, powerful, almost vengeful. He was thrilled with what he was doing to her. I was not stopping him, neither was she. She was his toy, and there was absolutely nothing preventing him from doing whatever he wanted with her

The shirt continued to rise, and soon he was barring a beautiful gymnast's stomach. But he continued lifting it until it traversed her entire body. Raising it all the way to her chin, he made sure we could both see her complete chest.

*Dear Fuck*!

There they were, out in the open and fully exposed, a pair of cock-stirring breasts held in place by a beautiful white bra.

Her petite little frame made them appear absolutely massive. Bulging out of the top of the cups, they almost appeared engorged. Her stomach was so tight and thin compared to them, and the bra straps seemed too small to hold them up.

They were beautiful tits, literally the most beautiful things I had ever seen. Round and smooth and riding high on her chest. I had never seen her in a bra. The closest I had seen was when she wore a bikini. But there was something different about this. This was degrading, an intrusion, an invasion of her body. Her coach was having his way with her, and I was allowing it, allowing it for my own sexual gratification. The whole thing was extremely dark, just plain raw. Beyond raw, it was primal, primitive, primeval.

I noticed the coach had leaned in closer, close enough for the air exiting his mouth to blow across her chest.

Suddenly, without a shred of hesitation, his large black hand reached up and engulfed the bottom-half of one of her breasts.

Her body stiffened. Then, slowly but firmly, he squeezed the breast and watched in fascination the pale tit-flesh bulging upwards above the cup.

""What size are they?"" He asked.

""Thirty-four double-D."" She answered.

""That's a beautiful size. Extremely large for a girl your size and age. I've seen your breasts in the locker room, but never up close like this.""

""Do the boys look at them a lot?"" He asked.

""Yes.""

""Do they ever randomly grab them?""

""Yes, sometimes.""

""Well, boys will be boys"" he said as he removed his hand from her breast.

Then he lowered the shirt down over her bra.

1ovwgh6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovwgh6,I’ve been building a simple habit & routine app as a long-term side project — finally reached MVP,"I’ve been working on a small habit & routine app as a side project with two friends.

It started from my own struggle to keep daily plans, and I wanted something visual, flexible, and not too “productivity-guru” heavy.

After a long time iterating, we finally reached a very early MVP.  
It’s still quite rough and missing a lot of important features, but it finally feels usable enough to show to others.

**Why we built it**

Most habit apps felt either too rigid or too gamified for me.

I wanted something more visual and conceptual — but ironically, the MVP ended up a bit more “safe” and conventional than I hoped.

My plan is to slowly make the trackers more distinctive, playful, and concept-driven as we continue building.

**Current state**

Right now, the core flow is:

* set weekly routines
* track actions with three input types (check, count, timer)
* visualize the day/week/month through different trackers

It works, but many parts are still minimal or incomplete.

**What we’re adding next**

We’re preparing the next steps, mainly:

* reminders
* widgets
* backup & restore
* more unique and experimental tracker types

These are the features people usually ask for first, so we’re prioritizing them.

**Would love feedback**

I’d really appreciate any thoughts on the UX, the visuals, or the overall direction.

Not expecting big traction — just hoping to hear what could make the idea stronger or more useful for others.

If you’re curious, here’s the MVP version:

The best one for you really depends on how long you plan to use it each session and what kind of setup you prefer, but a few models consistently stand out.

If you’re using a laptop for long hours, look for a lap desk with solid ventilation and adjustable angles. The Huanuo Adjustable Lap Desk is one I often recommend. It has foldable legs, multiple tilt positions, and enough space for a mouse. The adjustable angle helps with wrist alignment and reduces neck strain, which is something most people don’t think about until they start getting tension headaches.

If you just need something simple for browsing, writing, or reading, the LapGear Home Office Pro is a solid pick. It’s got a firm, non-slip surface and decent padding underneath that keeps your legs cool. It also has a slot for a phone or tablet, which sounds like a small detail but actually makes multitasking a lot easier.

For people who like more of a “mini desk” setup, the SAIJI Laptop Bed Tray is great. It’s height-adjustable, super stable, and feels more like an actual workstation. I’ve used it for long work sessions with a mouse, notebook, and coffee mug all sitting comfortably on top. The leg adjustment locks tightly, which is key because cheaper ones tend to wobble over time.

Avoid lap desks that rely purely on cushion padding without a hard base. They look comfy but end up heating your legs and forcing awkward wrist angles. Also skip anything with poor ventilation if your laptop runs hot, especially if you’re using it for design, coding, or video work.

So if you want the short version: for balance between comfort and function, go with the LapGear Home Office Pro. If you want full ergonomic flexibility, the Huanuo or SAIJI are your best bets. A good lap desk shouldn’t just hold your laptop, it should make working in bed feel like an intentional setup instead of a lazy compromise.",1,1763024763.0,BedroomLab,0,1.0,False

1ovwe25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ovwe25/which_model_train_is_best_for_small_apartments/,Which model train is best for small apartments?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been living in a pretty cramped apartment for about three years now, and I finally decided to get back into my childhood hobby of model trains. The problem? I had basically zero space to work with.

I spent way too much time researching which model train scale would actually fit in a small apartment without taking over my entire living room. Here's what I figured out.

**N Scale is Your Best Friend**

Seriously, if you're tight on space, N scale trains are the way to go. They're about half the size of HO scale (which is what most people think of), and you can build a pretty decent layout on a table that's like 4x6 feet. I managed to fit mine on a desk against my wall.

The trains themselves are around 1:160 scale, which means they're small but not so tiny that you can't see details. Plus, the tracks take up way less room, so you can actually do curves and interesting layouts without needing a garage.

**Z Scale If You're Really Cramped**

Now, if your apartment is absolutely tiny (like studio apartment tiny), Z scale exists. These things are seriously small at 1:220 scale. You could literally build a layout in a bookshelf. The downside is they're harder to find and more expensive. Also, my hands are kinda clumsy, so working with something that small would drive me crazy.

**What About HO Scale?**

Look, HO scale is the most popular size out there, and there's a reason for that. Tons of options, easier to work with, and they look amazing. But in a small apartment? You'd need at least an 8x4 foot space minimum to do anything interesting. I tried planning an HO layout first and quickly realized my coffee table would have to go.

**My Recommendation**

Start with an N scale starter set. You can find some really good ones that come with everything you need – track, train, power supply, the whole deal. I actually found some great options through [this collection here](https://athomewave.com/model-train) that made my search way easier.

The cool thing about starting small is you can always expand later if you move to a bigger place. But for now, an N scale setup on a folding table or wall-mounted shelf works perfectly. I can literally fold mine up when people come over.

**Space-Saving Tips**

Here's some stuff that helped me:

- Wall-mounted layouts are genius if you're handy
- Folding tables from IKEA work great as temporary bases
- Vertical layouts (like mountain scenes) use less floor space
- Corner layouts fit in awkward spaces that you're not using anyway

**Bottom Line**

Don't let a small apartment stop you from enjoying model trains. N scale gives you the best balance of detail, availability, and space efficiency. You can set up a solid beginner layout in a weekend without rearranging your entire apartment.

If you're ready to start, check out [some starter options here](https://athomewave.com/model-train) and just go for it. I waited way too long thinking I needed more space, but honestly, working within limits made me more creative with my layouts.

Back then, everything just *clicked*. I had my Pulsar NS160, friends who were like family, and every day felt like a movie scene. I used to perform on stage and I still remember the whole auditorium shouting my name — “**R.a.k R.a.k**” — that sound still echoes in my head sometimes. That rush, that energy, that feeling of being *seen* — nothing has matched it since.

Now life’s quieter. Everyone’s busy. No random canteen plans, no last-minute fests, no bunking for rides or filter coffee. It’s just… adult life, da.  
Sometimes I scroll through old photos or videos and it hits me how alive I used to feel back then.

\[Verse 1\]  
When the cursor breathes fire and midnight draws near,  
I wrestle the sentences, line after line,  
From coffee-stained towers I rally my cheer,  
To vanquish the deadline and make the prose shine.

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
I sharpen my commas, I polish each fight,  
I bargain with muses who vanished from sight

\[Chorus\]  
Toss a coin to your writer,  
O patron, be kind;  
Toss a coin to your writer,  
Fuel the tale in my mind.  
Toss a coin to your writer,  
And watch worlds be spun  
Every copper you offer  
Keeps the storyroom sun.

\[Verse 2\]  
The editor’s daggers find holes in my plot,  
Beta eyes narrow: “This twist needs a clue.”  
I stitch up the wounds with a deft little knot,  
Then raise a new banner and charge Chapter Two.

Ink is my armor, a library my shield,

Heroes march onward where day jobs would tire  
A tip and a cheer set the chapters on fire.

\[Verse 3\]  
So gather ’round hearthlight, I’ll sing what I’ve penned,  
Of thieves, gods, and bargains that don’t always mend;  
And if you’ve a token to toss in the hat,  
I’ll write you a kingdom and crown you in that.

1ovw5s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ovw5s6/blood_orange_juice/,Blood Orange Juice,"

Footsteps up the stairs. A desiccated voice. Her lament echoing inside my skull.
Out of breath in a convenience store, choosing coffee, I run through a life that could choose nothing else, and know it is all useless.
Cup‑noodles mutter to themselves.
“Where did it go wrong. I have to take it back. Take it back.”

Red liquid sliding off the desk’s corner. Blood‑orange juice.
When did the talking thin out.

Clouds mix with the high‑rises.
Glass takes the clouds as a mold.
No border between self and others; we look at the same things, complain in the same shapes.
Nothing solved; someone asks, “Why is a national‑university graduate stuck here?” and lets go of himself even more.

A woman poses before a house with raw concrete skin.
A crow pecks a convex mirror; a patrol car passes with its siren.
A night curve.

I still use the rose‑scented hand cream you gave me.
You wear white sunscreen off‑season and sunglasses at night.

New shoes are already dirty before the first step; your shirt prints an exploding bomb as you walk.
Over your shoulder that day you were smiling.

What returns is always that smile, and yet now you hunch, eyes on the steps, saying, “So this is what I climbed.”
Your smile was beautiful. I took it, and you took it.
The inside of my viscera flips; rose scent mixes with motor odor. A low hum and a pale rose spiral.
A room with flickering lights. Two of us in a dim, musty place with tired air.
What we handed over now belongs to others and has changed into something we do not know.
We can know only the result, and even that right is taken from us. Closed.

Lament and sobs seep into the houseplant; it exhales oxygen; the leaves grow. She grows too.
In red and yellow leaves I wanted to keep that smile: you in a green full‑length coat with a hood, turning back to say “Cold,” taking my cold hand and saying “Warm.”

“Who was that dumb‑looking guy today? He knows nothing, can’t tell left from right. No distinction, none.”
He keeps running from every moment; I don’t know how the force of my steps toward her will live at journey’s end.

“If I could say, ‘Back then it was me who could not tell things apart. I blamed you, spat, swung a studded belt, called it for you, but it was all to spare myself. I am only sad now. I am sorry,’ would it ease me?”
Thinking so, I crack a bottle and drink from the neck on the street; a far day floats in the sky’s reflection.
Across the way a window snaps shut.
In that room a glass of red trembles with the vibration.

---

Explanatory Poem 


At the desk edge the red decides the day; it refuses the theater of blood.
The irreversible is the spill, not the wound. Stairs beat; breath frays under convenience‑store lights.
The skyline repeats itself on glass until distinction peels away. Sunscreen in the dark, lenses at midnight, shoes already dirty—rulers that measure the distance from her shoulder‑smile to the downcast count of steps.
Motor odor threads the rose cream; a plant eats the salt of sobs and returns oxygen.
We are granted only outcomes; the keyholes of choice are sealed.
“I” and “you” take turns stealing a laugh. To confess would cut the last alibi, so the bottle opens instead.
Across the street a window shuts; inside, a glass of red trembles.
That tremor is what remains of care: not repair, not hope, but a thin motion saying we live long enough to watch the stain dry.

* **3 full days** if it is your first time
* **4–5 days** if you want a slower pace or a day trip

You can “see” the big sights in 2 days, but your feet and your mood will be wrecked. Rome rewards slightly slower trips.

If you can avoid peak summer, do it.

* **Best overall:** April–early June, late September–early November
* **Peak & sweaty:** July and August
* **Cheaper, moodier:** January–February

Spring and autumn are the sweet spots for most people: warm, busy but not carnage, and easier to enjoy long days out.

# Where to stay in Rome (quick cheat sheet)

If you are staring at a map and getting stressed, use this:

* **Centro Storico** – Classic “step out into history” Rome. Amazing location, higher prices, smaller rooms.
* **Trastevere** – Cute lanes, lively evenings, loads of bars and trattorie. Can be noisy at night.
* **Monti** – Central, a bit trendy, good bars and indie shops. Nice balance for first timers.
* **Prati (Vatican side)** – Wider streets, calmer, good if you like a more residential feel.
* **Testaccio / Ostiense** – More local, great for food and street art, slightly further from some big sights.

Mid range budget:

* Expect roughly **€130–€220 per night** (about **£115–£195 / $145–$240**) for a decent, central double.
* Plus Rome’s tourist tax of around **€3.50–€10 pp/night**.

# What things actually cost in Rome (rough 2025 prices)

These are ballpark, but should help with planning:

* Espresso at the bar: **€1.20** (\~£1.05 / $1.30)
* Cappuccino: **€1.80–€2.50** (\~£1.60–£2.20 / $2.00–$2.80)
* Pizza slice (al taglio): **€3–€5** (\~£2.60–£4.40 / $3.30–$5.50)
* Sit-down pizza or pasta: **€9–€14** (\~£8–£12 / $10–$16)
* Metro ticket (100 mins): **€1.50** (\~£1.30 / $1.65)
* 24 hr transport pass: **€8.50** (\~£7.50 / $9.50)
* Colosseum basic ticket: **€18** (\~£16 / $20)
* Vatican Museums basic ticket: **€20–€32** (\~£18–£28 / $22–$36)

Daily totals:

* **Budget:** roughly **€80–€120 (£70–£105 / $90–$135)**
* **Mid range:** roughly **€170–€230 (£150–£200 / $190–$260)**

# Must see sights (and what to book ahead)

If you only book three things in advance, make it:

* **Colosseum + Forum + Palatine** combo ticket
* **Vatican Museums + Sistine Chapel**
* **Borghese Gallery** (strictly timed 2 hour slots)

Also worth planning:

* **St Peter’s Basilica** (free, but queue + dress code)
* **Pantheon** (€5 entry now)

# Rome itinerary idea (3 days that actually work)

**Day 1 – Ancient Rome + Centre**

* Morning: Colosseum, Forum, Palatine
* Afternoon: Capitoline Hill, Pantheon, Piazza Navona
* Evening: Wander, gelato, earlyish dinner

**Day 2 – Vatican + Trastevere**

* Morning: Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel, St Peter’s Basilica
* Afternoon/evening: Cross the river to Trastevere for food and wine

**Day 3 – Borghese + neighbourhoods**

* Morning: Borghese Gallery and park
* Afternoon: Monti or Testaccio for more “local” Rome

If you have a 4th day, use it for a **day trip** (Tivoli, Ostia Antica, Orvieto) or just slow wandering and more food.

# How to get around Rome (without losing your mind)

* **Walk where you can**, but accept that distances add up
* Use **metro + buses** for longer hops
* A **24 / 48 / 72 hour pass** pays off fast on busy days
* Only use **official white taxis** with a meter

Big one: **validate your ticket**. On buses and metro you need to stamp or activate it, otherwise inspectors can fine you on the spot.

# Food & drink: how to avoid tourist traps

Some simple rules:

* Walk at least **one or two streets** away from the main squares
* Skip anywhere waving laminated menus in your face
* Look for **short menus**, lots of Italian being spoken, and a mix of ages
* House wine is usually great and cheap

Rough prices for a decent mid range dinner for two:

* **€40–€70** (\~£35–£60 / $45–$80) for starter, pasta/pizza, dessert and wine.

Classic Roman pastas to look for:

* Cacio e pepe
* Carbonara
* Gricia
* Amatriciana

# Safety & scams (the real stuff)

Rome is generally fine if you have normal big city habits. Watch for:

* Pickpockets on busy buses/metro, around Termini, Trevi, Vatican
* “Free” bracelets or roses that suddenly require payment
* People hovering at ticket machines wanting to “help”

Keep bags zipped and in front of you on metro/buses, and if you feel a bit crowded, move.

# Dress codes & church rules

For **St Peter’s Basilica** and other big churches:

* Shoulders covered
* Knees covered
* No tiny shorts or very strappy tops

Easiest fix: carry a light scarf and wear slightly longer shorts/skirts on Vatican day.

# Tiny Italian phrases that actually help

* Buongiorno / Buonasera – Good morning / good evening
* Per favore / Grazie – Please / thank you
* Il conto, per favore – The bill, please
* Un caffè, per favore – An espresso, please
* Dov’è la fermata dell’autobus / la metro? – Where is the bus stop / metro?

Using even one or two of these makes interactions so much nicer.

# TL;DR

* **3–5 days** is a good Rome window
* Stay in **Centro Storico, Monti, Trastevere or Prati**
* Budget around **€80–€120** per day on the low end, **€170–€230** for mid range
* Book **Colosseum, Vatican, Borghese** in advance
* Validate your tickets, watch your bag, eat one street back from the big squares

I've been playing since **Animal Crossing** for GameCube.

I love the series, doing my little daily tasks and enjoying such amazing art style and music and the general vibes of this game.

Simple actions such as just watching Brewster making some coffee and you drinking it, it just feels so right and satisfying. The sound of steps adapting on the terrain. The absolute perfect music tracks for each hour of the day.

While I understand that the entire focus of *New Horizons* is decoration and design, I can't help but craving for the latest installment of **Animal Crossing** to feature all the good parts from various different previous titles.

I love terraforming and decorating, but I am not good at it and it's not what I enjoy the most out of Animal Crossing (which is why I still do not own *Happy Home Designer*).

Again, I think it's crazy fantastic how the game now has terraforming, it came such a long way...!

But then, why did it have to lose everything else?

I cannot quite understand why the devs have to compromise features rather than stacking up all the popular and successful experiences from the past:

* focus on life sim
   * villager's personality/complexity
   * more events and tasks
   * moving drama & relationship layers
* dedicated shop district
   * more variety of buildings
   * multi-tier shop expansions
* multiplayer mini-games
   * balloon-hunting
   * hide & seek
   * maze
   * treasure hunt
   * so many more

I would love if Nintendo could make an **Animal Crossing** comprehensive of everything that works so well.

I'd be very disappointed if next installment for example lost terraforming and island design at the cost of some other new feature, rather than keeping it.

I’m one of the developers behind *Weirdl*, a small side project my husband and I built after realizing how boring (and fake-sounding) most reminder apps are.  
You know the type - “You got this!”, “Keep shining!” - while your plants are dying and your laundry smells.

We wanted something that actually gets you moving and makes you laugh - so we made Weirdl, a daily reminder app that roasts you into action.  
It sends you one brutally honest message a day about the little things you’ve probably been avoiding.

💀 “Water the plants. They don’t drink coffee like you do.”  
🦴 “Your posture is actively defying human evolution.”  
🧼 “Maybe it’s time your bedsheets remembered what soap smells like.”

Each reminder is a mix of humor and truth - a tiny insult disguised as motivation.

Main features:

🌀 One new roast every day (free & ad-free)

🔥 Collect and share your favorites

💪 Streak counter to stay consistent

✨ Premium extras: rare & legendary roasts, streak saves, rescheduling, custom share cards

We just launched on Google Play and would love your feedback - does the humor hit right, or should we tweak the tone?  
Share with us any ideas that come to mind - how to improve the app, the idea, what would you like to see in the app. Thank you all in advance!

1ovvtcd,https://i.redd.it/lexpdejuiz0g1.jpeg,"AKo in the SB vs Old man coffee min-open from the BTN, 15bb stack / Jam or call?","MTT, 8 players, 15bb equivalent effective stack for BTN/SB/BB.

Old man coffee so far showed only pocket pair and the occasional AQs as their worst opening hand. OMC on the BTN open 2bb.

You are the hero in the SB with AKoff. You know, I know, everyone knows « All in, it is +EV », but is it, really, against OMC?

So of course we don’t fold a premium, that would be too tight, but should we « Always » jam? 100% like all « classic » solvers recommend with a +3.88EV well known, well accepted value?

Well, I beg to differ, and against OMC, I would flat AKo even AKs (knowing that BB could certainly come along or jam if he is clueless).

Why? Because against a 90%-of-the-time-pocket-pair, AKo/AKs has about 45% equity, so by definition…. -EV.

Also, did you notice the slight 0.8 EV difference, in « pure theory » (solver vs solver) of jam vs call?

So maybe, just maybe, consider calling with AK when OMC open, you’ll most probably see a flop (because everyone at the table knows what’s going on and won’t jam on OMC + a call) and take it from there.

If you are like me and hate variance, share your thoughts of how you would play this spot.

I’ve saved up some money to do something for my parents. We grew up with a functional home, there wasn’t much focus on making the house homely or have a coherent aesthetic. I’m hoping to gift them a cosmetic lift so they can feel a little more comfortable as we can’t afford six figure renovations.

Do you guys have any ideas for organisation/decorative pieces/re-arranging to do/
Furniture to replace/purchase etc. to give a cosmetic lift to the kitchen and living room ( I’ve attached photos of what things currently look like)

Extra info:
For the living area I really don’t like the 2 large cream sofas but being functionally minded  people they think it’s practical. I was thinking of bringing in 
-different couch cushions in grey/white/matte & baby blue
-clearing everything on the stand beneath the tv and putting 2 ceramic vases on either side which are different shapes and sizes (I’ve attached a photo for inspo)
-I think the walls are a bit bare but don’t know what to put and where
-not sure if a rug and coffee table would work?
-not sure what kind of curtain/blinds to get to replace the ones currently there which are falling
