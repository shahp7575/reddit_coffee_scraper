I found Maharaji through connecting with Ram Dass videos over the last many years. Neem Karoli Baba has been with me through these connections and has appeared in my dreams three times. 
Last night was the third. üôè 
I wanted to share my dreams...
First of all I want to say that when I would look at his pictures I would just cry and cry and cry. I couldn't articulate what I was feeling but he had led me home and back to Jesus Christ.  his message for the westerners was that you have Jesus Christ. but Jesus has never had a real form for me to look at so his pictures and his videos and his voice was what my mental part of me needed I suppose. 
I had been struggling with addiction to alcohol and marijuana for some time. I had been sober from alcohol for a while but the weed was another story I had been meditating at the park everyday for a good while so the first dream, he appeared sitting up in a tree watching me. It was very sweet and let me know that he was with me. 
Fast forward maybe a year later I had been quit for marijuana but was still desiring it and very much struggling with it and so I started back. The second dream he appeared in a car sitting next to one of the actors from Cheech and Chong that was blazing up a joint smiling at me. In my dream I Grimned ear to ear smiling so big I could feel my cheeks stretching. He is quiet comical!! I took that message to mean that I just needed to burn out my desires and just smoke away until the desire was gone. So I did.  I smoked like a freight train until it finally did run its course. 
So then last night was the third dream. he was coming in on a boat and I was so excited to see his face but when his face got there, there were several of them and they looked very dead and I couldn't find the life in his face. This dream was quite bizarre and it was as if the images represented the side maybe we would call the void or emptiness. I am comfortable with that aspect of myself so I got up to make coffee and just decided maybe it means I need to let go of thinking about him on a mental level. 
And lastly this is the finale....
I made a friend from India here on Reddit the last couple days and we have been talking back and forth and the first thing that happens when I get on my phone this morning is he sends me a beautiful painting of him!! He said a friend offered it to him asking if I wanted it.....I was trying to upload it for you all to see but I guess hence this whole message we don't need it because I can't figure it out, but
Immediately my natural answer was no thank you he is in my heart. I think you need it!!!...üòçüôèüòÅüíï",2,1736683436.0,neemkarolibaba,0,1.0,False

Leah is my childhood friend and Casey was my gfs childhood friend before we all started hanging out as a group. For the record, Leah and Casey are dating. Out of 4 of us, Leah and my gf seemed the least close just beacuse they had no things in common and Leah pretty much met my gf because she was my gf and her gfs friend, while I met Casey through and ex a long time ago.

You see, Casey and Leah are incredibly close and they rarely do things without eachother. So if I ever went out for coffee or something, I'd go with both of them. I went out with one of them only once, just beacuse the other one was out of town. Last month my gf mentioned Leah is over at her house. I had asked my gf how was Leah there without Casey since they're s package deal, and my gf said ""Oh Casey's sick"", which made sense ig. Later on I found out that Leah had spent the day packing up my new years gift from my gf with her,to which my gf said ""yeah I had nothing else to do with her since Casey wasn't there"". I just shrugged it of, but fast forward to today, my gf wanted to see me but I couldn't make it due to work, and she decided to invite LEAH over instead. I had no reason to get mad or jealous, but then I saw my gfs story where she tagged Leah with some kind of a new inside joke only they know about, which again wouldn't pmo if my gf didn't mention the fact she came over like 5 times. Then she told me ""Leah is coming over again the day after tomorrow(again, by herself)"". Well THAT pmo so bad. Now, I'm not saying that my gf might be cheating on me, but this situation is just making me mad uncomfortable and I kinda have a bad gut feeling.

Also, my gf seemed off today and she had a hard time falling asleep tonight, so I asked her what's wrong,she said she doesn't want to talk about it and I said ""you don't have to, but please tell me if it's something regarding our relationship"" to which she replied ""it is, but I don't wanna talk about it, I just want to fall asleep"" Am I overreacting?",4,1736682683.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

It was my first time studying in the U.S., and I didn‚Äôt have many friends. Most of my days were spent alone, juggling my studies and returning home. My classes were small, often just a couple of students, and my routine was solitary and predictable. That all changed one day when a woman approached me and introduced herself.

At first, I was nervous. She was older than me, and this was my first real conversation with someone outside of my family in this new country. But as soon as we started talking, something clicked. Maybe it was because we spoke the same language or shared the same faith, but our connection felt instant and natural. From that moment on, she became a constant in my life‚Äîmy confidant and my guide.

She had a car, and at that time, I didn‚Äôt even have a driver‚Äôs license. She would often drop me home after classes, a kindness that meant the world to me. One memory, in particular, stands out. It was during Ramadan, and the summer heat was relentless. I had just finished my classes and was waiting for a bus at the stop, feeling drained and impatient. The bus seemed like it would never come. Then, out of nowhere, a car pulled up in front of me. The window rolled down, and there she was, urging me to get in. I hesitated at first, but she insisted, worried about the traffic building behind me.

As I climbed into the car, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. It was as if God had sent her to me at that exact moment. Her thoughtfulness and care reminded me of the beauty of human connections and the power of friendship.

Our friendship was filled with these small yet meaningful moments. In the fall, we‚Äôd drive around to admire the orange hues of the autumn trees, their beauty making the air feel magical. One weekend, she even took me and my sister to the beach. That day turned into an unexpected adventure. After playing in the sand and enjoying the cool breeze, we drove up to a hilltop viewpoint. Sitting there, we watched the beautiful blue waves crash against the shore below. The world felt infinite in those moments. We sat quietly, soaking in the view, enjoying our favorite burgers and sipping coffee.

The ride back home was bittersweet. The day had been long and fulfilling, and as she dropped us off, she waved us goodbye with a warm smile. I remember feeling a pang of sadness as her car disappeared down the road, but my heart was full.

In her company, I learned the true value of friendship. It wasn‚Äôt about grand gestures but about the quiet, consistent presence of someone who cared. She turned what could‚Äôve been a lonely time in my life into one filled with warmth, laughter, and unforgettable memories.",1,1736682451.0,BrazenAdventurers,0,1.0,False
1hzl067,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1hzl067/was_he_just_looking_for_a_fight/,was he just looking for a fight?,"So I went to the grocery store pending the second round of heavy snow this week and it was as expected... busy, low stock, lots of people rushing to get their bread and milk. I had planned ahead and was just stopping in for coffee and dog food. I go to grab a hand basket from the entry way and this big back boomer is just standing in the middle of the entrance making huffy noises and fiddling with his maga hat. 

I tried walk around him trying to not engage and he steps into my path and yells ""THERES NO CARTS HERE! WHY ARE THERE NO CARTS! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SHOP"" so I just said what felt right ""Not my problem... bye"" and just pushed past him and did my shopping. On the way out he was still standing there and approached me again. ""You should have brought me your cart! You saw me out here waiting!!"" again, I didn't have a cart and I'm walking out with one bag in my hand and nothing else.

I said ""Bro I don't work here. Seriously, F off. You're a creep. F you and your stupid little hat"" and just shoved past him again. He kept stammering and muttering but didn't follow me or anything.

I just don't understand this behavior like did he actually need to go to the store or did he just get a fresh from the factory maga hat and wanted attention? I in no manner of dress looked like I was wearing the store's uniform. No idea how to read this encounter other than stupiddddddd. I was in and out of the store in 5 mins. On the way to my car, I saw an employee with like 20 carts loaded on the cart mover headed to the front door.

How is this sort of damage valuated for the purpose of claiming the loss/damage insurance?,"I bought moving insurance for loss/damage with a deductible of $300. I'm not sure how value is assessed on minor damage or on small things that were destroyed that are not easy to replace or were part of a set. 

Damaged:

Natural wood cabinet with 3 drawers: Large chunk broken off of the corner of the front of one drawer. The chunk followed the grain of the wood, and it's about 6 inches long x 1 inch wide. The cabinet and the drawer still works, but this cabinet sits right under my TV and it's very noticable that a chunk is missing out of the front of it. How is this damage of something like this assessed? I don't think it's possible to just replace just one drawer.

Coffee table, desk, dresser, etc.: These are just Ikea items and the damage is only aesthetic, e.g. small chunks taken out of the paint, scratches, corners smashed in a centimeter, bottom edge frayed upward from being dragged...but there is a lot of it. How is this valued? 

Small Broken things:

Cups: One is a handpainted tea cup, part of a set, that I got in a rural village when backpacking through the Middle East. It's not something I can replace easily or order online. Similarly, a branded coffee mug from a German university where I did an exchange semester and it's not something that I can replace or order online.

1hzkyb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/moving/comments/1hzkyb1/paid_for_lossdamage_insurance_how_is_value/,Paid for loss/damage insurance. How is value assessed for lots of minor damage?,"I bought moving insurance for loss/damage with a deductible of $300. 

I'm not sure how value is assessed on minor damage or on small things that were destroyed that are not easy to replace or were part of a set. 

Damaged:

Natural wood cabinet with 3 drawers: Large chunk broken off of the corner of the front of one drawer. The chunk followed the grain of the wood, and it's about 6 inches long x 1 inch wide. The cabinet and the drawer still works, but this cabinet sits right under my TV and it's very noticable that a chunk is missing out of the front of it. How is this damage of something like this assessed? I don't think it's possible to just replace just one drawer.

Coffee table, desk, dresser: These are just Ikea items and the damage is only aesthetic, e.g. small chunks taken out of the paint, scratches, corners smashed in a centimeter, bottom edge frayed upward from being dragged. How is this valued? 

Small Broken things:

Cups:  One is a handpainted tea cup, part of a set, that I got in a rural village when backpacking through the Middle East. It's not something I can replace easily or order online. Similarly, a branded coffee mug from a German university where I did an exchange semester and it's not something that I can replace or order online. Are these valued as though they're just used $2 cups or how much they cost to replace?

Does anyone have some experience with a low-fiber diet regarding gut health?  
It seems to me that I am doing much better regarding my gut health especially constipation when I am choosing low-fiber foods. I can eat vegetables and fruits but when I start to eat more oatmeal or for example buckwheat my constipation instantly becomes worse.

Has anyone here had a similar situation? Or see great results regarding your well-being while keeping a low-fiber diet?

I try to eat pretty healthy, I do not eat gluten, any sugar, no coffee or alcohol, no processed food basically, I am not vegetarian I eat fish and meat so keeping a low-fiber diet does not make my variety of foods drastically small, it is just something that I noticed. I have a very sensitive gut that reacts very easily so I have to keep a strict diet and very disciplined lifestyle to feel great and have a nicely functioning body. I had severe constipation and gut issues due to my past with ED. I visited several GI doctors and they all suggested using more fiber, fiber supplements, and everything with fiber which made things even worse for me and made me basically miserable until I started to experiment with food myself and saw that actually low fiber is the diet that makes me feel better, which I found very interesting as doctors always pushed fiber for me.

So basically I am wondering if anyone has similar experience? I would really like to learn I am not alone in dealing with this :D",1,1736681023.0,GutHealth,2,1.0,False

1hzkmhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1hzkmhr/probably_too_much_context_but_i_cant_sleep/,"Probably too much context, but I can‚Äôt sleep","My husband and I went through a lot in 2022. I was having significant health issues due to mold in our home. I was out of the house for about 9 months while it was being remediated. During that time, he stayed in the single room that l didn‚Äôt need any remediation. He visited me on the weekends, wherever I was staying, which was either one hour or two hours away. He‚Äôs always been kind and positive but this year took so much out of him emotionally and he‚Äôs naturally very avoidant. 

I moved back into our home in the fall of 2022 and we started renovations to get everything back together. We threw out a ton of stuff, which I know was really hard for him to reconcile with ‚Äì he thought we could saved more stuff than I was comfortable with, not necessarily sentimental things. 

Around spring of 2023, I noticed the drinking increasing. It was normal that he‚Äôd have a few beers a few nights a week before the house stuff started. But there was one night that I had gotten ready for bed by myself and came back down to talk to him shortly after and I saw a 6 oz pour of whiskey under the coffee table. We‚Äôd talked about it and said all of the things. I got way more weary and aware of his drinking in general. 

Fast forward to spring of 2024, where my health is way better, but still not 100%. There‚Äôs a night where he‚Äôs being so insanely passive aggressive that I think I‚Äôm going crazy. He finally admits to sneaking shots of liquor because there isn‚Äôt a garbage trail. I got upset and was applaud considering he is all about honesty and ‚Äúhates liars‚Äù.

It continues to happen a handful of times throughout the rest of the year. He thinks he‚Äôs ok drinking socially and hasn‚Äôt felt like that‚Äôs a contribution to the problem. My reactions to the sneakiness and lies range between understanding/calm and ‚Äúwtf‚Äù. We‚Äôve talked about how I can‚Äôt be his mother, how I can‚Äôt police him, what happens when we have kids etc. His reasons have ranged from me leaving the house, our level of intimacy or lack there of, boredom, loneliness, my health issues/when I‚Äôm sick and not being busy with kids to fulfill him yet.

He‚Äôs been in therapy since June with a focus on substance abuse. He actually talks about his feelings and anxieties more, but never about the urge to drink. I accuse him periodically and sometimes I‚Äôm right and others times he‚Äôs just incredibly anxious. 

It‚Äôs now been three times in the past week after he was off of work for two weeks during the holidays. He drank throughout the holiday social events. His family are very big drinkers ‚Äì whiskey gift exchanges and tastings. No one in his family knows. He has so much shame the day after sneaking it and it‚Äôs always the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a piece of shit‚Äù language. 

On Sunday, I was away all day while a friend was trying on wedding dresses and I come home and it was so obvious. We were unexpectedly having out of town company stay over that evening because of the weather and proximity to the airport. He put himself to bed before they came over. 

I think something clicked over the holidays where he thinks he ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù a break where he‚Äôs tired of being vigilant and doesn‚Äôt want to complete a to do list to keep him busy.

He was being weird this afternoon and I asked whether he‚Äôd been drinking. We had a big talk about how much I worked this week and how lonely he was and also upset after Sunday. I pushed back, we talked about the way he talks about himself, the lack of hobbies, not hanging out or scheduling things with friends anymore, exercise, keeping busy, etc.

I went upstairs for not five minutes and come down to him in the liquor cabinet, which actually felt insane after the conversation we had just had and the place I had felt comfortable getting to. 

I don‚Äôt know how to detach yet or if it‚Äôs worth going down that path. We‚Äôve been waiting to have kids because of my health issues and we‚Äôre likely only a few months away from being cleared to start trying. I don‚Äôt want to subject kids to this and I don‚Äôt know if I want to leave either. 

He‚Äôs funny and kind and wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly. He‚Äôs not abusive or abrasive in anyway outside of the gaslighting when he‚Äôs trying to deflect when drunk. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just venting or typing to b process. ",2,1736680715.0,AlAnon,2,1.0,False

1hzkhom,https://i.redd.it/crtkq9mnpjce1.jpeg,Starbucks Korea's traditional artifact-themed products have been launched ,"Starbucks Korea's traditional artifact-themed products have been launched. For the first time in the Korean coffee industry, the company will showcase collaborative products inspired by relics from the Joseon Dynasty with the National Museum Cultural Foundation MU:DS.

It is a product developed with inspiration from relics of the Joseon Dynasty.

Under the theme of ‚ÄòJoseon, Meets Coffee‚Äô, the meeting between the Joseon Dynasty and coffee was expressed through various products such as cups and tumblers.

The four products that recreate the work ‚ÄòLee Han-cheol - Seo-ok Surrounded by Plum Blossoms‚Äô, an artifact from the National Museum of Korea, are mugs, tumblers, mats, and posters.

‚ÄòLee Han-cheol - Seo-ok Surrounded by Plum Blossoms Mug 355ml‚Äô, which captures the tranquil atmosphere of Seo-ok with plum blossoms in full bloom, and ‚ÄòLee Han-cheol - Seo-ok Surrounded by Plum Blossoms Mocha Tumbler 444ml‚Äô, which captures the joy of drinking a cup of tea while looking at plum blossoms on a snowy day.


It also consists of ‚ÄòLee Han-cheol - Seo-ok Surrounded by Plum Blossoms Table Mat‚Äô, which will add to the leisure of a quiet tea time, and ‚ÄòLee Han-cheol - Seo-ok Surrounded by Plum Blossoms Fabric Poster‚Äô, which will add a cozy atmosphere to the space.


 The ‚ÄòWhite Porcelain Embossed Plum Espresso Cup Set‚Äô consisting of an espresso cup with an embossed plum blossom and a coaster with a traditional pattern, the ‚ÄòWhite Porcelain Embossed Plum Blossom Ceramic Kettle (Teapot)‚Äô with an embossed plum blossom pattern on an elegant, round white porcelain, and the ‚ÄòWhite Porcelain Flower-Shaped Dessert Plate‚Äô with a neat and sophisticated design in the shape of fully bloomed flower petals will also be released in three types.


 Four kinds of products will be released on the Starbucks app online store and Naver brand store that reconstruct the works of Lee Han-cheol and Seo-ok surrounded by plum blossoms, which are relics of the National Museum of Korea. They include mugs, mocha tumblers, table mats, and fabric posters.


In addition, collaborative products that reinterpret white porcelain, a relic owned by the museum and a representative relic of the Joseon Dynasty, will be introduced sequentially through the Starbucks app online store. There are three types: an espresso cup set, a ceramic teapot, and a dessert plate.


Among the collaborative products, five types will be available at five Incheon International Airport and Jangchung Lounge R stores from the 20th, except for the ""Lee Han-chul-Plum-Surrounded Seok Fabric Poster"" and the ""White Porcelain Flower-Shaped Dessert Plate,"" which were released online alone.


In commemoration of the joint venture, Starbucks will present a leaflet note containing 40 pages and introduction of relics and collaborative products owned by the National Museum of Korea. The cover of the note was made by upcycling milk packs used by Starbucks.


In addition, when purchasing collaborative products through the Naver Brand Store for a week from January 13th to 19th, a Starbucks cafe americano tall-sized free beverage coupostarbucbs presented as a benefit of Naver New Week and an additional 5% of Naver Pay points will be accumulated.

- Richmond :or: Norfolk, VA
- Lancaster, Philly, or Pittsburgh, PA
- Athens, GA

The things that are most important to us are:

- Ability to find a decent paying job quickly ($15/hr or more)
- Ability to rent an apartment under $1600 within walking distance of coffee shops & bars
- Protections for workers rights and reproductive rights ( or low probability that Trump admin will be able to overturn these in said area )
- A large university in town

Things that would be nice

- Good Healthcare system
- Good Public transit or bike infrastructure
- Mildish climate

I'm willing to upgrade my machine for around ‚Ç¨1000. I usually drink about 4 cups of espresso a day. My wife does around 2-3 and usually with milk (cappuccino).

I use medium to dark roast beans from a local roaster (Lambo coffee Enschede). 

If I get a new machine i can easily move some things around (for easier access to the steam wand for example). 

I was looking at the Bambino Plus, but I think I can get something better for this budget? Preferably with a 58mm portafilter. Maybe a Profitec Go? Lelit Mara X? Or would a Gaggia Classic Pro suffice?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, the kitchen has transformed from a simple cooking space into a smart home hub that enhances efficiency and convenience. Imagine a kitchen where appliances communicate with each other and respond to your commands. This level of innovation simplifies cooking, meal prep, and even cleaning. Let‚Äôs explore the benefits of embracing a smart home kitchen.

### Streamlined Cooking Experience

A smart home kitchen makes cooking easier and more enjoyable. Imagine being able to preheat your oven from your smartphone while you‚Äôre still at the grocery store. You can also set timers and adjust heating levels remotely, ensuring everything is cooked to perfection. Smart appliances, such as smart ovens and slow cookers, offer preset cooking modes for different dishes. This means you can simply select a setting and let the appliance do the work, allowing you to focus on other tasks.

### Time Management

In a busy household, managing time effectively is crucial. Smart home kitchens save you time by automating everyday tasks. Here‚Äôs how:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen  
  
- **Smart Meal Planning:** Smart fridges have features that help you plan meals based on the ingredients stored inside. They can suggest recipes, keeping your family meals varied and exciting.
- **Shopping Reminders:** The fridge can track inventory and remind you when to restock items, reducing last-minute grocery runs.
- **Voice-Controlled Assistants:** Devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home can set timers, provide cooking tips, and even play your favorite music while you cook, all through simple voice commands.

### Energy Efficiency

Switching to a smart home kitchen not only increases convenience but also enhances energy efficiency. Smart appliances are designed to reduce energy consumption. For instance, smart refrigerators are more efficient than traditional models, keeping food fresher for longer periods. Smart lighting can automatically adjust based on the time of day, ensuring the kitchen is illuminated only when needed.

Additionally, smart home systems can provide insights on energy usage. You can monitor which appliances consume the most energy and adjust your usage patterns accordingly. This contributes to lower energy bills and a reduced carbon footprint.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen  
  
### Enhanced Safety Features

Your family‚Äôs safety is paramount, and smart home kitchens are equipped with several features to enhance this aspect:

- **Smart Smoke Detectors:** These devices can send alerts to your smartphone if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide, allowing for quick action.
- **Automated Shut-Offs:** Smart stoves often have safety features that automatically turn off if no movement is detected for a specified time, preventing kitchen fires.
- **Child Lock Functions:** Smart appliances can be programmed to lock settings, ensuring children cannot accidentally turn on the oven or microwave.

### Remote Access and Control

One of the most significant perks of a smart home kitchen is the ability to control your appliances remotely. Whether you‚Äôre at work, running errands, or on vacation, you can keep an eye on your kitchen. With a smart home app, you can:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen  
  
- Preheat appliances remotely.
- Adjust temperatures and cooking times.
- Receive notifications when meals are ready or when a fridge door is left open.

This level of control not only adds convenience but also helps you avoid food waste and makes meal prep significantly easier.

### Customization and Personalization

A smart home kitchen allows unparalleled customization. From programmable coffee makers that brew your favorite blend to personalized cooking settings in ovens, the possibilities are endless. Many smart appliances learn your habits and preferences over time, providing an even more tailored experience. If you have dietary restrictions or prefer specific types of cuisine, your devices can adjust suggestions and cooking methods to fit your needs.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen  
  
Integrating smart technology into your kitchen enhances not just the cooking experience, but your entire lifestyle. With improved efficiency, time savings, better energy management, enhanced safety, remote access, and tailored experiences, a smart home kitchen is more than just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a step towards a more connected and convenient way of living. Embrace the future of cooking and transform your kitchen into a smart home haven, where you can spend less time worrying and more time enjoying delicious meals with your loved ones.

Top Innovative Gadgets for Modern Home Kitchens
-----------------------------------------------

Your kitchen can be the heart of your home, and with the rise of innovative technology, it‚Äôs easier than ever to enhance its efficiency and style. For those looking to upgrade their home kitchens with modern gadgets, here are some of the top innovative choices that combine convenience, efficiency, and style.

### Smart Refrigerators

A smart refrigerator is a game-changer for any kitchen. These appliances come equipped with touch screens, Wi-Fi connectivity, and AI capabilities. Imagine being able to look inside your refrigerator from your smartphone while you're at the supermarket. Some models even have built-in cameras so you can check inventory before shopping.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen

### Smart Ovens

A smart oven takes cooking to the next level. Equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity, these ovens allow you to control them from your smartphone. That means you can preheat your oven on your way home or set timers while you are in another room.

- **Voice Control:** Many smart ovens are compatible with voice assistants, so you can preheat, set cooking temperatures, and more just by speaking.
- **Adaptive Cooking:** Some models even offer guided cooking options, providing step-by-step instructions.
- **Self-Cleaning:** Forget about scrubbing; many of these ovens come with a self-cleaning option that makes maintenance easy.

### Smart Coffee Makers

If you can‚Äôt start your day without a cup of coffee, consider a smart coffee maker. These devices can be programmed to brew coffee at specific times, ensuring your favorite beverage is ready when you wake up.

- **Easy Cleanup:** The flat surface allows for quick and easy cleaning, often needing just a simple wipe.
- **Energy Efficient:** They use less energy compared to traditional gas or electric stoves, making them an eco-friendly choice.

### Smart Dishwashers

Modern dishwashers have come a long way from just cleaning your dishes. Smart dishwashers connect to your Wi-Fi network, allowing you to control them remotely.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen  
  
- **Schedule Cleanings:** You can start cycles while you‚Äôre out, ensuring dishes are clean when you return home.

A smart food scale can make meal prep easier, particularly for those who need to measure portions for dietary reasons. These scales connect to apps on your phone, helping you track nutritional intake with ease.

- **Recipe Integration:** Input recipes to ensure accurate measurements for each ingredient.
- **Nutrition Breakdown:** Receive instant nutritional information based on the food you weigh.
- **Portion Control:** Keep track of servings to help manage weight effectively.

These innovative gadgets into your kitchen transforms it into a smart home kitchen, allowing you to streamline cooking, reduce food waste, and even improve family communication.

I awoke sometime later. Rolling over, I noticed the time and sat up with a start. What I had intended to be a 6-hour nap had in fact become a 12-hour one. I jumped out of bed and hurriedly made myself presentable. I straighten my blouse in the mirror. *I have two hours to prepare what I‚Äôm going to say to Father.*

¬†

Stepping outside my room, I walked up to Jack‚Äôs door and raised one of my upper hands to knock before thinking better of it. I continued to the officer‚Äôs mess. Jack was sitting in the corner with his feet propped up on a spare chair reading from a tablet. *I guess knocking on his door wouldn‚Äôt have mattered after all.*

¬†

‚ÄúMorning sleepyhead!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSay, where to they keep the coffee on this ship? I could go for a cup.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù I had never heard of this drink before.

¬†

‚ÄúYea, coffee. You know, the drink made of roasted and then ground beans in hot water?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI have never heard of that in my life.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBummer. Do you have an alternative caffeinated drink?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCaffeine? You know that‚Äôs a highly potent and addictive stimulant drug, right? Why would you willingly consume it?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHelps me wake up. But no matter, I‚Äôm plenty awake as it is.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you reading?‚Äù I said pointing to the tablet in Jack‚Äôs hand.

¬†

‚ÄúOh this?‚Äù He turned the tablet towards me, and I recognized the page of the Royal Science Committee on the screen. ‚ÄúI figured I‚Äôd read up on your planet, seeing as I‚Äôll be visiting soon.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting Jack to be interested in my home. ‚ÄúWell, what did you find?‚Äù I said pulling up a chair and sitting backwards on it.

¬†

‚ÄúWell, first of all, Theracksia is in in the Andromeda galaxy, so I guess I‚Äôm the first human to leave the Milky Way. Your planet orbits its home star noticeably further away that Earth does; its orbit is more similar to Mars.‚Äù He motioned to me, ‚ÄúOr Sol 4 as you would call it. As a result, years last 715 days. Days are of a similar length to Earth.‚Äù

¬†

Jack went on about the geology, sociology and culture of my home, all things I already knew. *It‚Äôs strange. I already know all this information, but all I want to do is listen to Jack teach me it again.*

¬†

‚ÄúI also found this!‚Äù Jack pulled up the site of the Royal family, specifically the article on me. ‚ÄúLook at you! You look so regal and proper!‚Äù Jack pointed to the picture of me in a royal dress at some ceremony I had long forgotten. I could feel my face complexion turn from its normal pale green to a bright red.

¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to read that!‚Äù I tried to grab the tablet from Jack, but he was faster and pulled it out of my reach, laughing.

¬†

‚ÄúToo late!‚Äù He said triumphantly. ‚ÄúIt was mostly extraordinary boring, to be honest. Mostly about the committees and clubs you‚Äôve been a part of, the laws you‚Äôve helped pass, or advocated against. That kind of stuff. Not exactly engaging reading.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, the life of royalty isn‚Äôt all excitement.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFair, but there‚Äôs a lot here for someone who‚Äôs only 28 in earth years.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat reminds me, I never asked how old you are.‚Äù Jack looked about my age, but I knew next to nothing about human maturity.

¬†

‚Äú26, or 13 in your years.‚Äù

¬†

The ship shuddered again, and Jack looked at me expectantly.

¬†

‚ÄúExiting warp?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYea. Come with me, we can see the landing decent through the forward observation room.‚Äù

¬†

I led Jack forward to a small relaxation suite at the bow of the ship.

¬†

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this a warship? Wouldn‚Äôt large windows be a weak point?‚Äù Jack referred to the panoramic viewing window that spanned the breadth of the ship.

¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre covered by an armored plate when in combat, silly.‚Äù I pointed to the large door that sat immediately above the window.

¬†

Jack shrugged ‚ÄúMakes sense I guess.‚Äù

¬†

Ahead of the cruiser was my home. I could see the snow-covered surface, with the distant lights of the capital city space-port visible against the white. We passed other warships in orbit and descended through the atmosphere. Breaking through the clouds, the captain set the ship down gently in one of the docks.

¬†

We exited into the port. Ship maintenance personnel milled about, tending to not only our cruiser, but also the other ships in dock, including one of our battleships. I noted extensive battle damage to its plating, and it was missing one of its quintuple plasma railgun turrets; a gaping and jagged hole had replaced it. We moved to the exit, towards the royal palace.

¬†

‚ÄúThis is the main spaceport?‚Äù Jack sounded concerned.

¬†

‚ÄúYea.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúLooks more like a military base than a transportation hub.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAll the ports have been requisitioned for the war effort.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou never mentioned you were at war.‚Äù Jack said, a surprised tone in his voice.

¬†

‚ÄúThose slavers we ran into belong to an entire slave empire. They call themselves the Sirukians. They‚Äôve enslaved half the galaxy at this point, and we‚Äôre simply their latest conquest. The thugs you killed weren‚Äôt true Sirukians, they were simply another race that had been enslaved and turned into foot soldiers. True Sirukians have six legs and a strong outer carapace if chitin. They have poisonous stingers for tails, and a humanoid torso with a compound eyes and mandible mouths.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre humanoid scorpions?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what a scorpion is to be honest.‚Äù

¬†

Jack pulled out a small tablet-like object from his pocket and fiddled with it ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs here somewhere,‚Äù he said under his breath. ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù He turned the device towards me. ‚ÄúI took a picture of an earth scorpion on my vacation to Arizona last year.‚Äù On the screen was a creature that looked very similar to a Sirukian, minus the humanoid torso. It had a pair of claws and a pair of small black eyes where a Sirukian‚Äôs torso would connect. Two further clusters of eyes were on the sides of the creature.

¬†

‚ÄúYea, kinda like that.‚Äù

¬†

We had arrived at the steps of the palace and stepped inside. The guards at the door didn‚Äôt bother us, but glanced worryingly at Jack‚Äôs weapon, still holstered on his thigh.

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a museum through there, since you seem to be so keen on learning about my world.‚Äù I said pointing to a hall to the left. ‚ÄúI need to talk to my father, alone. I‚Äôll come find you when I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAlright. Have fun!‚Äù Jack encouraged me.

¬†

*Fun is the last thing I plan to have.* Father was already stressed enough, what with having to fight a losing war against overwhelming enemies. This business of my new friend would likely not help.

¬†

Father was standing on the throne room balcony.

¬†

‚ÄúWelcome home Jasa.‚Äù he said in his characteristic monotone. Father never changed his tone for anything. He remained facing away from me, looking out over the city.

¬†

‚ÄúThere is much to discuss, daughter. But first is the matter of your guest.‚Äù He turned to face me. ‚ÄúWhat business does our people‚Äôs future queen have in entertaining alien guests?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFather, he rescued me, defended me. I believe he can help us,‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThe future queen should have been able to care for herself. The fact you needed assistance tells me you are not ready to lead. And Theracksia needs no outside help.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe need no help?!‚Äù I tried to control my voice like Father always did his, but my exasperation leaked through. ‚ÄúI saw the battleship in the dock. I saw the wounded as we walked here. The war‚Äôs not going well is it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTheracksia has faced troubles in the past, and we survived without outsiders. We will do it again.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs likely what half of Andromeda thought too and look where it got them!‚Äù I could no longer control my voice. ‚ÄúYou and the war council will be the death of our people!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYoung lady, you fail to conduct yourself like a royal should. Perhaps you have become too much like your new guest already. Remember, a royal is to feel nothing. Emotions will betray you and lead you wrong. Logic will free you and allow you to make correct judgements. I‚Äôll see you and your guest at the evening meal.‚Äù

¬†

Father walked past me and out of the throne room.

¬†

*He‚Äôs right. Emotions can lead to rash decisions. But can‚Äôt a ruler care for their people and rule soundly? Does it have to be one way or the other? Why is everything so black and white?*

¬†

I left the throne room and went looking for Jack. I found him in the museum examining one of our most ancient relics, a weathered rock with faint symbols painted on it.

¬†

‚ÄúThere you are!‚Äù He smiled warmly. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd the reunion go?‚Äù My face must have betrayed me, as he quickly continued, ‚ÄúThat bad, huh? Well, family is never without drama.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe wants us to join him at the evening meal, so we had better get going. No offense, but your current outfit would not be appropriate.‚Äù

¬†

We spent the afternoon at the clothes-makers, or Tailor‚Äôs as Jack called it, getting Jack a new suit. The tailor had to make some quick adjustments, namely removing one set of sleeves, but when it was said and done, it fit Jack well. Jack thought it was too much, but I thought it looked good, with a white ruffled shirt under an iridescent blue coat with matching pants, both with gold cuffs. A gold bowtie completed the outfit. After packing it up and retrieving the rest of Jack‚Äôs belongings to be stored in the palace, we went to dinner.

¬†

The table was set with enough food to serve an army. Father sat at the head and motioned to us as we entered.

¬†

‚ÄúCome sit, we have much to discuss. I have many questions, especially for you, Deathworlder.‚Äù

¬†

As we moved to sit, we were interrupted by warning sirens sounding outside. Our attention was immediately drawn to the screen and the end of the room. A feed from the space port showed dozens of Sirukian warships dropping out of warp, including five of their massive dreadnoughts. Father stood quickly.

¬†

‚ÄúStay here, I will go deal with this.‚Äù

¬†

Father left, and Jack and I sat. Both of us picked at the food, not eating much. Our attention was captivated by the screen. The five dreadnoughts were escorted by 12 heavy cruisers. 18 light cruisers and 28 light escorts formed and outer picket line. Hundreds of fighters swarmed about. Against them, Theracksia only mustered two battleships, 4 cruisers, 12 escorts and the Royal Barge, which father had retrofitted into a warship years ago when the Sirukian‚Äôs first threatened our planets.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hopeless.‚Äù I said in despair. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll never win.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúBut there are alternatives to fighting. Come with me, I have an idea.‚Äù

99% of these people live at home and are basically living rent-free and unemployed with mom and dad, who are happy to support them. Their art ""studios"" are either their own bedroom, or the garage/shed/spare room of their parents.

Which, don't get me  wrong, is honestly great.  Actual +1 for supportive parents, we need more of them in the world.

But the way that this is often portrayed is that they are out there living their independent girl  boss dream,  whereas really they're... not. 

The ones that actually DO support themselves and quit their jobs are often back in work (and in debt) within 3-6  months of quitting, from what I've seen. 

We are bombarded daily with news stories about how Gen Z is the ""poorest"" generation, how they struggle the most with basically everything - and here's a  handful of people doing the HARDEST CAREER  EVER TO MAKE MONEY IN and acting like it's a simple case of following your dreams and being a brave goddess about it all.

""My cosy slow living life as a cutesy wutesy 22 year old artist UWU"". Cue a 35 minute video  of an unemployed girl flouncing around to plinky-plonky piano music whilst she paints something totally indistinguishable from the other 100 girls making the same videos.

Ugh, no. Stop. Fkin stop.

It's so toxic. Take it from someone old enough to be a 22 year old's mother - the world does not work that way, and has never worked that way.  Not even ye olde Boomers could just quit a job to float around drinking coffee and painting pretty pictures in a plant-filled spare bedroom (sorry, ""studio"").

**YES you can make it as  an artist. But  you gotta be sensible. You gotta make that art money BEFORE  you quit, and essentially make it your career  while you're working a normal  job. And that can take years,  and requires meticulous planning and a good work  ethic.**",103,1736679203.0,ArtistLounge,38,0.89,False

I awoke sometime later. Rolling over, I noticed the time and sat up with a start. What I had intended to be a 6-hour nap had in fact become a 12-hour one. I jumped out of bed and hurriedly made myself presentable. I straighten my blouse in the mirror. *I have two hours to prepare what I‚Äôm going to say to Father.*

¬†

Stepping outside my room, I walked up to Jack‚Äôs door and raised one of my upper hands to knock before thinking better of it. I continued to the officer‚Äôs mess. Jack was sitting in the corner with his feet propped up on a spare chair reading from a tablet. *I guess knocking on his door wouldn‚Äôt have mattered after all.*

¬†

‚ÄúMorning sleepyhead!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSay, where to they keep the coffee on this ship? I could go for a cup.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù I had never heard of this drink before.

¬†

‚ÄúYea, coffee. You know, the drink made of roasted and then ground beans in hot water?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI have never heard of that in my life.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBummer. Do you have an alternative caffeinated drink?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCaffeine? You know that‚Äôs a highly potent and addictive stimulant drug, right? Why would you willingly consume it?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHelps me wake up. But no matter, I‚Äôm plenty awake as it is.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you reading?‚Äù I said pointing to the tablet in Jack‚Äôs hand.

¬†

‚ÄúOh this?‚Äù He turned the tablet towards me, and I recognized the page of the Royal Science Committee on the screen. ‚ÄúI figured I‚Äôd read up on your planet, seeing as I‚Äôll be visiting soon.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting Jack to be interested in my home. ‚ÄúWell, what did you find?‚Äù I said pulling up a chair and sitting backwards on it.

¬†

‚ÄúWell, first of all, Theracksia is in in the Andromeda galaxy, so I guess I‚Äôm the first human to leave the Milky Way. Your planet orbits its home star noticeably further away that Earth does; its orbit is more similar to Mars.‚Äù He motioned to me, ‚ÄúOr Sol 4 as you would call it. As a result, years last 715 days. Days are of a similar length to Earth.‚Äù

¬†

Jack went on about the geology, sociology and culture of my home, all things I already knew. *It‚Äôs strange. I already know all this information, but all I want to do is listen to Jack teach me it again.*

¬†

‚ÄúI also found this!‚Äù Jack pulled up the site of the Royal family, specifically the article on me. ‚ÄúLook at you! You look so regal and proper!‚Äù Jack pointed to the picture of me in a royal dress at some ceremony I had long forgotten. I could feel my face complexion turn from its normal pale green to a bright red.

¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to read that!‚Äù I tried to grab the tablet from Jack, but he was faster and pulled it out of my reach, laughing.

¬†

‚ÄúToo late!‚Äù He said triumphantly. ‚ÄúIt was mostly extraordinary boring, to be honest. Mostly about the committees and clubs you‚Äôve been a part of, the laws you‚Äôve helped pass, or advocated against. That kind of stuff. Not exactly engaging reading.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, the life of royalty isn‚Äôt all excitement.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFair, but there‚Äôs a lot here for someone who‚Äôs only 28 in earth years.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat reminds me, I never asked how old you are.‚Äù Jack looked about my age, but I knew next to nothing about human maturity.

¬†

‚Äú26, or 13 in your years.‚Äù

¬†

The ship shuddered again, and Jack looked at me expectantly.

¬†

‚ÄúExiting warp?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYea. Come with me, we can see the landing decent through the forward observation room.‚Äù

¬†

I led Jack forward to a small relaxation suite at the bow of the ship.

¬†

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this a warship? Wouldn‚Äôt large windows be a weak point?‚Äù Jack referred to the panoramic viewing window that spanned the breadth of the ship.

¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre covered by an armored plate when in combat, silly.‚Äù I pointed to the large door that sat immediately above the window.

¬†

Jack shrugged ‚ÄúMakes sense I guess.‚Äù

¬†

Ahead of the cruiser was my home. I could see the snow-covered surface, with the distant lights of the capital city space-port visible against the white. We passed other warships in orbit and descended through the atmosphere. Breaking through the clouds, the captain set the ship down gently in one of the docks.

¬†

We exited into the port. Ship maintenance personnel milled about, tending to not only our cruiser, but also the other ships in dock, including one of our battleships. I noted extensive battle damage to its plating, and it was missing one of its quintuple plasma railgun turrets; a gaping and jagged hole had replaced it. We moved to the exit, towards the royal palace.

¬†

‚ÄúThis is the main spaceport?‚Äù Jack sounded concerned.

¬†

‚ÄúYea.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúLooks more like a military base than a transportation hub.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAll the ports have been requisitioned for the war effort.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou never mentioned you were at war.‚Äù Jack said, a surprised tone in his voice.

¬†

‚ÄúThose slavers we ran into belong to an entire slave empire. They call themselves the Sirukians. They‚Äôve enslaved half the galaxy at this point, and we‚Äôre simply their latest conquest. The thugs you killed weren‚Äôt true Sirukians, they were simply another race that had been enslaved and turned into foot soldiers. True Sirukians have six legs and a strong outer carapace if chitin. They have poisonous stingers for tails, and a humanoid torso with a compound eyes and mandible mouths.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre humanoid scorpions?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what a scorpion is to be honest.‚Äù

¬†

Jack pulled out a small tablet-like object from his pocket and fiddled with it ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs here somewhere,‚Äù he said under his breath. ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù He turned the device towards me. ‚ÄúI took a picture of an earth scorpion on my vacation to Arizona last year.‚Äù On the screen was a creature that looked very similar to a Sirukian, minus the humanoid torso. It had a pair of claws and a pair of small black eyes where a Sirukian‚Äôs torso would connect. Two further clusters of eyes were on the sides of the creature.

¬†

‚ÄúYea, kinda like that.‚Äù

¬†

We had arrived at the steps of the palace and stepped inside. The guards at the door didn‚Äôt bother us, but glanced worryingly at Jack‚Äôs weapon, still holstered on his thigh.

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a museum through there, since you seem to be so keen on learning about my world.‚Äù I said pointing to a hall to the left. ‚ÄúI need to talk to my father, alone. I‚Äôll come find you when I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAlright. Have fun!‚Äù Jack encouraged me.

¬†

*Fun is the last thing I plan to have.* Father was already stressed enough, what with having to fight a losing war against overwhelming enemies. This business of my new friend would likely not help.

¬†

Father was standing on the throne room balcony.

¬†

‚ÄúWelcome home Jasa.‚Äù he said in his characteristic monotone. Father never changed his tone for anything. He remained facing away from me, looking out over the city.

¬†

‚ÄúThere is much to discuss, daughter. But first is the matter of your guest.‚Äù He turned to face me. ‚ÄúWhat business does our people‚Äôs future queen have in entertaining alien guests?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFather, he rescued me, defended me. I believe he can help us,‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThe future queen should have been able to care for herself. The fact you needed assistance tells me you are not ready to lead. And Theracksia needs no outside help.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe need no help?!‚Äù I tried to control my voice like Father always did his, but my exasperation leaked through. ‚ÄúI saw the battleship in the dock. I saw the wounded as we walked here. The war‚Äôs not going well is it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTheracksia has faced troubles in the past, and we survived without outsiders. We will do it again.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs likely what half of Andromeda thought too and look where it got them!‚Äù I could no longer control my voice. ‚ÄúYou and the war council will be the death of our people!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYoung lady, you fail to conduct yourself like a royal should. Perhaps you have become too much like your new guest already. Remember, a royal is to feel nothing.

We don‚Äôt really text much but most of our interaction comes from sending eachother posts on TikTok, Instagram etc. We will occasionally have short conversations but ultimately lead nowhere. Previously, I had sent her a post about an event that‚Äôs coming to town and her reaction was an excited ‚Äúdo you want to go!?‚Äù. I said yes followed by ‚Äúit‚Äôs a date‚Äù. She never said anything after that or acknowledged that comment but we did still do the normal of sending eachother random posts and short texts over the course of the next month or so.

Fast forward to a couple days ago where my friend told me that I should just be straight up and blunt with my attraction towards her. I agreed and so I texted her and said that I know I was a bit too casual about bringing up that date but in all honesty I was attracted to her and would want to take her on an actual date. She replied saying that she wasn‚Äôt sure what shes looking for but she is casually dating other people but after giving it some thought she would like to go on a date and see where it leads. A week later, we went on a coffee date this morning and walked around downtown looking at stores. The conversation was that similar to how friends would talk. It felt a bit too casual and not enough like a ‚Äúdate‚Äù. Looking back, the whole week I was so excited and nervous about it but I feel like it was a bit underwhelming. I don‚Äôt want to be too flirty or forward as I think I‚Äôm not sure what to do considering we‚Äôre technically friends. We did talk about that event coming to our city and she said ‚Äúwhen we go to it‚Äù so that gave me some confirmation on that. 

How should I approach this? At the end she did say that she enjoyed today. I agreed and said something along the lines of ‚Äúwe should do this again‚Äù. It seems like she hesitated a bit but did say ‚Äúweekends are an opening‚Äù ",2,1736678467.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Found this, and its bigger brother finished in French Oak, not pictured, today. 

My god the nose on this is a deep-dark sweet smell of chocolate and somewhat like walking into a Starbucks (in a good way).

The flavor punch off the first sip is all over the sweet spectrum and hard to narrow down. 

After letting it rest for 10 min, there‚Äôs the chocolate-caramel and light oak just begging you to drink more, so I did just that. 

3rd sip and a tiny bit of sweet spice reveals itself with yet another reminder of a top grade coffee lightly sweetened. Not over the top but just about where you would want it to be.

Over the course of 1 hour with this bottle it opened up a little more with an absolutely wonderful caramel linger on the palate. 

Overall this is a great bottle and I‚Äôm excited to see where it lands on the palate in about 1 month. While I‚Äôm not the biggest Amburana fan Found North (big shocker coming) ‚ÄúFound‚Äù a way to make this work the way an Amburana finished whisky should be!

1hzjz4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hzjz4r/dear_espresso_machine_its_over/,"Dear espresso machine, it's over.","A few years ago, I was gifted a nice espresso machine. Nothing too fancy, somewhere in the ‚Ç¨150-200 range. It was meant to free me from the tyranny of capsules, those convenient little pods that my friend loathed with a fiery passion. ‚ÄúYou *HAVE* to learn how to make proper espresso,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never look back.‚Äù Well, here I am, a few years later, looking back, because I‚Äôm officially done.  
  
Making espresso, I naively thought, would be a straightforward affair. Grind some coffee, press a button, and voil√†: a perfect cup of rich, aromatic goodness. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not that simple. It‚Äôs an obstacle course of coffee-induced frustration, and the reward at the end? Maybe a decent shot of espresso. If you‚Äôre lucky.  
First, you‚Äôre faced with an overwhelming choice of roasts and cultivars. Some claim to taste wildly different, but honestly, most taste‚Ä¶ fine. Not revolutionary, not life-changing, just fine. Then there‚Äôs the grind size, which has to be just right. Too coarse, and your coffee is weak. Too fine, and your machine might go into overdrive and refuse to brew anything at all. And then comes the preparation process, which requires the precision of a neurosurgeon. You can‚Äôt just scoop coffee into the portafilter and hope for the best. No, you have to measure it out *exactly* the right amount and tamp it down perfectly. Not too loose, not too tight. It has to be flat, but if you flatten it too much, the water won‚Äôt flow properly. Oh, and if the coffee doesn‚Äôt come out and your machine starts huffing and puffing? Guess what? That‚Äôs your fault too.  
Then there's the maintenance. The sheer maintenance required for this endeavor is enough to drive anyone to tears. Did you clean the filter? *Are you sure*? Because you need to check, *every  damn  time*. You have to wash it, dry it, and hold it up to the light to see if any microscopic pores are clogged. And if they are? Grab a needle and start poking. But don't poke *too* hard or you'll mess up your filter and then it will be trashed. But wait, there‚Äôs more! You also need to run water through the machine without the filter to flush out any rogue coffee grounds stuck in the system. And sometimes, the upper mesh won‚Äôt come off easily, so you‚Äôll be fiddling with it while the machine sputters and sprays coffee grounds all over your counter. It‚Äôs a never-ending cycle of clean, brew, clean again. Want another cup of coffee? Great! Time to repeat the entire process. First, remove the used coffee grounds by either banging the portafilter against the counter (messy) or rinsing it under the tap (also messy). Congratulations, your kitchen is now coated in coffee debris. Better grab that towel you‚Äôve wisely kept nearby because espresso machines are like toddlers: perpetually messy and completely unpredictable.  
  
Over time, I did manage to make some half-decent espresso. But the consistency? Nonexistent. The result is so dependent on a million tiny variables that I can seldom replicate the same coffee twice. Making good espresso is clearly an art. The thing is, I‚Äôm not an artist, and I don‚Äôt want to become one. I don‚Äôt care about optimizing water pressure, nailing the perfect temperature, or extracting the high and low notes from my grounds. I don‚Äôt need my coffee to be a masterpiece. I just want a cup of coffee. Simple, reliable, and mess-free. So, I‚Äôm calling it quits. Capsule coffee, drip coffee, whatever, at this point, they all sound like paradise. No more overthinking. No more maintenance marathons. No more coffee-covered countertops. To those who swear by the craft of the espresso: I salute you. But as for me, I‚Äôm out. Life‚Äôs too short to spend it cleaning filters and chasing the elusive perfect shot. I‚Äôll take my coffee without the drama please.

I'm in grad school and I have ADHD. Coffee is really helpful to me for focusing (it doesn't make me feel more 'awake' so much as 'zeroed in', which is nice). I know exactly which Starbucks drinks to get, for example, that are most helpful to me when I need to do different kinds of homework. I know exactly how they will affect me because the caffeine in them is strictly measured. 

But I'm also on a grad school budget and my school has coffee for sale for $2. It is just in one of those big dispensers, with milk and sugar available. 

I have zero issue with putting together my own drink, but where I keep struggling is how to measure the actual caffeine. What I want is what I do with Starbucks - one drink with x amount of caffeine and a lot of milk that I can more or less chug and hammer out an hour of homework with. But there's no way to measure the ""giant canister"" into the cups. How much is the right amount? If I put in less so I can add milk, is there then less caffeine? How can I get the equivalent of an espresso shot, into the cup, but also put in milk? ??????

The spring semester is starting soon and I want to figure this out. Would appreciate help. Because of the same ADHD, really, *really* specific instructions are helpful, like as much detail as possible if you can. Sorry. Thank you!!",0,1736677108.0,Cooking,10,0.3,False
