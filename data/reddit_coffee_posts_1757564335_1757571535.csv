Before, I used to shut it off after my cup of coffee by hitting the power button. Then it would automatically rinse and then power off. Recently, it does not power off on the first try. After my cup is made, I hit the power off button, it rinses, but then stays on and heats up the water again. I can hit the power button again during the heating or after it finishes and it’ll power off. I’ve never had to push the power button twice before.

A collaboration between me and multiple AIs using a comprehensive song review rubric. The AIs analyze lyrics while I provide the human ear—listening to your actual tracks to assess flow, catchiness, and performance issues that can't be judged from text alone.

**What's new this round:**

* New scoring standards – No more /10. We’ll label tracks with status tiers like Great, Good, Needs Development, etc.
* Improved genre-appropriate metrics – Hip-hop, folk, experimental, etc., each judged through relevant lenses.
* Emphasis on originality – Extra weight on whether hooks and concepts feel fresh vs. recycled.



**Reality Check:**

IMO most music being shared on the sub isn’t radio-ready, a lot of what gets downvoted likely deserves to, however hard that pill is to swallow. If your songs are already on Spotify/Amazon/YouTube and they’re your pride and joy, you might not be receptive to criticism—however constructive. Maybe wait for a thread where everyone seemingly gets 8/10 minimum no matter what, or share it here and accept the outcome (might be a banga).

**IMPORTANT**: This is for growth and improvement. I get no pleasure from being unkind—but I’m not here to delude anyone that a track is breathtaking when it needs work. That said, I’m not a professional, just a passionate music enthusiast.

  
**How to Submit:**

* Submit **one** song per comment (**welcome to send as many comments as you like**).
* Include your track link (Suno, Udio, SoundCloud, YouTube, etc.).
* **Include the lyrics (if they’re not on the song page)**
* I’ll be reviewing gradually over the weekend through Wednesday.
* I’m in New Zealand, so I might not be on when you are

You likely don’t have time to hear every submission on the sub but surely you can listen to these 10!  
Just because your song isn't on this Top 10 list doesn't mean i didn't really like it!

Bonus shout out to [Orra The Poet](https://suno.com/@orrathepoet) His personal experience war stories have helped him earn the highest song average of anyone who's submitted 3 or more songs. On the new status system they are all ""**Radio Ready""**  


Before you submit please know that **even professional songwriters rarely hit “Great.” on this Rubric**  
  
**Growth > ego.**

  
**I’m happy to do these reviews for free** (I genuinely enjoy listening to your music!).

1ne11w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1ne11w4/interested_in_aa_pickering_ontario/,"Interested in AA - Pickering, Ontario","I lost my job a month ago and trying to make sure I get up with a purpose, go to the gym and sort my shit out and replace my income as my family depends on me. 39 years old, and kids are 20/17/15. 

I feel like part of why I lost my job, I became complaceent and would drink and basically become a zombie and work the bare minimum. 

Family Started early, and glad we did, but man we had some challenges with the marriage and the time management as our kids are high level athletes. 

I’ve been sober fully 4 days and im irritable (wife played a joke and asked if im on my period, honestly a great jab back to me). 
Typically, I’d drink a box of wine in a day or two without issue, while my wife would have a glass and look at me disgusted as I keep going. 

Losing my job, money is a big concern (we’re ok for 5 months, maybe 4 as my son needs ADHD testing which is nearly half a month old salary and benefits
Cutoff end of Sept.).  Needless to say as I type this, the day 4 goes back to 0. 

Since I’ve started the gym I definitely feel better and more in control to shut down so I can do the gym the next day, but these old habits (demons) have a way to take over. 

I feel like the worst part is my wife who has very minimal addiction history in her family understanding my side and the release that’s chased by me at times. My brother died 4 years ago at 39 due to fentanyl. I’m not like him, but I am…? I dunno what to say there. I do dumb shit very rarely but I do (maybe tonight?). The feeling of guilt leads to depression for days. 

My father had major back surgery and got
Hooked on pain pills. To this day he still drinks and takes the pills with no real intent on improving himself and his health. 


My brother, He had drug issues his whole life, and no matter the support and funds given, he could not get himself out of it. My parents were rockstars with what they gave him to help and it cost them their marriage. 

He had a severe crack and cocaine addition. Mine is more when I drink too much and I’m open for more? While I could afford other
Habits, my life lessons taught me to avoid most times, except tonight…? 


I look up to you guys able to stay sober. Cheers.

I need a solid sponsor / support who’s been through some shit to talk to. Anyone in the Toronto area, Pickering specifically, I would be game for a friend to meet sober and have some coffee and chat about life and how to really stay sober. Maybe a workout friend as that really seems to help or someone I can go to when the mind takes over. 

Since I got terminated I’ve been going to the gym and it really helps my mental wellbeing, not just physical. It’s pretty crazy but I still fall backwards and hide it from the family as best I can. 


Sorry for the rant. Anyone in the area who may be able to help as someone to talk to, 
appreciate you reaching out. I’d love a no judgment zone and someone to open up to as a male, that’s hard to find.

1ne11hi,https://v.redd.it/vhekiwdt6hof1,Should I move to a finer grind? [Breville Barista Express],"Hi all
Recently purchased a HE Filter basket, paper filters and a puck screen - which has changed my shot significantly. Shot tastes great and I feel like it is within the window (18g, 26 seconds, 36 ml) but I’m used to the shots being pulled a lot slower and darker - still within the window and dosage. 

The other issue is I’m starting to see more bubbles at the top of the coffee, quicker than what usually happens (15-20 seconds after pouring the milk in they start to form) which usually happened after a few minutes left sitting. 

Is this normal? Or was I just pulling bad shots before the upgrade?

1ne0zf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheapButGood/comments/1ne0zf8/how_to_stop_being_clueless_about_money_before_its/,How to Stop Being Clueless About Money (Before It’s Too Late),"We all know *that person* at parties. The one who confidently blurts out random “finance wisdom” they inherited from their grandparents while sipping watered-down punch. Ten minutes later, the accountants in the room are quietly judging them, and boom, you’ve just earned the title of *money moron*.

Don’t be that person.

Money is confusing enough with jargon, bad advice, and get-rich-quick scams everywhere. The good news? You don’t need an MBA or Wall Street internship to get your finances in order. You just need to avoid the rookie mistakes and follow some time-tested principles.

Here’s a **comprehensive guide** to go from money moron → money master.

# 1. Own Stuff (Don’t Just Work for Stuff)

* Cutting out lattes won’t make you rich.
* Wealth comes from **owning assets,** businesses, stocks, real estate, or anything that grows and makes money while you sleep.
* A job caps your income. Ownership scales it.

**Examples:**

* Invest in low-cost index funds (S&P 500, etc.).
* Buy dividend-paying stocks or REITs.
* Start a side hustle or small business.

*Think of it this way: working pays your bills. Ownership builds your future.*

# 2. Use Your Youth Wisely

* Your 20s and early 30s are the best time to take risks.
* Fail a business at 23? You’ve got decades to recover. Fail the same business at 45 with a mortgage and kids? Whole different story.

**What to do:**

* Start small side hustles, freelance gigs, or e-commerce experiments.
* Learn in-demand skills (coding, marketing, design).
* Network like crazy, mentors save you years of mistakes.

# 3. Remember the Only Equation That Matters

>Revenue – Expenses = Income

That’s it. The whole personal finance game.

* You can’t cut your way to wealth (spending less has a floor).
* Growing revenue has unlimited upside.

**How to play it:**

* Ask for raises, change jobs, or freelance for extra income.
* Cut *big* expenses (housing, cars, debt) instead of obsessing over $5 coffees.
* Invest the difference instead of lifestyle upgrading every time you get a raise.

# 4. Budget Like a Bad-Ass (Without Being Miserable)

Budgeting isn’t about deprivation, it’s about control.

**Simple frameworks:**

* The 50/30/20 rule → 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/investments.
* Automate your savings so you don’t have to think about it.
* Track where your money leaks (apps like YNAB, Mint, or even Excel).

Pro tip: Focus on *big wins*. Dropping your rent or refinancing loans saves thousands more than skipping Netflix.

# 5. Stop Overpaying for Everything

Negotiating isn’t just for sharks, it’s for anyone who doesn’t like lighting money on fire.

**Examples:**

* Cars and houses: always negotiate.
* Call your internet/phone provider and ask for a better rate (works more often than you’d think).
* Use cashback sites for everyday purchases.

Every dollar saved is a dollar you can invest.

# 6. Start Yesterday

* There’s no “perfect time” to start a business, invest, or get serious about money.
* The earlier you start, the more compounding works for you.

If you invest $5k a year starting at 25 → \~$1.7M by retirement.  
Wait until 35 → \~$700k.

Future You will either thank you or hate you.

# 7. Don’t Forget Money’s Real Purpose

Money is just a tool. If you only chase numbers, you’ll never feel “rich.”

* Spend on experiences (travel, time with family) → more lasting happiness than stuff.
* Define what financial freedom actually means for you.
* Use your wealth to give back... charity, mentoring, scholarships.

1. **Diversify Income Streams** → Don’t rely on one paycheck. Build side hustles, investments, or rental income.
2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts** → Max out your 401(k), IRA, or HSA before Uncle Sam takes more than his share.
3. **Build Financial Literacy** → Read books, listen to podcasts, and keep learning. Money compounds, and so does knowledge.
4. **Protect Your Wealth** → Emergency fund (3–6 months), insurance (health, auto, life), and a will/trust if you’ve got dependents.

# Quick Reality Check: Common Money Myths

|Myth|Reality|
|:-|:-|
|“You need a high income to be rich.”|Nope. Saving/investing matters more.|
|“Renting is throwing money away.”|Not always. In some cases, renting + investing beats buying.|
|“You need to time the market.”|Consistent investing beats market timing 80% of the time.|
|“All debt is bad.”|Wrong. Productive debt (mortgage, business loan) can build wealth.|

# Final Word

Being smart with money isn’t about memorizing Wall Street jargon. It’s about:

* Owning assets.
* Taking risks early.
* Spending less than you earn.
* Growing your income.
* Starting *now*.

Do those consistently, and you’ll avoid the “money moron” label forever.",1,1757570085.0,CheapButGood,0,1.0,False
1ne0xoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Practical-Second76/comments/1ne0xoy/why_choosing_a_digital_marketing_agency_in_new/,Why Choosing a Digital Marketing Agency in New York Can Give You a Competitive Edge,"These days, businesses in virtually every industry are faced with the struggle to remain visible and relevant. As I have uncovered through research, companies investing in digital marketing are achieving greater brand awareness, more effective customer engagement, and enhanced sales growth than counterparts not investing in digital marketing services. This is especially valid in an extremely competitive hub like New York, where each business is gang-fighting for consumer attention. Selecting a digital marketing company in New York is not only a decision—it is a growth plan.

Market research indicates that New York-based organizations, which utilize the professional marketing industry in total of marketing services, have much more internet exposure than organizations managing their campaigns in-house. If New York brands utilized a digital marketing agency, they would experience the knowledge, tools, and strategies needed to convert clicks into customers.

# The Role of a Digital Marketing Company in New York

A New York digital marketing agency isn't only focused on running ads. They offer a variety of digital marketing services like SEO, PPC, social media management and content marketing services. From my perspective these services are intertwined to create long term organic visibility for brands.

For example, social media ads can capture an audience for local Manhattan restaurants while finance firms in Brooklyn can build trust and authority through seo. Each industry has its own challenges and that is where a professional digital marketing services in New York company comes into play to develop tailored solutions.

# Why Businesses Prefer Digital Marketing in New York

As part of my research, I found that businesses in New York face a tougher environment than smaller cities. Businesses need to create next-level marketing strategies to get potential customers' attention. Here are several reasons companies choose digital marketing New York.  

* **Competition**: New York has thousands of businesses in every niche.  
* **Target audience**: With digital ads in an urban setting, businesses can target by demographics, interests, and even location of viewers.  
* **Measurable**: Digital marketing provides businesses with real-time analytics compared to traditional advertising.  
* **Cost-effective:** Google Ads and social campaigns give businesses more control over their budgets and ROI.  

# PPC and SEM: The Backbone of Digital Growth

Market research shows that paid advertising is still one of the quickest ways to gain online visibility. A Google PPC expert will help ensure that each dollar spent will have measurable resultsPay-per-click can generate immediate traffic to your website with Google Ads specialist tactics or targeted keyword terms.

 By employing an AdWords PPC expert, companies can update campaigns for optimal conversions. An example of this could be an AdWords PPC consulting specialist in New York would be able to take a second look at ad copy, bidding strategies, and conversion tracking all while maximizing ROI. These consultants that I've learned about do not just manage campaigns, they study and analyze market trend data that can allow your business to grow over time.

**Search Engine Optimization: Long-Term Brand Visibility**

While PPC yields short-term results, SEO builds a foundation for long-term visibility. A professional digital marketing agency New York offers keyword research, content creation, and backlinking as a part of growing a business to rank higher on Google. 

During my research, I came to learn that over 70% of all search traffic is generated by companies that rank on the first page of Google. If you are serious about investing in SEO, it should not be considered optional - it is necessary, local or global, it will drive aggressive revenue and growth.

**Social Media Marketing: Building Engagement and Loyalty**

Social media isn’t just for posting an update. Market research shows that consumers in New York will become more engaged with brands that are socially present. As we have accessed more social platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok) they have become more powerful tools for storytelling and engagement.

An digital marketing services in new york company create strategies leveraging paid social ads, influencer collaborations, and community engagement. These strategies help clients share their stories, build personal connections with audiences, and generate loyalty with repeat business.

# Content Marketing: Educate and Influence Your Audience

Content marketing is still one of the biggest pillars of digital growth. As far as I recall, businesses that publish frequent, high-quality content generate 3x the leads as businesses that do not. A digital marketing agency in New York City often recommends content strategies including blogs, videos, infographics, and email newsletters. 

Combining SEO with meaningful information allows businesses to position themselves as leaders in their industries. For example, law firms messaging out articles about new regulations while a fashion brand sends out a seasonal trend guide.

**Email Marketing: The Underestimated Powerhouse**

Email might seem old-school, but as I researched, it is still one of the best returns on investment in spending in digital marketing. As a result, companies can use emails to follow up with leads, advertise products, and engage customers to create long term relationships. 

One digital marketing company in New York utilizes automation, segmentation, and good content to ensure email is a sustainable revenue stream.

**Web Design and Development: Creating Strong First Impressions**

A poorly designed website can cost businesses leads and sales. According to research, users form their first impression of a website in only a few seconds. This is why a digital marketing agency in New York often has web design and website development as part of their offering.  

Each and every detail matters to make a properly organized website, from fast loading pages to mobile responsiveness. A proper website will bring visitors but will keep visitors on the site long enough to convert them into clients or customers.

**Analytics and Performance Tracking**

A very strong advantage of digital marketing New York is having access to comprehensive analytics. Companies can measure each interaction with their ad, including every click, impression and conversion. This allows companies to modify campaigns on the fly and maximize returns. 

An

When an AdWords PPC consultant looks at the number of clicks, cost-per-click (CPC), and conversion rates, they can appropriately figure out if the performance of ""the campaigns"" was positive or negative. Likewise, an SEO consultant understands how far that consultant's rankings have improved, how much traffic the site is experiencing (trends), and each consultant builds their own strategies/actions accordingly.

**Local Marketing: Reaching Customers Where They Are**

Local marketing techniques like optimizing a Google My Business listing, using location-based ads, and local SEO are vital for New York businesses. As I've read, 78% of local searches result in offline purchases.

Whether it's a coffee shop in Queens, or a health club in the Bronx, online marketing services in New York will help your business reach nearby customers looking for their products or services.

**Competitive Advantage of Hiring a New York Digital Marketing Agency**

Working with a New York digital marketing agency gives you a competitive edge that your in-house staff can't offer. An agency provides:

* Access to up-to-date tools and technology
* Access to a team of specialists: SEO strategists, content developers, and PPC managers
* Flexible solutions that grow with your business
* Research-based insights into the industry

As per my knowledge, businesses that collaborate with agencies experience faster growth compared to those that rely solely on internal resources.

# Conclusion

In the fast-changing world of digital marketing, selecting a digital marketing agency New York is much more than a decision - it's an investment in your future. Based on my research, companies following expert-led procedures in SEO, PPC, content and social media will outperform their competitors.

By hiring a digital marketing agency New York, brands will have access to additional tools, proven procedures, and skilled professionals to ensure every campaign can be measured. If you need a Google PPC expert, a Google Ads expert, or AdWords PPC consultant, you need a digital marketing agency New York that can provide world class solutions.

Ideally, the portions should be divided into two fruit and three vegetables. Raw vegetables should alternate with steamed or cooked vegetables.

[**One portion**](https://ifnh.ethz.ch/) corresponds to the size of your own fist – the portion for a child is therefore much smaller than that of a grown man.

On average, one portion of cooked vegetables corresponds to about 200 – 300 grams, raw vegetables 100 – 200 grams, salad 75 – 100 grams, pulses in their raw state about 70 – 100 grams, fruit 125 – 150 grams and vegetable or fruit juice 200 milliliters.

Ok but I'm sick of the bin bag liner to protect laptop and other things.. So I'm looking for something and wondered what others use. 

My commute is 45 minutes train then 10 minutes ride each end in a town. Not demanding ride so I'm thinking another drybag rucksack and perhaps spend more than £43 this time for something better.

So I'm curious what others use. The distance part of the question is to compare against my commute.

Obviously anything from about 30 minutes ride plus then I'd prefer it to be on the bike which means convertible pannier really I think. That's not me so rucksack I think seems the best option.

Trouble is the commuter ones tend to be waxed cotton or simple bag with a couple of flat pockets. Like stubble and co. My preference is some outside pockets for insulated coffee mug and empty water bottle (save weight on commute by filling up at work). Also the side pockets aren't stretch so their use means losing inside space. All seen inadequate design, more about look than use to me. I'm all about use / function then look.

I carry laptop, food, paperwork and filofax / notebooks (I'm analogue a bit more than most). I can just any manage with my 23 litre Brompton large metro bag when I used to ride my Brompton (now use a road bike as train isn't busy enough to need as folding bike).",1,1757568744.0,ukbike,2,1.0,False

1ne0goh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ne0goh/i_27f_read_my_boyfriends_32m_journal_and_hes_been/,I (27F) read my boyfriend’s (32M) journal and he’s been lying to me. Is it enough to end it?,"Okay I know it sounds bad that I read his journal. To be fair, there were good intentions. I didn’t have any weird “gut feeling” that anything was off and I wasn’t trying to catch him in anything. I was perfectly happy and in love. 

For context, we’ve been together 11 months (our anniversary is in 2 weeks) and over that time, we’ve helped each other grow tremendously and had countless amazing times together. I’m so attracted to him and really proud to be with him. I think/thought(?) that he’s an incredible person and I lucked out finding him. 

This all changed earlier this evening when I read his journal from the first 6 months of our relationship. I’m blaming myself for reading it and wishing I could go back and undo it, because then I’d be blissfully ignorant and happy still. Unfortunately, what I read was a huge shock. 

Why did I read the journal in the first place? Hear me out. Here are my good intentions- he’s a writer, and on one of our first dates I told him about The Artist’s Way. It’s a workbook that can help creatives deepen their craft when they feel stuck. I ended up gifting him the book and part of the program is keeping daily journal pages. Cut to 11 months later and he’s feeling inspired, writing a lot, and we’re even collaborating together on ideas for a novel. We had the best night-in a few days ago just drinking wine and firing off plot ideas. At the end of the night he told me how much he loved me and appreciated my support of his writing. He then shared an anecdote about Stephen King’s wife originally finding the manuscript for Carrie in the trash, pulling it out and encouraging King to work on it further. And then Carrie became Carrie. He was giddy telling me about this and likened our night to that titular moment for King. 

In light of this conversation bringing us closer and feeling inspired, I decided to read through his Artist journal pages to see if I could find any great bits of writing worth including in his pending novel. He tends to be insecure and critical of himself, so I thought he might have deemed an idea “not enough” when it had potential. I was looking for another “Carrie” feeling moment and (I can’t lie) I wanted to feel like a muse, lol. Cue the clip of Julia Fox. UNCUH GEHMS

However. The first page I read, I knew I fucked up. This wasn’t writing he was working on. It wasn’t even mostly about his craft. It was a cold, callous monologuing that sounds completely different from how my boyfriend speaks to me. He wrote about me, other women, and our relationship in a way that I can’t even put words to. It broke my heart. I’ve never felt so betrayed and lied to. It makes me sick imagining those first 6 months when I was falling in love with stars in my eyes, giving him all the vulnerability and intentionality, meanwhile he was TELLING me he was feeling the same… then going home to WRITE about how he’ll have to “use me for what I’m worth”, “convince me to have a threesome in due time” and how “she’s not my dream girl, but she’ll do”. 

I can’t even type it out without sobbing. I feel empty and so incredibly betrayed. He didn’t show me an inkling of this cold, unemotional way of viewing me. He refers to me repeatedly as an object, or a means to an end. He lists the ways I’m not enough. He lusts after my friends, even saying that he only went to coffee with me to meet my out of town best friend so he could “behold her tits in person”. I’m sick. 

This isn’t even the worst part. After our first few arguments, his journal entries are disturbing. When the honeymoon phase faded and shit got real, I thought we were doing a great job communicating. Come to find out (and I NEVER would have known it had I not read this), he was placating me with apologies in person and going home to journal about how he “wants to kill me” and “the bitch should kill herself”.

I’ve been angry at people before, and I’ve thought horrible things. I’m human. But I have NEVER EVER. EVER. thought anything like that about someone I love. It has wrecked me. 

I’m doubting if what he’s shown me and told me over the last year is true at all. When journaling the morning after the first time I told him “I love you”, he wrote “I said it back to her, so now I guess I have to justify it to myself”. 

I feel like I’ve been strung along like a puppet and manipulated and used. But… the most repulsive part is that I still feel deeply in love with him. It’s fresh, so this may change, but at this point I can’t imagine not being with him anymore. I can’t parse through what’s real and what’s fake. His spoken and written narratives are just too different. 

Please give me any advice you have. Is this enough to leave without a discussion? Am I missing something huge? Could this be some fucked up writing exercise? I feel like I’m living the plot of Verity. Just f*cking help. ",0,1757568152.0,relationship_advice,11,0.4,False

Di naman toxic environment sa work namin, sadyang sya lang nakikita kong toxic. Medyo power tripping din kasi minsan di ka nya hehelp dahil lang ayaw nya. May time pa non na i tried exploring things tapos sinabihan akong pabibo in front of others. I can say na love and hate relationship kami. Kasi pareho kami girl. Medyo ate turing ko sakanya. Andami nyang pabiro na below the belt. Like nung nag coffee kami nakashort lang ako and sinabihan ako na p*kp0k dahil lang nakashort ako. May times na nagsasabihan kami ng prob pero i stopped na magkwento or pili nalang nung nafeel ko nang andaminb beses na tinake nya yung weakness mo againsts you.

Sobrang frustrated ako lalo nung new hire pa ko kahit yung on time ko na pag uwi pinupuna nya knowing na need ko habulin yunh shuttle at nasa 3hrs pa byahe ko. Palagi nya kinukumpara sarili nya sakin na sya nga mag isa nya lang inaral to so dapat ako din. For context mga 6yrs na exp nya sa company namin kaya medyo alam nya na tlg lahat. Di ko sya macall out kasi helpful naman tlga sya in terms of tasks sa work kasi nga senior na sya. Pero eto after 3yrs resigned na ko, nagrerender nalang. Di ko masabi na isa sya sa reason ng pag alis ko kasi may times tlaga na ambait nya naman sakin tlga. Pero feeling ko di naman yun reason para itolerate mo yung panbubully sayo. Anghirap lang. like alam ng iba na may attitude tlga sya. Nung nag APE kami pati height namin kinocompare nya panay tanong sya sakin like twice nya naitanong at di nya daw matanggap na .1 lang daw lamang nya.

Sobrang upset ko kasi like kahapon maggroufie kami pero tinulak nya ko again as a joke pero talagang may force para di ako sumama sa pict and tumatawa sya sympre.

1ne0d72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ne0d72/aitah_fell_in_love_then_got_blocked/,AITAH fell in love then got blocked,"I was asked on a date through social media. I went to the same HS as this man but we did not attend that HS at the same time. I had only ran in the same circle a couple of times as a teen and a couple times in my early twenties. He had a gf and she then became his wife and I was with someone else too. Fast forward to present day. I’m horny I had been celibate for ten years and he had just gone through a dissolution. When he asked me out I was very forward when he asked what I wanted to do straight away I said skinny dip. I knew what I wanted and I went for it. We have the date have the sex have so much fun. He is blowing me up says he is crazy about me. Sex was fun. A little weird. He has a hard time orgasming that was the first time I ever experienced a man having to try to orgasm and it took forever …. Hours! He said it was bc of alcohol. I kind of knew it wasn’t me because I had hooked up with someone else that brought me out of the celibacy and that person could barely last 5 mins. But I didn’t mind I really liked him. I had a trepidation at that time. His ex wife had just moved out three weeks ago and that REALLY bothered me. He wanted to keep things on the DL so she wouldn’t find out. So I told him I wasn’t really about that. He keeps trying and blowing me up and then I get horny again and text him and it’s back on. I go to his house again and we have four wonderful nights together we eat sleep have sex laugh swim under the moonlight. It was so much fun. I am falling more and more each time we are together. He tells me I am pretty caresses my face, kisses my forehead. Wraps his arms and legs around me when we sleep. Holds me all night. Brings me coffee in the morning, has me meet his friends his son, we are talking day and night. He is in my face the entire time and I absolutely love it and I just wanted to follow him around like a puppy and do whatever he wanted me to do. And that scared the ever living hell out of me bc I DONT KNOW HIM. There were red flags but I ignored them and that scared the ever the ever living hell out me. Red flags: talks bad about the ex and her body, he lost weight fixed his testosterone now is horny wife wasn’t horny so he left her but he kept the family home, his eyes would light up every time I talked about my sister or other beautiful women I know, he drank and drove, loves to drink (I don’t drink but I was ok with it but like how can a drunk guy protect me?).
So after the last date I was conflicted I was triggered I’m starting to panic. I am having thoughts like oh no I am gonna start my period what am I gonna do to keep him and so he doesn’t go for someone else. He cheated on his wife I am sure he will probably cheat on me too. But wait! We are not even a couple AND when I go home I have to finish myself off. What the fuck am I doing?!?! So I text him and tell him I had to finish myself off and we are acting like love but we aren’t a couple and can we just tap the brakes and take a break from talking. He does what he always did and send rapid texts one after the other. Sorry I’m not what you wanted hope you find what you are looking for. Remember when I said he had that look in his eye when I talked about the pretty women I know ….. he said give your single cousin my number. Boy did that hurt my feelings. After that I was just a cunt. At first I said sure no problem then he did the rapid texts again. Hope everything works out hope we can be friends I said no that last comment pretty much kicked friendship out the window he then apologizes and says it was just a joke and I need to relax I said it’s about as funny as me saying I want to fuck all your friends. Then he said it’s not the same but ok. And then I said “ you wouldn’t be able to make her cum either” then we didn’t talk for a couple days. He keeps trying to messages me on social medias and I don’t play into it but we agree to just be cool with one another. Then he messages me on a dating app and his messages just piss me off. He tells me he is getting 50/50 in response and I say well the best advice I ever heard was to not swipe when you are horny and he says that he is f bc he is always horny. I said yea bc you might be several dates in and have to sit through listening about their ex just to not orgasm. Then he blocked me on everything the dating app and every social media. This was over the span of  three weeks. We were at a same event recently and he walked side by side with me and acted like I was a stranger. AITAH?

I have a client who owns several juice shops/cafes in a city with 1m+ people.

They have a very strong social presence and get thousands of branded searches a month. We've done all of the following since we first started with them about 7-8 months ago:

* Built 100-200 citations per store + ran all through an indexer
* Built a location page for each store location with Google Map embed, content describing the location, keywords, and local descriptors 
* Optimized Google Business Profile title and descriptions with main target keywords
* Optimized Google Business Profile primary and secondary categories
* Linked each Google Business Profile to the proper location page
* Generate 3-5 reviews per day from outreach efforts + respond in timely manner
* Add new photos that show products sold at the stores
* Build 4-6 backlinks per month from sites within their city + niche-relevant websites

Usually, this is more than enough to get our clients into the map pack. 

Since we've started our campaign, they've shot up onto the first page of Google Maps but now growth is starting to plateau. 

Furthermore, only about 10-15% of their shops rank in the map pack for keywords like ""juice near me"" or ""smoothie near me""

When I look at the Google Business Profiles ranking above them, there are a lot of smaller establishments with fewer reviews, backlinks, and unoptimized content on the site. I'm going to guess they also get fewer branded searches just based on what I see on Ahrefs.

The only thing I can think of separating us is website content and what I mean is that my client doesn't link to their menu anywhere on the site. 

Currently, you can only find their menu page by scanning a QR code in their stores, so their menu is essentially an orphan page. 

But there's no way it's ONLY their menu, right? I feel a little skeptical that not having their menu page featured on the site is keeping them from the map pack, especially since we manually added their menu to each Google Business Profile. (with images)

So, if anyone here does SEO for coffee shops, juice bars, restaurants--anything where customers are going to a storefront--how important is your menu page and is there anything else I'm missing?",1,1757567156.0,localseo,3,1.0,False

**AITAH for telling my SIL that breastfeeding is not about her journey but about her starving baby?**

&#x200B;

So I've published the first part of this story before on breastfeeding and mommit subreddits and I've been made feel like a monster because ""mother knows best"". For the record, we are in Europe. I'm sorry for my English, and also I'm extremely emotional.

My SIL Julia gave birth to a little Amanda 11 weeks ago. From the beginning, Amanda was barely growing, mostly losing weight instead of gaining. My country is heavily pro breastfeeding and Julia decided that she wanted to breastfeed. However, Amanda wasn't gaining weight properly and landed in 0.1 percentile for weight.

Julia forbade me and my mum from coming to visit them. She said we will poison her if we bring her food. It was surprising especially that before she gave birth, we were good friends. So we only saw little Amanda on pictures and videos my brother has been sending to us. And only once, my mum said she's worried because Amanda looked like she's hungry (she was crying and writhing, pushing her fists into her mouth) while Julia narrated on the video that this is how a happy baby looks like with a full belly. So my mum asked if Julia cannot give her a bottle because Amanda still seems hungry.

Julia went berserk and cut us off completely. She was pumping but her supply didn't go up at all. Amanda had a tongue tie resolved but it didn't help much. Julia was using donor's milk to top up Amanda's feeds through a sonde (I don't know what this thing is called).

Now, every week they're visiting a doctor's office for a control checkup of the weight. This is where it gets really messy. They were there yesterday. And yesterday, my brother called us crying that Amanda is in the hospital.

The story went like this: As always, Julia asked my brother to bring her coffee before the weighing appointment while she's using the nursing room to change Amanda's nappy. As always, he did. Except this time, a nurse went in in the middle of it to ask Julia about some paperwork. And the nurse saw that Julia was feeding Amanda from a bottle right before the check up... the bottle was 150cc of milk and it was already half down. The nurse said that Julia was supposed to wait with feeding until after the checkup, and then my brother came in.

He got very mad. He said that Julia refused giving Amanda the bottles so wtf was going on. Then he took the bottle, and at the same time Amanda vomited with a very, very thick milk. Nurse went crazy and checked the bottle and it was filled with milk mixed with rice cereal.

The doctor who's been called to see it immediately ordered moving Amanda to the hospital for an emergency check up especially after seeing Julia who went berserk and started throwing stuff around and yelling at everyone that she will be feeding her baby however and whenever she wants.

We went to the hospital to see my brother. Amanda already had her blood tests done and they showed some problems with kidneys, liver and vitamins level and iron. The doctors said she has been starving for a long time and why nobody from our family reacted. We told them the story about Julia claiming that we will poison her.

So the doctors immediately took Julia for a psych evaluation for PPD, but... turns out she was faking it. She admitted to the doctor (she was super scared that somebody might take the baby from her) that her friend told her that if she fakes PPD, we will leave her alone and she will have peace of mind during her breastfeeding.

The doctors then told her that what she did was not okay and that she was regularly stuffing the baby with milk and cereal before the weight checkup so as to pretend that Amanda grew. And that she should just give Amanda bottles with formula because this is about the little girl's life and survival as she's now failure to thrive and her life and health are in danger.

Julia got very mad. She yelled that she will either breastfeed Amanda or she won't feed her at all and that the choice is only hers because this is her baby and nobody else's.

Now this is when the doctors told Julia that either she will go for another psych evaluation or they call the police. Julia agreed for the evaluation and they locked her for a week.

My brother is working 14 hours per day because they are poor and after their wedding Julia decided she wants to be a traditional wife and he has to earn their living. So my brother said that whatever Julia is doing, it must be right. But after seeing what was happening, he got super mad. He said that she starved Amanda on purpose for her own sick satisfaction even though he was working hard on providing money so they would be able to buy formula if needed. He said he wanted divorce and full custody over Amanda. We don't k ow if he will get it because it's rare for dad to take care of their daughters. Also the doctors are mad at him that he didn't notice what Julia was doing.

Before Julia went to the ward, I got angry and told her that she made monsters out of us and that we were just worried about her and Amanda. And that thos whole situation was always only about Julia and her ""breastfeeding journey"" and not about Amanda's life. She called me a b*tch and said I should’ve died in childhood because nobody can love an autistic person like me.

AITA?

*NTA. Julia is very mentally ill and was willing to kill her baby to maintain some weird illusion.*

>OOP:
The doctors say she may have schizophrenia or some kind of psychosis or very dangerous mania. But if after the evaluation they find out nothing she probably won't get Amanda back.




**Curious-One4595**

*NTA, obviously. Regardless of what Julia's diagnosis is, she is not safe to parent poor little Amanda. Obviously, the infant's needs come first, regardless of what journey a parent wants to make.
Based on my work with abused and neglected children, the idea that ""mommy knows best"" is sadly very wrong in many cases, and fatally so in some.*

*Thank you for posting this. As somene who was raised by a seriously mentally ill mother and who could never get help or protection because nobody believed that a mother would do what my mother did, I am really grateful to you. People like you raise awareness that mothers can be abusive and raise the chances of children getting protected.*

This is heartbreaking to read. Your niece’s health should always come before your SIL’s pride or desire to exclusively breastfeed. It sounds like the doctors are finally stepping in, which is good, but your brother really needs to wake up and advocate for Amanda before things get worse.


>OOP:
He admits he made a lot of mistakes. He said he always trusted Julia and wanted the best for her and Amanada. He says he hates himself for what happened.

>My mum said we'll help him financially as much as we can. I also hope Julia will be okay. I really liked her before everything that happened and she was always kind to me and was never bothered that I'm autistic. But mostly I pray for Amanda.

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

I got so many comments under my original post and so many private messages that I am unable to reply to each and everyone so I figured I'll post a short update.

First of all, our little Amanda is doing good and stays in the hospital. She's being fed with formula and bottles (my brother had to agree to this) and since yesterday gained 30 g. She had more tests done and we're waiting for the results. The doctors are also worried about the fact that Julia forcefed Amanda with cereal mixed with donor milk before the appointments because apparently it can cause some problems with digestive system in the future especially that they don't know for how long she's been doing it and she doesn't want to admit it.

Secomd, thank you all for your support. Also, thank you for the comments stating that we let Amanda down and put her in danger. Me and my mum realise it and we feel terrible about it.

Some people were questioning what happened because my previous post in other groups stated that Julia is feeding Amanda and that she's doing everything she can to provide milk for her. And yes that is true, this is what we knew at that time. We didn't know Julia decided that it's either breastmilk or nothing at all. She only said this in front of the doctors.

My brother took vacation at work and most of his time he stays with Amanda but he will be moving in with us. All this time he's been working and later doing overtime under the hand and he feels exhausted but says he had no other choice. He promised he will do everything he can to be a good father.

We don't have any information about Julia but no matter what we worry about her. She's our family as well. She doesn't have her own family (she said before the wedding that she and the rest of her family had a fight and they cut her off so she is alone in this world and we felt very sorry for her).

We managed to get in touch with one of Julia's friends Linda who was donating milk to her. Linda was terrified with the story and admitted she was the one who told Julia to pretend that she's afraid of us poisoning her. All of it because Linda's MIL was demanding to visit them after the birth so she used this excuse for people to leave her alone. And apparently Julia said to Linda before giving birth that Amanda is only hers and only she has the right to hold her, and Michael (my brother) if really needed. And I don't understand this because my mum never asked to hold Amanda. In the hospital, two days ago, it was the first time we saw Amanda in real life.

Linda also told us that she introduced Julia to The Milk League (???) and there she found out all the bad things about formula and bottle feeding. Also it turns out she never wanted to vaccinate Amanda but my brother forced her to. Linda said she recommended Julia a couple of lactation consultants who apparently weren't real educated LCs but some women with instagram accounts claiming to know a lot about breastfeeding.

This is all for now. This is all the information I gathered. The most important to me is that Amanda is safe with the doctors and nurses. I will update whenever I know something more if you want.

**0fluffythe0ferocious**

*So not only was this woman starving her kid, she was purposely surrounded by people who were also misinformed to a dangerous degree.
I'm glad the baby is safe now but I honestly don't think SIL should ever be near a child again.*

**One-Chipmunk3386**

*This just kept getting worse. I don't know who is worse your brother, Julia or Linda. Julia and Linda tie honestly*


**LifeOpEd**

*FED is best! I tried to BF, and it went nowhere fast. My son lost too much weight in the hospital because everyone was pushing breast feeding. I got home, and my mom vetoed everything the hospital experts told me. That boy was fed formula immediately and I started pumping so I could better monitor his intake. I was only producing maybe half of what he needed, so he was on both his entire infancy. He is now a weirdo, stinky, HEALTHY, smart, well-adjusted tween.*

**DamnitGravity**

*FED really is best. Nothing else matters. If a parent's priority is not 'fed' then they are not fit to be a parent.*


**SlytherinPaninis**

*My poor mum struggled BF me (1985) and the nurses berated the fuck out of her. As soon as they got home, formula it was. And I was fine.*



**2dogslife**

*There are plenty of babies - like those adopted or delivered via surrogate, who are raised on formula. While breast milk does offer some benefits, it's not SO great that other alternatives aren't considered.
This has been such a horror story to read. At least the doctors found out the truth and now steps can be taken to get that kid back up to speed.*

**JustAsICanBeSoCruel**

*You might want to reach out to her family to see if this is the latest in a longer history of mental illness. 
They might be able to assist on getting her help.*


>OOP:
The doctors told my brother to do this and he will try.



**FelineCompanionCube**

*Hopefully he tries a bit harder than he did at being a proper parent. Anyone with half a brain cell can tell the difference between a fed baby, and a starving one. Even if he was working 16 hours a day, all it takes is 30 seconds to look at his child.*

*I've been told by 2 different family lawyers that (at least in the US) a large reason that fathers have the alleged difficulty in getting sole custody is simply because they don't try. They assume they won't get it, so they don't fight for it. In his case, his wife tried to starve her baby because she's crazy. So he better step up.*

*I suspect that his hours will actually go down if he isn't having to pay for his wife's needs on top of his child.*


>OOP:
The doctors told him that he screwed up and that he is a parent too. We're afraid they'll take Amanda away because of it. My mum already scheduled a meeting with a lawyer

**New Update**


&#x200B;

**Update - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

HAPPY NEWS Amanda is currently at our home doing very good.

Before I start with the update I want to specify that: A - I don't know everything. If the story is missing details then I'm sorry but I can't provide more as I'm very often not in the place where the conversations or revelations take place. I rely only on what I'm told. B - our attorney told me that for the good of our family and most of all Amanda, I'm not allowed to share the details of the ongoing case. There are many people involved now, many authorities. I need to keep my family safe, and most of all Amanda. We owe her the best. So I won't be answering the questions about: is Jugendamt involved, are there any charges and what are the charges, interrogations, court, usw. Please don't ask me these questions because I won't answer them.

Now to the update.

AMANDA

She's out of the hospital, currently placed in our family house. We will have daily visits of nurses who are going to check up on her and on us and make sure that she's growing well and that we're taking good care of her. Currently she gains around 35-40 gram per day which the doctors say is an amazing result. She is also pink now and not grey and is very interested in everything. I was scared to hold her because I've never held a baby!!! But my mum showed me how and Amanda was smiling to me and playing with my braid. My older sister came to live with us for the time being and help us so everyone can get enough sleep and be a present caregiver. Amanda is eating every 3 hours around the clock from a bottle. She's getting a high calorie formula and she seems to be fine. Tomorrow she will have another blood test done and we're hoping for the best.

We asked the doctors a couple of days ago to ask Julia to give us some breastmilk for Amanda if she's willing but Julia didn't agree. The doctors told us that she stated once again that either she's feeding her baby from her breast or she won't be feeding her at all. So formula it is.

JULIA

As far as I know, she's probably still in the psych ward as she didn't return home. We don't know what's going on as she cancelled all the permissions she gave to my brother to know about her health. So nobody can tell us anything right now. Before she cancelled the permissions one of the doctors told my brother that she has a strong narcissistic personality but they believe there's more to this.

MICHAEL

My brother knows about his mistakes. He's taking some sort of parenting classes and being in therapy and is working on himself to prove that he can take care of Amanda. He will be fighting for full custody. I can't tell about other things that are going on so basically that's it about him. But he found out something interesting that he shared with the doctors of the psych ward.

JULIA'S FAMILY

So my brother manmaged to find them through social media. And when he told them about Amanda and everything that happened, Julia's parents immediately wanted to come to visit but Julia's vather has problems with mobility so instead they invited Michael to them to talk.

Now this story is how Michael told us. If there are missing details I'm sorry but this is all I know for now. There were more things I think but later he decided to talk to my mum behind the closed door.

So Julia was raised in a religious family in a small town. She has one younger brother Sven. Her parents said that Sven was always a very sickly child. He was always ill, always with weird diseases that made no sense. Like sudden fevers and stomach bugs when nobody else had them. Sometimes he would have bones broken, like fingers or toes, and he couldn't explain why and how did that happen. So the whole family had to take care of him, and because they had no sitters Julia was always with them in the hospital when they needed to take care of Sven (mostly on weekends).

So this isn't really weird because I was always hurting myself with stupid things so I can relate.

But then they said that when he was 18, Sven took all his belongings and moved out of the house and began working in the city. He only sporadically reached his mum to tell her he was fine and he wasn't sick anymore. Julia was very upset when Sven moved out and her parents said that she was always super super close with Sven and they were always together. She was angry afterwards, she was breaking plates and glasses and even once made a hole in the wall after she threw a chair onto it. So her parents asked her to move out. She moved out and soon after she met my brother. They were together for less than a year before the wedding because she said she is from a very religious family and she cannot wait.

Now the thing is that Julia is like super super pretty. And my brother.... Well, he's my brother. So he was really into her, and he really wanted to be with her especially that she was educated and he is working simple jobs and he was always admiring her for her knowledge (and that's one of the reasons he never questioned what she was doing with Amanda, especially that Julia told Michael multiple times that she is the smart one in this house).

Shortly before the wedding Julia reached out to her parents demanding money for the wedding dress and wedding party as well as inviting them. She also pushed for her brother to come. But when the parents called Sven to tell him about it he said he will never be in any proximity to Julia, not after what she's done to him. He broke down and said that all his illnesses were caused by her. She forced him for example to eat raw potatoes or old cottage cheese and once even a random animal poop she found in the fields (???????). She also used to play with him violently and he always ended with broken fingers, toes and wrist (3 times). So the parents went berserk (I'm skipping here the part about how they were quarreling and trying to find out if everything was true, but apparently it was true). They said they don't want to see their daughter again anymore and she won't get any money and if only they knew who her fiance is they would reach him and warn him to not even think about marrying Julia. But they didn't know Michael back then as Julia refused to introduce him to her parents before the wedding.

Michael got pretty mad at Julia's parents that they didn't try to warn him but they later said they honestly started thingking Julia is making up the whole wedding thing as she used to lie a lot when she was a teenager and young adult and that she just wanted money from them. So the parents didn't do any effort to find Michael, but instead focused on Sven and helping him (which is totally fair).

So that's the story for now. I felt sick when Michael told us about Sven. It was a couple of days ago and I'm still feeling shocked and bad. It feels so wrong. Especially because Julia was always kind to me. She never tried to hurt me (I know her for almost 1.5 year). Michael told about it to the doctors but they couldn't say anything because of the lack of permissions.

So for now, this is it. I'll update more when I can.

**mcmurrml**

*I had a feeling she was hurting her little brother as I was reading it!!! You must tell whatever authority involved in her case. She must NEVER be unsupervised with this baby. They need to know and her brother needs to know as I hope he would testify to help this innocent baby.*

>OOP:
And I still don't understand how it is possible that she hurt Sven because she never tried to hurt me. Except maybe for that awful comment a bit more than a week ago.




**SarcasticAzaleaRose**

*Because you can talk and fight back and tell people she’s hurting you. Sven and Amanda couldn’t do any of those things so that’s why Julia hurt them but never hurt you. People like her target vulnerable people who can’t fight back. It’s also why she isolated Amanda from your family and did her best to keep your brother away from her too. So she could keep hurting Amanda without interference.*

*As Sven got older and was able to talk she probably told him no one would ever believe him and that’s why he didn’t tell them till years later. He was too scared to either out of fear of Julia hurting him again or because she made him terrified that he wouldn’t be believed.*


>OOP:
I know I am naive, and my mum always tells me that I believe people too easily. But I just can't figure out what Julia would gain with this behaviour. If she is sick like some people here say then I get it. But why wouldn't she ask for help? When I had problems in school because I'm autistic and I was abused by my colleagues I asked my mum for help.



**SarcasticAzaleaRose**

*We all want to believe people are good so don’t beat yourself up about that. You had no reason to believe anything otherwise about Julia until she couldn’t hide her true colors any longer.*

*Abusers, psychopaths/sociopaths, and people who suffer from Munchausen’s by proxy rarely think they’re doing anything wrong or that they need help so they never seek it out. Julia didn’t ask for help probably because she didn’t think there was anything wrong with her or her behavior. That was probably only further fueled if her family was praising her for helping with Sven.*

*In your case with your problems in school and with colleagues you knew that their behavior was wrong and you needed help managing it. Julia and people like her don’t think that way. They know society doesn’t view their actions as ok but they don’t care because they believe they’re doing nothing wrong or that they have a right to act how they are.*

//jcgreen_72//

*I'm so happy you got to meet her, and to hold her! That must have been so special, I loved reading that. Thank God she's safe now with you and your family. I hope she continues to grow and be healthy and soon be a happy little chubby baby like she is meant to be 💛.*


>OOP:
Thank you 
She is so tiny and I was so afraid to hold her. I'm very clumsy but my mum helped me and it was something extraordinary. I won't ever have kids so I appreciated this moment of our first meeting even more. And she even held my finger and she's so strong!!!


**Eerie_Grimoire666**

*I’m so glad Amanda is healthy again and is in the best care with your family.
As for Julia, she definitely sounds like she has Munchausen by proxy as she was secretly making Amanda sick to get attention/sympathy. She’s clearly unwell and is a danger to Amanda.
I would encourage your brother to write everything down as for evidence/documentation even the statements from Julia’s parents and Sven so that they can help to give your brother full custody of Amanda.
Even ask Julia’s parents and Sven if they’re comfortable to give their statements so Michael can gain full custody of Amanda.*


>OOP:
My brother is in contact with the attorney and he says everything Michael needs to do and yes, that includes collecting statemens and evidences. Thank you

I just bought a Casabrew Ultra that came in the mail yesterday. So far, I really like it. It’s a decent step up from my Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista. However, I’m curious about my grind size. On my Fellow Opus, it has a scale on the inside of the lid that shows the grind sizes for the various styles of coffee prep (see 1st picture). It shows that a 1 to 3 is ideal for espresso. However, I have it set at one click past 4 (4 and 1/4) as any finer than that and the shot pulls extremely long. At a 3 and 3/4 (2 clicks down from where I have it now), it pulled 36g in 47 seconds with an 18g dose. 

I’ve added pics of the grind before distributing and tamping. The shots taste alright but not amazing so I’m wondering if there’s a fundamental flaw in what I’m doing. What do you guys think?",0,1757566990.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

I love the feel of heavier uncoated papers and the look of processes like risograph or screen printing. I had planned to use risograph, but the colours didn’t quite come out how I wanted, and now I don’t have time to go with this method. I’ve also looked at giclée printing, though that feels a bit over the top for this use.

What I’m really after is a way to get high-quality prints on nice paper with a bit of texture and a quality finish.

1ne00py,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ne00py/my_most_recent_manic_episode_got_me_a_lifetime/,My most recent manic episode got me a lifetime ban from Disney,"This was about a year and a half ago and I just felt like sharing. For several months during mania, I had practiced staff-spinning, and actually got pretty good at it. Through the voices and influences of psychosis, I got the “download mentally from the universe” that I was meant to be Mulan, and staff-spin in front of the Asian section in Epcot to “inspire people to see I’d returned.”

I bought this African staff at one of the sections (a real beautiful one, too, that was taller than me and cost me $280), and proceeded to walk with it to the Asian section.

I was twirling it as I walked, and let’s just say with how I was dressed, twirling this staff, I looked threatening. But not to manic me, no. To manic me, I looked “inspiring, whimsical, and fun!”

When security approached me, I set the staff down when I realized how I looked, flipped them off, which then aggravated the hell out of them. One of the main guys, who seemed like a supervisor, not security, then told me to leave the park and that I was to come with him.

I said “hell nah” and skedaddled on my own to one of the park exits that entered into the hotel. That’s not the exit, I basically just trespassed. It happened to be a few steps away from where they stopped me, and I in my manic state said, “aha! Tell dazzling old me to exit? I shall! On my own terms!” I proceeded to get followed by him and a huge security team. They kept following me as I walked about a mile from that hotel to another one down the street. They sent an entire security detail and about 4 police cars to track me down. 

When I went into the second hotel, they waited outside (I thought they stopped following me). I got a coffee and sat in the outside patio and kicked back. That’s when one of the cops came up to me and talked to me, I cried that “I was just trying to have fun and all these meanies are just trying to ruin it.” Or something like that. He was nice, and then escorted me outside. Believe it or not, all the cops (there were like 10) were super chill with me since at that point I was non-threatening and suddenly cheery, funny, silly, and personable. 

But big boss man Disney was not happy letting some lunatic run around the park. That one supervisor I mentioned was waiting outside the hotel the police escorted me to with his arms crossed, two men in suits beside him, standing next to a police cruiser with a very official looking clipboard on the hood and a fingerprint stamper there. I, suddenly filled with excitement, was so honored that I was pursued for something so “silly” in my mind, and thought it would look “cool” to get in trouble.

So anyway, they were happy to see I complied, I stamped the ban paper with my prints, and that was that. Police gave me a ride back to my car, were super chill, and even told me how to get the ban removed because they felt I got “banned unfairly.”

From kitchen sinks that back up during meal prep to slow bathroom drains that turn showers into shallow baths, clogs can throw off your entire routine. The good news? With a little knowledge and preventative care, you can avoid the headache altogether. And when prevention isn’t enough, you’ll know where to turn for reliable Drain Cleaning in Merrick.

This blog will discuss the primary reasons for clogs, helpful preventative measures, and the significant impact of having a qualified drain cleaning expert like Johnny Rooter on your side.

**Why Do Drains Clog in the First Place?**

Before learning how to stop clogs, it’s important to know why they happen. Drains work hard every day, carrying away water, food particles, soap scum, and waste. Over time, these substances build up and form blockages.

**Common culprits include:**

* **Grease and Oil:** Cooking grease may look harmless when hot, but once cooled, it hardens into a sticky clog magnet.
* **Hair:** Bathrooms are especially vulnerable since hair easily tangles with soap residue to form knots.
* **Soap Scum:** Regular bar soap can leave behind film that narrows pipes.
* **Foreign Objects:** Kids’ toys, floss, or even “flushable” wipes often create hidden problems.
* **Mineral Buildup:** Hard water leaves behind deposits that gradually shrink pipe openings.

Knowing what goes down your drain is half the battle. The other half is building healthy habits.

**Smart Habits to Prevent Drain Clogs**

The best way to deal with clogs is to prevent them before they start. Here are some effective strategies:

**1. Use Drain Screens**

Placing a simple mesh strainer over sink and shower drains can catch food scraps, hair, and debris. Empty them regularly for best results.

**2. Dispose of Grease Properly**

Instead of pouring grease down the sink, let it cool in a container and toss it in the trash. This one step can prevent countless kitchen clogs.

**3. Flush with Hot Water**

Once a week, run hot water down your drains to loosen up minor buildups before they become stubborn.

**4. Be Cautious with Garbage Disposals**

Avoid fibrous foods like celery, potato peels, and eggshells in your disposal, as they often lead to jams and clogs.

**5. Switch to Liquid Soap or Body Wash**

They leave behind less residue than bar soap, reducing bathroom drain buildup.

**6. Educate the Family**

Sometimes, kids don’t realize that toys, wipes, or paper towels don’t belong in the toilet. A little education goes a long way.

**Natural DIY Drain Maintenance**

While chemical drain cleaners are tempting, they can corrode your pipes over time. Instead, try these natural, eco-friendly methods:

* **Baking Soda & Vinegar Flush:** Pour half a cup of baking soda followed by half a cup of vinegar down the drain. Wait 15 minutes and flush with hot water. This fizzing action helps break down buildup.
* **Boiling Water Rinse:** A quick pour of boiling water down the kitchen sink once a week can keep grease and soap from solidifying.
* **Salt & Baking Soda Mix:** Pour equal parts salt and baking soda into the drain overnight, then rinse with hot water in the morning.

These simple remedies can serve as regular maintenance, though they won’t always solve major clogs.

**When to Call the Professionals**

No matter how careful you are, some clogs are inevitable. Signs that it’s time to call a professional include:

* **Water Backing Up:** If your sink or shower fills instead of draining, the clog is already advanced.
* **Slow Drainage in Multiple Areas:** This could indicate a bigger issue in your main sewer line.
* **Unpleasant Odors:** Foul smells mean waste or food is stuck and decomposing.
* **Recurring Clogs:** If you’re dealing with the same problem repeatedly, a deeper cleaning is required.

At this point, DIY solutions often won’t cut it. That’s where professional [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-cleaning/) becomes essential.

**Why Professional Drain Cleaning is Worth It**

Hiring experts not only solves the immediate clog but also prevents future ones. Professional services:

* Use advanced tools like hydro jetting and motorized snakes to clear stubborn blockages.
* Inspect your pipes with cameras to identify hidden problems.
* Provide long-lasting solutions, not just temporary fixes.
* Save you money in the long run by preventing costly pipe damage.

**Frequently Asked Questions About Drain Cleaning in Merrick**

**1. How do I know if my drain needs professional cleaning?**

If you notice slow drainage, gurgling noises, recurring clogs, or foul odors coming from your sinks or toilets, it’s a sign you need professional drain cleaning. These symptoms often mean that a blockage is forming deep inside your pipes.

**2. How often should I schedule drain cleaning for my home?**

For most households, scheduling professional drain cleaning once a year is a good preventive measure. However, larger families or homes with older plumbing systems may benefit from more frequent cleanings to avoid major clogs.

**3. Can chemical drain cleaners damage my pipes?**

Yes, chemical drain cleaners can corrode pipes over time and cause leaks. They might provide temporary relief, but they rarely solve the root cause of the clog. That’s why professional [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-repair-and-installation/) is a safer and more effective option.

**4. What’s the best way to prevent kitchen sink clogs?**

The key is to avoid letting grease, oils, coffee grounds, and fibrous foods go down your drain. Using a strainer to catch food particles and regularly flushing with hot water helps keep kitchen sinks flowing smoothly.

**5. Are “flushable” wipes really safe for toilets?**

Despite the label, most flushable wipes do not break down quickly and can cause major blockages in pipes and sewer lines. It’s best to dispose of them in the trash instead of flushing.

**6. Why should I hire Johnny Rooter for drain cleaning in Merrick?**

1ndzx52,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1ndzx52/i_love_my_husband/,I love my husband,"My husband is a great man alhamdullilah. Everyone has ups and downs but as long as you’re there for the ups and still there at the downs that’s what’s most important. I’m working on being kinder to my husband because he’s put up with all my stress from the big change that comes with marriage and moving I finally feel comfortable after 1 year. 

Back story: we met 6 years ago, when he first met me he told me I’d be his wife and that he knew it, asked me for my moms number so his mom could call my mom to come over for coffee so it can be a halal relationship and my mom said no. We waited 5 years until she finally let me marry him. She said “I could do better” and “try talking to other people and I did and allowed him to but we always came running back to eachother. My husband sold his house, his business and left his family to live in the same city as me because he didn’t want to make me move. He lived about 25 mins away from me just so we wouldn’t be tempted to have a haram relationship and see eachother often. When we did see eachother he was always very respectful and didn’t do anything that would upset my parents because he knew one day he would face them and he wanted to with a clean conscious. My mother finally accepted him and is a pretty good husband to me. 

He’s always so kind, and when he’s not he owns up to it and does better. Sometimes I feel I don’t do enough for him because I work full time and it’s hard for me to run a business, cook, clean and grocery shop but he helps me. I want to be better for him, I truly love this man. 

Moral of the story, don’t try to force anything or fall into the trend of getting married because it’s time. What’s meant for you will always find its way to you. Also a man knows from the first look if you will be his wife, if you both don’t know from the first look you’re wasting your time ",5,1757566213.0,MuslimMarriage,1,1.0,False

1ndzonu,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ndzonu/the_roommate_i_never_saw/,The Roommate I Never Saw,"What if one morning… you woke up in your own apartment.

Everything was in place.  
The coffee cup tilted exactly three degrees.  
The fold in the bedsheet—too sharp, too perfect.

Perfect in a way that didn’t belong to reality.

Would you believe it was real?  
Or worse… realize someone had already done countless things here—  
things you once tried to forget.

I always believed I lived alone.

Until breakfast began to disappear.  
Toast. Coffee. Scrambled eggs I never remembered cooking.

At first I thought—maybe I forgot.  
Maybe I sleepwalked.  
Or maybe… it was my roommate.

That sounded reasonable.  
Except… I had never actually seen him.

We had an arrangement:  
Different schedules.  
No knocking.  
No questions.  
No contact.

Only a few messages.  
No emojis.  
No typos.  
Every word clean, exact—like typed by a machine.

Strange. But it worked.

Too well.  
So well that it no longer felt like two people sharing a space.  
It felt like one person… living with a rough draft of themselves.

The longer I stayed, the more I felt I hadn’t moved into this apartment.  
I had been fitted into a gap already carved out.  
Tailored to my height. My breathing.  
My memories.

The apartment sat at the end of the third-floor hallway.  
Not big. Not small.  
Complete in every way.

But missing one thing:  
Any trace of a life.

The air felt frozen mid-motion.  
No scent of clothes.  
No stale food.  
Only sterile stillness—like a waiting room no one had ever entered.

The couch: unmarked.  
The pillows: untouched.  
The kitchen: spotless.

No background noise.  
No echo.

As if the space was preserving itself… for someone who wasn’t me.  
Or worse—for someone who had been here… and was erased.

A fresh coat of paint laid over a memory that never had the chance to form.

I looked around.

No photos.  
No notes.  
Not a single scratch on the floor.

Only perfection.  
Perfection so complete it broke logic.

As if this place had been reconstructed from the memory of someone who had never truly lived here—  
only imagined it.

The wall clock was frozen.  
3:04.

I tried to wind it.  
It didn’t respond.  
No one had bothered to fix it.

As if that exact moment had been chosen.  
And no one had permission to change it.

Or worse—  
that wasn’t when everything stopped.  
That was when everything began.

I stepped into the bathroom.  
A towel hung over the mirror.

I pulled it away.

Just a mirror.  
Clean. Smooth. Spotless.

But I felt something stir behind the glass.  
The back of my neck tightened.

Not from cold.  
From the sense of being watched.

Not by light.  
By a thought I hadn’t yet had.

I never linger on mirrors.  
Not because I’m afraid.  
But because the reflection unsettles me.

The light never seems to reflect quite right.  
A gaze slightly out of sync—  
as if it comes from the other side.

No sign of anyone ever living here.  
But the mirror had once been covered.

As if someone had been here.  
And tried to erase their presence from the world.

And I began to wonder:  
If someone had already been erased from this place—  
what guarantee is there…  
that I won’t be next?

I couldn’t tell if I was imagining too much…  
or just missing the changes happening right in front of me.

At first — only little things.  
The slippers I left apart… lined up side by side the next morning.  
The toothbrush that had fallen — back in place.  
Not turned. Not tilted.  
Not off by a single degree.

So I started testing.  
Turned a chair.  
Flipped a carton of milk upside down.  
Pushed a pen off the table.

By morning… everything was reset.  
Not half a centimeter off.  
Neat. Precise.

But too precise.  
As if life itself had been pressed flat.  
Replaced with a reconstruction — perfect enough to suffocate.

At first, I thought — my roommate.  
An obsessive neat freak.  
That made sense… until I measured.

The chair — still tilted at the exact angle I left it.  
The pen — lying in the same spot, same direction.  
No scratches. No shift.

As if something unseen was quietly rebuilding the world around me.  
Not from what I did…  
but from what it remembered of me.

And if it wasn’t me…  
then who was controlling the rest of this reality?

I asked myself that every day.  
Until one night… I realized something worse.

I wasn’t choosing anymore.

I woke up — exactly 3:04 a.m.  
Not from a sound.  
Not from light.

My eyes just opened.  
On schedule.  
Like it had been written in.

And then… I heard it.

Footsteps.

Slow.  
Steady.

Moving through the hallway like a metronome hammering into my skull.  
Each beat like a knock inside my ribs.  
Not outside — but from within my chest.

Each step was probing me.  
Testing for whatever life was left.

I froze.  
Held my breath.

It felt like… if I moved, the sound would change.  
And I didn’t want to know what it would change into.

The second time, I used my phone to record.  
The footsteps returned.  
Same hour. Same rhythm. Same echo.

I slowed it down.  
Played both tracks together.

Every step — matched.  
To the millisecond.  
No drift. No variance a living body could ever repeat.

I opened the door.  
The hallway was empty.  
No one there.

But the sound kept going.  
Step after step.  
Still echoing.

And then I understood.  
No one was walking.  
It was only a sequence… replaying itself.

Another night… just before it began, the wall clock flickered.  
Like a blackout.

But the lights stayed on.  
The fan kept spinning.  
Every other device — normal.

Then the footsteps returned.  
As always.

I didn’t move.  
It felt like… if I even twitched, everything would snap out of place.

Or worse — I’d break something meant to repeat in perfect precision.

That was the first time I had a terrifying thought.

Maybe… I wasn’t the one living here.  
Maybe I was only allowed to listen.

Not the protagonist.  
Just a spectator.  
Pre-installed.

Sitting still.  
Hearing the sounds of a life already built — from start to finish.

And the worst part was…  
It wasn’t mine.

Since the first night I heard footsteps…  
I began to dream.

Every night.  
Always the same.

I sit across from someone.  
No face.  
No gender.

Their voice — muffled.  
Like through a crushed speaker.  
Or behind a pane of glass in some lab…  
where people are treated as samples.

I try to focus.  
But around me — only white light.  
No lamp. No shadow.

Light from everywhere… and nowhere.  
As if I were being rendered in a world not yet complete.

I look at my hands.  
Too sharp.  
Every detail.  
Each finger. Each breath.

Perfect.  
Too perfect to be chance.

Everything else — blurred.  
Like a glitch still waiting to load.

As if I’m the only object finished…  
while the rest of the world waits for its update.

Every time I try to ask:  
“Who are you?”

I wake.

Not like waking from sleep.  
But yanked out.

Dragged from a layer of consciousness I never fully saw.  
I shoot up. Shirt soaked.

Cold — like being pulled out of a bottomless tank.  
My fingers twitch.  
My throat dry.

I don’t swallow.  
Afraid my voice will echo back… distorted.

I glance at the clock.  
3:04 a.m.

Always.

One night, I woke with words in my head:  
“Overwriting… overwriting…”

Looping.  
Like an error message.

As if something was writing over my dream —  
while I was still asleep.

I turned on the light.  
Sat up.

Paper. Pen.

I tried to write my name.  
The letters came out wrong.

My hand shook —  
like the joints had been reassembled, not quite right.

I wasn’t writing.  
I was replaying a motion.  
Like another hand had written it before…  
and I was only relearning the move.

So I started testing.  
An orange strip taped under a bowl.  
A faint X on the milk cap.  
Slippers tilted apart.

If I didn’t leave marks…  
I feared I wouldn’t be myself when I woke.

Morning came.  
The tape — in the sink.  
The X — gone.  
The slippers — aligned.

Too exact for any hand to reset…  
unless it already knew what it was correcting.

I began doubting my memory.  
Maybe I sleepwalked.  
Maybe I did it all… then forgot.

But if so… who was controlling me then?

I rang the nearest apartment.  
No reply.  
No light.  
No sound.

The building felt empty.  
Except for one unit.  
Mine.

I stared at my hands.  
They felt rebuilt.

Not painful.  
Not cold.  
But not… fully mine.

I checked the kitchen camera.  
No motion.  
No data.  
No glitch.

Just white.  
As if that moment never existed.  
Or was never rendered.

As if reality only activates when I open my eyes.

I whispered, almost without breath:  
“I’m not sure anymore… if I’m remembering… or being remembered.”

And worse—  
I’m not sure I ever woke up.

Maybe I was only assigned the sensation of waking.  
Like a line of code…  
marking the end of a cycle.

I hid a small camera behind the bookshelf.  
Pointed straight at the hallway.  
Battery full. Memory clear.  
Indicator steady — as if it was waiting.

I checked it every night.  
And every night… the video froze.

At exactly 3:04.

No error.  
No disconnect.  
No sound.  
No image.  
No data.

Only white.

As if that time wasn’t mine.  
Or worse — time went on…  
but I was no longer allowed in.

I added more cameras.  
Different angles.  
All of them recorded.

Until 3:04.

No fade.  
No cut.  
Just pause.

Not a glitch.  
As if everything had been told to hold its breath.

I sealed the bathroom curtain.  
Pins. Heavy tape.  
Two layers, crossed.

By morning — perfect.  
No crease.  
No tear.  
No sign I had ever touched it.

As if every act of mine had been undone.  
Reversed so cleanly… it left nothing.

One night, I stood before the mirror.  
The reflection didn’t come right away.

It lagged.  
Like it was waiting.  
For a command.

I raised my hand.  
Slowly.  
Too slowly.

Like someone waking from anesthesia — testing what body they still belonged to.

The reflection delayed.  
Watching. Waiting.

As if asking me:  
“What do you want me to do?”

I touched my cheek.  
It followed.  
But always… one frame behind.

Not light.  
Not physics.  
Something else copying.

Not by glass.  
But by a presence stitched from memory.

I looked into its eyes.  
They looked back.

But not mine.  
Not sharp. Not vague.

Just empty.  
Like a template searching for a missing piece.

I stepped back.  
It stepped back.

Perfect sync. Precise.  
But never real.

Always with a delay.  
Small… but enough to make me feel watched.  
From the other side.

I whispered:  
“If I’ve never seen my roommate’s face…  
then how do I know someone’s really here?”

No answer.  
Only a faint hum… from the camera in the shelf.

I said my name.  
The echo returned.

But only the first syllables.  
The rest… twisted.  
Like tape rewinding through broken code.

And I realized.  
Something was still watching.

Not to record.  
But to check.

Not to preserve.  
But to rebuild.

Closer. Sharper.

I sat down.  
Spoke slowly.  
As if dictating to myself.

“If every motion I make… can be relearned from a sample…  
then am I the original?

Or only a model… refined each time it breaks itself?”

I looked at my hand.  
Flexed. Released.

Watched the micro-movements.  
Like a system running a test. On me.

And if I am only a copy…  
if all of this is just replication…

Then what part of me cannot be cloned?

Or am I only kept alive —  
as a corrupted sample,  
still worth extracting…

until there is  
nothing left?

I made a plan.

Not to find him.  
But to test — if there was another me… besides me.

A chair braced against the forbidden door.  
A thread taped to the knob.  
A recorder hidden behind the microwave.  
An infrared camera pointed at the hallway.

I checked everything.  
Battery. Memory. Time.  
No margin left.

That night I tried to sleep.  
My heart frantic.  
As if my body already knew.

I shut my eyes. Opened them again.  
Repeat. Repeat.

Like a corrupted loop stuck on restart.

3:04 a.m.

I woke.  
Not to sound.  
Not to light.  
But to an emptiness… sliding cold across my chest.

Morning came.

The chair — still there.  
Thread — unbroken.  
Camera — alive.  
Recorder — running.

I almost exhaled.  
As if logic could still hold me together…  
as long as the system obeyed.

I played the audio.  
Three minutes of silence.

No fan.  
No breath.  
Only absence.

As if sound itself had been erased.

I scrubbed the video to 3:03:59.

A flicker.  
One frame.  
A shadow.

Then… a gray smear sliding across the hall.

No face.  
No feet.  
No shadow cast.

Just a smear.  
As if what I saw was never finished.

I checked the door cam.  
Light dead.  
Battery gone.

Keys were still in my pocket.  
No one could enter.

Unless… it didn’t need a door.

I looked up.  
The clock frozen.  
3:04.

Cold.  
As if everything moved forward — except me.

I opened older files.  
Frame by frame.  
Back two nights.

And there — I saw myself.

I stepped out.  
From the forbidden door.

Not rushing.  
Not startled.

Slow.  
Like a man repeating a dream — already lived, already lost.

I froze.  
Hands numb.

Not from cold.  
But like every nerve had been unplugged.

It couldn’t be wrong.  
Every twitch. Every habit.  
Mine.

But that version of me… moved like he belonged here long before I did.  
And I… was only just permitted to exist.

I turned the light on.  
Opened the closet.

A green hoodie — centered.  
Freshly washed.  
The scent of detergent I never used.

I turned back to the screen.  
He was closer now.

Approaching the camera.  
His face — blank white.

No lines.  
No depth.

A face without a face.

Not erased.  
Not hidden.  
Just never granted permission to appear.

Like a placeholder.  
Waiting for someone… to assign it a name.

I stepped back.  
Fingers clutched the bedframe.

Afraid I’d slide out of myself.  
That I was only a thin layer…  
ready to be peeled off… for something else to wear.

I tried to cling to logic.

“Maybe I forgot.  
Maybe I sleepwalked.  
Maybe… I’m still me.”

But deep in my chest — I knew.

A part of me had already been replaced.

And if I couldn’t remember when it happened…

Then what meaning was left… in the parts that remain?

I don’t know if it was the insomnia.  
Or if the light that day was wrong.

But for the first time — I saw him.

I stepped out of the bathroom.  
The mirror was fogged.

I wiped a corner… and saw him.

A figure, right behind me.  
Tall. Thin.

Wearing the same gray hoodie I once wore.  
Hair falling across half his face.

Still.  
Unblinking.

I turned.  
The room was empty.  
No sound.

Only steam hanging in the air.

I faced the mirror again.  
He was still there.  
Unmoving.

In the same place — just behind me.

I looked into his eyes.  
But he didn’t look at me.  
He looked through me.  
Into a point that wasn’t there.

I turned.  
Nothing.

Back to the mirror — closer.

I spun around.  
Heart pounding.

The mirror still held him.  
Sharp. Exact.

As if his presence only existed inside the reflection.  
And that reflection… no longer needed me  
to keep existing.

I stepped back.  
One step. Another.

Each time I retreated, he advanced.  
Closer… to the version of me I had already lost.

No need to break.  
No need to fight.  
He only needed to learn.

Then I saw it.

He had no face.

Not hidden.  
Not erased.

Just a pale white surface.  
Smooth, like uncarved wax.

Not unfinished.  
Not complete.  
Just waiting.

Like a frozen screen… never updated.

I raised my hand.  
The reflection followed.

Late.  
A frame behind.

For the first time I knew — this wasn’t a reflection.  
It was a being.

Learning.  
Becoming.  
Me.

I bowed my head.  
He copied.

But wrong.  
Twisted.  
Off-beat.

Like an old tape, badly replayed.

I leaned closer.

On that blank surface… faint lines appeared.  
Fragments of memory, trying to etch themselves  
into a face that didn’t yet exist.

I killed the light.  
Darkness swallowed everything.

When I turned it back on —  
the mirror was empty.

Only me.  
And this time, the reflection was just a reflection.

I stood there.  
Too long.

No more testing.  
No more games.

But from that night on…  
every time I looked into a mirror —

I didn’t see myself.

I saw someone rehearsing my role.

And I wondered.

He is learning to be me.  
But if he succeeds — will any part of me remain?

Or am I only a draft…  
temporary, so he can complete himself?

And when he does…

I’ll be nothing more than a page erased too many times.  
No trace left.  
No proof I was ever the original.

I stayed awake.  
All night.

Scrubbing through the hidden camera feeds.  
Frame by frame.

Not a single moment skipped.  
I was searching — for myself.

Every twitch.  
Every pause.  
Every delay.

As if… if I caught even one slip —  
I’d see something I wasn’t ready to face.

And then — I saw it.

A clip.

Me.

Walking out of the forbidden door.  
No hesitation.  
No doubt.

Exactly like the footage I’d seen before…  
Except this time — it hadn’t happened yet.

I froze on the timestamp.  
The date… still in the future.

The recording was from the future.

But whose?  
Mine… or the one I was becoming?

Cold spread through me.  
Not the room.  
The video itself… recognized me.

The person in the frame — undeniably me.

Messy hair.  
The tilt of my walk — still bent from an old injury.  
Phone in the left hand — a habit too precise to fake.

I bolted upright.  
Rushed to the closet.

The shirt in the video — there.  
Centered. Freshly washed.

No dust.  
No crease.

As if it had been placed there just this morning.

I turned back to the screen.  
Reached out.  
Touched the clip.

The screen went dark.

I rebooted.

The file — gone.  
Not in the folder.  
Not in cache.  
Not in trash.

No trace it had ever existed.  
Except in memory.

And even then…  
I wasn’t sure the memory was mine.

Panic.

I began writing.  
Notes. Timelines.

Every camera numbered.

But the more I arranged…  
the more it circled back.

Looping.  
Repeating.

Every thread of suspicion ended at the same image.

Me.  
Looking into the camera.

Not absent.  
Not unaware.

But watching myself.

And the thought grew—

I wasn’t the one reviewing the footage anymore.

The footage… was choosing when to review me.

I closed my eyes.  
Darkness.

And there — the video returned.

Flickering.  
Distorted.

Like it was being replayed from corrupted code.

And I began to understand.

Maybe I was the anomaly.

Maybe the recording wasn’t for me to discover.

Maybe it was only… checking if I was ready to be erased.

I couldn’t wait any longer.

If something was tampering with my memory…  
then every second I hesitated only made my true self fade further.

I had to see.  
Now.

I walked to the forbidden door.  
Placed my hand on the knob.

It wasn’t locked.  
Never had been.

I just… had never dared to open it.  
Until today.

The door slid sideways.  
No sound.  
No touch.

Like a scene skipped in a video.

Inside — no walls.  
No ceiling.  
No light.

Yet I could see.

A gray space.  
Shallow. Hollow.  
No depth. No anchor.

As if I were standing inside the buffer of a system  
still waiting to render.

I stepped in.

Gravity — gone.  
Heartbeat — gone.  
Sound — gone.

I screamed.  
But nothing came out.

Only the thought,  
trapped inside my skull.

On a flat plane… an apple.

I picked it up.  
Bit down.

No taste.  
No juice.  
No crunch.

Only emptiness sliding down my throat.

I set it back.  
Took a few steps.  
Turned around.

The bite mark was gone.  
The skin — blackened.

Not rot.  
Not decay.  
Edited.

The data… not saved.

I walked deeper.  
And saw him.

Sitting.  
Back turned.

Wearing my clothes.  
My hair.  
My posture.  
The scar on my neck.

I couldn’t breathe.

I had never seen myself from that angle.  
But I knew his thought.  
The way his fingers curled…  
exactly like mine when I feel watched.

I reached out.  
Almost touched his shoulder.

The instant I did — he vanished.  
No sound.  
No fade.

Just… removed.

The space around me began to melt.  
Layers peeled away.  
Textures dissolving.

Like corrupted render.  
Like code erasing itself.

I looked up.

He was back.

Not sitting.  
Standing.

At the edge of the space.  
Not moving.  
Not closer.

Just waiting.  
Like a placeholder paused for activation.

And I realized.

I wasn’t the main character in the next version.

I stepped back.  
He didn’t move.  
Didn’t vanish.  
Didn’t change.

Just stood there — as if he’d never left.

And I wondered.

How many before me stepped into this place…  
and never returned in the same form?

And if the system was ready to finalize its next build…

Maybe I’ll be nothing but a blur.  
A faulty pixel.

Too faint to keep.  
Not erased.  
Not saved.

Just… never rendered again.

I returned to the room.  
This time — no hesitation.  
No fear.  
No doubt.

The door slid open.  
No sound.  
No weight.

Just a temporary pathway.  
Barely permitted.  
Just enough to let me return.

Inside — empty.  
No light.  
No figure.  
No chair.

Nothing but me.

I stepped deeper.  
A faint click beneath my foot.

I looked down.  
A shard of mirror.

Freshly cracked.  
Or maybe placed there… for me.

I picked it up.  
And saw myself.

But not fully.  
The eyes staring back weren’t mine.

No fear.  
No haze.  
Only waiting.

I raised my right hand.  
It raised its left.

Reversed.  
Misaligned.

I smiled.  
It didn’t.

It only stared — as if retrieving a broken memory.  
And I… was the last fragment of data it needed to rebuild itself.

I set the shard down.  
Turned around.

Behind me — a full mirror spread across the blank wall.  
I was certain it hadn’t been there before.

Or maybe… it had never been meant for me until now.

I stepped closer.  
Slow. Steady.

But the reflection didn’t move.  
Didn’t follow.  
Didn’t mimic.

It just stood.  
Waiting for a signal.

I raised my hand.  
Touched the glass.

It was warm.  
Not cold — like any mirror should be.

And then… it began to read me.

Not invading.  
Not stealing.  
Just scanning.

Layer by layer.  
Every reflex.  
The rhythm of my blinks.  
The swallow I make when fear swells.

I was no longer a person.  
I was data.

I tried to recall my name.  
But each syllable felt like a deleted file.

As if I lived among versions that were never saved.

I stepped back.  
The reflection stepped too.

Same posture.  
Same timing.

Until it stopped.  
Frozen.

It stared.  
Its lips moved.  
Slow. Silent.

Two words:  
**Not you.**

A click.  
The sound of deletion.

No anger.  
No grief.

Just confirmation.  
That I wasn’t in the version kept.

I stayed still.  
No more touches.  
No more steps back.

I looked at the reflection and whispered — unsure if to it… or to myself:

“Maybe I lived here.  
But I was never truly me.”

“Or worse — I was him… and only just woke up.  
A memory no longer mine.  
Still using me to remember itself.”

The reflection didn’t fade.  
Didn’t move.  
Didn’t answer.

It just existed — like an unopened file.  
A fragment of data rebuilding itself.  
Using me as the recovery tool.

And if I am not me…  
then who is remembering me?

If he is the one holding memory…  
then who do I exist for?

Or am I only the final draft of a thought never written down?

I don’t know if I’m still here.  
Or still here… but already replaced by a version that fits better.

One of us has been overwritten.

But the real horror isn’t which one survived.  
It’s that there’s nothing left to confirm it.

No witness.  
No system.  
No original baseline.

Only a recovery loop.  
Reconstructing itself.  
Using every broken version  
to rebuild what it once called “me.”

I might be a copy.  
He might be a memory.  
Or both — fragments echoing a self already erased.

A story.  
A voice.  
An identity.

Something that once carried my name…  
but lost its code.

And then I understood.

In a system with no line  
between original and copy,  
between memory  
and the one who remembers,  
between reality  
and an endless re-render…

The word *replacement* means nothing.

Because no one is replaced.  
Only the ones that fit… are kept.",1,1757565394.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I just started playing zzz about a week ago and have been wanting to dive in and learn more. I’ve finished the main story and made it to level 40 so I’m at the part where it’s time to invest into team building. My full roster is just the basics of Billy(40), Anby(40), Nicole(40), rina, corin, Soukaku, Ben and piper. 

A. What main team should I focus on and take to 50+?
B. When do I need to focus on 2 teams? 
C. I’d like to make sure Nicole, anby, soukaku and piper are built for future flexibility.  What possible teams should I look into that might include those agents? I’m thinking of billy, Nicole and anby for one and piper, soukaku and maybe corin/rina?
D. If I manage to grab pulchra/Lucy from the standard where might they fall 

Future plans
I’ll set it straight. I am indeed a meta slave. So I’m thinking of saving my pulls, hence the team questions in the first part. I would ideally like to wait for someone strong and then build around them. I really enjoyed yixuan, miyabi, astra, lighter and Alice in the story, however it seems hopped on the zzz train in an awkward spot after a majority of them just released or had a rerun. For this banner cycle, I’m currently not sold on any agent. I was thinking about Evelyn but I could solve any fire issues by selecting soldier 11 or looking into grabbing a Lucy for the piper/lucy. Looking further, I’m currently intrigued by a new agent as a flexible support but that is far in the future and to my limited knowledge there is no information about her kit. Those are my current thoughts so please feel free to correct any misinformation or guide me to a different path. I have so many questions so I’ll just list more below. 

E. When might yixuan/miyabi/astra/lighter rerun again?
F. When might the next void hunter release? (End of year?)
G. How many pulls do we normally get per patch/banner/monthly and where do they come from after the one-time rewards?
H. Is there a limit to investigation progress for the hollow zero daily/weekly? 
I. What should I do daily? Log in > fortune > coffee > spend stamina (not on disk drives until after 45 and maybe later) > daily quest >????
J. Should I save my boopons until I need a certain one for a team?( currently have a copy of miss esme and snap for general use)
K. What resources are available for hollow void and other content so I can learn what gear/relics to look into.
L. How far should I go until it’s time to start working on disk drives? ( I assume this one is heavily based on team comp, skill and level. If possible based on the teams in the first part.)
M. What other recommendations do y’all have?

I’m always willing to learn more so feel free to add any resources, guides or any information you would like (I’ve only checked prydwen). I’ve heard this game is a marathon so I’d like to make sure that the basics are down. Thank you for your time and sorry for all the questions accompanied with bad formatting.

Anyone else feel like every week there’s a new trading platform popping up with wild promises? Yeah, same here. But **[RichbertPro](https://tinyurl.com/2dq63gta)** caught my eye recently, and I’ll admit—I was skeptical, but curious. The name sounds like a Bond villain, but apparently, it’s gaining serious traction in online trading circles.

With platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** drawing in users by the thousands, it makes sense that RichbertPro is getting attention too. If you’ve been looking for a smarter, more automated way to dip your toes into crypto or forex trading, this platform might be something to explore.

In this review, I’ll break down everything you need to know about RichbertPro—how it works, what it’s good at, where it falls short, and whether it’s actually worth your time. I’ll also share my own experience and some tips in case you decide to give it a shot.

## What is RichbertPro?

RichbertPro is an **automated trading platform** that uses smart algorithms to analyze market data and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like a robot trader that never sleeps and doesn’t let emotions get in the way. It focuses heavily on **cryptocurrency and forex trading**, but also supports other asset classes like commodities and stocks.

The idea is simple: you fund your account, select your trading preferences, and let the algorithm do the heavy lifting. It’s designed to be **user-friendly**, even for people with zero trading experience. You don’t need to know the difference between a candlestick chart and a birthday candle to get started.

What stood out to me was the platform’s **intuitive dashboard**, which makes it super easy to monitor your portfolio, set parameters, and tweak strategies. No flashy gimmicks—just clean functionality.

## Who Created RichbertPro?

Here’s where things get a bit fuzzy. Like many automated trading platforms, **RichbertPro doesn’t have a named founder or public development team**. That’s not necessarily a red flag—it’s common in this niche—but it does make it harder to verify its origins.

Some rumors suggest it shares development roots with platforms like **Immediate Edge** or **Bitcoin Code**, which have been around for a while and have decent reputations in the auto-trading space. What I can say is that the platform seems well-built and maintained, which hints at a team that knows what they’re doing—even if they prefer to stay behind the curtain.

## How Does RichbertPro Work?

At its core, RichbertPro uses **automated trading algorithms** to scan financial markets, spot trading signals, and execute trades in real-time. This means it can react to market movements faster than a human ever could.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:
- **Data Collection**: The system constantly pulls data from multiple markets.
- **Market Analysis**: It uses technical indicators, trends, and price patterns to make decisions.
- **Trade Execution**: Once a trade meets your criteria, the bot pulls the trigger automatically.
- **Monitoring**: It keeps track of your portfolio, adjusting the strategy based on market behavior.

You can customize your risk level, trade frequency, and other parameters, or just let it run on default settings. For beginners, those auto settings are surprisingly solid.

## RichbertPro Pros and Cons

No platform is perfect. Here’s what I liked and what I think could be improved.

### Pros:

- ✅ **Multi-Asset Support**: You’re not limited to crypto.
- ✅ **Demo Account**: Try it out risk-free.
- ✅ **24/7 Customer Support**: Better than most platforms in this area.

### Cons:
- ❌ **No Mobile App**: You can use it on mobile browsers, but an app would be better.
- ❌ **No Transparent Team Info**: Would love to see who’s behind it.
- ❌ **Requires Minimum Deposit**: $250 might feel steep for total beginners.

## Is RichbertPro a Scam?

From my experience, **no, RichbertPro isn’t a scam**. It does what it claims—automated trading based on market analysis. That said, it’s not a magic money machine. You’ll still face market risks, and you should start small until you get a feel for it.

1ndzlxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal_Ind/comments/1ndzlxv/does_frugality_make_you_complacent/,Does frugality make you complacent?,"Anyone else feel they’ve become less aspirational towards career and finances, less ambitious and a lot more complacent towards everything after turning towards frugality?

There usually comes a point in your life, where all your needs are covered easily with your income, and you are able to spend on discretionary purchases. 

Then there comes a point where all typical discretionary purchases are easily met, and you start aspiring for luxury across all aspects of your life.

When you follow this template you are actively aspiring towards improving every aspect of everything all the time.you’re constantly working towards the next tangible goal.

I feel, when you are frugal, since you pick and choose a small subset of the discretionary and luxury, instead of the whole package, you end up playing this game on easy mode.

Suddenly, you don’t need to be as ambitious in your career, you don’t need to make as much money to fulfill that tiny subset of wants, and you start aiming lower.

For example-
- why buy a DF64, when you get just get an agaro manual coffee grinder
- why buy a specked out macbook air when you can make do with the base model and some very inconvenient external hard drives
- why buy a second vehicle for your spouse when you can make do with uber
- why buy a range rover when you can make do with a tata harrier
- why buy a fancy villa when you can make do with an apartment in a gated community 

Now, these examples may seem exaggerated to some. But I’ve seen ambitious people make the luxury purchases happen with 15-20 years of career within 35-40 years of age, while starting out from 0 wealth. 

It takes a lot more effort, it demands a lot more from you. But it potentially takes just the same amout of time to make it happen.

The frugal purchases on the other hand - they’re the low hanging fruit. It’s easier to get there. You need to work less towards it. You can wait a lot more for it.

Playing the waiting game makes it so that, in the same 15-20 years of your career, that apartment, that tata harrier, that second car, macbook air base model will become the limit of aspirational purchases instead.

1ndzhgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1ndzhgd/alta_via_2_and_dolomites_trip_report/,Alta Via 2 and Dolomites Trip Report,"**Who:**

* Two experienced hikers, both 66
* One less experienced hiker, 63

**Trip Dates:** August 25 – September 3

**Conditions:**

* **Daytime Temps:** 55–70°F
* **Evening Temps:** 30–50°F (elevation dependent)
* **Weather:** Frequent afternoon rain, fog, and poor visibility
* **Daily Mileage:** 9–11 miles on average

**My Gear**

Base weight was \~15 lbs, maxing out at 18 lbs with 2L of water. Huts made it possible to leave tents, stoves, and sleeping bags behind. Instead, carried only a liner for bedding.

* **Backpack:** Durston Kakwa 55. Overkill. A 35L would be perfect. But at such a light weight, it really didn’t matter that 1/3 of it was empty.
* **Shoes:** Topo Athletic Traverse, with SOLE Performance insoles with metatarsal pad
* **Daily:** Patagonia UV hoodie, UFM underwear, Stoko leggings, Injinji liners with Darn Tough socks.
* **Backups:** Patagonia T-shirt; 2 pairs of UFM underwear; 1 pair of Darn Toughs; UL Waterproof socks for heavy rains. EE torrid jacket and booties. Z pack camp shoes. Small towel.
* **Sleepwear:** UL Thermals or shorts and a t-shirt.
* **Rain Gear:** Simple, breathable layers
* **Food:** Hut meals, with limited snacks (a few Muir Energy gels, Salt Stick chews)
* **Misc**: Small Ditty bag and med kit. (probably could have saved 11 oz by not carrying a backup battery and steripen. Didn't use either.
* **Water:** Easy access at huts; filtered water provided if requested

**Day 1 — Bressanone (Plose) → Rifugio Medalges**  
Bus and cable car to Plose. Early miles wound through ski terrain and gondolas, but soon opened into meadows, flowers, and ridges with the first Dolomite spires in view. Really easy, pleasant walk. First introduction to the scree and talus that will dominate the hike.

Medalges was basic but functional: foam mattresses, blankets, and a separate dining hut. Dinner was satisfying, the night sky clear. Facilities are limited to one bathroom, no showers, and filtered water on request.

**Day 2 — Rifugio Medalges → Rifugio Frara**  
Steep morning climb, then more scree, talus, and cliffside traverses with exposure. Great stuff. First via ferrata (Nives) introduced cables and ladders. We used helmets, harnesses, and lanyards; many did not. Fun day. Ended with interesting monster rock garden terrain.

Rifugio Frara felt like a ski motel — adequate, but uninspiring. Showers and toilets are available. The best breakfast was across the road at Hotel Cir.

**Tip:** Bring basic via ferrata gear even if it's optional. The protection adds safety on slick rock and in poor weather.

**Day 3 — Rifugio Frara → Rifugio Boè**  
Ferrata Pisciadù climb in the morning. Popular, crowded route — early start essential. This was a blast. After completing the climb, we hung out at the top and cheered on climbers after they reached the top. Refugio for lunch at the top of the climb was crowded.

We then had a big climb on talus, etc, on our way to Rifugio Viel Dal Pan. Afternoon storms forced us to cut the day short by about 6 miles and stay at Boè instead of Viel Dal Pan.

Boe was pretty good. Clean. Decent food and drink. Excellent coffee drinks. Great energy at night. While the heavy weather forced us to cut the day short, it had a significant impact on all our planning going forward.

**Insight:** Weather can disrupt even modest daily goals. Have backup huts in mind for each stage.

**Day 4 — Rifugio Boè → Rifugio Contrin**  
A planned Marmolada glacier crossing and Via Ferrata on the way to Capanna Punta Penia became impossible due to fog, rain, and lightning. We fell short the day before, and the trail conditions were suspect. 

Long scree descent from Boe on the way to Viel Dal Pan punished knees and ended any chance of reaching the glacier. Total time in weather to Viel Dal Pan 5 hours.

We continued across big ski terrain and down more steep switchbacks to Refugio Castiglioni. We rested and refilled. My knee pain forced me to take a forced day off. Stayed at a hotel near Refugio Contrin while partners walked there and on.

**Insight:** Knee health matters. Prepare for long, steep scree descents. Trekking poles (lots of) KT taping makes a difference.

**Day 5 — Refugio Contrin → Refugio Passo Valles**  
I rested while my hiking partners continued past war relics and had a “five-star” meal in San Pellegrini. We regrouped at Passo Valles. Facilities were solid, with hot showers and friendly staff.

**Insight:** Build recovery time and breaks into the itinerary, especially for older hikers. A short rest day (nero or even a zero) can preserve the rest of the trek.

**Day 6 — Refugio Passo Valles → Refugio Rosetta**  
Morning brought green ridges with wild horses and sheep, followed by steep climbs and scrambles with and without cables. Lunch at Refugio Mulaz was good, but then behind Mulaz, the trail continued up a difficult scree climb through a pass and into a giant scree bowl where poor decision-making and trail visibility led us off-route, costing time. The trail was marked by grey cairns on grey rocks in a grey talus bowl, so it took a bit of time to work our way through it. Note that when you see the trail blazes, follow them! (Duh)

We eventually found our way through the Ferrata next to the big blaze and then along a long walk across the top of a valley and green cliffs. A good walk if we weren’t concerned about weather and light. We arrived at Rosetta well after dark, by headlamp. Facilities were comfortable. They served a nice pasta dish for dinner, even though we were late.   (squat toilets, limited showers, crowded bunks).

**Insight:** Time lost to navigation or weather can quickly push you into late arrivals and treacherous situations. I’d like a do-over on this section.

**Day 7 — Rifugio Rosetta → Rifugio Cereda (via Pradipali)**  
Steep descent with cables and stemples from Rosetta to Pradipali. Lots of cliff walking. Lots of fun. Lots of climbers doing their thing as well.  Too tired from the previous evening to take on another via Ferrata, so we had a lot of time to kill. A dilemma: a beautiful day, arrived too early to stop, and so after good food and dessert, we continued on. The day ended at Cereda — spacious grounds, reasonably modern rooms, excellent food.

**Insight:** Flexibility pays off. Skipping an overly crowded hut and pushing on can improve the experience.

**Day 8 — Refugio Cereda → Rifugio Fonteghi (The slow route)**  
The slow route was basically a hike through a forest, another 2k ft climb and descent.  Then a long, slow walk down to Rifugio Fonteghi. It rained a fair amount of time on this day.  I found this to be nothing remarkable. Just a good day of hiking.

 The only reason to do this would be to connect with Rifugio Fonteghi. A picturesque converted old mill building. The chef here, Julio, prepared an excellent dinner. Thats as good a reason as any.

**Insight:** Reservations are essential on AV2. Losing a spot at a key hut forces less optimal reroutes. Book redundantly if you need to and have alternates mapped in advance.

**Day 9 —Rifugio Fonteghi → Refugio Dal Piaz**  
Climbed through a steep notch with scrambling and a great deal of exposure, then onto rolling green hills. Had a very bready lunch prepared by Julio.  Passed WWII memorials — a stark reminder of history along the route.

Dal Piaz was the final hut.

**Insight:** AV2 isn’t only about landscapes. Off-trail explorations add depth to the trek.

**Day 10 — Dal Piaz → Croce d’Aune**

Views stretched between never-ending cloud layers, making for quite a last night. A gentle forest descent with carved wooden figures along the path led to the valley and train station. A pleasant closing to the route. Lots of interesting wood carvings on the trail make this part a bit entertaining as well.

**Insight:** The AV2 ends gradually. Unlike some alpine routes with dramatic finishes, this descent is more reflective — a natural wind-down.

**Watchouts**

* Afternoon storms significantly impacted decisions. Early starts were essential.
* The wide gap in group experience and fitness forced slower progress and altered routes.
* Hut quality varied widely. Know in advance where comfort is limited and where you can expect showers, modern rooms, or better food. Liners required. 
* The dinners are generally very good. The lunches are good, not great. Desserts, Soups, and goulash were the best.  Most breakfasts were sparse.
* Via ferrata sections are manageable with basic gear and steady movement. Crowds often matter more than the technicality.
* Build time in for a few more daily breaks and a nero.

## What is Seguro Bitline?

Seguro Bitline is an **automated trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to trade assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities. Think of it like your always-alert, never-sleeps trading assistant that scans the market and executes trades based on real-time data.

The platform is designed to be super intuitive, meaning you don't need a PhD in finance or hours studying candlestick charts. It's ideal for people who want to dip into crypto or diversify their portfolio without spending every waking hour watching price charts.

What makes Seguro Bitline stand out is that it blends **automation with user control**. You can let the bot handle everything or set specific parameters to guide how it trades.

## Who Created Seguro Bitline?

There's not a ton of public info about the actual founders of Seguro Bitline, which is kind of typical with platforms like this. Based on what I could dig up, it appears to be developed by a group of financial tech professionals with backgrounds in algorithmic trading and AI.

Now, is it sketchy that they’re low-key? A little. But they follow the same pattern as platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. It’s not uncommon for devs to stay behind the scenes, especially in the crypto space where privacy is a big deal. Still, I’d love to see more transparency here in the future.

That said, the platform has partnered with **licensed brokers** and seems to operate within legit financial frameworks, which helps build some trust.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Seguro Bitline Today](https://tinyurl.com/2c4a9k88)
## How Does Seguro Bitline Work?

Seguro Bitline uses a combo of **machine learning**, **AI-driven algorithms**, and **market trend analysis** to scan trading opportunities across multiple markets. Once it spots a potential win based on pre-set criteria, it executes trades automatically.

You can:
- Run it on full autopilot (great if you’re busy or new)
- Set custom limits and strategies (great if you’re more hands-on)

It integrates with brokers who handle the actual execution of trades, meaning your funds are not sitting with Seguro Bitline but rather with these brokers. This is pretty standard and adds an extra layer of safety because the brokers are often regulated.

Basically: You sign up, make a deposit, tweak your settings (or don’t), and let the bot do its thing.

## Seguro Bitline Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. Every platform has its highs and lows. Here’s where Seguro Bitline shines—and where it could improve:

**Pros:**
- ✅ **User-friendly interface** — Even if you’ve never traded before, you’ll get the hang of it fast.
- ✅ **Automated trading** — Save time and avoid emotional trades.
- ✅ **Demo account** — Practice before risking real cash.
- ✅ **Multi-asset support** — Not just crypto; you can trade forex, stocks, and commodities too.
- ✅ **Solid security protocols** — SSL encryption and KYC in place.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Lack of founder transparency** — Would love to know who’s behind it.
- ❌ **Minimum deposit of $250** — Not outrageous, but a smaller entry point would be nice.
- ❌ **Limited mobile app features** — Works on mobile browsers, but no dedicated app yet.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Seguro Bitline?

This one’s easy. Seguro Bitline is **web-based**, so you don’t need to download anything. As long as your device has a browser, you’re good.

Devices supported:
- 💻 Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 📱 Smartphones (iOS and Android)
- 📟 Tablets

I tried it on both my laptop and phone—it runs smooth on Chrome and Safari. It’s optimized for mobile, but again, I’d love to see a native app someday.

## Seguro Bitline – Supported Countries

Seguro Bitline is available in most countries where crypto trading is legal. This includes:

- 🇺🇸 United States
- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom
- 🇨🇦 Canada
- 🇦🇺 Australia
- 🇩🇪 Germany
- 🇫🇷 France
- 🇮🇳 India
- 🇿🇦 South Africa

Some countries may have restrictions due to local laws, so the sign-up form will usually notify you if it isn’t supported in your region.

## Seguro Bitline – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform uses AI to analyze thousands of data points per second. It keeps an eye on market trends 24/7, which is great because most of us can’t do that without losing our minds.

This feature works in the background and helps the bot make informed trading decisions that (in theory) increase your success rate.

### User-Friendly Interface

The interface is clean, simple, and intuitive. You won’t need a manual to figure out how to adjust your settings or monitor your trades.

Even if you’re new to trading, the dashboard makes it easy to understand what’s happening with your money.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no dedicated mobile app, the web-based version works well on mobile. You can check your trades, adjust settings, and even withdraw funds straight from your phone.

Perfect for checking your portfolio while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for market events, price changes, or trade executions. This keeps you in the loop without having to watch charts all day.

It’s a nice middle ground between full automation and staying hands-on.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not limited to crypto. Seguro Bitline also supports:
- 💱 Forex
- 📈 Stocks
- 🛢️ Commodities

This diversification is great if you’re looking to hedge your bets or explore new markets.

## Is Seguro Bitline a Scam?

I had the same question at first. After testing it and reviewing user feedback, I’d say **Seguro Bitline is not a scam**. There’s no shady behavior like hidden fees or random withdrawals.

That said, it’s still a **trading platform**, and all investments come with risk. You could lose money, especially if the market takes a turn. But from a security and legitimacy perspective, Seguro Bitline seems above board.

Use the demo account first and **never invest money you can’t afford to lose.**

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Seguro Bitline?

The minimum deposit to start trading is **$250**. This is pretty standard for auto-trading platforms, though I wish it was a bit lower to attract more casual users.

You can deposit using:
- 💳 Credit/debit cards
- 💸 Bank transfers
- 🪙 Crypto (in some regions)

### Seguro Bitline Customer Support

Customer service is available **24/7** via:
- 📩 Email
- 💬 Live chat

I tested the live chat feature and got a response within 10 minutes. Not bad at all. They’re polite, knowledgeable, and not pushy—which is a win in my book.

Seriously impressed by the speed and taste!
I’m considering getting one for home, but have a few questions:

Downsides: Are there any major drawbacks to the Finero machine? The pod system looks super convenient, but does anyone find the limited grounds basket (only 9g) or pod dependency frustrating in the long run[reddit]? Is maintenance easy?


Vantro Alternative: I noticed the Vantro X1 machine is similarly priced, offers a bigger water tank (1.8L), touchscreen, and adjustable temperature.Would Vantro be a smarter choice for someone who sometimes wants traditional ground espresso? Does it hold up in terms of taste and reliability—especially for beginners?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s used either (or both) machines. Which one do you recommend for regular, hassle-free home coffee?",2,1757564501.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

I read a lot (sci fi / fantasy and philosophy mostly), listen to metal music, get tattoos (12 so far), code for a living, walk my dog (sassy little corgi), water my plants, love horror, exercise to keep those mental demons at bay, obsess over coffee (former barista).

```
Behind the villainous reality that separates us  
We crossed the raging oceans together,  
Climbed hundreds of towering mountains,  
Traveled thousands of miles,  
Until we reached the quiet forest.  

There, you became the sun in my sky,  
My remedy for every misery,  
And the last puzzling piece of my jigsaw.  

I love you the way I long to relive every beautiful dream I’ve had.  
You remind me of my favorite morning coffee,  
The scent of delicate flowers in the garden,  
And the dazzling moonlight above.  
What a seamless canvas you've become to my sight!  
You're such a breathtaking masterpiece,  
One who painted passion into my soul.  

Our hearts, flowing to the same cue,  
Created a sea of sensations.  
Every aching moment caused by flying bullets  
Was healed by wildflower bandages.  
Every gap between our heartbeats was filled with love.  
That's how it became a vicious cycle —  
A cycle we became addicted to,  
A cycle we can no longer escape, even through a loophole.  

I created poetry for you then,  
Writing with my pen dipped in the blood flowing through my veins.  
I was moved by your story.  
And it was the kind of movement that didn’t push me away —  
It pulled me closer.  
Close enough to hear music in your heartbeat,  
And close enough to create space for unspoken thoughts.  

Indeed, a love without frontiers, yet separated by distance —  
Not between us, but between the reality and truth that contradict us.  
Cheek by jowl, we hold on to what keeps us  
Alive in the midst of what kills us.  
But where will it lead us?  

We're like birds, but we can't fly —  
Because it sinned us.  

Does it ever feel better?  
Mistake after mistake,  
Just to fulfill a destiny?  
I wanted the ending to be beautiful,  
But I don’t want to see the end.  
How paradoxical it is — to hope for something good when it's over,  
Yet not want it to be over.  

Sure, I'm in love with you.  
And it’s the kind of love that’s been tattooed into my body,  
A kind of love carved into my bones.  

You are my untold story —  
A priceless treasure I hid in a jar,  
A perfect dress I locked in the closet,  
And the tears I covered with a smile.  
You are my untold story.  
The forever great love of my life.  
Our love may not be visible,  
But it's written in the stars.  
```
