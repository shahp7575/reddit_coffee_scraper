A home once lost, a broken vow, Beneath the California sky, somehow. The hardest choice a heart can make, To send away for their own sake. I stood alone and watched you go, The deepest pain I’d ever know.

My home became a canvas tent, By creek water, my strength was spent, And then renewed. The tracks my guide, With nowhere left for me to hide. I’d walk to work in waitress shoes, To fight the lonely, midnight blues. Each dollar saved, each tip I’d keep, While promises were buried deep.

By day I’d scrub, by night I’d pour The coffee, dreaming of a door. A roof, a room, a simple key, To bring my children back to me. The work was hard, the time was slow, But in my heart, a fire would glow. Fueled by your faces in my mind, Leaving the darkest days behind.

And then it came, that joyful sound, A home on safe and solid ground. And you were there, my children three, Your laughter filling it for me. The struggle forged a bond so strong, The place where we had all belonged.

Now twenty-five years down the line, A legacy of love is mine. A business owner, standing tall, I catch the ones about to fall. For in their eyes, I see my own, The seeds of strength that have been sown. I offer work, a helping hand, A chance to rise and make a stand. No judgment for the road they’ve trod, Just quiet faith and a gentle nod. For we can change this world, you see, One person at a time, like me.

1m120fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m120fu/apple_application_advice/,Apple Application Advice...,"I replied to a post earlier today and my DM's are absolutely obliterated. I apologize if I could not get back to you directly but I tried to reply to as many as I can. I will summarize the advice I shared. Sorry if it is hella basic but it worked for me and I think talking to some guys I talked to on my team and beyond. 

*  Apple is constantly and aggressively hiring. Jobs are always going to be on the career site. I know it seems like a black hole of applications but it is what it is. Submit an application.
* My background:  Apple was my target company for a variety of reasons from the first day of me studying CS. I consider myself a very average student. I did go to a Top 3 school (I'll come back to that later).  I am a bit older and non traditional however. I served. Then came home and started a business (completely unrelated to CS) and then sold the business to go back to school. I did a bunch of side projects mostly for the love of the game during my four years but did not have any internships. I am a bit older than most college students and as such had a lot of responsibilities. I competed very seriously in a sport. I ended up getting an offer for a NASA internship but declined it due to it being in West Virginia and in the middle of the school year.  
* Regarding Referrals: Knowing how absolutely average I was as a student (there were 100s of absolute studs in college), I really focused on networking during my four years. I reached out to every person in my life  that might have some connection with some big tech company and I cold messaged people I found on linked in. Looking at my spreadsheet, I literally had coffee or zoom meetings with nearly 40 individuals in four years and I reached out to very likely hundreds. I did all of that and I used 4 referrals to Apple specifically. I never got a call back for any of those roles.
* I applied to dozens of Apple positions without referrals and kinda lost hope. I randomly got a call back for a random role I applied for 5 months prior. Honestly, this mirrors the story of many people I know at this company. 
* Interviewing: I would say if you don't consider yourself a naturally charismatic person, then try to work on that in every aspect of your life. When I got the NASA offer, I legit asked what I did to get an offer when there were a lot more talented engineers that I knew personally that applied. The response I got was that ""there are a lot of A+ failures that come in and out of these doors."" We talked about that statement and what he meant was that shit will go terribly on a team. There is immense value in having a team of people that can keep their cool and work well under pressure. His point is that many applicants fail to convey that. I would say in general, remember that people are looking to hire someone that they would want to be around for 40 hours a week. There are so many talented engineers but the difference really is pretty marginal. Everything can be taught. And if you are insanely innovative, then you aren't worrying about working for some big corporation, you are building something yourself.
* So yea, I went to a top school which probably got my resume looked at a lot more than it should. But I will say, I really am in the minority of people who went to top schools on my team. I mean legit one of the best MLE on our team is self taught and got a degree in drama or something like that. Albeit he came in at an entirely different generation, but the point remains, no one really cares about schools. Someone that got hired in my cohort went to a very very obscure state school and at the end of the day we make the same money and have the same chances to rise up. 
* THE BIGGEST THING: Tailor your resume for the role. I know we all think quantity is key and it is because it is a numbers game but you won't ever be looked at unless your resume is perfect for the job you are applying to. Once I took that advice seriously, I started getting call backs. I first hired a resume writer and out of the 10 resumes they did for me, I got 6 call backs. I built on that and starting tailoring them myself it remained about 50/50. I know not everyone can pay for something like that but find a way tailor your resumes. It is so worth it....

The next evening, he passed (in a very upsetting way). We can't understand what happened or why... :(","So, our pet rabbit was acting lethargic and not eating/pooping. We suspected he was constipated (probably from excess sugar or protein in his mix and him not eating enough hay to balance that). When he did poop, it was dark and goopy. He stopped eating then. He was constipated once (years ago, shortly after we rescued him; he was overweight too), but we were able to treat him for that successfully, and he recovered and also lost the extra weight. 

My sister took him to the vet to see if he was constipated/impacted, and the vet felt him and said that he didn't appear to be constipated/impacted and that he was probably ""just feeling a little lazy."" They gave us a prescription for meloxicam (0.8ml) and transdermal mirtazapine to rub on his ears. My family also started giving him ""Critical Care Herbivore"" on day 2 or 3 of his lethargy, although I don't know for sure if they got it at the vet this time or sometime in the past. 

(TW, this next part is sad).

Well, the evening of day 3, (less than 24 hours after seeing the vet) he came into the living room and lay down under the coffee table (very weird for him to want to be in there). Our dog started sniffing him and lay next to him, which was also very strange. So we checked on him: picked him up and set him on the table on a blanket. Well he started kicking violently, and we realized he was seizing. His mouth was open and he seemed to be struggling to breathe. We wrapped him up in the blanket and ran to get in the car to go to the emergency vet, and he squeaked when we picked him up. I dialed the emergency vet while my sister carried him to the door. 

I was on hold with the vet when I heard my sister crying by the porch. I went to help, and he had one last moment of movement and then passed away. It was extremely sad and tragic and horrible, and it seemed to just escalate out of nowhere...

This has been bothering me for a while (it's been a month since this happened, and it was too sad to talk about until now). What on earth happened? Was he impacted? Why the respiratory distress? Why the seizures? Why was it when we picked him up that it started? What could've been the cause?

Any thoughts on this is helpful, especially if any rabbit owners see their bunny have symptoms like this and are concerned. We loved him so much and miss him every day.

1m11qru,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCryptoMoonshots/comments/1m11qru/why_lightning_network_is_failing_bitcoins_vision/,Why Lightning Network Is Failing Bitcoin’s Vision,"Bitcoin was created as peer-to-peer digital cash—a way for anyone to send money directly to anyone else, without middlemen or high fees. But today, that vision is falling apart, and the Lightning Network is a big part of why.

## What Was the Original Vision?

Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be a decentralized, trustless payment system. Every transaction recorded on the blockchain, secure and transparent. The dream was for people everywhere to use Bitcoin to pay for coffee, send remittances, or buy goods online—fast, cheap, and censorship-resistant.

## The Scaling Problem

Bitcoin’s base layer can only handle about 7 transactions per second. To keep the network secure and decentralized, block size wasn’t increased. So, scaling had to come from “Layer 2” solutions like Lightning Network—an off-chain payment system designed to handle millions of transactions quickly.

## Why Lightning Network Isn’t Living Up to the Dream

### 1. Centralization Risk

To use Lightning effectively, users often rely on large hubs or nodes. This creates centralized points of control that contradict Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. A few big players control a large share of Lightning’s capacity, creating bottlenecks and censorship risks.

### 2. Custodial Risks

Many Lightning wallets are custodial or semi-custodial, meaning users must trust third parties to manage their funds. This goes against Bitcoin’s principle of “be your own bank” and exposes users to hacks, freezes, or fraud.

### 3. Complexity and User Experience

Lightning is complicated. Opening and managing payment channels isn’t straightforward for average users. This limits adoption and keeps Bitcoin out of the hands of everyday people.

### 4. Limited Use Cases

Lightning is mainly useful for small, instant payments but not suited for larger transactions or diverse financial applications. It lacks the broad utility needed to truly replace traditional money or scale for mass adoption.

## What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future

The core team’s focus on Lightning instead of scaling the main chain has left Bitcoin more of a “digital gold” store of value than the peer-to-peer cash Satoshi envisioned. This has opened the door for other blockchains, like $XRP Ledger, to build fast, low-cost, scalable payment systems that banks and fintech companies are already using.

I had no idea for sure if the guy passed away but it looks like he did cause she's been wearing this cremation necklace in her photos. So I assumed he's gone na. 

And then, the kid hay. 

I told myself ayoko ng anak. Nor do I want a partner with a kid, cause to be honest, while I'm fond of kids, I don't think I'm patient enough to raise or help raise a kid (yes, advanced ako magisip) it's also worth noting that I came from a very dysfunctional family. 

Now, she hasn't told me any of this yet. Never namen napagusapan in detail yung past relationships niya, and I think I'm partly at fault, kasi natatakot ako ibring up. 

I've been hinting at her that I'm being pressured by my mom for a kid, and she just sent an emoji as a response to that. I figured she doesn't want to talk about it so I dropped the topic. 

I tried to brush off the fact that she has a kid, and then eventually we went on our first date, and it was okay naman. We had dinner, coffee, then drove around for a bit while nagkkwentuhan. The conversation was so much better irl than online, so I was really happy about that. 

She has a big masc energy talaga, like you wouldn't think na may anak siya. She's so pretty too, very soft spoken and well mannered. Ang perfect na sana. 

I'm so torn if deal breaker ba na may anak siya or hindi. I think mas deal breaker ata that she left out this really important information. 

Idk what to do, to be honest. Di ko alam if I should already confront her about it, how do I ease in to the conversation about her past? Madali nalang dapat to pero ang hirap pala pag alam ko na yung sagot na gusto ko marinig from her. 

We're already planning on going out again, pero parang di ko alam if it's time that I ask her and tell her what I know? Should I just wait for her to tell me??? Pano ko va siya pipigain? Is it a red flag na parang di ata siya seryoso in dating me kasi, again, WHO LEAVES THIS INFORMATION OUT? Shouldn't it be something you tell a person you want to potentially date off the bat???

Help a gay girl out. Nasisira na yung judgment ko because I like her too much 😭😭😭

(Written as a firsthand experience)


---

I never believed in mirror superstitions.
Break one, you get seven years bad luck? Whatever.
Say “Bloody Mary” three times? Nothing.

But this… this wasn’t a game.

This mirror took me.


---

It started last November.
My grandmother passed and left me her house.
Old farmhouse, middle of nowhere, cold as hell.
The only thing she told me in her will was:

> “Don’t cover the mirror in the upstairs hallway. Let it see.”



Weird, right?
I figured it was some senile quirk. But when I moved in, I saw it.

A massive, old mirror — six feet tall, silver frame warped like melting wax.
It didn’t match the house. It didn’t match anything.
And when I looked into it…

I noticed something was off.

It was me, yeah — but my reflection… lagged.

Like I’d turn my head, and for a half second, my reflection would stay frozen, still staring at me.
Not a delay. A choice.


---

That first week, I kept catching it.
At night, it would flicker.
Like static. Like something pushing through.

Then, one night, I walked past and saw my reflection smiling.
But I wasn’t.
I swear on everything — I wasn’t.

I backed up, stared into it.
My reflection was still grinning — too wide, too many teeth, the mouth stretching just a little too far.

Then it stopped, mimicked me again.
Like it didn’t want me to catch it.


---

I tried to ignore it.
Told myself it was stress, grief, isolation.

But then came the tapping.

From inside the mirror.

Just faint, slow taps — like fingernails on glass.
Always at 3:33 AM.
Every. Night.

Until I made the mistake.

Until I got curious.


---

That night, I waited.
Sat in front of the mirror with a flashlight.
3:32 AM. Silence.

Then…
tap. tap. tap.

I asked, “What are you?”

The mirror fogged up from the inside.
And one word wrote itself in the condensation:

> “YOU.”



I laughed. Nervous.
Wiped the glass.
But my reflection didn’t move.

It stood still while I wiped, breathing slow and heavy.
Eyes locked on me.

Then it stepped forward.


---

The glass rippled, like water.
And before I could move, a hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.

It was cold and slick, like wet porcelain.
It yanked me into the glass — no impact, just a slide —
like falling through the surface of a still pond.


---

And then I was in the other side.

The same house, but dead quiet.
Gray light.
Everything covered in dust and static, like an abandoned film set.

I turned around — the mirror was gone.

In its place was a window, and on the other side of the glass…
was me.

The real me.
Watching TV. Drinking coffee.

He took my life.

And I’m stuck here, on this side, in the echo.


---

The world here isn’t dead.
But it’s not alive either.

The birds don’t fly.
The clocks don’t move.
The sky is always that same choking gray.

But sometimes, at night, I see others.
Figures, distorted, half-formed.
Things trapped in their own reflections.

And I know what they are now.

They're all people who looked too long.
Asked too many questions.
Let it in.


---

If you ever see your reflection move when you don’t…
If you ever see it smile when you're not smiling…

Don’t touch the glass.
Don’t stare back.
And whatever you do…

Don’t answer if it taps.

Because once you do,
your world becomes theirs.

And they never let go.

**Elder Witches Astrology Forecast for July 1st – 15th**

**-- by vrwriter78**

 

Overview:

Retrogrades are a big theme this month with Neptune, Saturn, and Mercury all slowing down. While **Mercury Retrograde** (July 18-August 11 in Leo) gets a lot of buzz, its effects—think miscommunications, tech glitches, postponed plans, and re-doing tasks—don't have to be negative. It's a prime time to triple-check contracts, back up files, and anticipate minor tech hiccups. While it doesn’t have to be a bad experience, I will caution that starting new jobs can be tricky, because expectations might be unclear or something about the work or the duties gets restructured later.

Life happens, so if you *must* sign a contract or buy electronics, do your research, consult experts for major contracts, and be ready to revisit things later. This **Leo Mercury Retrograde** asks us to communicate from the heart. Leo loves to lead and shine, but during this time, focus on curiosity, playfulness, and active listening. The best leaders know how to serve, not just take charge.

**Retrogrades: General Guidance**

Generally, retrogrades favor finishing projects, tying up loose ends, and taking stock of where you've been before deciding where to go next. Each planet's energy shifts to allow us to finish up one cycle before we begin the next one. Here are the themes of each planet that will be retrograde:

·        **Saturn** (responsibility, rules, structure, discipline and authority)

·        **Neptune** (illusion, fantasy, dreams, mental health, psychic ability)

·        **Mercury** (communication, tech, travel, and the internet).

These planets are all ""operating more slowly,"" guiding us to revisit old territory and rehash whatever needs to be addressed before embarking on a new cycle.

On July 15th, the moon in Pisces opposes Mars (and Mars squares Venus), so expect people to be a little more irritable or sensitive. Be wary of hasty decisions or impulsive actions, as emotions might run high. Since both the moon and Venus are at unfriendly angles to Mars, this could spark disagreements with loved ones if we don't pause and react calmly. With the sun also squaring Chiron, our buttons may feel pushed, leading to negative reactions without truly listening to the other person. Many will feel better once the moon joins Saturn and Neptune in Aries on the 16th, as it finds support from planets in air and fire signs.

On the 18^(th), the day Mercury goes retrograde, it will make a harmonious aspect to Venus, making our communication more warm and loving, if we allow it. We may feel vulnerable and sensitive on the 19^(th), when the sun aspects Chiron, the planet of core wounds and healing.

July 22nd marks the sun entering Leo! This is where the sun shines brightest, beckoning us to find delight and express our innate talents. It's a social, creative, and playful time, perfect for gathering with loved ones and working on creative projects. Ask yourself: where can I shine? What playful activities can I engage with over the next three weeks?

The sun and Uranus are getting along well on the 23rd, making it a great day for brainstorming and creative breakthroughs if you've felt stuck. However, Venus will square Mars, bringing tension. This aspect often generates sexual chemistry and flirtatious banter, but it can also bring underlying relationship conflicts to the forefront. Because Mars opposes the North Node, simultaneously with Venus squaring Mars and three planets in retrograde, some of you may hit a point where you're simply done with fruitless arguments and rehashing old issues. This could be a ""make-it or break-it"" situation where you no longer have the willpower for an emotional rollercoaster.

The **New Moon in Leo on July 24th** opposes Pluto in Aquarius, reminding us we cannot move forward without addressing past wounds. Thankfully, Saturn and Neptune support this new moon, lending discipline and motivation for needed changes. Dream big on this Leo moon: what would you do if you were truly free? How would you show up if you weren't afraid? Be prepared to address past patterns even as you embrace a new future vision. This period is favorable for spells attracting attention (glamour, job interviews), freedom, creativity, self-love, and breaking old habits. If you have big goals, create a vision board and craft a spell around it. If you are an Aquarius, releasing, banishing, protection, and healing spells are highlighted for you.  
  
The sun makes an exact opposition to Pluto on the 25^(th) and Mercury squares Black Moon Lilith. The feeling I get here is a power struggle or someone standing up against a bully. There’s a line that once it is crossed, a person is done cooperating, done making excuses or putting up with B.S. If you’re feeling angry at injustice, it is okay to express it, just make sure you’re directing that in the right place and not lashing out at an innocent bystander.

If you’re craving connection and intimacy, whether that is with a romantic partner or cultivating friendship, Venus sextile Chiron on the 28^(th) could be a good time to allow yourself to be vulnerable with someone. Just be mindful that the moon will be square Venus as well on this day, so it may feel a bit uncomfortable to be so open. But as long as the person seems trustworthy, there could be rewards to doing so; there is a grand air trine, lending support to sharing ideas, information, and speaking about how you’ve grown and matured through the hardships you’ve faced.

On **July 30th, Venus enters Cancer!** Venus in Cancer is nurturing, welcoming, gentle, and comforting—always ready with tea or warm treats, sharing love, time, and home. Be kind and offer support where needed. The caveat is that a healthy Venus in Cancer understands boundaries and self-care, so don't overextend yourself or let selfish people take advantage, but do be considerate when you can.

For this cycle, text or call loved ones, bake treats, and make your home cozy. While Cancer is nurturing, watch for clingy tendencies or unsolicited advice. Find healthy ways to express emotions—journaling, therapy, or coffee with a best friend. Allow yourself to be fully present with your feelings rather than stuffing them down.

On **July 31st**, the sun conjuncts Mercury, making it a good day for brainstorming, digging for truth, or communicating ideas and plans. However, several squares and oppositions make it crucial to avoid hasty, impulsive communications or actions, as you could unintentionally rub someone the wrong way. The energy is quite scattered, with tense squares balanced by beneficial trines. It's a ""hit or miss"" day, where communication might flow freely and you feel supported, or people might be irritable and exhausted. Be prepared for both kinds of energy.

 

**Horoscopes by Sign:**

Note: Since sun sign horoscopes only cover a tiny part of the chart (affecting the accuracy), you may wish to take a look at your rising, sun, and moon sign. [Astro-Seek.com](http://astro-seek.com/) will tell you all of your planetary placements if you just want to find your rising sign. You can also find a free, accurate daily planetary reading on [Astro.com](http://astro.com/), which is based on your personal chart.

 

**Aries –** The rest of July is a time where things are slowing down. Three retrogrades are hitting at once (Mercury goes retrograde on the 18^(th)). he rest of July brings a notable slowdown for you, Aries, with three retrogrades hitting at once (Mercury goes retrograde on the 18th). You might feel exhausted or angry as tensions from Chiron, the sun, and Pluto peak around the 18th. Power struggles are possible, so wisely choose what's worth fighting for and what you can simply release. With Uranus in your house of communication combined with Mercury retrograde, you're being asked to examine how you interact with others. Be mindful of a tendency to be impulsive with your words or even tell people off this month, especially over the next three to four weeks. Overall, Uranus will be more favorable than harmful if you flow with change rather than against it.

Use the 19th and 20th to get work done or earn extra money. The sun moving into Leo on the 22nd will energize you, bringing a welcome sigh of relief now that it's out of Cancer and no longer squaring your sign. That square likely left you feeling irritable, tired, or just fed up with B.S.

Use this retrograde cycle to review your goals and focus on the nitty-gritty details, rather than rushing into new projects. Also, allow yourself time to pause and savor all you've accomplished this year. These retrogrades could be restorative if you shift your focus to being present and bringing awareness to how you feel versus the constant urge to ""do.""

The New Moon in Leo on July 24th is particularly good for you, Aries, highlighting your 5th house of children, play, performance, and creativity. This is your cue to take a vacation or a day off to truly enjoy yourself! You've been working hard with Saturn in your sign, so now is the time to relax and have some fun. This moon is highly compatible with your energy, boosting your creativity and overall zest. Just be aware that the last week of the month could be stressful, so prioritize self-care and get rest when needed.  
  


**Taurus –** Uranus has moved off of your sun/rising and moved into Taurus’ 2^(nd) house of finances and values, where it will stay for a few months before it comes back around to your sign. While this offers some breathing room, be mindful of your spending. Most Taurans appreciate creature comforts, but with Uranus bringing instability, you might find yourself spending more than planned over the next few years. Fortunately, Venus in this house for the rest of the month could work in your favor, possibly bringing unexpected extra money your way.

Uranus can bring “feast or famine” energy in the money houses, so there could be unexpected windfalls or extra expenses you weren’t prepared for. However, Uranus in the 2^(nd) affects more than just your money; it highlights your personal values and could indicate a shift in priorities until 2033. This month, reflect on what truly matters to you: what people or possessions are indispensable? How can you better protect them or show your loved ones how much they mean to you?

If you’ve been thinking about starting a side hustle, do it by the 16^(th) or wait until Mercury is out of retrograde (it begins on July 18^(th) and ends on August 11^(th)). The exception would be if you are selling used/salvaged items or your business involves making repairs. Those industries tend to do well during Mercury retrogrades, but wait to get your business license and paperwork done after August 11^(th) to minimize risk.

Mercury Retrograde highlights your 4^(th) house of home, family, and ancestry. You may be communicating more with loved ones, catching up with those you haven’t spoken to in months or years. Be prepared for delays and mishaps with communication or technology. Leave your plans flexible so you won’t be disappointed if something gets postponed.

The last week or so of the month could bring stress as the sun enters Leo and planets align in air and fire signs. You might encounter unsolicited advice or criticism, particularly from family, since Leo falls in your house of home. Or, some of you may feel overwhelmed/exhausted trying to juggle too much. It's crucial to pause, reflect, and stay present.

Consider treating yourself to a massage, hot bubble baths, or a night out at your favorite restaurant. Remember, other people's emergencies and drama don't have to become your own. Use the Leo New Moon on the 24th for protection, releasing, and banishing spells, along with any spell work involving your home or family, such as healing for parents/children or a home blessing.



**Gemini –** This is your time to shine, Gemini! With Uranus newly in your sign and Venus still present, seize the next couple of days to launch new plans or make major purchases. After Mercury goes retrograde on July 18th (until August 11th), your focus will shift to finishing existing projects, and revising or repairing what needs attention.

Your natural charm and beauty are amplified by Venus right now, even if you don't notice it. Uranus, the planet of surprises, might make you feel a bit frazzled, eccentric, or inspire a personal reinvention, bringing forth unique creative ideas. You'll feel more willing to let your talents show and share your quirky ideas.

While Mars in Virgo might bring some tension—perhaps requiring you to reorganize your space, tackle overdue paperwork, or deal with challenging family news—you're well-supported by Saturn and Neptune in Aries and Mercury in Leo, positioning you to weather whatever arises.

Mercury, your ruler, retrograding in your communication house means you might find you need to repeat things or take more care when explaining your ideas. You could also impulsively say something you later regret. Be mindful of this. It's especially **not the time for you to buy major electronics like computers or phones** unless your old one is beyond repair, and avoid signing contracts if possible. If you must sign, have multiple lawyers and/or accountants review it, as anything set in stone now is prone to hidden loopholes or issues requiring revisions later. While we generally advised against these during Mercury retrograde cycles, it is emphasized *much more strongly this year* because Mercury is in your 3^(rd) house. Avoid the confusion and the mess.

Speaking of your 3^(rd) house of communication, the sun will enter it on July 22^(nd). This is a favorable place for it to be because the sun shines brightly in Leo, and it’s a favorable sign to you. If you’re trying to expand your social media reach or do business advertising, this could be a good month to do it, just be mindful of that retrograde. If you’re single and looking to join a dating app, be mindful that it may be harder to connect with someone now (due to plans being frequently postponed or cancelled), or they may not be what they seem.

This month does offer a lovely grand air trine from the 28th to the 31st, activating your 1st, 4th, and 10th houses, potentially bringing good career news or even a family wedding invitation. However, some squares in the mix mean blessings might come with a side of stress, exhaustion, or annoying people. Mars in your house of home and family, squaring Venus, could also lead to minor disagreements or sad family news, especially with the retrogrades stirring things up.

With three retrogrades in play, you might feel like you're operating slower than usual, and that's perfectly fine. Allow yourself more time and space to accomplish tasks, and keep your plans flexible.

 

**Cancer –** The sun and Jupiter in your sign is bringing a lot of attention to yourself and how you’re feeling. You may be noticed more right now or find yourself thinking about yourself, your body, your feelings and needs. The sun stays in your sign until July 22^(nd), when it moves over to Leo and your 2^(nd) house of finances and values.

Speaking of your 2^(nd) house, I should mention that Mercury goes retrograde in Leo on the 18^(th) and will move backwards over the next three weeks. This is going to highlight communication around your finances, possessions, and your core values. You could be re-evaluating your money or your priorities right now. This is a good time for you to repair older or damaged belongings, clean up your credit report, re-evaluate your investments, and to revise your financial and business goals. If you’re thinking about a new job, this would be a good month to network with former co-workers as Mercury retrograde favors connecting with old friends or family that you haven’t seen in a while.

The planet Uranus has entered Gemini, bringing some unexpected news your way, probably around your health or a loved one’s health. This is a long 7–8-year cycle, and because the 12^(th) house can rule bed rest, hospitals, and also lost items, it’s important to follow up on any lingering health issues. You may need scans, ultra sounds, or examinations. The 12^(th) house rules the health of loved ones, so you may hear news about the health of close family and friends. Be careful when travelling to double-check that you have all belongings with you as Uranus in your 12^(th) could also show up as lost or missing items (especially when traveling by airplane or bus as Uranus rules airplanes and car engines).

This month, Mars is visiting your house of communication. You may be a little more assertive or to-the-point in your communications with others right now. You may not have as much patience for long, meandering stories or beating-around-the-bush. Be aware of giving unsolicited advice this month as you may get some pushback, with Mars opposing Saturn and squaring Venus.

There could be some tension the last week of the month as the planets are making several squares and oppositions. While there will be a harmony between Uranus, Pluto, and Mars, the other planets won’t be getting along, which may bring up some stress or frustration.

Use the Leo full moon for money spells or career spells as you will have planets in these areas of your chart. You could also do a road opener spell to clear away blockages and open up new avenues to you. Just wait to take action on NEW plans and goals until August 12^(th), if you can, to be away from the chaos of the Mercury retrograde.

 

**Leo –** Leo, the chart is lighting up for you, my friend! Mercury is in your sign, bringing lots of communication/chatter your way. Early Leos will be celebrating their birthday and reveling in the summer fun and extra attention. The sun will be leaving your house of mental health and bedrest and entering it’s home, LEO, on July 22^(nd).

While there will be planets favorable to you this month in Gemini and Aries, you are still dealing with tensions from Pluto, which is pushing early Leo’s to redefine who they are and come to a deeper understanding of self. Uranus in Gemini supports you in making these needed changes because it’s now in a friendly angle to your sun. So don’t be afraid to flow WITH change and anticipate it, rather than fighting against it.

The New Moon in your sign gives you the opportunity to visualize your dreams and claim what you want to manifest. There will be a bit of tension between Mars and Venus on this day and Pluto will oppose the new Moon, but you can still use this powerful time toward your goals. There is one caveat though, Mercury and Saturn retrograde are indicating that it’s not a good time to launch a new business, buy electronics, or to buy/sell a home right now. Wait until after August 11^(th).

If a house absolutely needs to be sold as soon as possible, then just be prepared for a lot of back and forth negotiations and if you’re the seller, you might encounter some flaky buyers or delays with the realtor/escrow company. Just be flexible and consult an expert if needed.

The last week of the month has both a grand air trine and squares. You could be feeling moody or irritable around the 30^(th) or 31^(st). The grand air trine will support you, but the energy between the 28^(th) to 31^(st) is a bit chaotic overall.

I should mention that plans may get postponed, cancelled, or revised over the next three weeks. Allow extra time if hosting birthday festivities away from home. You may get last minute cancellations, but don’t worry too much about it, that’s pretty par for the course during Mercury retrograde cycles.

 

**Virgo –** Virgo friends you’ve been dealing with Mars in your sign. This could either energize you or exhaust you as it pushes you to move at a faster pace than you are used to. The next two weeks could be a bit challenging for you as there will be a lot of fire and air planets that are not at a complimentary angle to your sign.

Since your ruler, Mercury, is going retrograde on July 18^(th), keep your plans flexible, and wait to purchase any electronics or major appliances. It’s best not to sign any contracts (that are not simple renewals) during this time as there could be something in the fine print that trips you up later or the agreement may need to be revised down the road.

This month, take a deep breath and practice some self-care. There is a lot going on around you, with T-Squares and tense aspects over the next couple of weeks. It ould just be that you are super busy at work with Venus and Uranus in your 10^(th) house of career. Don’t be surprised if there is some kind of big shakeup around your career this year or next year.

Try to keep your schedule light over the next three weeks if you can, so you have down time to decompress and re-center yourself. These squares aren’t inherently bad; sometimes we need friction in order to get things moving – or to motivate us to get out of a crappy situation. Just know that there could be more pressure on you right now than you’re used to.

The New moon on the 24^(th) falls in Leo, which is your 12^(th) house of bed rest, hospitals, mental health, psychic vision, and family’s health. You might be getting more health news than usual during this retrograde, or you may have to slow down and take days off to see to your mental health.

If you are interested in psychic development, this month would be a great time to practice energy work exercises, psychic development, or meditation. Mercury gives you added intuition and mental fortitude for occult work. Use this new moon for mental health spells or shadow work, psychic development, healing spells for family, releasing, and banishing. If you’re seeking to go into therapy, this could be a time where you put out a call for a good therapist or mental health professional. Or, if you’ve had trouble sleeping and need to get a sleep study done, that would be also highlighted now.

Leo also rules the heart, children, and play. Maybe you can use this time to do something fun – take a vacation, go to an amusement park, or a summer concert. Create some art or spend some time with children. Tune in to what your heart is telling you that it needs. Be present with it and listen to its wisdom.

 

**Libra –** Dear Libra, I know some of you have felt like you've been hit from multiple sides, with Jupiter and the sun in Cancer squaring you and Saturn and Neptune opposing your sign. You're exhausted and definitely need a break—hang in there! On the bright side, your ruler Venus is in Gemini, and Uranus has also entered Gemini, bringing spontaneity and surprises that mostly work in your favor due to an excellent trine. You'll also benefit from a grand trine in air signs toward month-end.

However, some tension from the sun and Jupiter, plus Mars inconjunct your sign, might zap your energy and willpower. You could find people unexpectedly irritable or rude, and even your renowned charm might hit its limits. It's crucial to center yourself right now. Between social invitations, work demands, and relationship tensions, prioritize self-care and carve out time just for you this summer.

Mercury will be retrograde from July 18th-August 11^(th). This is likely to involve a flurry of communication from friends. It’s not a good time to buy any electronics or sign any important contracts, if you can help it. Mercury retrograde can cause travel delays, postponed or cancelled plans, and technology issues. Since this is not in a square or opposition to you, I see you weathering things pretty well, but be cautious of having to sign work contracts or partnership agreements!

The sun moves into Leo on July 22nd, which is much more aligned with your energy and boosts your spirit. Things will flow a little more once it does, though there will be a few days when the sun opposes Pluto in Aquarius, so you might notice others around you stressing out as this is lightly to impact your friend circle or social organizations. There may be some drama or power struggles. I don’t see you being too heavily affected, other than through hardships on your friends. But the work drama could have you wanting to pop some popcorn and watch the sparks flying.

The New Moon in Leo on July 24th highlights your house of friends and opposes Pluto in your house of children, play, and fun. This makes it ideal for spells supporting friends or children, or encouraging a friendship to blossom into romance. There’s a grand air trine for early Librans, making it a good time for spells to increase social activity or build momentum toward a big personal goal. Just wait until after August 11th to launch any major new ventures to avoid Mercury retrograde chaos.

The last four to five days of the month might feel scattered and chaotic, with several squares despite the supportive grand trine. You might notice heightened stress or anxiety in those around you. While I don't foresee any major direct hits to you, if difficulties arise, remind yourself that this, too, shall pass!

I’m the founder of a new platform called Purple, and I wanted to share how this all started — and where we’re headed.

🎧 From Music to Momentum

Growing up, I was obsessed with music. I didn’t know it back then, but listening to songs on repeat until I knew every word was the start of something deeper. Eventually, I started making my own music and collaborating with others.

College was never optional in my household (shoutout to Nigerian parents), so I ended up at Virginia Tech. And that’s where everything really began.

⸻

🚨 The Entrepreneurial Itch

Between classes, I met other artists and producers — we made music, threw shows, and started building something special. We rented out pizza shops, community centers, and even frat house backyards.
Lights, fog machines, real flyers — we weren’t just doing shows. We were building a scene.

And people showed up. A lot of them. It felt like we were creating something that people actually needed.

⸻

💡 The Idea for Purple

After hosting multiple sold-out shows, it hit me:

Why is it still this hard to bring people together in real life?

We were jumping between Instagram, Eventbrite, Canva, Google Forms — it felt like duct-taping the internet together just to create community.

So I started building Purple:
A platform that gives creators, organizers, and community builders the tools they need to bring people together — all in one place.

Think: Eventbrite x early Instagram, but built for authenticity.

⸻

🚀 Where We’re At Now

We started building Purple in February 2025. We’re now in July, five months later, and we’re this close to our beta launch.

We’ve had no outside funding, just late nights, coffee, and belief. And now the product is real.

⸻

🫱🏽‍🫲🏽 Why I’m Sharing This

Because I always found posts like these helpful — and I want to return the favor.

Also:
If you’re building something and feel like you don’t know what you’re doing — same. But I’m learning as I go. And it’s actually working.

In the words of Steve Jobs:

“Everything around you was built by people no smarter than you.”

So if you’re on the fence about building — just start.

⸻

We’re opening up early access soon. If you want to follow along, test the product, or just see what happens — I’d love to have you.

Early 2023 it was 5.6, late 2024 it was 5.9, and it is now 6.1. My activity level has stayed fairly consistent throughout this period. I am a construction worker, so stay fairly active at work and we do an evening dog walk every day after dinner. I am 5'9 and weigh 175, down from 185 in early 2023 (I attribute the weight loss to reducing my alcohol intake)

In early 2023 I was drinking more heavily, typically 4-6 beers per day. By late 2024 I had cut down to 12 a week, which I have continued to present (although I have gone from Modelo to premium European beers).

The only consistent dietary change between late 2024 and now is switching to breakfast burritos (detailed below) from an Everything bagel with cream cheese, although I might also be eating slightly more sweets.

Typical Diet:

Breakfast: egg, Spanish rice, shredded cheese and salsa on whole wheat tortilla, coffee with 1/2 & 1/2 

First snack: lightly salted almonds and approx. 3 oz. cheese, Equate diabetic care chocolate shake

Lunch: turkey and cheese sandwich with mayo/Sriracha on whole wheat toast, single serving bag of potato chips, fun size candy bar

Second snack: Cajun trail mix

Sample dinners:

Pork tenderloin with roasted Brussels sprouts and rolls

Shredded bbq chicken (no sugar added bbq sauce) on baked potatoes

Breaded and fried pork chops with side salad

Shrimp alfredo with garlic bread

Chicken fried rice

In addition to this I typically drink 12 beers a week. Sometimes less, very rarely more. Usually two in the evening, occasionally one or none.

On the weekend I might have a few spoonfuls of ice cream or another fun size candy bar or two. Once or twice a month I might have a fast food milkshake, or I might go a couple months without. We rarely eat out, but if we do it is typically fast food as part of a road trip, maybe every other month.

I am hoping to see where I can improve my diet to address this trend in the wrong direction. Any and all input/advice is appreciated and I will do my best to respond to any questions/clarifications promptly.",1,1752633800.0,prediabetes,2,1.0,False

What did you do?,"I was at a traditional meeting today which I've been to before but very rarely attend. There was a very small group of us including a newcomer who just hit 30 days sober. The newcomer suggested that we talk about the first step, and we did, and everything was going well until the last gentleman's share. I'll call him 'the missionary'. The missionary leaned real hard into trusting God and praying in his share, and was basically talking directly to the newcomer God and prayer over and over again. Honestly this stuff happens at a traditional meeting and if it had only gone that far I wouldn't be too bothered.

After the meeting the missionary continued to talk to this newcomer, but then the talk got more and more intense. I didn't hear everything he said but I did hear things like ""Jesus Christ died on the cross for you"" and ""Once you get Baptized in my church you will be a new man and all your troubles will melt away"" he invited him to his church and his Bible study. He probably talked to the newcomer for a solid 15-20 minutes about converting him to his religion. 

Another atendee at the meeting muttered to me that the missionary ""tries to convert people all the time"" and that ""some people are sicker than others"" By now my blood is boiling because I feel like the missionary is preying upon a newcomer who may not be in the best headspace to get him to see God his way, and in my opinion even traditional AA isnt about that.

I came up with a couple excuses to stick around, drank more coffee and caught up with the newcomer in the parking lot after the other guy had finally left. I was far more diplomatic than I really wanted to be, but I told the newcomer that ""while I respect that guy's passion, and he seemed friendly, that in AA God can be whatever you want it to be, if anything at all"" because honestly I don't want to sell my beliefs(or nonbeliefs) in that situation either. The newcomer thanked me for my concern, and told me that he was raised Jewish and doesn't know what he believes, and he intends to explore that, but it won't be at the missionaries Bible study or church. Which i was happy to hear

Have any of you been in this situation? What would you all do? Did I overreact, underreact, or do the right amout of react? I mean everybody can believe what they want to believe and if it doesn't affect me I'm ok with that, but this just felt so predatory.",3,1752633563.0,AASecular,0,1.0,False

1m116eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1m116eb/i_married_amarantha_i_barely_survived/,I Married Amarantha. I Barely Survived.,"

Let me preface this with a warning: if you’re the kind of person who reads BookTok, drinks aggressively medium roast coffee, and thinks red flags are a suggestion—this is your story. Or mine. I'm Rhys. 32. Male. Once naïve. Now seasoned like a cast iron skillet that’s been through a few grease fires.

This all kicked off back in 2021. But rewind a bit: Amarantha (32F) and I have known each other since high school. Same neighborhood. Same awkward teenage friend groups. She got married young to a guy who was such a piece of work he skipped town and life itself before their divorce was finalized. So technically, she's a widow. I’d been through my own brand of trauma—which I won’t unpack here, for your mental health and mine—but suffice to say, when we reconnected, sparks flew. Or maybe that was a red flare. Who can say?

We dated for six whirlwind months before getting married. Quick wedding, normal family chaos. Then she took a “find-myself” trip to Europe, which sounds fun until you find out she was drugged by some of her travel companions and came home with a concussion and a whole new personality: emotionally volatile with a side of gaslight.

It started slow. A jab here, a dig there. But over time, she stopped pulling punches. She’d twist open the wounds of my past and salt them like a line cook at Red Lobster. Yet, paradoxically, when I was at my lowest, she’d console me—like a fireman lighting the match and then handing you the hose.

That emotional whiplash? It gave her control. Full-on isolation mode. She excommunicated me from my own family, moved us across state lines, and slowly turned my life into a hostage situation where the ransom was my sense of self.

By 2019 (yes, we’re time-skipping like a bad Netflix miniseries), we were in couples therapy. Eight therapists, to be exact. They all saw the same thing: I was doing everything I could and she was constantly shifting the goalposts. We finally found a therapist who said the same thing as the others, but with just the right phrasing to not make Amarantha feel ""attacked."" Progress, right?

Naturally, we celebrated with the worst decision two broken Millennials could make: we had a baby to save the marriage.

Enter Nyx—our daughter, my light, my anchor, the only genuinely good thing to come out of this emotional FEMA site of a relationship. Amarantha nearly died during the pregnancy, which understandably changed her, but she weaponized that bitterness like a dagger made of unpaid therapy bills. I did everything—night feeds, diaper runs, mental health check-ins—but nothing was enough. The goalposts? Gone. We're not even playing the same sport anymore.

Oh, and if you thought this was going to stay a two-player game—think again.

Amarantha is bisexual and had always manipulated our dynamic, holding threesomes with women over my head like some twisted ""if you're a good boy, maybe"" reward chart. Fast forward to 2021: she meets Celestina at her new job. They hit it off. Then she suggests a throuple. That’s right: a three-way relationship where we’re all dating each other.

Shockingly, it kind of worked—for like a minute. We had a wild night together (and yes, it was as mind-blowing as the 17-year-old me would’ve dreamed). But just as we started house-hunting, Celestina flipped the narrative. Suddenly, I was the financial deadweight, the reason we were “bleeding money.” Spoiler: I had receipts. Literally. We were in the green and saving.

But Amarantha? She chose chaos. And Celestina.

I was slowly pushed out of my own marriage. And here's where the universe—finally, blessedly—stepped in: Celestina had a mental breakdown and was admitted for psychiatric care. (That part sounds awful, and I don’t wish that on anyone, but I won’t lie: I was relieved.) With Celestina sidelined, Amarantha briefly snapped back to reality.

We moved back to our home state, tried therapy again, but it was too late. We divorced.

The divorce? She came at me swinging with accusations, emotional manipulation, and revisionist history. But when I laid out financial proof that she had been attempting to control and trap me for years, we settled. Split everything 50/50. She kept what was hers, I kept mine, and I made it very clear that if she wanted to get ugly, I would match her energy and then some.

But here’s the best plot twist of all: the house? Never in my name. Which meant my credit stayed clean when Celestina, still legally bound to Amarantha on the mortgage, stopped paying. Despite four failed attempts to remove Amarantha from the paperwork, it never went through. And now, Amarantha is financially trapped in a burning building she helped design.

Call it karma. Call it divine irony. I call it closure.

She’s now married to a guy named Jurian and, from what I hear, barely keeping her head above water. Do I feel bad? Not really. I was a placeholder until she found someone new. She used my body, drained my soul, and dipped.

It’s been three years since we split. I'm rebuilding. I've made some questionable choices—like dating someone we’ll call Nesta, who was so damaged by past relationships she thought basic kindness was manipulation. That ended with me being shoved down a flight of stairs. Fun times.

So yeah, some red flags were obvious. Some were written in neon across the sky. But did you see where this story was headed? Or did you, like me, hope—just for a moment—that this might have ended in healing and growth?

Spoiler: It didn’t.

But I did survive. I’m still here. And to quote one of the few good things to come out of this mess:

A child at her school pulled a cup of hot coffee onto themself that was left on the counter by a teacher visiting the class. The director was not present in the class when it happened. When she was informed of the incident she assessed the injury by removing the child’s shirt, applying neosporin (with the parents permission) and calming the child. She fed her lunch  and helped her sleep. She promptly terminated the teacher and self reported to licensing. The issue is that the parents weren’t notified to pick up the child until about 2.5 hours after the incident.

Bit of a long one, but important if you want to see the realities of being a healthcare worker. 

For context, I’m a nurse at a tertiary-level hospital, and have been for the last 5-ish years. While I have been known to run my mouth a bit, I’ve never had any conflicts with any of my coworkers, and am known to be a hard worker and reliable partner to have on duty. I have put in HUNDREDS of hours of overtime in my career at this hospital, even pulling 24-hour shifts (illegal in my location, but approved by hospital management) to compensate for the poor management decisions made by my manager. 

My manager used to be my direct supervisor working on the ward. To say we didn’t get along would be an understatement. She was determined to become a manager, and was willing to throw every innocent nurse under the bus in order to get there. She would be praised for her cutting of costs for the ward, but she did it by purposefully leaving shifts with 4 nurses for 30+ SICK patients (on many occasions), despite having a number of nurses reaching out and asking to come in to work in order to help. She denied their requests to help every time, and both the patients and us nurses suffered. Her routine practice of denying nurses from picking up shifts was the sole reason I had to pull numerous 24-hour shifts; I’d reached out a WEEK in advance and messaged every single day that week reminding her that I was available to be moved to a critically short-staffed shift. Every time, I was denied. I ended up being an extra staff member on my scheduled shift, with the dayshift having no staff. 

We never got along because I would routinely call her out on her BS. I wouldn’t be crazy about it, but I never hesitated to speak out about the unfair decisions she made and how her actions were burning us out faster than we could recover. 

Our patients were suffering, and her decisions as a supervisor put everyone into unsafe situations just so she could make HER boss happy. 

Imagine putting a random INFECTIOUS non-surgical patient into a 4-bed room on a surgery floor, when you have the power to request a more appropriate patient. 

Imagine knowing a nurse is too busy to receive report on a patient coming from the recovery room, so instead of waiting, you tell the patient to come anyways and leave the nurse stranded with a patient they know nothing about, are completely unprepared for, and are unable to even take their vital signs because they are TOO BUSY, LIKE THEY SAID THEY WERE. 

Regardless, I love the ward I work on. My coworkers are like my family, and I enjoy working with the patient population on my ward. (For context, we are a specialty ward and we are the ONLY floor with these surgeries/patients). 

Ever since my supervisor became my manager, I’ve been “reported” for many different ridiculous concerns that have NEVER been brought up to me by my coworkers (who are supposedly reporting these concerns about me). The latest? I was allegedly seen entering a patient’s room WITHOUT A STETHOSCOPE VISIBLE at some point in my 12-hour shift. 
For the record, I wear a fanny pack at work where I keep my stethoscope when I’m not using it. 

Another one: I was reported being seen sitting in the nursing station, and it was “too soon” after I began assessing my patients. A nurse?! Sitting in the NURSING station?!? 

I came out of nursing school in the heart of COVID, and with my manager’s practices of screwing over the nurses meant that I had to become fast at my job in order to survive. Let me be clear: I do NOT skip parts of my job in order to get by. I complete every task of my job (with a smile); I just do it quickly. 

Ridiculous, right? But these are the types of “concerns” I’ve been investigated for. 
Now for the issue at hand. 

It’s extremely difficult to be approved for time off thanks to my lovely manager. I think her favorite words are, “Aw, no. That’s too bad though.” 

My niece’s first birthday was coming up, and I had to buy a plane ticket at the last minute seeing as I had to try and swap multiple shifts around in order to get the time off. It took a lot of bargaining with my coworkers and me agreeing to a number of terrible shifts in order to accomplish getting the time off, but I managed to do it! I booked my ticket, and my brother was ecstatic to hear I’d be able to make it to his daughter’s first birthday. I live 13 hours away, so this would also be the first time I’d be able to even meet her. 

The week of her birthday arrives, and I realize that I had been approved for a shift that week that I completely forgot I had bid on. Panic mode: ACTIVATED. I did everything I could to get the shift off; I even requested to use some of my banked overtime hours and remaining vacation hours in order to cover for the shift. 

Guess what my manager’s response was?

You guessed it: no. 

Why, you ask? Because the request was put in within the same week. 

(Keep in mind, though: we cannot submit requests for anything more than 14 days in advance! Basically: automatic no unless you’re a superstar who has the time to submit the request within those 6 days. As a busy nurse, this is impossible.)

I even submitted a request to use my union-gifted personal hours in order to get this shift off. 

You already know what response I got. 
I exhausted every option I had. I’d already paid over $2000 for the plane ticket home, and it was non-refundable at that point. I was stuck with a single 8-hour shift in an otherwise now-empty work week. A single 8-hour shift in an administrative nursing job (we don’t see patients in person) stopping me from meeting my beautiful niece and witnessing her very first birthday on this earth.

So I did what any human would do: I called in sick for the shift. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know the whole kabab about “time theft” and the importance of only using sick time when you’re actually sick. I tried every single thing I could to get rid of the shift using the proper channels. 

My brother and I grew up in a horribly abusive home, so the fact that he had children and is a good dad was a miracle for him. Those babies turned his life around, and are the only reason we were able to work on repairing our relationship. 

Seeing that miracle baby’s first birthday (a literal once-in-a-lifetime event) was not an option for me. So yeah, I called in sick for a single shift. 

Unfortunately, I was scheduled for a meeting with my manager on that day (which would take me from my shift in order to attend). I made sure to let her know that I wouldn’t be able to attend and we would need to reschedule. In addition to being “sick”, the required union rep for the meeting wasn’t able to attend either. In summary: no union rep= no meeting. So, even if I HAD worked, I still would have had to reschedule due to not having a union rep present. I made it very clear to my manager that my calling in sick was in NO WAY related to our meeting, and that I would like to reschedule the meeting at her convenience. 

Jump to today:
I had a follow-up meeting with my manager. I was told my responses to their concerns (remember sitting in the NURSING station?) “didn’t make sense”, and I committed improper usage of my sick time. 

I was formally suspended from my job as a nurse for 2 shifts, and received a disciplinary letter as well. 

For calling in for a single shift using my accumulated sick time. 

During a nursing staffing crisis. 

Now, I’m not dumb. I’ll admit I wasn’t sick. However, being SUSPENDED for calling in for a single shift? I’ve never improperly used my sick time in the past, so this was a first offence. No warning, just straight to suspending me. 

To be frank, I’m convinced my manager has it out for me. All of these accusations that have been reported about me are ridiculous (and not illegal, to boot) and have never had a face behind them. My manager refuses to disclose who reports these things (fair enough), but conversations with my coworkers revealed nothing but shock and having no idea what I was talking about. I’m a very approachable person, so I have no doubt that they would feel comfortable telling me concerns they had. In fact, I make it a point to tell them to tell me if I’m doing something sketchy or annoying so I can fix it. 

I’ve already talked to the union rep, and I’ve decided I’m going to dispute the suspension given by my manager and request another investigation by the nursing union. In that investigation, my manager will be forced to provide actual documented evidence in regard to the behaviours I’ve been accused of. 

Now, I’m laying on my couch in my PJs with my cats watching trashy reality TV pondering my life choices. The union rep recommended I change to a different department at work, but I love my current floor. As tiring and emotionally draining it is, I genuinely love my job and I do everything I can to properly care for my patients. Besides, I deserve better than being run off because my manager doesn’t like me. 

I was there when my coworkers sobbed in the supply rooms after witnessing horrible deaths. I was there to save the new grad nurses who were suddenly placed in charge of 30+ patients, when they themselves were just trying to survive through a shift. I was there holding my patient’s hand as they took their final breaths alone because their family wouldn’t stay with them. 

Where was my manager? Oh, her shift ended at 4pm, so she got to go home and leave all of us under the bus she drove into our ward. 

I know it’s a depressing tale, but it’s my reality. I’ve helped save hundreds of lives over the years, but seeing my niece have her first ever cupcake at her first birthday apparently makes me a terrible nurse worthy of suspension. I know some people will say, “No, it made you a bad employee”, but my job is different from others. My “job” is keeping people alive, not making reports or keeping profits up. I may be an employee, but my employer is a government healthcare system. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to my situation. I’m open to advice for how to move forward, even if it is just changing my mindset to help get rid of some of this anger I have. 

Side note: our gift for Nurse’s Week this year was an email that said, 
“We were going to gift you coffee, but you deserve far more than that.”
In the end, they never got us anything.

1m1152m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1m1152m/yearning_and_exhausted/,Yearning and exhausted,"I (24M) have been working full time and living on my own for a little over a year now. Growing up I never really got into a super committed relationship in either high school or college. There were a few talking stages but COVID and long distance shut those down quickly. 

In my time on my own, the desire for companionship has grown miserably intense in a manner that almost seems involuntary. Before anyone asks, no I don’t place all of my self worth in being in a relationship. I have plenty of things to do on my own, but recently it’s begun to feel pointless, because at the end of the day what I really want is someone to share the things I love with, and hopefully they’d want to do the same for me. As an introvert I have a harder time meeting new people, as I don’t have a strong social circle in my town at the moment. I’ve been trying to go out to bars and coffee shops by myself, just to show that I’m open to meeting people, but this feels so unnatural to me at a soul level. So I find myself in a really awkward place where I feel like I have to play a character to find what I’m looking for, but that would in essence by lying to everyone I meet thereafter. On top of all of it, full time work is hard to juggle a social life with, and I many times have to triage personal tasks like cooking and cleaning over trying to go out and be social, which makes the issue worse in my head. 

I haven’t tried dating apps yet, for a couple reasons. I’m 5’6” and average looking (straight btw) in a rather problematic location for dating apps (small population, skewed to higher age range). I only hear bad things about them for guys but I guess it’s the only other play on the playbook. 

TL;DR I have been yearning to find a romantic connection with someone, and have been frustrated with how it feels like being myself is some sort of road block to doing so. ",1,1752633207.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1m11435,https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/1m11435/the_masterplan/,The Masterplan?,"I'm not sure if this is the place to post this, but I am completely beside myself and I don't know where else to go. Any words of anything would help right now. This is very long, but it's a long complicated story.

I confessed my feelings to my friend yesterday morning. We've known each other for just over two and a half years. I have had feelings for him for...just over two and a half years. We live on opposite sides of the country, but have kept a close friendship. We met on a bus in 2022 while both traveling to another city to see the same band. His friend was wearing a t-shirt of the band, he was wearing a t-shirt of my favorite (Belgian) brewery. They asked to join us as we were on the way to a brewery. He seemed rather quiet at first, till we found we both kept track of all the concerts we attended & shared the same first musical love. We hung out for about seven hours straight & compared show counts and were literally within a ten of one another. He texted to make sure we got home alright that night. And the following morning, he & his friend arranged to meet up briefly at the airport as we were both leaving around the same time.

We started dm'ing one another upon arriving home. We spoke every day and I found myself looking forward to talking to him more and more. About a month later, we were attending another concert of the same band in a different city and I met a bunch of his friends. A few of them said things to me like ""you guys are soooo similar"" and ""how did YOU get close to HIM? no one gets close to him!"" These are friends that have known him for many, many years. I left feeling stronger feelings, but knowing we wouldn't see each other for a while & assumed the feelings would fade during that time. Did I mention I was also with someone else during all this? I was. The feelings persisted.

Aside from similar interests, being the same age & the eldest of three of our respective families, he's a very private person, who is not very open/vulnerable with other people. I too am a rather private person, who struggles with being vulnerable with others. We are both very giving and supportive to others in our lives and bonded over this. I'm an intensely emotional & passionate INFJ & I believe he is an INFT, but who knows really. He is incredibly caring and sweet, to a point that no platonic friend has ever acted towards me before. I have had many friends of the opposite sex throughout the course of my life - no one has been like him. Not even close.

We met up for concerts together with our friends the next spring and the feelings were still there. Two months after, he suggested we follow around the same band for a few days in France together, alone. He insisted we kept it a secret from our other friends. I jumped at the chance. My feelings intensified on that trip. We ended up sleeping in the same bed due to a booking error & he insisted it was no issue at all, that he would sleep above the covers. We rode bikes under a full moon and enjoyed one another's uninterrupted company greatly. We stayed in bed late talking the following rainy morning. In response to me joking about having a panic attack he told me ""if I'm around,  you don't have to worry about that happening"". Smitten is an understatement to how I arrived back home. Another winter came & went.

The following spring he visited with his brother and the two of us spent the final day of his trip, the day before his birthday together. We strolled the park, went to the museum, walked across the city & had dinner. I snuck a birthday card in his backpack before he left the next morning. A few weeks later, we took off on another international trip following our favorite band again. This trip felt incredibly romantic to me. Kind of hard not to in the English countryside with someone willing to drive you anywhere and everywhere and caring for you while you are sick. We teased each other mercilessly. I asked him ""do you tease everyone this much?"" and he replied ""I don't spend this much time with other people"" with a smile. He was a perfect gentlemen the whole trip. He opened every door. He carried my suitcase. He let me off every elevator first. We shared a bed one night and he put a pillow between us. It was surreal and enchanting. I cried hard behind sunglasses saying goodbye when I hugged him too tight & he said ""we'll see each other soon"". I cried in public all over London feeling tortured by the situation I was in. A few months later, he came back to my city for a quick visit for two concerts with one of our friends.

The following month I went to a show with our group of our friends in WA and texted him that we missed him. He replied that he missed me too. Two days later, I flew down to see him/spend my birthday with our friend's parents. He drove me to LA for a concert of one of my favorite bands & took me out to dinner. A few days later, my friend's family threw me a birthday party where I met his family who all stated ""we've heard so much about you"". His mother instantly launched into how much she wants him to find someone to settle down with & thought he would've with another woman he was friends with years prior, but he never told that woman his feelings. His mother told me ""I asked him once if he regretted not sharing his feelings with her before she got married and he told me yes"". It was quite a position to be in for me, having all these feelings for her son but unable to act upon them. It was very overwhelming and very easy to start imagining what it would be like if I packed up my life and moved coasts to be with him. He made an effort to see me every single day I was in town - even if it was just stopping by to have coffee together first thing in the morning. He told me his mother told him she felt like she had known me forever.

The following month, he had to do a very tough thing and check in on his friend's parent to confirm they had passed. I was the person he called the following day to tell about this. It was then that I realized just how close we had grown with time. Later that week, he & his parents took a cruise which departed & returned out of my city. He asked me to meet up with them both days for the few hours they had before their cruise/return flights home. We saw each other last in November for a few more shows in a group setting.

This year, we had plans to go on our third international trip. This time it was to see the reunion of that first much loved band we had originally bonded over. My personal life hit a major roadblock and I kept my distance from everyone, including him. When I informed him of what was going on in my life he was supportive. And a few weeks later, he inquired if I still wanted to go on this trip we had planned to do last year. I explained I was not in a position to do so financially & he told me he felt I should really, really, really go & offered to cover the cost of our accommodations if I could cover the flight. I booked my flight. I booked it knowing this would be the time I would come clean about my feelings. The years of yearning finally took their toll & my life circumstances were finally at a place where I was ready to come clean on my feelings.

This trip took place last week. I felt that he was a little distracted/disengaged compared to our previous trips together, but he's been dealing with the loss of his grandfather & his father going through cancer treatment. We still had a good time & stayed up late talking in the dark and laughing. One night, I expressed my level of overthinking &  he shared with me that he actually aphantasia & joked about having ""no thoughts"". We talked about this quite a bit over the course of our time together, which was fun but felt less romantic than our time together previously. I felt he was distracted and disengaged. I was anxious and unsure I was doing the right thing, but then we would have moments where it felt like there certainly is something between us.

Since he had booked us a room with a Queen bed & had a very early flight yesterday, I decided not to tell him how I felt till the following morning right before he left. It was very, very hard but I did it. I told him I know we had connection, but that I had felt there was something more. That I had feelings for him. That I had had feelings for him a long time. That I needed to let him know even though I was scared of it ruining our friendship. That he had consumed my thoughts, a lot. He responded that he wasn't in a place to have a relationship. That he has never had a relationship. That he hasn't even thought about being in a relationship for about 30 years (we are both 42). He told me he was flattered and had never had anyone confess having such feelings for him. I asked him if he had a crush on anyone and he replied ""no, not for about 30 years"". He told me that he wished he could reciprocate feelings. He asked me if I was going to be okay and I lied and said yes. I managed not to cry.

I was crushed.

I am crushed.

We ate an awkward breakfast together after I asked if he still wanted me to join him before he left to the airport. I was half in a state of shock and half asleep and heart broken and can't remember what we talked about much. I asked him if he ever noticed any signs of me having feelings and he said ""no, but maybe if I look back now I will be able to"". He said how he never thought anyone would ever feel this way towards him and I apologized for being the first to put him in this position. I told him he'd probably find himself in this position again in life and I joked that he definitely would because he plans to live forever.

He told me to text him when I got to the airport later that day. I stayed at the hotel for a few more hours and cried and slept and cried some more. He texted me to say that his flight was delayed, hoped that I got some more sleep. I cried some more & told him I had just gotten to the airport. He said he wished I had a good flight and I cried some more. I've cried and cried and cried. I lost count how many times the tears have flowed. I got home yesterday and cried. I woke up and cried. I went to work and cried. I took lunch and cried. I got home from work and cried. I'm writing this and I'm crying. I've spent so much time and so many zillions of thoughts on him/us/a potential future. I know that's unfair. People find themselves in unrequited love situations all the time, but this just feels ironic. A 1% of the population person (INFJ) falling in love with another 1% of the population.

I know this is a me problem, but I'm heartbroken all the same.

I love him so much.

tldr; I've been unknowingly in love with an aromantic for almost three years & finally told him how I felt yesterday. he told me he is aromantic without using the word. i found out the word today reading up on it assuming what he was was asexual. he also happens to have aphantasia. I believe he is in the closet about being aromantic based on things his family/friends have said to me about him. I am utterly heartbroken.",1,1752633125.0,aromantic,1,1.0,False

I'm looking to setup a weekly coffee chat with other LIC-based entrepreneurs and/or people working in the AI industry. This could be 1:1, or could grow to more of a meetup depending on how many are interested and what other people are looking for. My goal from this is to find others to learn from, to grow my local community, and to find more sources of collaboration to bounce ideas off of and pressure-test my thinking.

About me: I'm an LIC local, 37M, and recently launched a business in the AI space after getting laid off by Microsoft. It's going better than I was expecting, which is pretty fortunate :) When I'm not working, I like to play pickleball, workout, read, practice yoga, travel the world, watch standup comedy, and take long walks around the city. 

If this is of interest, drop me a line and we can meet at a local coffee shop and explore a mutual fit.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **La Liga 2025-26 Kicks Off: Villarreal vs. Oviedo – A David vs. Goliath of the Mediterranean**

The Spanish La Liga’s new season opens with a mismatch so stark, it’s like sending a go-kart to race a Formula 1 car… except the go-kart forgot to charge its battery. On August 15, Villarreal takes on Real Oviedo in a clash of titans and minnows, with the odds reflecting a confidence as sturdy as a Spanish *churro* dipped in coffee. Let’s dissect this opener with the precision of a Barcelona tiki-taka play.

---

### Parse the Odds: Villarreal’s Implied Invincibility

The bookmakers have priced this contest like a one-sided chess game. Villarreal sits at **1.31 decimal odds** (implied probability: **76.3%**), while Oviedo’s **9.0 odds** (11.1% chance) suggest they’re here to vacation, not compete. The draw? A meager 4.8 odds (**20.8%**), which feels generous given Oviedo’s historical struggles against Villarreal’s “Yellow Submarine” attack.

Statistically, Villarreal’s depth and European pedigree (they’ll juggle Champions League and La Liga this season) dwarf Oviedo’s resources. The latter, a team that’s bounced between tiers like a malfunctioning elevator, lacks the firepower to trouble Unai Emery’s side. If football had a “Tale of Two Cities,” this is it: it’s the best of Villarreal’s golden generation, the worst of Oviedo’s budget constraints.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Schedule Shenanigans, and a Goalkeeper’s Wild Past

Villarreal brings **good news**: their star striker, **Arnaut Danjuma**, has been training with a robotic exoskeleton to recover from a minor hamstring tweak. Meanwhile, Oviedo’s defense is… *colorful*. Captain **Álvaro García** is out with a “tripping injury” sustained during a team-building exercise where players had to navigate an obstacle course of their own shoelaces. (Spoiler: He tripped. Twice.)

Oviedo’s woes don’t end there. Their goalkeeper, **Álvaro Cervera**, has a CV as eclectic as a Renaissance polymath: three seasons in La Liga, two in the circus (as a human

So for context, today, I ate a good half of a deep dish pizza that had a ton of tomato sauce on it.

After about 5 to 10 mins later, the part right behind my ears on both sides of my head (between jaw line and neck pocket section) started hurting. It feels inflamed and even Tylenol doesn't help at all. It hurts on both sides in the same spot.

For reference, I have my wisdom teeth out but make sure I brush my teeth and floss every day. I am fairly certain it's not TMJ, and I use my retainer every day so it's not a teeth alignment issue either.

I had these same symptoms happen with coffee in the past as well and it would take a few days for this kind of pain to go away.

I also felt a dry sinus and slight dry eyes. I do have to drink a lot of water at times throughout the day.

I had a hiatal hernia which I fixed with a Nissen Fundoplication maybe 5 or so years ago.

Anyway my main thing is: does anyone know how I can rule out if I have this disease / if it's just a GERD thing?

Also, anyone know any good Minneapolis area doctors for this kind of thing?

Last question: does anyone know any quick relief for this kind of thing? I ask because drinking water helps slightly and an ice pack only helps slightly. Anything I can drink that does the job better than water for hydration?

I ask all this because I'll be honest, I would love to pick up coffee again somehow since adult life is so tiring, especially with a newborn of around 8 months old. I don't care if it's decaf either to be honest.

1m1105a,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m1105a/mother_constantly_vents_to_me/,Mother constantly vents to me,"My mother constantly uses me for emotional support and vents to me about her problems. I can’t help but feel bad for her because I understand where she’s coming from and why she is the way she but I don’t think she realises the impact it has on me. It leaves me feeling confused. I feel confused about our relationship and dynamic because I have a lot of resentment towards her but at the same time we are quite codependent and do everything together. I want to be close with her but sometimes I just feel like she’s too all over the shop. She’s too hot and cold and I don’t know my place or what I’m going to get with her. It saddens me because I want to have a good relationship and a lot of the time we do. 

I don’t know how to even explain it to her or set boundaries because that’ll probably upset her and she’ll turn it against me and it makes me feel like I’m someone who is easily manipulated. My thoughts are so conflicted. For example if she ever really upsets me, once she starts acting really nice I forgive and just want to forget. She’s my mother and I don’t want to stay angry with her. It makes me feel like a confused person.

For context my mother has trauma from her own family that has clearly deeply affected her. She is constantly obsessing over it (I can understand why) and it affects her relationships with others and her ability to trust. Her mum (my grandmother) always had some sort of vendetta against her. While she seems nice, it’s her subtle actions that reveal how she always treated my mother as lesser than her siblings. She even writes snarky things about her own daughter in her diary, keeping tabs on her. Her actions seems like some sort of underlying jealousy. This has continued her whole life and my mum would do nothing but try to be a good daughter. Paying rent and doing chores with her siblings not having the same expectations or rules. It does make me feel awful for her. My mum has always been good to her mum and yet it still feels like it is never good enough and that she is not valued. While my grandmother seems like she is being nice to my mum, her comments and actions still show an underlying disdain towards her (even as an 80 year old woman). This has built up heaps of resentment for my mother, where sometimes she despises her and her own sister too for the treatment of her. She often says she is just evil or that she is such a nasty calculated woman, and even finds herself deeply hurt till this day. 

Not to mention her relationship issues with my father, I get to hear them all. I listen to her cry and break down. Sometimes she’s like an emotional mess. Then after a while things go back to normal like there are no issues. But I can’t get these moments out of my head. It distorts the image I have of my family. I feel cruel to not support her when she is crying out for support and I know it’s probably not healthy but I just listen anyway. Hearing things about my father have confused me and often resent him myself. I feel like I’m on her side against him. I think my mum knows the damage she does but can’t stop because she so desperately is seeking support and validation. I know she dosent have bad intentions but it’s not so nice for me. 
Seeing my parents later on getting along, having dinner together, holding hands on the couch and other cute things has me thinking wtf is going on? So their relationship is bad but not that bad? I I really don’t know what to think of my family. (For context I still live with them).

My mum holds huge grudges against anyone who ever does her wrong. She doesn’t forgive and she obsesses. If I point this out it’ll just reignite her anger all over again. I’ve heard the same stories over and over. She dosent let go. This obviously comes from some sort of wound she has from her childhood. Like people are out to get her. She is distrustful of everyone. Even if it’s a simple comment she gets extremely triggered, especially if it hits an insecurity. Like if I simply tell her my friends have asked if she’s still working she’s like “why would they ask that? Who are they going to tell? They are so sneaky how dare they judge me? It’s very odd they’d be asking you that sort of question” (she’s not working at the moment). She lies to most people in her life that she still has a job so no one pesters her or judges her. She gets overwhelmed easily and feels that people take advantage of her when she’s not working.

We spend a lot of time hanging out and getting along so when she switches up it throws me off. I don’t know what to do. she frequently even gets angry at me for bringing my partner over because she feels she needs the house to herself, and can’t do things while we are here. She sometimes blames me saying she can’t have quality time with my dad because we are having people over, but like I live here too and can’t always accommodate my life for her sake. Like she’s also upset when I’m out of the house a lot and not doing the housework. Most of the blame is always on me. It’s always on me , I get the blame. I hold the weight of all these things. When my dad isn’t here I hear everything. She tells me everything like I’m the one carrying the emotional weight but I am just her daughter.

I get her but I also think she’s fucking crazy sometimes and needs to get it together. But I also know she can’t cos she’s clearly got issues. I’m frustrated from all of this so sometimes I barely respond to her or make comments that come off as judgmental, because in reality what she’s doing is pretty crazy.

At the moment she’s furious at me for expressing judgment. Like how dare I after everything she does for me? She even said to me how dare you I always defend you to your father? It makes me feel guilty but I know that’s mot fair. I tried to say I am your daughter you are my mother it’s a different relationship but I don’t think she’ll get that. I think she’ll see it as me throwing everything in her face and turning on her. I said it’s unfair to put everything on me and for her to hold it against me that I was judgemental. I’m not allowed to offer an opinion or bring a sense of reality. When I said this to her she was like “oh poor you, you have a mother who does everything for you and you can’t even listen to her” (implying I’m selfish), also that I just rely on her for everything bth don’t care to listen to her.  Everything is always thrown in my face, all of my flaws. Stuff like I’m lazy, I expect her to do everything for me, I just use her, and it makes me feel like I’m a disaster. Just like everything else I don’t think she’ll forgive, she hangs on to this kind of stuff. She often groups me and everyone else as also being the people against her who don’t value her. 

She’s the type of person who will lose her shit and take it to heart if you ever dare to say anything that comes as a criticism to her. It’s like I’ve diminished everything she’s ever done for me and it’s all thrown back in my face. 

I am writing this as she is sitting on the couch opposite me watching TV. We spend most mornings drinking coffee together and talking about clothes, interior design and other lifestyle things. I am not even looking at her but yet she keeps making commentary and talking to me about what’s she watching.",1,1752632801.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Tigers vs. Texas Rangers: A Tale of Two Streaks (and One Team That Can’t Score)**

The Detroit Tigers, baseball’s current home-run-happy overlords, take on the Texas Rangers in a July 18 clash that’s less “World Series preview” and more “why is this guy still at the buffet?” The Tigers (-126) are favorites, and let’s be honest, the math isn’t even close. Their 66.7% win rate as favorites this season is like a Tesla on Autopilot—efficient, reliable, and slightly unsettling. The Rangers (+208), meanwhile, have the scoring prowess of a diet soda: promising on the label, disappointingly flat in reality. Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire on his last coffee break.

### Odds & Stats: The Tigers Are Here to Win, the Rangers Are Here for Moral Support

First, the cold, hard numbers. Detroit’s offense is the sixth-best in MLB, churning out runs like a bakery at dawn. Their pitching staff? A 3.69 ERA, solid enough to keep most teams in check. Texas, on the other hand, has the lowest ERA in the league—but their offense ranks 22nd. That’s the baseball equivalent of having a world-class goalkeeper but telling your forwards to “just, uh, kick it toward the net, I guess.”

The Tigers’ implied probability of winning this game? A 55.3% edge (thanks to those -126 odds). For the Rangers, their +208 line suggests bookmakers give them a 32.8% chance—about the same odds as me correctly spelling “Spencer Torkelson” without checking my phone.

Both teams have players on two-game home run streaks: Detroit’s Riley Greene and Texas’ Marcus Semien. But here’s the rub: The Tigers have *three All-Stars* in this matchup (Greene, Gleyber Torres, and Javier Báez) plus ace pitcher Tarik Skubal, who’s been so dominant he’s essentially the AL’s designated “do not pass go” card. The Rangers? They’ve got Semien and Adolis García to keep the lights on offensively, but their lineup looks like a “Coming Soon” sign at a food court.

### News Digest: Tigers Bring the Party, Rangers Bring the Snacks

Detroit’s All-Star contingent is so large, they’re essentially fielding their own parallel universe All-Star team. Gleyber Torres will lead

Not, ""I dont wanna clean my room"" but to the point even turning on my phone/fan is hard and I've procrastinated it for hours at a time. Get home, everythings heavy, everything is tired, and I crash on the bed. Usually if I have something- grocerys, gas station run, it just- goes away? But I cant really ask to do stuff, mom brings me when she needs to get cigs or smth. But anyways, I sleep at around 11pm-2am (unhealthy but i try) wake at about 7-8am, eat, coffee, work, maybe get coffee or a monster at the end of the workday. Like yesterday, got home, slept till 7, could not get out of bed to go to a resterant and binged fries they brought home. I've been cleaning my room for a month.

ANY WAYS, here are my immediate thoughts… 

-The opening with Miranda being SO huffy and put out that it was “family hour” at her gym, thus ruining her entire workout and day… when the most obvious and simple solution exists… DON’T GO during that designated “family hour!” 🤪 She’s a single and fabulous woman who has her weekends wide open… literally wait an hour… or go before. It was so idiotic to have her glaring at kids and acting so put out to be sharing a public space with them. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Even more ridiculous to hear Carrie’s voiceover lamenting how the city is “overrun” with kids on the weekends… 😂 It’s literally just their world, and we are all an inconvenience in it. Lol 

-When Carrie goes to spontaneously meet Von’s family (her current fling), and the super weird voice they have the sister, Franny do. It’s like she’s trying to do a “fake masculine voice” to cue the viewers “oh, this chick is a MAJOR lesbian!” It reminds me of when my toddlers are playing pretend and pretending to be man in some capacity. 🥴

-How at the recap brunch, when Samantha just happily and casually tells the story that she “fucked a guy once because he had a pool,” and then she goes on to reveal she was only 13, and none of the other girls find that weird or concerning… I mean, I know sex DOES happen with young teens… but, it’s definitely not the norm, and 13 is SO YOUNG! not even in high school yet! 

-When Carrie is having her lunch with Wallace, Von’s mother. And she’s bragging about how “sex has always been part of the conversation!” And then goes on to say she started talking to her kids “about sex” at 2 years old because she taught her kids the correct anatomical names for their body parts. 🤨 Um, that has nothing to do with sex, lady. And that’s actually great parenting. But, she’s making it weird by grouping that into the world of “sex.” 

-Charlotte walking into her kitchen in the morning, and Samantha is standing on chair literally looking for coffee filters literally ON TOP of Charlotte’s cabinets. Like, no one would ever store coffee filters on top of their numerous and roomy kitchen cabinets. 😂

Ok. That is all for now. 🫡",3,1752632558.0,sexandthecity,0,1.0,False

it’s 9:21 am and I arrived at Las Cruces, New Mexico and I was starving and couldn’t get the idea of eating a breakfast burrito out of my head. Need to grab some food and get some sleep or I’m gonna crash and die on the 10 freeway. I see a diner called Dave’s Diner as I get off the freeway and just pull in and park, as I make my way towards the diner I see a golden retriever with a black collar no name tag. 

BARK BARK BARK!!!

I jumped nearly as I stumble back from the dog. I quickly regained my composure and just walked with haste towards the doors. I’m now welcomed with the sweet smell of bacon. Not to mention a packed house, that’s a good sign the foods good. I find an booth and sit down.

A cute blonde waitress in red shirt and kakis walks over with a menu and a glass of water. “Welcome to Dave’s Diner, coffee?” The waitress Kelly said with a bright smile. I try to calm my nerves before speaking “yes please, and I just want a breakfast burritos with no onions”. She wrote down my order and said “of course sweetie, how’d you like your coffee?”. I thought about it and said “two sugars one cream”

I finish my breakfast and search for a hotel nearest to me on my phone. Found one but before I could check the reviews and such my phone rings. 714 area code like before but different number. I have to answer, “hello? Who’s this and how did you get my number?”. I hear static or something electrical 

Maybe, but slowly starts to become more clear and stable. “ Javi…it’s Javi. Don’t be scared, don’t trust….” Sounds like the connection is breaking up. “ Don’t trust what? Who is this and how do you know me?” I wait for an answer but I wish I didn’t. “ Brother….don’t have… that much time, kids in d-“. I’m hit with static than “BARK BARK! YEEELP! AHHHH!”.

It’s so loud it hurts my right ear, nothing but god awful animal cries and screams of pain and agony. It won’t stop and it’s getting louder to the point it sounds like it’s on speaker mode. I try hanging up but it won’t, after the 4th or 5th press on my phone the call disconnects. Eyes all over me, my fear overwhelms my embarrassment and I rush out the diner to my car.

I check in the Cozy Castle Inn and crash on the bed immediately after a few shots and cigarettes. I’ll have to buy more booze soon. I wake up to my phone ringing, it’s just my Uncle. “Morning Tio, what time is it? ”
I stand up and light a cigarette. I hear the tv going on in the background, Cheers “where the fuck you run off too Javi, and it’s 8pm”.
I look that the time and shit it is 8pm. I thought I slept thru the next morning. Good fucking sleep, needed it. “I’m driving out to LA to settle some publishing rights issue. No big deal gonna be a week max.” Really I have no idea how long I’ll be or even what I’m really gonna accomplish if anything at all.

Uncle didn’t respond right away. “ Tio? You there?” He responds immediately now but with a concerned tone. “Just.. be careful, if you need anything let me know” Uncle is complicated and high strung but he does love me. He took me in after Mom, he’s more like a father than my uncle at this point in my life. I drag my cigarette and clear my voice “ I’ll be fine, don’t worry about me just business that came up. Love you ” he said the same and we hung up.

I grab my keys and get ready to drive to rest of the way. Nothing eventful happens for the rest of the ride up. Just few stops for food and cigarettes, listened to alien conspiracy podcast to distract me. I arrive in SoCal early in the morning around 7am. 

I unlock my hotel room and unpack and settle in. I want a drink but prefer some ice. I walk down the hall to get ice for my room, I hear a tiny footsteps behind me as I’m filling up ice. I turn around and drop my ice. It’s a dog all bloody, dripping blood. No eyes, no teeth staring back at me. I froze where I stood, the panting was loud and the stench was unbearable. I must be dreaming, must be passed out drunk already in my room. 

The dog took a couple steps to me and his intestines fell out of its belly now dragging behind him like a soaking blood red gown. It’s Biscuit, I can tell now looking at his tag on his bloody collar read BISCUIT. Biscuit jumps at me so fast I couldn’t do anything I was frozen and shaking in fear. His eyeless sockets were pitch black and crying blood. His yelps so loud it rings my ears, while saliva drips on to my face and inside the corners of my mouth. 

His butchered body pinned me down, blood dripping on to me. I feel his intestines draped over my legs. Biscuit opened his toothless mouth and the Pedro’s voice bellows out of his throat. “Javi!!!!! Leave! Leave Now!!” I start screaming while closing my eyes, I’m suddenly nine years old again in that treehouse. I then hear my mom, my uncle, and I swear I hear my own voice come out of that half dead beast of a dog who’s on top of me. 

I start to scream uncontrollably and close my eyes even tighter. After what felt like minutes or seconds, I couldn’t feel the heat of biscuits breath or the hear the voices anymore and his weight almost instantly went away. I was alone in the ground with no blood on me at all “Fuck! Fuck what the Fuck!” A old man opened his hotel room door and looked at me while I was gathering myself from the hotel floor while he asked “you okay sir? Were you just mugged?”. My embarrassment turns my face hot and flushed and I remark “No.. I saw a rat”.


I rush back to my room and take a hot shower and drank some more. I can’t get the sight of those pitch black sockets peering into my soul. I don’t understand what’s happening to me. This is insane, what am I doing back here so close to the house. I need to get my shit together, I’m going insane or damn near it at this point. I always knew this but 20 years living in Austin, drinking heavily and the drugs I was using in my teenage years have taken their toll. Maybe I need to see my therapist again or a priest.

I get out of the shower and put on my clothes, it’s 1pm. There’s than a knock on my door. I jump out of my skin, and shout “Who’s there?”I put on my clothes. No answer but I open the door anyways, I’m just crazy. No one, I look left and right. Not a soul out in the halls, than right before I shut the door I spot something on the floor. A blue policeman action figure standing upright on handwritten note like you would get from a girl in school. Looks like a notebook page folded into many folds with one end snuggly folded into itself.

My heart beats faster, hands shaking as I pick up the figure and the note. I close the door and throw the toy on the bed and walk towards the end table to pour a drink. I Pour two fingers of tequila and shoot all of down in one swig, gulp it down and feel it work its magic. I unfold the small note and read it.

SPITZR 

Written down in pencil with shakey handwriting. My hearts racing, my body goes instantly hot and freezing at the same time. I rush to the restroom dropping the note but before I even hit the door I throw up in my glass of tequila. I clean up and wash out my glass and fill another with ice and shoot it back. Instantly feel a burning in my throat from the tequila, I walk back to the end table and pour another shot to wash down the vomit as my hands shake uncontrollably. I ball my hands into fists and squeeze and take a deep breath. My hands slowly calm down as well as my heart. 

Did Mr. Spitzer write the note? If so, how does he know I’m back and staying at the Cozy Castle. I don’t even know his first name, just knew him as Mr. Spitzer. Maybe he was involved in someway, or worse. Now that I think about it he did kinda creep me out, always catching him staring at me and Pedro playing in the yard or coming in from school. 

My nerves were setting down after another shot of tequila. I turn on the lights to restroom and wash my face. I turn around towards the door of the restroom and it slams right before I walk out hitting my nose with a blinding pain. I fall back and hit my head against the tub, I’m dazed. Rub my head where the pain aches and burns like Hell.

 I call out “who the fuck is in my room?! I’m coming out I have a gun you bastard!” I actually do have a gun but it’s in my trunk. My pain and anger outweighed my fear at that moment as I rushed towards the door and turn the knob, it wouldn’t turn. I kept jiggling and turning the knob and tried with all my strength to open the door and nothing not even a little bit. My stomach dropped, I start kicking the door in a panic like a animal caught in a trap. The lights went out as soon as I made contact foot to door. I was in pitch dark no light only a small bit coming from the bottom of the restroom door. I see a shadow walk across the door. I yell at the top of my lungs “ I’m gonna shoot the god damn door motherfucker!”.

 Desperate panic was setting in deeper and deeper by the second. I try opening the door one more time and it wouldn’t budge. Suddenly a huge slam meets against the door and I back up so far and fast I fall over and  I’m instantly in the bath tub this time. Tears welling up in my eyes not from the pain but fear. I cry out “Stop! Stop it okay! What the fuck do you want!?” As I recover from my fall in pitch darkness . I dig in my pocket looking for my phone to illuminate the room. 

Nothing but lint and mints, I left it on the damn end table. I stand up from the tub and start reaching out so I don’t further injure myself as I head for the door. Something meets my fingers that makes me back up a step, I reach out again like a blind man this time i know what’s on my hands. Soft silky almost oily hair slides between my finger and I scream and jump back into the tub again throwing punches in the air. I pissed my pants a little as I still scream in the tub arms swinging like a drunk Irishman at a pub. 

Than the lights turn back on suddenly to my sweet relief. No one was in the restroom with me, I wipe my face with the sleeve of my shirt. Heart slowing down as I regain my composure and wipe off tears and sweat from my hands. I need to get to Spitzer’s house as soon as possible. I’m not staying in the hotel room another minute I say to myself as I exit the restroom successfully, i scan the room and no one. I hope Spitzers still alive and living Nextdoor, because I’m going to talk to him tonight. 

I pull up slowly to 16701 Alton Drive, my old house that plagues my existence. Looks abandoned and run down. Paint job looks cracked and caked with dirt over the years. Windows looked fine but the window to my old room looks cracked from a baseball or something. Not even going to entertain going inside or stepping on the dirt lawn. The neighbor has gotten dramatically worse than I remembered it. Maybe it just looked bad at night. 
 
I step out of my car and walk to the front of Spitzers house on the right side and think to myself how the hell am I going to explain to Spitzer why I’m here, when I don’t even truly know. Is he even alive or living here? He must be 60 something at this point. Fuck it, only one way to find out if he’s here. I only have the one lead, if I sound crazy I sound crazy and just go home and get a new number every year like Mark. 

As I take one step towards the house a light goes on and the front door opens. First thing that catches my eye is the most vibrant red and green Hawaiian shirt I’ve ever seen. He’s still alive and living next door to my light suprise. Still wearing kaki shorts, flip flops and his vibrant Hawaiian shirts. Some styles die hard I suppose, I walk towards the door as he says “can I help you out dude?”. 

“Sorry to bother you sir but I don’t know if you remember me-“ before I finish my sentence he almost shouts at me in excitement “Little Javier!? Is that you? Nora’s boy?” I couldn’t believe he recognized me after all this time. 
“Yeah it’s me Mr Spitzer, good seeing you still live here” he smiled a big ear to ear grin and motion me inside the house. “Well someone has to for gods sake, now come on inside I figured you would return at some point” I look back at my car and lock it, bad neighborhood after all and maybe always has been. I take up his offer to go inside. 

His house was clean for the most part, living room looked like no living has been done in it for years, not even a tv. Spitzer locked the door and the chain, not very comforting but he’s 60 something and feel confident enough to knock him on his ass if needed. God I’m paranoid as fuck, this is what mom must of felt all the time after Pedro. 

“Well welcome to my home, not much but I have whiskey and cigars if you wanna talk in my study.” I look over the rest of the house as I agree. He leads me to the back of the house near the kitchen, he open his study door and grabs whiskey off his booze cabinet that must have every liquor brewed and distilled. “How did you know I’d be back?” I asked while I found myself a seat in one of his leather lazy boys. “Well for one, who wouldn’t after what you experienced and two.. I returned as well”.

I must of had a dumb confused face on because he laughed and went on to pouring us two glasses of whiskey. “What did I experience? And what do you mean that you returned too?” He hands me a glass and he sits down and takes a big deep sigh of satisfaction after he sips his glass. Spitzer scratches his gray beard and looked me for a second or two “the paranormal, demons, ghosts and the all of that smashed in a gift box, that’s what we experienced. I never believed in any of this shit but 30 years ago I saw something that maybe you experienced too I’m similar fashion.” 

His face turned white almost as he got up and poured more whiskey into his glass. “My sister Sydney and her husband Terry lived in your old house next door 35 or so years ago. I’d crash over from time to time to take care his my nieces Skylar and Brittany. Their parents both worked at the hospital a ways north of here, both nurses. Loved those girls, they were trouble but good kids deep down.”
I take a sip of this delicious whiskey and interject “Mr Spitzer My mom never told me that your family lived in our house before us”.

He walked back to his seat with two cigars and a cutter “please call me Frank, I haven’t taught in 13 years now” he cuts the two ends and hands me one and lights me up. I’ve never smoked cigars but after the past couple days I’m sure I’ll take to it after the first few puffs. 

“Where was I?” He asked while he was lighting his own. “Oh right right, the worst night of my life. I come home after a night at the bar with my buddies, I find the front door wide open with the music blasting from the living room, rain drops keep falling on my head. Used to be Skylar’s favorite song that she would play on repeat with her Si-” a Slammed door interrupted Frank, I dropped my glass on his hardwood floors. 

I get up and before I apologize Frank lets out a bellowing laugh that calms my fear and I start chuckling. Frank gets up and grabs an old shirt and throws it on the spill and I help wi try the glass. Frank than sits back down and laughs again saying “wow they’re listening on us this soon, faster than I thought.”. My fear kicked back in so strong I was getting lightheaded, or maybe to much cigar. I cough on one last puff of cigar, yeah fuck cigars. With a cracked voice I blurt out “What do you mean? Who’s listening?”. Frank takes a few puffs and as he exhales he puts out his cigar in the ashtray and calmly says “I’ll get to that in time”.

Frank puts his cigar down on a black golden nugget ash tray and clears his throat and coughs a few times “Anyways, I turn off the song than suddenly that tv turns on to static at max volume. Course my drunk ass goes to turn the damn thing off thinking the electrical was going bananas or I stepped on the remote. For nearly 2 minutes I’m trying to turn this thing down or turn it off, I was failing on both ends. As I’m about to give up and go for the plug I hear screams still hear in my sleep. They came from the backyard, the slider was wide open. I ran outside and as you may already know, the screams came from that creepy ass treehouse.” 

Frank’s eyes well up with tears, one breaks out and streams down his left cheek as he stares at his glass swirling the ice cubes around. I get up to grab go for his Kleenex, but before I make it three steps he grabs my forearm “it’s okay boy, I need to use the little boys room anyways”. I go back to my seat as he walks out. 

What are the chances both of us are crazy or  disturbed I wonder. I don’t know how to feel right now, it’s like overwhelming to think that something similar happened to Frank. I have so many questions that I take out my phone to write it down in my notes to compartmentalize all this. Before I type one word the lights go out. I use my phone to illuminate the room, scanning it everywhere like it’s a weapon. Before I light up the windows a dog comes crashing through them at my feet all mangled and smelling of rotten eggs and road kill. Frank comes barging in with a super soaker and crucifix attached to it shooting everywhere  screaming “FUUUCK YOU!!!”

The dog gets up like a bat out of hell and sprints at Frank, He falls back shooting water all over the rabid zombie like dog. I ready to sprint out the window before I hear the dog yelp that turned into a monstorous yell from hell as his body was disintegrating or melting off his bones. His eyes popped out into the pool of dog soup that lay before me and Frank. Finally the beast melted entirely like it was dipped in super acid, even the bones. “Frank… Frank…What the fuck was that?!”

Some from a decade past are clear and vivid and last week could be a fog. There are periods  time erased, however the past has shallow graves. It only takes a few words to bring everything back to the surface.

For me, it was my mother’s voice at the kitchen table.

“Do you remember your imaginary friend?” she asked, stirring her coffee, thinking back to what she thought was childhood whimsy.

And just like that, the name crawled out from the dark.

Mister Stranger.

It didn’t feel like a memory. It felt like waking up mid-conversation with something you’d forgotten you were listening to. Most people recall flashes from early childhood an emotion, a birthday, a toy. I remember him. And I think he remembers me.

He came during the year I was homeschooled. Lonely doesn’t even cover it. I had no friends, no playmates. My parents were good people, just… busy. I lived in silence, days swallowed by the buzz of a box fan and the creak of a two-story house.

Until he came.

It started with a tapping.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I was six. I remember it was past midnight. I crept to the window, heart thudding in my chest like a rabbit in a trap. I pulled back the curtain expecting wind or a branch or nothing.

But there were no trees near my window.

Only the long black beyond the glass, the moon hanging heavy above the distant woods.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Closer now. From the other side of the glass.

Then, a voice. Calm. Deep. Velvet-soft and serpentine.

“May I come in?”

I should have screamed. But I was lonely, and children will trust anything that speaks softly enough.

I cracked the window.

The night breathed in. I could smell moss and something burnt. I listened. But the voice was gone. So I shut it and backed into bed, heart still thumping.

The window creaked shut on its own.

That night, as I buried myself beneath the blanket, I felt breath on my neck.

“Don’t worry,” he whispered, right behind me. “I’ve got you.”

And I believed him.

Mister Stranger became everything to me. I never saw him then, but I felt him—hovering just behind the veil of sight, like looking at a star that vanishes when stared at. We’d talk. We’d play. He would tell me strange stories about roots that strangle and moons that bleed. I’d laugh, because I thought he was being silly. I was a child.

He taught me games.

We’d draw together. Symbols. Circles. Spirals that made my hand cramp as it spun over and over like it wasn’t mine.

“What is it?” I asked, giggling.

“Home,” he replied.

We covered the walls with the drawings. Pages and pages—odd marks and runes that made no sense to me, but made him hum with approval.

“They’re for your protection,” he said. “From the ones beneath.”

I didn’t ask what that meant.

I just kept drawing.

My parents found the pages.

They tore them down, threw them out with the garbage. Called them nonsense. Called me disturbed.

That night, Mister Stranger didn’t speak.

He had left me. 

And then the dreams came.

They were not dreams. They were burials.

Each night I was dragged—screaming—into the black soil. Hands with too many knuckles clawed at my limbs. I was pulled beneath the roots, into a place that pulsed like a dying heart. I’d wake screaming, soaked in piss and sweat, throat raw and lungs empty.

My parents let me sleep with them after the second night. It didn’t help.

Because even there they could save me in my dream. 

The last night of it all happened when they finally put me back in my room.

Mom tucked me in.

“Why did my friend leave?” I asked her, barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know, baby,” she said, brushing my hair back. “But you’ve got me.”

But her warmth wasn’t the same.

Her love didn’t reach as deep.

I lay in silence.

Then—

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I bolted to the window, heart pounding with joy and terror.

I flung it open.

“Welcome home!” 

They words echoed into the void as the night overtook me.

The forest was alive.

I don’t know how I got there. I remember the window, then darkness, then trees so many trees. Their branches twisted like antlers, blotting out the moon.

My legs bled. My feet were raw. My pajamas shredded by thorns and bramble.

I screamed for help.

No one answered.

Then came the footsteps.

At first, just one set. Then more. Dozens. Hundreds. All around me. Pattering through the underbrush like bare feet on wet tile.

I could hear in unison the gnarled growl of dozens of empty stomachs. 

They weren’t just chasing me.

They were herding me.

I ran. My breath ripped my throat. My lungs burned. I didn’t know where I was going—I just needed out.

I ran as the sharp claws of the forest reached and pulled at my clothing. 

The harsh bramble and thorns cut into my legs and feet. 

I ran, the skittering followed but I never saw my pursuers. 

The air grew colder. The ground steeper. My tears blurred the world.

I broke through the trees and fell—rolling down a hill, branches snapping against my back.

Then-thud.

I hit pavement.

A road.

I tried to scream for help, but only a rasp came out.

Then, in the distance, headlights.

Blinding. Barreling toward me.

I tried to rise. My ankle screamed in protest.

The light roared.

And just before it hit me—

I saw him.

Tall. Wrong. Strings for limbs. A body like a silhouette carved out of darkness. And a face, no face. Just a reflection. A mirror, twisting my own terrified face back at me.

Then nothing.

I woke in my bed.

Covered in mud. Burrs stuck to my skin. My legs bloodied and scratched. Pajamas torn. My feet looked flayed, like I’d been dragging them through glass.

But the room?

Pristine.

No mud. No trail. No open window.

Just me.

Shaking. Breathing. Remembering.

My parents panicked, they couldn’t explain my wounds, and the mess. Especially with the house showing no signs of it. They didn’t believe my story that I just appeared in the woods or especially that Mister Stranger saved me. But there was no explanation.

It was after that day he was gone, or he didn’t show himself to me. The days went by, I started public school, life moved on.

I had nearly forgotten of all of it until that simple question. 

But lately…

The tapping’s back.

Not at the window.

Inside my head.

Soft. Reassuring. Almost like it’s humming.

I keep telling myself I’m fine. That I just haven’t been sleeping well. That nothing is waiting in the dark.

But just now, after writing all this down, I went to splash some water on my face.

I looked up at the mirror.

And in the reflection of my pupil just a glint, just for a second I saw him.

Long limbs. Faceless. Twisting ever so slightly, like a shadow caught mid-dance.

And I don’t know what’s worse…

That he’s back…

Or that he’s always been there.

Watching. Waiting. Smiling with a mouth I’ll never see.

But somehow…

I think everything’s going to be okay.

He’s got me.

1m10qgl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m10qgl,My submission for this month is my BEAUTIFUL daughter. Her name is Ginger Belle.,"Okay I know this is long but it is a good story I promise. 

————————————

A child was having fun in the street with her friends. She was 12. Her mother cared for her as much as she could, but often had to work since she was a teacher. While she waited for her mom, she spent a lot of time in the next classroom over with her History teacher. He was nice and gave her some quick extra lessons as he worked. 

Then she was hit by a truck. 

A drunk driver sped down the street, running over this child and crashing into a streetlight, nearly killing him in the process. 

Immediately after, the child awoke. Two cold gazes stared down at her now very small form. Brown fur coated her body as she stared back with wide eyes. 

The child had been reincarnated into her new form as Ginger Belle, the child of the pompous and vain Liam T Belle and Sloane Bell. She was often left by herself as soon as she turned 2, entertaining and caring for herself for the day. The parents still cared for her, but never grew close. 

At age 4, this changed. Sloane Belle had gotten pregnant again, this time producing a healthy and rambunctious son Dan Belle. Immediately after his birth, Ginger’s parents paid her no mind. They had the baby boy they had wanted, and now she was of no use to them. She was left even more alone than before, required to make herself something to eat or get something from the fridge at home. She didn’t even get driven to school due to her parent’s neglect, left to walk by herself. 

Her best friend became Cal, the Skeleton running the Diner. He’d listen to what she had to say and even brought her a stack of Pancakes on her birthday free of charge. She was never able to eat at his Diner otherwise as she never had any money. 

At age 8, Ginger developed her ice powers. Supernatural abilities were by no means rare in her world, but they weren’t common. She had the ability to manipulate ice crystals in the air and cause them to expand upon contact with an object by absorbing moisture in the air. It was very fragile, but it stung like hell as it crept across someone’s body. 

Her parents were not pleased with her abilities. When emotions ran high, the ground around her feet would freeze and ice would start expanding out and up from this. Liquids such as the wine her parents liked also froze over when she was nearby. Instead of neglect, Ginger was faced with abuse as they screamed at her to control herself while her pinprick little brother snickered like a goblin in the corner. They paid attention to her now, but it was even worse than when they didn’t. 

Everything came to a head during her brother’s 11th Birthday. She had celebrated her own birthday a month before with her usual stack of Cal’s pancakes, with Hilda, the old lady who always got a coffee there for 18 years, giving her a plaid blue jacket she got for her granddaughter, but she whined about the color. Ginger went out to the party to get something to eat, as she hadn’t gotten lunch that day and her stomach was growling. She bumped into Uncle Sam, who subsequently snapped at her to watch where she was going, causing a thin layer of ice to coat the surrounding area. 

Seeing the disturbance, Liam and Sloane came over to berate their daughter. They screamed at her over her lack of control, how she was a disgrace to their proud family, and her hideous jacket. The rest of the family watched with either disdain for Ginger or cackling over her misery. 

The insult to the gift Hilda had given her was the last straw. She screamed back, cursing out her entire family right to her father’s face. This caused the temperature to instantly drop 10 degrees, as ice coated everything. With her final word, it all froze solid. 

Ginger had turned everything within a quarter mile to ice. Solid sculptures stood where her family once did. Ginger dropped to her knees. Everyone around her and many others were killed by her. 

She sat there for days. She barely moved, just to get something from the Fridge to keep herself alive. The only thing keeping her from stopping there was the hope that Cal and Hilda were still alive. Maybe she had the chance to start a new life. 

In walked Scout the Scout. He claimed to be from the Ludum Academy for Fearsome Fighters, here to recruit her for the academy. Ginger barely heard him. She didn’t know what to do. In the end, Scout simply took her. She didn’t resist. What would she do? 

Upon her entry to the academy, Ginger didn’t do much. She was still reeling from what she did. At least, until she was forced to. She was put into an arena with a horrific grinning beast. Out of fear she used her abilities, causing the monster’s arm to snap clean off as it struggled to escape. 

After this, Eloise Ludum…complimented her. It was weird and backhanded as anything, but it was a genuine compliment. It actually made Ginger feel good about what she did. 

Ginger knows what kind of person Eloise Ludum is. She’s seen what she’s done. But despite this, she can’t help but want her affection. She’d do anything to gain her affection. 

But no matter how far she runs, she’s always haunted by the cold, rigid forms that stalk her in the night.

After countless cups and many machines, I've learned a lot about what makes a great manual espresso machine. If you're looking to up your coffee game, a good manual machine is the way to go.

Manual espresso machines give you full control over the brewing process. You control the grind, the tamp, the water temperature, and the extraction time. This level of control lets you fine-tune your shots to get the perfect flavor. It's a bit of a learning curve, but the results are worth it.

So what should you look for in a manual espresso machine? First, build quality is key. You want something sturdy that will last for years. Look for machines with solid metal construction and quality components. Cheap plastic parts just won't hold up to daily use.

Pressure is another crucial factor. For true espresso, you need at least 9 bars of pressure. Many high-end manual machines can produce 15 bars or more. This extra pressure helps extract all those delicious oils and flavors from the coffee grounds.

Temperature stability is also important. Fluctuations in water temperature can ruin a shot. The best manual machines have precise temperature controls and heavy-duty boilers to maintain consistent heat.

After trying out many different models, I've found some great options at various price points. For beginners, the Flair Espresso Maker is a solid choice. It's affordable and produces surprisingly good shots. For more experienced users, the Rok Espresso GC is hard to beat. It's built like a tank and gives you incredible control over the extraction.

But if you want the best of the best, check out the La Pavoni Professional. It's a true work of art that makes incredible espresso. These and other top-rated manual espresso machines are available at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have a great selection of high-quality machines at competitive prices.

No matter which machine you choose, making manual espresso is a rewarding experience. There's something special about crafting each shot by hand. It's a skill that takes practice, but once you nail it, you'll be making cafe-quality espresso at home.

Of course, a great machine is only part of the equation. You'll also need fresh, high-quality beans and a good grinder. Invest in a burr grinder if you can - it makes a huge difference in the quality of your shots.

Don't forget about accessories either. A good tamper, milk frothing pitcher, and espresso cups are all essential tools. You can find all of these and more at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They offer complete kits that include everything you need to get started.

Making great espresso at home is a journey. It takes time, patience, and practice. But with the right manual espresso machine, you'll be well on your way to coffee nirvana. So why not take the plunge? Your taste buds will thank you.",1,1752631795.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phumelele Cafu vs. Jesse Rodriguez: A Foregone Conclusion with a Side of Humility**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a boxing match that’s about as surprising as a rooster winning a beauty pageant: **Jesse Rodriguez**, the pound-for-pound maestro, takes on the valiant but wide-eyed **Phumelele Cafu**. The odds? So lopsided they make a leaning tower of Pisa look balanced. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffee breaks.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Math Test

The numbers scream louder than a crowd at a Tyson Fury press conference. At **DraftKings**, Rodriguez is a jaw-dropping **1.03** to win, implying a **97.09% chance** of victory. Cafu? He’s priced at **12.0**, translating to a **7.7% implied probability**—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of a game of Jenga blindfolded. Other books like **BetUS** and **FanDuel** barely tweak the numbers (Rodriguez hovers around 1.04, Cafu maxes at 12.8), confirming this isn’t a typo.

For context: If Rodriguez were a toaster, he’d be the one that not only makes your bread but also recites Shakespeare while doing it. Cafu, meanwhile, is the toaster that still needs to learn how to plug in. Rodriguez’s dominance isn’t just statistical—it’s existential.

---

### Digest the News: Cafu’s “Unbeaten” Streak is a Miracle

Cafu, the “unbeaten titleholder,” has a record that’s part fact, part myth. Let’s be real: fighting and losing to no one is a superpower, but it’s also the boxing equivalent of winning a chess game against a player who’s never seen a queen move. His challenge against Rodriguez? A bit like a squirrel attempting to fight a bear in a WWE ring—admirable, but not a recipe for victory.

Rodriguez, on the other hand, is a

I’ve been following this subreddit for a while now and have noticed a common thread: many of us are feeling stuck with the current matchmaking options, especially the hit-or-miss nature of dating apps. Rather than simply commiserate, I’d love to do something proactive.

# Here's what I’m Proposing 😁

* **In-Person Meetups:** I’m interested in organizing (or co-organizing) relaxed, faith-conscious gatherings for single Muslims. Think small-group brunches, coffee chats, park picnics, or game nights—settings that encourage real conversation without the pressure of a formal “matrimonial event.” ☕️ If nothing comes out of this, at least you hopefully meet a new brother or sister.
* **Age Range:** I’m aiming for attendees roughly between **25 and 50**.
* **Venue Options:**
   * **Neutral public spaces** (cafés, community centers, outdoor spots).
   * **My home on select weekends**—I’m willing to host if a more private, comfortable environment helps people open up.
* **Faith-Friendly Atmosphere:** Halal food, prayer space, modest dress code, and a casual vibe—no forced icebreakers, just respectful conversation.
* **Collaboration Welcome:** If you’ve organized something similar, I’d love a co-host (or several) to share planning, handle different age cohorts, and ensure gender-appropriate facilitation.

# How You Can Help

1. **Share Ideas:** What meet-up formats or activities have worked for you in the past? What pitfalls should we avoid?
2. **Volunteer to Co-Host:** More hands make lighter work—especially if you have event-planning experience.
3. **Suggest Dates/Locations:** Weekends? Weeknights? City parks? Community halls? Let’s brainstorm.
4. **Spread the Word:** Know friends who might benefit? Tag them or share this post. The wider our reach, the more balanced the group.

# Next Steps

* Drop your thoughts, concerns, or suggestions in the comments.
* If there’s enough interest, I’ll create a simple survey to lock in dates, preferred locations, and dietary needs.
* We can spin up a group chat (Telegram/WhatsApp) to coordinate details insha’Allah.

# Blurb/Synopsis

Captain Henry Donnager expected a quiet career babysitting a dusty relic in Area 51. But when a test unlocks a portal to a world of knights and magic, he's thrust into command of Alpha Team, an elite unit tasked with exploring this new realm.

They join the local Adventurers Guild, seeking to unravel the secrets of this fantastical realm and the ancient gateway's creators. As their quests reveal the potent forces of magic, they inadvertently entangle in the volatile politics between local rivalling factions.

With American technology and ancient secrets in the balance, Henry's team navigates alliances and hostilities, enlisting local legends and air support in their quest. In a land where dragons loom, they discover that modern warfare's might—Hellfire missiles included—holds its own brand of magic.

**Chapter 52: All the Time We Need**

\-- --

Henry squeezed her hand. “My grandparents wondered the same thing. Well, my grandfather did, anyway.”



Sera tilted her head slightly.



“You’re asking if you can handle the ending.” Henry took a moment, trying to find the right angle. “But that’s like asking if a book’s worth reading because it has a last page.”



Okay, that came out more fortune-cookie than intended. But Sera was really listening, so he pushed on.



“It’s not exactly the same as your, y’know…” He gestured vaguely at the whole elf-human situation. “But it’s kinda close. My grandmother – she developed this condition. Her mind started failing her. Forgetting things, forgetting people. Like watching someone fade while their body remained.”



“A curse?” Sera asked quietly.



“No. Just… her brain breaking down. We called it Alzheimer’s disease.” He shrugged. “Your healers probably see it sometimes with the elderly. Memory going, personality changing. But there’s no magic to fix it.”



Sera nodded – she knew what he was referring to, even if the term was alien to her.



Henry continued, “My grandfather had to watch her disappear piece by piece. Different kind of aging than what you’re afraid of, but maybe that’s why I understand.”



Sera’s fingers tightened in his.



Henry met her eyes. This was the part where he was supposed to say something profound, probably. Drop some wisdom about love transcending time or whatever. But all he had was the truth.



“He had to decide every morning if it was worth it. Knowing she might not recognize him. Knowing the woman he married was already mostly gone.” Henry paused. “And he kept choosing yes.”



“They got married young,” Henry started, settling back against the headboard. The lamp cast weird shadows on the ceiling, and he found himself tracing them with his eyes while he figured out how to tell this. “Built their whole life together. House, kids, the American dream package. I used to spend summers there when I was a kid.”



Sera shifted to face him better, still holding his hand. She had this way of listening that made him feel like nothing else in the room existed. Just them and whatever words he could find for this.



“My grandmother was sharp. Like, scary sharp. Never forgot anything – birthdays, anniversaries, which grandkid liked which ice cream flavor, who’d broken her favorite vase thirty years ago.” He smiled at the memory. “She’d tell these stories about her childhood, same ones every visit, word for word. We used to joke about it. Turns out that perfect recall was actually the first thing to go.”



“How do you mean?”



“She started repeating things. Not the old stories – those were still normal. But she'd call on Tuesday to tell us something, then call Thursday with the same news like it was fresh. Ask the same questions week after week.”



Henry shifted, regret resurfacing. “We’d brushed it all off at first. Mom had said she was just stressed, maybe needed to slow down. Then she missed my cousin’s wedding rehearsal. Not the wedding – she definitely made sure to show up – but the rehearsal she’d helped plan for months. Just completely forgot it existed.”



“That’s when the family went into crisis mode,” Henry continued. “My aunt Sarah – she’s a nurse – she was the one who finally said the word. Alzheimer’s. Mom tried to argue at first, said her mother was just overwhelmed, maybe needed vitamins or whatever. But that doesn’t really happen at 65 – especially not to people who take care of themselves. I mean, we’ve got researchers back at base who are 65, and they’re cracking magic.”



Henry sighed. “Deep down, we all knew. We rallied overnight. My aunt handled all the medical stuff – researching treatments, finding specialists, connecting with colleagues. My uncle took over their finances before she could give their savings away to every charity with a sad commercial – like, ads. You’ve probably seen ‘em on YouTube. Anyway, my mother became like this… logistics coordinator. Made these color-coded calendars showing who was responsible for what each day.”



“And your grandfather?”



“Refused to follow the schedule.” Henry smiled. His grandfather was like something out of those romance movies Ron made fun of, except real. “Everyone else needed their assigned days, their breaks. It’s exhausting, watching someone you love forget who you are. But Grandpa just… showed up. Every single morning, seven AM sharp. Made her coffee exactly how she’d liked it for forty years even though half the time she couldn’t remember asking for it.”



“He preserved their customs.”



“Yeah. Well, more than that, actually. He preserved *her*.” It was almost impossible to find the right words for this. How could Henry explain that kind of devotion? He started with the facts. “Good days, she knew him. They’d sit together, watch their shows, argue about whether the garage door needed painting. Lowkey… it felt normal, sometimes. Like nothing had ever happened. Until we got to the bad days. Bad days, she thought he was her father. Or one of the doctors. Or a family friend.”



Henry took a breath. “The worst days, he was a stranger. Sometimes a burglar. Sometimes someone trying to hurt her. She’d scream when he walked in.” Henry’s jaw clenched at the memory of one visit where he’d watched his grandmother try to call 911 because a strange man was in her house. “Even through all that, he never stopped spending time with her. Tuesday nights, for whatever reason, she usually remembered his name.”



“Sounds… peculiar.”



Henry gave a small chuckle. “Yeah, right? Happened most Tuesdays, enough that he’d plan for it. Bring her white roses, wear the cologne she’d bought him for their anniversary. Make pot roast even though she could barely manage solid food anymore. He’d – well, he’d try to fit a whole week of being married into those few hours when she knew who he was.”



Sera’s breath hitched. Her hand tightened in his, and when Henry glanced over, her eyes were bright with unshed tears. 



“My dad was on the International Space Station when things got really bad,” Henry continued. At Sera’s questioning look, he pulled out his phone. “He’s an astronaut. I think I might’ve mentioned that before, but it’s like a pilot. For spacecraft. Goes up past where the jets fly, all the way to orbit.”



He scrolled through his photos until he found one – his dad floating in the ISS cupola with Earth visible through the window behind him. “This is him. That's Earth below.”



Sera leaned in, fascinated. “Heavens above…”



Her eyes went wide, that same wonder she’d shown when he’d first explained helicopters. Maybe Earth had some magic after all, seeing it through her eyes.



“Something like that.” Henry found himself grinning at her reaction. “This mission was six months in orbit, prepping for a long-term trip.”



Sera nodded slowly, processing the scale of it – or at least trying to. “To behold an entire realm thus rendered, not upon a map but living and whole. It is wondrous beyond all telling.”



Henry glanced at the picture again. “Yup.” He’d almost forgotten how incredible it was. He’d spent so much time around people who took space travel for granted – and happened upon so much crazier shit ever since the portal opened – that he’d lost sight of how absolutely insane it was that humans had figured out how to leave the planet.



Watching Sera process it, seeing that mix of awe and interest light up her face – it hit him all over again. Hell, it made him want to show her everything – satellite imagery, the moon landing footage, those Mars rover shots. “My dad took this photo himself. Said the first time you see Earth like that, it changes you.”



“Would Gaerra appear so, could we ascend to such heights? Would our kingdoms and borders prove naught but traceries upon the earth? Would we too seem so… small?”



“Probably. Just as beautiful, if not more, honestly.” The idea of seeing her world from orbit – man, what he wouldn’t give for that view. All those magical forests and Gatebuilder sites and fantasy cities and God-knows-what-else out there, reduced to colors and textures. “Maybe we’ll get a satellite up here one of these days. Show you what your world really looks like from above.”



Henry pocketed his phone before he fell into his own tangent.



“I’ll show you more when we get back to base. Anyway, Dad would call when he could. Video calls from space, kinda like the ones we had when you were doing your training. He’d show her the Earth through the window. She loved it at first – her son the astronaut, floating around up there. But past the fourth month, she finally hit the day where she was starting to forget what he looked like. Thought he was some TV character.”



“What grief must have seized his heart.”



“The worst part was coming home.” Henry’s voice went flat. “Six months is forever with that disease. When he left, everything was normal. When he came back, it was basically the beginning of the end.”



“He never took another long mission after that,” he continued. “Turned down the Mars prep team – Mars is another planet. A realm.” Henry gestured vaguely upward. “And that’s insane, every astronaut dreams of Mars. It’s like… like a knight turning down a quest for the Holy Grail.” He caught her blank expression. “Or uh, a Tier 9 adventurer turning down the Ovinne Campaign. It just… doesn’t happen, y’know?”



“To reject the heavens,” Sera trailed off softly.



Henry nodded. “It hit different. Dad spent his career looking out into infinity. And he told me that infinity would always be there. But our time here, on Earth, on Gaerra, on this mortal plane – it’s finite. There are times when he’d long for the stars again, but never with any regret. He never regretted giving it all up, just to be able to be there for Grandma and Grandpa in their final moments.”

“They passed, as one?”



Henry lowered his head. “Yeah. He didn’t want her to go alone. Grandma died two days before Christmas. December twenty-third. That day, she was perfectly her, having strawberry ice cream even though she’d forgotten how to use utensils the year prior. Talking to us about the stories we told her throughout the years. She recognized all of us, said her goodbyes like she knew it was time. Not even a few minutes later, her heart gave out.”



Sera stayed silent, so Henry kept going, “Grandpa told me then: ‘Fifty years or five minutes – love isn’t measured in time remembered, but in time given.’ He passed the same night, in his sleep. I guess he didn’t want Grandma to go alone.”



He turned to face Sera fully, taking in her tears, the way she held his hand like she was afraid he might disappear. She knew the parallel; the weight of choosing something she knew would end. The daily decision to show up anyway.



Henry took a breath. “That's what you’re really asking, isn’t it? Not whether you can handle the ending, but whether the story’s worth starting when you already know the last page.”



Sera gave a weak smile. “How well you read me, dear Captain.”



“You have centuries,” he said. “I’ve got maybe seventy years if I’m lucky. Well, not counting the risks that come with adventuring. And yet, we’re still out here kicking monster ass, aren’t we?""



Sera laughed, but it came out shaky, tears still on her cheeks. “It scarce compares.”



Henry took both her hands now. “Still, we could’ve done anything but this. You could be at soirees, I could be pushing papers at some FOB.”



“And yet we chose this.” She looked down at their joined hands, then back up at him. Her voice softened, “I know not if seventy years shall be enough.”



“We’ll have all the time we need,” Henry said, the words coming out sure and steady.



Something shifted in her expression. Relief, maybe. Permission. She freed one hand to reach up and touch his face, thumb tracing his cheekbone like she was memorizing it.



The space between them had gotten smaller without him noticing. Close enough to see the tears still clinging to her lashes, feel her breath catch slightly. The whole room seemed to narrow down to just this – her hand on his face, her eyes searching his, the inevitable pull between them.



Sera leaned in, slow enough to make her intentions clear. Slow enough that he could’ve pulled back. As if.



He readily accepted. Her lips brushed his, soft and careful at first, like sealing a promise. Nothing desperate about it, nothing rushed. Nothing like those hollow preludes from his Academy days – kisses that were just transactions on the way to somewhere else. This meant something, and the pounding in his heart confirmed it.



When she pulled back just enough to breathe, her eyes searched his. He saw no doubt there now, just that same certainty he felt.



“We’ll have all the time we need,” she echoed, and kissed him again.



This time was different – deeper, more certain. Her fingers slid into his hair while his arms came around her, and God, the way she kissed him. Like she was trying to say everything they’d been too uncertain or busy to say for weeks. 



When they finally pulled apart, faces close enough to share breath, Sera tugged at his arm – gentle, like she was asking a question. He followed her lead as they shifted down to lie properly, settling into each other. She tucked against his side with her head on his chest, and it hit him how perfectly she fit there. Like his body had been saving that space.



It didn’t take long for Henry’s eyes to get heavy. Most guys would probably be trying to make moves right now, push for the full send or whatever. Of course, he wouldn’t have turned down an offer to go ham, but to him, just lying here with Sera felt right. She was warm against him, breathing steady, and that was all he needed. This was enough – hell, this was everything.



Sleep came easy after that.

I come from a very efficient store originally with much stronger partners and my store currently (until today) has been struggling to keep up with lesser demand because a decent bit of the baristas lack urgency or don't follow standards etc.

I consistently try to create a floor of partners that does their job quickly, with true beverage quality and routines and making the Cafe and drive through friendly to our customers as well as a peaceful place to do some work while enjoying a coffee. 

Examples of these instances:

I saw we have had a couple of bad reviews in a row lately and wanted to see who all was working that shift and so I looked at the schedule. A barista was watching me as I named off the list of partners that were there for said bad reviews experience. They thought because I listed their name as someone who was working that I was implying the bad review was about them. I clearly told them i didn't believe it was (I was quite positive i knew who it was which was a different SSV. She went to my manager and said she was uncomfortable that I implied a bad review was about her.

A barista with a lot of personality was making very loud witch cackling noises to be silly and fun. Got too loud where it was a distraction to those in Cafe and people looked over like he was crazy or on drugs. I told them they needed to lower the volume a bit but I'm all for having fun on the floor. Barista was crying in the back .

A longtime barista who calls out legitimately 10 times a month was asking to go home 10 minutes into their shift (recently pregnant and nauseous) i said you are good to clock out and go home might have at most sighed because I had to try to find coverage instantly. Was confronted by my manager who said she claimed I was discriminating due to her being pregnant. 

My manager said her hands were tied and that it was upper management who decided to fire me but it's honestly the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. As their SSV I'm supposed to coach and tell them how to improve and if I use a ""gentle friendly"" tone they don't listen and repeat bad behavior. I use a flat tone to show I'm serious about something and I'm a dice apparently. I'm genuinely someone who cares about people and I'm aware of how i talk. Disappointed because I cared more about quality and standards and customer experience while still trying to make things fun for everyone working but apparently that's not enough.",1,1752631045.0,starbucksbaristas,5,0.57,False

It's one that has stuck with him, and in turn, with me, since 2012 when he first shared it.

He had gone deep down one of his Newgrounds rabbit holes, exploring recommendations and user submissions. He was on the hunt for something obscure, something lost, and he found it in a web animation called ""Misery Blues."" Just the title caught his attention. 

He described the animation's distinctive early 2000s Flash style, with its somewhat jerky motion, bold black lines, and muted color palettes. It opened with a long shot of a deserted nighttime bar. There were no characters, just an eerie stillness broken by a low hum.

Then, the camera slowly zoomed in on a table in the center of the room. As it got closer, the table started to shake violently, thudding against the wooden floor. Suddenly, it crashed to the ground. From under the overturned table, something appeared. 

It was a cat—specifically, an anthropomorphic cat. It had gray fur, a lean build, and disturbingly human eyes. Adrien said the animation style was typical for that time, but something about the creature was deeply unsettling.

The cat stood still, its head tilted as if trying to understand its surroundings. Its eyes were blank, almost empty, silently asking the question, ""Where am I?"" It didn't make a sound, but its posture expressed complete confusion. 

The camera zoomed in on the cat's face, and Adrien felt a growing sense of unease. As the zoom continued, he noticed something alarming: the cat's eyes were slowly turning black. Not just the pupils, but the entire eye, the whites fading into a dark void.

Adrien was gasping, as he sensed what was about to happen. He just knew.  Then the screen abruptly went dark, leaving him staring in shock at the empty monitor.

But the silence didn't last long. Instead of a quiet moment, he heard sounds of a late night: the cold wind, the distant hoot of an owl, and the chirping of insects. It was an oddly peaceful soundscape.  

Adrien was hooked. He sat there, eyes glued to the screen, waiting for something to happen. He anticipated something awful. A minute passed, which felt like an eternity. The night sounds continued...

Just when boredom started to creep in, it happened. ***The loud jump scare.***

The gray cat's face, a twisted version of its former self, filled the screen. Its eyes were solid black, and its mouth was stretched into a wide, maniacal grin, showing needle-sharp teeth that looked nothing like a cat's.

But the worst part wasn't the image; it was the sound. Instead of a typical jump scare noise, it sounded like extreme VHS interference. Adrien described it as a piercing noise that could shatter eardrums. 

He leaned back in his chair, heart racing. He scrambled for the volume control, quickly turning it down. He was living in an apartment then, and it was late—he didn't want to disturb his neighbors.

Fortunately, the noise stopped and the image faded back to the bar. Adrien leaned back once more, relief and terror washing over him simultaneously. He felt completely confused. For a moment, he worried about his neighbors, but nobody knocked at the door—thankfully.

He took a deep breath and forced himself to focus on the animation. The scene shifted. Now the camera showed the outside of the bar, where the door slowly creaked open, revealing darkness within.

The camera edged forward, getting closer until the screen went black. Another minute passed, with only the sound of his breathing. He wondered if the animation had frozen, stuck on a black screen.

Then, the image returned. This time, it was daytime. The animation revealed details hidden during the night, showing five more anthropomorphic cats. Adrien noted they were more detailed than the gray cat, with distinct personalities reflected in their expressions and clothing. 

He learned their names: **Arnoldo**, a scruffy-looking guy; **Freya**, an easy-going lady; **Seifer**, the bartender with a tired look; his two-year-old son, **Strago**; and **Relm**, a rebellious teenage catgirl. 

The animation took on a more traditional narrative. **Arnoldo** was looking for someone and asked **Freya** if she had seen a cat named ***Vando Setina***, describing him as a gray cat. 

Adrien thought that name sounded off, feeling that something was not right.

**Freya** said she hadn't seen him. Relm mentioned that Vando had been missing for weeks. **Seifer**, playing with his son, mentioned that **Vando** had been acting strangely for the last few months, suggesting something was amiss. 

The animation provided some backstory about the bar. It doubled as a motel, which attracted a wandering and often troubled crowd. Then the screen went blank again. 

When it returned, it was nighttime once more. **Relm** stood on a balcony, smoking a cigarette. She looked introspective, reflecting on her life choices. After tossing the cigarette butt over the edge, she stepped inside, turning off the light. 

As the light flickered out, a dark figure appeared next to the balcony door—a cat-like anthropomorphic shape. Adrien instantly recognized it was not **Relm**'s silhouette. 

The scene shifted to **Freya**'s bedroom. Outside, it was raining, the sound pattering in the quiet. **Freya** slept fitfully in bed. Near the window was the same gray cat from the start of the animation, contorted in the same expression as the jump scare. **Adrien** found it disturbing that the cat was there while **Freya** slept peacefully. 

The scene cut to **Seifer**'s room. He was fighting in his sleep, clearly having a nightmare. It then switched to **Relm**’s room. She was still awake, getting ready for bed in the bathroom. When she came out, the gray cat's face appeared in the darkness of the closet, disappearing as it looked at her. 

She rebooted her alarm clock and went to sleep. The cat's face showed up again, watching her with malice.  The screen suddenly went blank again. 

**Adrien** began to form a theory. Earlier in the animation, everyone had mentioned **Vando**, talking about his disappearance and his strange behavior. And **Vando**, of course, was also a gray cat. Could he be the same disturbing cat from the jump scare? Adrien didn't know but the thought lingered.  

The next scene showed the bar-motel during the day. The animation switched to the private struggles of the characters, revealing the issues they faced. **Seifer** mourned the loss of the last family member he had. **Relm** received a letter from her university informing her of her expulsion due to excessive absences. **Freya** discovered her husband was cheating on her and wanted a divorce because she was ""ugly."" 

**Adrien** hoped for some resolution, thinking the story would take a better turn. That’s what stories do, right?  

*Right?*  

The plot grew darker and creepier, revealing tragic fates for the characters. The first and perhaps saddest fate befell Seifer and his son. **Seifer**, battling deep depression, took his own life. The police came, and **Strago** began crying. Without a mother to care for him, he would have to go to an orphanage. 

**Freya** and **Arnoldo**'s endings were worse. **Arnoldo**, trying to ""cheer up"" **Freya** after her breakup, thought it wise to play a cruel prank on her. **Freya** was furious. She grabbed him by the collar and shouted, ""*YOU'RE A DAMN BITCH! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!*"". 

She punched, kicked, and beat him relentlessly. It might have been understandable at first, but **Freya** went too far. **Arnoldo** lay still. Realizing what she had done, **Freya** panicked and dragged his body to a dumpster. Then she ran to the bathroom. What happened next was left to interpretation. **Adrien** thought she likely took her own life, like **Seifer**. 

**Relm**'s fate was the wildest of all. She called a school friend to explain her situation, convincing him to travel overseas with her. He agreed, and they planned to meet up at the station. She rushed to the station but was careless while crossing the street and was hit by a car. 

**Adrien** was shocked. He couldn't help but feel sympathy for the characters, whose lives ended in sadness instead of resolution. The animation returned to the empty bar at night, focusing on the same table from the beginning. It began to shake and finally fell to the floor. Crawling out from beneath it was the gray cat—or rather, **Vando**. 

The jump scare returned, louder and more distorted than before. The picture disappeared after about ten seconds, the sound stopped, and the screen faded to black. The animation concluded with a simple credits screen. Adrien sat in stunned silence, staring at his screen, unable to comprehend what he had just witnessed. He made himself a pot of coffee and stayed awake all night, trying to distract himself and calm his nerves.

He began to think about the animation, trying to make sense of it.  

""Why did the animation end the same way it started?"" It might demonstrate a time paradox where five people met their ends and the story that began that way ended the same way.

""Why didn't the story have a happy ending?"" Maybe the bar was haunted. Adrien wasn’t sure.  

""What was the story's meaning?"" It could show the consequences of not confronting our problems. Adrien wasn't certain about this one.  

Then, out of nowhere, he remembered something. He mixed up the letters in Vando’s name, hoping to uncover a hidden message. When he rearranged them, what he found sent shivers down his spine.  

The anagram? *""No Viste Nada.""* A simple phrase in Spanish. But in English, it translates to:

The rest of their time on Harlaan passed without incident. The crew spent their days exploring the planet-sized city and all of the tourist attractions and entertainment it had to offer, although after their experience on the first night they chose to avoid any more trips to the bar. In what felt like no time at all, they were back underway along the next leg of their never-ending journey through space. 

By the time Jason’s doorbell rang two days after leaving Harlaan, he had nearly forgotten about the promise he had made to Oyre in the cafeteria the morning of their arrival. 

“May I come in?” Oyre asked when he opened the door.

“Uh, sure,” Jason replied, stepping aside to allow her into his rather cramped living quarters. “Aren’t you supposed to be working right now?”

“I told them I was going to the restroom,” Oyre explained before changing the subject. “It’s been two days since we left Harlaan.”

She said it like she expected Jason to know the significance of the fact. When he could only muster a blank stare in response, she glanced at her watch and added, “In less than one minute, the captain is going to order the ship into lockdown.”

“Oh, right,” Jason replied, remembering the prediction she had made during that conversation in the cafeteria. “The pirates.”

The ship shuddered briefly, as if they’d managed to hit a pothole in space. Jason knew that the feeling was caused by the inertial dampeners struggling to compensate for the sudden deceleration as the ship exited the hyperlane and entered realspace on the outer edge of whatever star system was nearby. Theoretically, if Oyre’s prophesied pirate attack really did happen, it would be now. Space travel was made up of alternating faster-than-light trips through the hyperlanes connecting solar systems to each other and slower-than-light trips through the system to reach the next lane. It was impossible to attack a ship while it was in the hyperlane, but they would be vulnerable while transiting the system. 

Jason looked out the window and saw nothing but empty space, save for one red-orange star that appeared slightly larger and significantly brighter than all of the others. 

“You’re not going to see anything,” Oyre said, as if she was reading his mind. “Even if there was anyone out there, they’d be too far away to see without sensors.”

Suddenly, an armored plate snapped into place on the outside of the window, blocking the view entirely. The ship’s intercom buzzed to life. “Your attention please, this is Captain Tanari. Due to pirate activity in the area, we are entering category one lockdown. All security personnel are to report to their designated stations immediately, and all other crew members are to shelter in place until the lockdown is lifted. I repeat, category one lockdown, effective immediately.”

“Believe me now?” Oyre asked as she sat down at his desk and swiveled the chair around to face him.

It took Jason a moment to process what had just happened. He took a seat on the bed across from her as he began to consider that maybe she wasn’t so crazy after all. When Oyre had first made her prediction, he’d immediately dismissed it as nonsensical. The unhinged ramblings of a conspiracy theorist. In the days since then, he’d almost forgotten that she’d even said it in the first place. But now, at least the first part of what she’d said had come true. And he did recall promising to give her a chance to explain herself in the event that she was right. “How did you know?”

“Because we’re in the system S-1274. No Alliance presence at all, save for a comms relay and a hyperlane.”

“And this is where all the pirates hang out?”

“Not exactly. It’s a bit of a detour on the way to Pyrvoth. Two or three hours of extra travel time, but it skips all of the traffic in 1268. If 1268 gets too busy, we can save a few minutes going this way. Both of the times we’ve flown through here since I joined the crew, we’ve gone into lockdown the whole time we’ve been in the system, then picked up a stage one primitive a day later. So I looked into the logs, and it turns out that has happened all seven times this ship has flown through 1274 since Tanari took over as captain. We’ve been through 1268 probably about twenty times, and it has never happened there.”

“So, the pirates are attacking the scientists and the scientists are dumping their experiments?”

Oyre changed the subject again with a question of her own. “Tell me. When you woke up in the infirmary, how long did Ukan say you’d been in stasis? Three hundred years?”

“She didn’t say anything specific,” Jason replied. “She told me it could have been anywhere from days to centuries.”

“At least they’re learning,” Oyre sighed. “They told me it had been three hundred years. But when I started looking through the star charts on my first day of work, I found a supernova I had been studying back home. After a bit of math with the distances and times, I found out it couldn’t have been more than a few weeks since I was home. I showed them the calculations. They told me I was too primitive, too stupid to understand what I was looking at, then they locked me out of the star charts. Ever since then, I’ve only ever been allowed to look at the ones I need to plot our next course.” As she said it, the scales on her face turned red briefly, then shifted to a pale yellow. 

That begged the obvious question. If she had figured out where home was, why was she still out here? Jason supposed that, if she was telling the truth, then the most likely answer would be that she was still on the waiting list for a ride home like the customs official on Harlaan had mentioned. But regardless of the reason, the way she reacted to the question would be indicative of whether or not there was any substance to her claims. “So, if you already found home, why haven’t you gone back?” he asked.

“I don’t want to talk about it,” Oyre replied, a ripple of navy blue flashing across the scales on her face. The fact that the question hadn’t sparked an argument - or even an angry response of any kind - did lend some credence to the idea, even without a real answer to his question. Jason had never known a conspiracy theorist to react so calmly and politely to having their beliefs questioned. 

“Take a look at this,” Oyre said, tapping the face of her watch to activate the holoprojector, and with a few gestures opened a document to show him. 

Jason recognized the photos of a supernova and the star charts displaying its location in the universe, but the rest of it was a ton of math that went way over his head. “What am I looking at?” he asked.

Oyre walked him through the calculations, explaining each step of the problem to show how she had arrived at the conclusion that they’d lied about how long she had been in stasis. He still didn’t really understand the math, at least not well enough to duplicate it on his own, but nothing stood out to him as an obvious mistake. She hadn’t added two plus two and gotten five or anything like that, but Jason would have to take her word that all of the formulas and constants were right. She had no evidence beyond her memories of her work back home to verify the numbers she’d used for the time of the supernova as observed from her homeworld or the distance between the two, but everything else made about as much sense as it ever would to someone who didn’t know the math. At least it was more proof than his brother had ever offered for any of his crackpot theories back home. 

“Where do the pirates come into all this?” Jason asked. In the blink of an eye, they’d gone from discussing the prevalence of space piracy to a full-on math and physics lecture, and somewhere along the way he’d missed the point. 

“There are no pirates, Jason,” Oyre replied. “It’s all Captain Tanari. He took us from our homes because us ‘primitives’ tend to be more reliable workers.” Her scales turned purple as she said it. “Entry-level jobs on a ship always have really high turnover. Lots of people like the idea of travelling the galaxy and don’t fully understand what it’s like to not have a permanent home. To not be able to spend time with anyone except your crewmates. To be completely out of contact with everyone you knew for weeks or even months at a time. Once they realize how isolated space can be, they quit.”

“How can they afford to?” Jason asked. Sure, forty credits a day was plenty to get by when he had no living expenses whatsoever. But between finding a place to live and paying the customs and immigration fees involved in settling down on a new planet, it would take months or even a full year of his salary to leave the ship, depending on which planet he chose. And that was assuming he never spent a penny of it while on shore leave. “I thought we didn’t get paid that much.”

“We don’t,” Oyre confirmed. “That’s why citizens of Alliance member civilizations are entitled to severance pay if they make it more than three months on board, regardless of why they left. But ‘primitives’ don’t get that. We’re on our own if we leave. Think about it. Why would Tanari hire someone just so he can pay them to not be here in three months, if he could keep us trapped here doing the same work for years instead? The pirates are just an excuse to make sure nobody sees what’s happening while he does it. When the ship goes into lockdown, only the people who are in on it get to see what’s going on outside.”

Jason didn’t reply immediately. If she hadn’t had the star charts and calculations to back it up, he’d have dismissed the whole thing as easily as he dismissed his brother’s rants about the frogs’ sexuality. But now, he found himself strongly considering the possibility that she might be telling the truth. 

“I’m sorry,” Oyre said, her scales once again turning yellow. “I shouldn’t have gone there yet. I know how it sounds.”

“These … beings we’ve picked up here,” Jason said, hesitant to use the word ‘primitives’ to describe them. “Have you seen them before?”

Oyre’s scales changed color again, this time shifting to a pastel green a couple of shades lighter than her normal color. “One of them.”

“What did he look like?” Jason asked.

“Avian,” Oyre replied. “A bit shorter than me. Mostly blue feathers, with a bit of yellow and white here and there too. Short but sharp-looking beak, three claws on each foot.”

*Space parrots*, Jason thought. 

“Do you believe me?” Oyre asked.

Jason had to admit she made a surprisingly compelling argument. He reserved the right to rethink his decision depending on whether or not the space parrot appeared some time in the next few days, but he really didn’t have a good counter-argument against anything she had said. “Yes,” he admitted eventually.

Oyre practically leapt out of the chair and hugged Jason as soon as he said it. He couldn’t imagine how she must have felt, being told over and over again by the whole crew that she was crazy or stupid when she raised what seemed like a valid question about the story they’d told her. Spending a whole year in outer space, surrounded by strangers - aliens, at that - not knowing if there was a way back home, well, he was already beginning to experience that part. Throw in Oyre’s rough relationship with the rest of the crew, and her experience started to sound like a literal hell. Wondering if this was the first time since her arrival that she’d actually been taken seriously, he returned the embrace. 

“Wow, you’re warm,” Oyre commented as they separated. Her scales were now displaying a combination of white and pastel green, not that Jason had any idea what that meant. She fidgeted with something in her pocket and said, “I almost won’t need my heater for a few minutes now.”

“Your heater?” Jason asked.

Oyre unzipped her jacket and revealed the inner layer, which contained a web of wires that Jason recognized as a heating element. “I’m cold-blooded,” she explained. “They keep the ship way colder than I’d like, so I have to wear this to make sure I don’t freeze.”

Jason hadn’t thought about alien biology in that level of detail before, but it made sense. Her body temperature hadn’t felt much different from a Human's when she hugged him, but room temperature on the ship felt about the same as room temperature back home on Earth. And if she was cold-blooded, then all that extra heat had to be coming from somewhere. “I take it you come from a warm planet, then?”

“Yes,” Oyre replied, a ripple of blue appearing across her scales for just a couple of seconds before fading back to the usual dark green. “I had to crank the thermostat in my room as high as it goes to make it feel like home.” With that, she changed the subject. “Tell me about … Earth, was it?”

“Yeah,” Jason nodded. “What do you want to know?”

They spent the remaining two hours of the lockdown discussing their past lives before being abducted. The same ripple of blue flashed across Oyre’s scales whenever she mentioned a friend or family member from back home, and she was oddly hesitant to go into much detail about anything personal. By the time the lockdown lifted and she was able to head back up to the bridge, he’d gathered that her species - the Binolta - had only ever colonized a narrow band around the equator of their homeworld due to their lack of cold tolerance, and they’d achieved a level of technology comparable to what Earth had in the 1960s or 70s. 

Once she was gone, Jason sent a quick text message to Farranax informing him of Oyre’s prediction. He still wasn’t entirely sure if he was keeping a record to vindicate her when the parrot showed up, or if he was just supplying the topic for tomorrow’s conversation among the rest of the group. But either way, the others should probably know beforehand. 

---

Jason was still struggling to get used to the not-quite-twenty-hour day observed by the crew of the *Spirit of Fortune*, and the fact that he’d only gotten four hours of sleep the night before wasn’t helping matters. He made his way through the line at the cafeteria and grabbed some breakfast. He downed an entire cup of alien coffee - referring to things by their Earth equivalents was easier than remembering a million different alien names, especially while still half-asleep - while still standing in front of the dispenser and filled the glass again before joining the rest of the group at their usual table. By the time he sat down, he was feeling awake enough to participate in the conversation.

To nobody’s surprise, the others were already making fun of Oyre’s claims that the ship had picked up a passenger - a space parrot, to be somewhat more precise - during the lockdown. “She can’t even come up with an original idea,” Hjelin suggested. “The primitive she was describing is the same one we picked up four months ago. If you’re going to say some crazy shit, at least go all-in on it. Fire-breathing dragons. Giant spiders. Something like that, you know?”

“Hey, Jason,” Farranax greeted him. “Were you really stuck with her for the whole lockdown?”

“Yeah,” Jason nodded. “She showed up at my door like a minute before it started.”

“Must’ve seen the pirates on the long-range sensors before the announcement went out,” Elkam suggested. “I know I wouldn’t want to be stuck at my workstation for an entire lockdown. Those things can go on for days sometimes.”

“Well, at least it was a short one,” Hjelin pointed out. “Must have been bad enough being stuck with her for two hours. I couldn’t even imagine days.”

“You know, you did promise you’d listen to what she had to say if the lockdown really happened when she predicted,” Farranax pointed out.

“I suppose I did,” Jason replied. “Only have myself to blame for that. I just said that to make her shut up, I didn’t think she was actually going to be right.”

“I’d have done the same,” Yronien admitted. 

“A few months ago, I got stuck in the damned bathroom during a lockdown,” Aeru mused. “I thought that was bad, but I think I’d prefer that to listening to two hours of her yapping.”

That drew a round of laughter from the table, which was abruptly cut short when Doctor Ukan walked into the cafeteria alongside the space parrot Oyre had told them to expect. Very short - about the size of the average Human preteen - with blue, yellow, and white feathers. Nobody said anything for a moment as they all tried to process what they were seeing. Jason had to admit he wasn’t surprised after what Oyre had said last night.

“Oyre must’ve seen the primitive in the infirmary right before the lockdown,” Hjelin declared confidently. “There’s no other way she could have known that.”

“Uhh … right,” Aeru agreed hesitantly.

“I think we should ask her how the hell she knew that,” Farranax suggested. “I know she’s been wrong before - more than a few times - but this is just too specific. She has to know something that we don’t.”

Elkam nodded his agreement and opened his mouth as if to say something, but Hjelin cut him off.

“Come on, guys. Do you really believe that nutjob just because she happened to get something right for once in her life?”

“Crazy or not, she still got it right,” Elkam pointed out. “And I’d like to know how. Jason, why don’t you invite her to join us on Pyrvoth? That way we can hear it straight from the source.”

“Okay,” Jason agreed, opening up his watch’s display and sending Oyre a message.",19,1752630885.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

I am currently working as a barista and had to reschedule my first appointment at a psychologist because my work schedule has changed. I emailed her 2 days in advance and we scheduled a new appointment. When I got out of work today to go to the appointment, I had some issues finding the house so I arrived max. 2 to 4 minutes late as I was never in that area before.

I entered the waiting room and there was a woman making herself coffee. She was preparing it and like 10 minutes later she turned around and said are you Ms. so and so? I said, yes , thats me. Then she said well, you rescheduled the first appointment and now you came late without telling me on the phone that you are coming late, I will not accept you as a patient. She was looking at me really bitter and was literally talking down on me. I felt really shocked as I was sitting there in public in the waiting room. She just wanted me to leave. She did not even talked to me about that in the patient room and just dismissed me. 

I already felt really down due to my anxiety, depression and self-worth and to be confronted with someone dismissing you like that had ruined my whole mood. I was looking for a safe space, I feel horrible right now.

1 - It looks a little cramped. While I do love my couch and coffee table, together, I feel like it looks a bit “stumpy” (instead of leggy). Should I get rid of some pieces? Or should I just minimize the decor? i.e. blankets, pillows, replace the blue chair dog bed, etc.

2 - My living room has black railing all around since it’s sunken. It’s there for functionality but I’m debating on whether I should just remove it. Then again, I don’t want to fall on my face. It does provide some separation between the entrance and the kitchen.

1m109h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1m109h0/can_i_ask_her_to_move_out/,Can I ask her to move out?,"I’ve been living with my current roommate for almost a year now, and we still have one more year left on our lease. The truth is, I really don’t like living with her, and I don’t want her to renew the lease or stay once it’s up.

We met a few times before she moved in, just dinner and coffee, and she seemed nice and pretty normal. I even did a bit of due diligence: Googled her, checked her Instagram and LinkedIn. There were no red flags. She moved into my apartment in the spring, and everything seemed fine at first.

Things started going downhill by September. I had made it clear from the start that I like to keep the apartment clean. It’s a big city, 600 square feet, and you really have to be mindful. I mentioned that I do a quick clean midweek and a deeper clean on Sundays, and that I try not to leave dishes in the sink. At first, she seemed to respect that, but slowly she started leaving dishes and food out. We ended up with a cockroach, and when I suggested we both make an effort to clean up right away, she sent a long, defensive text blaming the landlord and saying she wouldn’t change anything. It was frustrating, especially because this was my space and I had been upfront about my expectations before she moved in.

Then there were smaller things that piled up. She had a friend visit, and afterward, I noticed my wine glasses were missing. When I asked, she casually told me they broke but she’d been too busy studying to let me know. I replaced them myself and asked her to just give me a heads-up in the future if anything breaks.

The messiness continued. She left food and dirty dishes out regularly, and when I politely brought it up, she accused me of being passive aggressive. Around exam time, she started waking up at 5 a.m. to study, which I understand, but she was extremely loud. When I asked her to be a little quieter in the mornings, she was again very rude.

She also used to drink alone a lot, and that made me uncomfortable. I’m sober, and she knows that. But even with that context, she would often drink alone in the apartment and then start texting me excessively, almost like she needed constant reassurance that we were on good terms. It made the apartment feel tense and emotionally draining for me.

I often come back from long weekends away to find crumbs all over the floor, chocolate smeared on the white kitchen cabinets, and just general messiness. It’s so frustrating because it feels like she completely ignores any effort to keep the apartment clean, even when I’m not there.

I went away over Christmas for three weeks, and when I came back, a swing-arm lamp of mine was snapped. She claimed it must have just been cheap or old. Another time I was walking around and felt something gritty on the floor. I said it felt like sand, and only then did she say, “Oh yeah, I spilled bread crumbs earlier” and hadn’t cleaned them up.

But the final straw was when she broke a Ralph Lauren barrel vase I own, worth $900 and gifted to me. It had been stored under the kitchen table because it’s quite tall and there wasn’t a better spot. She texted me a photo and apologized, but it took her over a month to replace it. I followed up twice during that time, and she accused me of harassing her, saying of course she would replace it and that she had so much going on. When I tried to be helpful and suggested she could just send me the money and I’d order it, she responded with “Jesus Christ” and sent a long, angry message saying things like “if it’s so important to you, why is it under the table collecting dust?”

Eventually, she did replace the vase, though it’s smaller and not quite the same. Since then, I’ve pulled back. I’m polite, I say hi and ask how she is, but I’ve stopped trying to have a relationship with her. She’s been unkind, dismissive, and extremely inconsiderate. And at this point, I really just don’t want to live with her anymore.

It’s frustrating because she moved into my apartment, where I’ve lived for two years. I own all the furniture outside of her bedroom, and I genuinely love the space and the location. She does pay slightly more rent because she has the larger room, but I’m the original tenant and this feels like my home.

I want her to move out when the lease ends.

Can I ask her to move out next lease? How should I go about it?",4,1752630645.0,badroommates,1,0.84,False

1m105vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCryptoMoonshots/comments/1m105vq/bitcoin_vs_xrp_why_i_sold_bitcoin_and_believe_xrp/,Bitcoin vs XRP — Why I Sold Bitcoin and Believe XRP Is the Future of Crypto,"After years watching the space, I made a major move — I sold all my Bitcoin and doubled down on XRP. Here’s why I believe XRP is the future, and Bitcoin’s glory days are fading fast.

Let’s break it down:

🔹 Bitcoin: The Original Digital Gold?

Bitcoin was the pioneer. It promised decentralized, peer-to-peer money free from government control. But fast forward to 2025, and Bitcoin is nowhere near that original vision.

- Slow & Expensive: Bitcoin handles about 7 transactions per second with fees that can spike to $30 or more. Try buying a coffee with that.
- Scaling Problems: The Core dev team abandoned on-chain scaling years ago, pushing users to Lightning — a complicated, centralized layer that contradicts Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos.
- Centralized Control: Mining power is concentrated in a handful of pools mostly in China and the US. Whales, ETFs, and institutions hold massive amounts of Bitcoin. Retail is sidelined.
- No Real-World Use Case: Bitcoin is mostly a store of value or speculation asset now. Sending money across borders? Forget it. It’s too slow, costly, and complex.

🔹 XRP: The Utility Powerhouse

XRP was built from day one as a fast, low-cost settlement layer for payments. It’s not trying to be digital gold — it’s designed to move trillions across borders in seconds.

- Speed & Cost: 1500+ transactions per second, settling in 3-5 seconds with fees less than a fraction of a cent.
- Real Adoption: Banks, remittance companies, and fintechs like SBI Remit, Tranglo, Coins.ph use XRP to power live payment corridors worldwide.
- Built for Tokenization: XRP Ledger supports smart contracts, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization natively.
- Decentralized & Energy Efficient: No mining. Consensus is achieved via a Unique Node List, which is becoming more decentralized every year.
- Cross-Chain Bridges: Integration with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and others means XRP connects to the entire crypto ecosystem.

🔹 Why I Made the Switch

Bitcoin was revolutionary but stopped evolving. It’s become slow, expensive, and controlled by elites who use it more as a financial tool than a currency.

XRP is the real-world crypto powering financial innovation. It’s solving actual problems with speed, cost, and usability that Bitcoin never addressed.

The financial world isn’t about to replace gold with Bitcoin. They want fast, scalable, reliable tech to move money. XRP is that tech.

---

This isn’t just hype. The numbers don’t lie. XRP’s technology and adoption show it’s poised to dominate this next bull market. Bitcoin is becoming digital gold for whales — XRP is the digital oil that powers global finance.

1m105uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m105uk/flirty_girl_at_grocery_store_ghosted_me_on_1st/,Flirty girl at grocery store ghosted me on 1st text,"So I go to this grocery store pretty often and I noticed that a new woman started working there.  As soon as she saw me she smiled really big and said ""Hey"".   I just said ""Hey"" too.   She seemed cute to me, but I didn't think too much of it.

I go to this grocery store a couple of times a week and every time I see her, I get the same look and she says things like, ""How are you doin tonight?"" - but in a really flirty way.  It's hard fro me to describe it, but most people know when someone is flirting with them.  Still, I am always afraid that I am misinterpreting things and that no woman is really interested, she's just being nice.

After about a month or so of similar encounters, she asks me if she can help me find something, and I tell her I'm looking for this weird thing that I can't seem to find in any stores around, and she laughs and we joke about where I ""might"" find it, and she ends up saying I'll probably just need to go on Amazon.  All of this is very flirty and she's joking about the stuff in my basket that I'm buying and telling me what I ""should"" be getting, etc.

Still, I'm not overthinking this and I assume she is just being nice.

When I go to checkout, she runs over and grabs my arm (my bicep), and says, ""Nice seeing you, I hope you have a great night.""

Ok then, well that's it.  Every single piece of dating/relationship advice I've ever read has said that when a woman touches you - especially if she grabs you by the arm after being flirty - then she is interested.

So then I said, ""Hey, do you wanna get a drink or some coffee sometime and hangout?""

She says, ""Sure, how can I get your number?""

So I hand her my phone and she puts her number in and calls me so I have it.  I said, ""Cool, I'll text you, hope you have a great night too.""

And when I get home, I texted her, ""Hey, this is the dude from the grocery store.""

She texts back and says, ""Haha, how was your day?""

I said, ""It was good thanks!  When are you free from work so we can meet up?""

Crickets.  Nothing.

The next few days go by and it's the 4th of July, and I thought I'd try again with, ""Hey happy 4th!"".

Nothing.  No response at all.

I went back to the grocery store a couple of times since then and I've seen her and she just avoids me, and I avoid her too and just get my stuff really quick and leave.

This seems so damn weird to me.  Was I misinterpreting shit again?  I mean, I really don't care that much whether or not we meet up or if she ever talks to me again.  The thing that bothers me the most is that I feel like I simply cannot trust my dating instincts at all.  Like how in the hell was I completely off base about these interactions?  She had zero interest in me at all apparently and I misread everything.

Am I crazy?  When the hell am I supposed to know for sure that ""yes, this is the sign that she's interested!"".  It just really bothers me that I can't seem to read that at all and I feel like I should never try to initiate anything again because it's alway just in my head.",6,1752630352.0,dating_advice,5,0.87,False

I got a new job yesterday. Which is good because rent is due in two weeks, and I’ve nearly blown through my savings. A tanned and plump hand slipped the assignment through the crack in my bedroom window. One whose arm reached impossible lengths and whose owner had their body tucked around the corner out of my sight. To avoid being rude to a house guest, invited or not, I took the manilla envelope and waited until the hand had completely retracted from my window to open it.

Inside the envelope are two sheets of paper. Printed at the top is a bold typeface that reads ‘Delivery position. Monday through Friday, 7pm to 4am. $35/hr, gas compensated. First day: tomorrow.’ Below that: ‘Congratulations on joining the team!’ And below even that are my uniform specifications: Plain black t-shirt with a pocket on the chest, full-length jeans, and close-toed shoes. It then lists the address. The second sheet of paper was a W-2 with a typed sticky note attached instructing me to fill it out and hand it in tomorrow first thing.

\*\*\*

It’s a warm and cheerful evening when I arrive at my new job. Of course, when I glance at the clock on my dashboard, I’m fifteen minutes early, because like my grandfather always told me: ‘if you’re not early, you’re late, and if you're late, you’re fired’. Usually his advice was prefaced by “you’re unsettling, and people won’t like that.” and culminated in, “so do ‘x, y, and z’ and they won’t mind you too much.” Whenever he visited the children's home I grew up in, he passed on gems like that and I’ve found each one just as useful as the last.

Just as my GPS said it would be, the shop sits tucked in the rear of a pitch black alley. The unlit neon sign above the door is a simple curled tentacle, and along the suckers are a series of swirling letters that my brain interprets as ‘Unspeakable Horrors’. When I blink, I swear the tentacle on the sign shifts in place, as though restless. I shake my head to dispel the illusion, swallow my nerves, and push the door open. The bell on the inside handle announces my arrival, but no one greets me at the register. Dishes clatter and food sizzles in the kitchen, but the long metal gate is shut, so the chef remains a mystery. “Excuse me.” I call, and there’s a beat of silence in the cacophony before it resumes its regular tune. I try again, projecting my voice louder this time. “Excuse me, I’m here about the delivery driver's position?”

When there’s still no reply, I turn around and take in the shop. Best to be patient. Someone will come out eventually, right? There are a handful of red booths, and a few blonde wood tables whose sizes range from seating two to six patrons each. At the far left of the shop, resting atop a small round table where a single person would struggle to eat their meal without feeling cramped, is a 90s classic: a cherry red Sangyn brand landline telephone. The kind with the buttons instead of the previous model’s rotary style face. It and the table beneath it are the only items on the left side of the store, aside from the swinging traffic doors that lead to the kitchen. The menu above the register gives me the same issues as the sign out front. The letters swim, and I can’t tell if this is a deli, a sandwich shop, or a pizza parlor. All I glean is the delivery fee: +$2.50 for every ten miles outside of the regular delivery zone. 

The phone’s sudden shrill ringing sends jolts of nostalgia through me. With hardly a glance around, yet brimming with hesitation, I stride towards the phone and answer it with a confused, “Hello?” Not my phone, not my problem, so why did I answer it?

There’s no voice on the other end, no breathing either. No tone, or buzz, just a sucking silence that makes my ear ache from where I’ve pressed it against the receiver. My mind goes blank. My eyes stop seeing. The cells that make up my body seem to stretch as though moving ahead without me. Time ceases, granting me a small sampling of infinity. 

**Welcome,** the dark and terrible emptiness says without saying. **When the kitchen bell rings, a delivery is ready. Do not look inside the bag. Deliver to the address printed on the receipt. Ignore all handwritten notes you may see. Return promptly. Remain in the lobby. Do not enter the kitchen. Questions?**

Just one.

“What do we deliver?” I ask, my tongue numb.

Nothing but static comes over the line.

My senses come back to me as I hang up the phone without meaning to, but the message is clear; I’m hired. If I had a dad, I bet he’d be proud. Heart full of sunshine, I do a little happy dance across the lobby. Behind the cash wrap, I find an ancient-looking broom and a banged up silver dust pan. Instead of leaning, I get to cleaning.

I’m still grinning from ear to ear when the kitchen bell rings for the first time. I gently place the broom against the wall, and dump the dustpan on the way to the bathroom to wash my hands. “Be right back!” I say as I grab the handles of an unassuming brown paper bag that reeks of copper. The weight of it surprises me and I grunt as I heave and move towards the door. As I hoist it, the contents wiggle, almost like half frozen jello. There’s also a strange heat radiating from it that warms my fingers where they’re wrapped around the little twisted paper handles. *What kind of food is this?* I think, but I don’t peek and, you know what, I definitely won’t yuck someone’s yum, so I turn my thoughts to my guessing what part of town I’ll end up in.

In my car, I turn on the passenger seat warmer so the package doesn’t get cold during the drive. Then I squawk along with the radio and gently drum on my steering wheel until I pull into the parking lot of an apartment complex. As I remove my seatbelt, I glance down at the receipt and see the zero dollar tip in the bottom corner. \*Ah, bummer,\* I think, my lips pulling to one side in displeasure. Then I remember the hourly wage and my mood is cheerful once more. \*If no one ever tips me, I’ll be a-okay with that.\* I grin to myself. The sun has long since set, but the breeze is still warm and the moon is bright enough to guide my way. The delivery note on the receipt says to bring it to the leasing office, which is easy enough to find. It’s the big brick building at the forefront of the complex with the big wooden sign that reads ‘LEASING OFFICE’.

The massive double doors open to a spacious lobby decorated in various shades of coffee and beige. The clacking of mechanical keyboards draws my attention to the right side of the room. Centered perfectly is a massive white desk, framed by two towering iron lamps. Sitting at that desk are three women who look almost exactly the same. From their hair color and style, to their makeup, to their clothes, they’re identical, with only a single difference between them. Never once do their heads lift, nor do their eyes drift from their screens.

On the left is an older woman. Elderly, certainly, but not at all frail. On the right, a woman in her fifties. She sits tall as she types. In the center, a young woman. Somewhere between sixteen and twenty-five depending on how frequently I blink. There’s a strange sort of pressure behind my eyes as I step forward with the delivery, and for a second my vision blurs. The three women merge into one, and again, just for a second, the world changes. I step foot into a cave a hundred miles above a craggy shoreline. Sea salt and brine fill my nostrils and behind the merged woman is a massive loom where a brightly colored tapestry lay half-finished. Then my vision clears and the three women have their own bodies, and the package in my hand weighs so much that my arm trembles to keep it upright. Sweat pours down my temples. I have to focus on my breathing to avoid throwing up.

The young woman in the middle, still without ever raising her gaze to meet my own, reaches out a single hand to take the delivery. Eagerly, I pass it over the computer monitor. She takes the heft of the package with ease and hands it to the woman on her right. The woman on her right then reaches underneath her desk and extracts a large yellow umbrella. The umbrella moves from the woman on the right to the woman in the middle, who then passes it to me. “Oh,” I say, and glance over my shoulder to gauge the weather, “I don’t think I’ll need that. The forecast said no rain all week.”

The elderly woman speaks, startling me as honestly I’d forgotten about her entirely. “Take it.” She intones, pecking at her keyboard one finger at a time. Maybe I’m still overwhelmed by the image of the cave, or maybe it’s the aura of authority that radiates from her, but I don’t argue any further. I take the umbrella and stagger out of the leasing office. The double door's slam suit behind me; the sound of the wood crashing together makes me flinch. I clutch the umbrella in my hand and take a second to gather myself. Upon my first steady inhale, the sky opens. Rain pours from clouds that snuck up on me, and the temperature drops so suddenly all the heat from my body seems to be sucked away with a single gust of wind. The only bit of heat comes from the fingers that held the delivery, so I press them to my throat and savor the warmth. With my other hand, I pop the button on the umbrella and let it spring open. With the big yellow shield above my head, I race to my car.

Back at the shop, the rain continues. In fact, it’s coming down even harder than before. For a brief minute, I consider sitting in the parking lot outside the alley until the rain passes, but the list of rules I was given thirty minutes ago remind me that I’m not to dilly-dally on delivery, so I brave the rain once more. Honestly, the umbrella is perfect, but when I close it to bring it inside the shop, the kitchen erupts into deafening chaos. Thunderous clangs of metal hitting metal, the impact of which is so strong it dents the grate that hides the kitchen from view.

A warbling wail that makes my stomach turn with dread. I drop the umbrella to clap my hands over my ears. The second I let go, the umbrella goes flying outside the building as though kicked, and the door slams shut behind it. Silence descends upon me, and cautiously my hands fall from their protective position. I watch the yellow umbrella spin down the alley until it disappears from sight. “Sorry.” I say as I turn towards the kitchen. Something tugs my gaze upwards, and I spot a small sign above the menu. It’s a white circle about the size of my face, with a yellow umbrella printed on it, and a big red circle with a line through it, indicating that the item is banned from the premises. “Oh, sorry.” I say again, “I didn’t see that. No umbrellas, got it.”

Out of guilt for pissing off my new employer on my first day, I find cleaning sprays and gloves, and get to work scrubbing the backsplash below the kitchen window. The noises in the kitchen taper off, and eventually the only sound in the shop is the *scritch-scritch-scritch* of my scouring pad against the tiles, and the rain hammering against the pavement outside. That’s how I pass the rest of my shift, and by the time four a.m rolls around, I’ve done a single delivery all day. As I gather my belongings, the phone rings. The receiver is in my hands before I can blink, “Hello.” I state.

**Good work today,** the dark and terrible emptiness says without saying. **Leave your paperwork on the counter. Payday is every Tuesday. Your check will be in the register. See you tomorrow.** Then I’m out the door, having successfully completed my first day of work. As tired as I am, I can’t help but have a spring in my step. This job, while confusing and stressful at times, feels like a good fit for me. I pull my keys out of my pocket as I exit the alley and turn into the parking lot, where a rubber-duck-yellow umbrella rests on the hood of my car.",3,1752630330.0,creepcast,0,0.71,False

I think there's a lot that's wrong with the way we live.

 It's not that cities are inherently bad, or that processed food shouldn't exist, or even that smartphones are harmful - it's just that everything in life now revolves around HAVING stuff and DOING anything costs money USING technology, and if you're missing any of these things, then...yeah! You're going to be depressed, because you're deprived of a lot of what life has to offer!

I think a lot of what people consider depression is really caused by this feeling of incompleteness. Not having enough money to enjoy yourself or quel your worries about day to day survival sucks. You can't go out with friends, treat food as something to enjoy, purchase entertainment, or do anything leisurely. 

Given the money and the time, most people have at least some idea about how they want to spend it and what would make them feel a bit better. But there's only so much you can do on a limited budget, when all of your waking consciousness is consumed by worries about how to pay for your right to exist.

It's just...really frustrating and hurtful when people say stuff really matter-of-factly, like oh, you should take care of yourself! Get regular exercise! Sleep 8 hours a day! Partake in hobbies that bring you joy!

None of that is FREE! A lot of enjoyment comes from choice, and if I can't make choices without feeling immense guilt for not being ""pragmatic,"" then I might as well not have any decision-making power. 

Even if I can technically afford it, it's not like I can just throw down $7 for a coffee to brighten my morning or $30 for a museum. The guilt eats away at whatever little pleasure might be left from those experiences.

I get walking in parks and going to the library is free, and that you can cook inexpensive meals that still taste good, but being limited to those options sucks.

I just want to be able to enjoy things I am deserving of without guilt. I'm depressed because I can't, not because I have a low self-esteem or for lack of ""trying"" to improve my situation. I'm just stuck and it really sucks.",1,1752630067.0,depression_help,1,1.0,False

1m0zy5p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0zy5p,LATAM Signature Lounge SCL - Quite impressive,"I had the chance to check the LATAM's Signature Lounge in Santiago while flying back on a DL operated flight in Delta One

The Delta App actually invited all D1, Platinum and Diamond (forgot if 360 were invited) to check in via the Signature check-in salon at Gate 6 and visit the signature Lounge.

The check-in area was empty and with three LATAM and one Delta employees. They invite me to sit down and asked if I wanted a coffee or water. The check-in was very smooth and very comfortable. Although I never flown La Première with Air France, but it had that sense of luxury.

You do not get priority security at SCL.

The lounge is separated into three areas:

* Worldmember for LATAM credit card holders - No Delta flyer presence it seems
* Premium for LATAM elites or premium economy cabins etc... - Delta Gold medallion
* Signature for LATAM higher elites or business cabin - Delta Platinum and Diamond

The desk agent informed me that this was the biggest lounge complex in South America. This is not surprising as LATAM's HQ is in Santiago. They are also opening more lounges like in Lima.

The lounge is beautiful. I have yet to visit a D1 Lounge, but this LATAM lounge is vast and the architecture of the bar area is phenomenal. Showers are offered and lie down rest areas as well. In terms of food and drinks, there was the usual bar, great Chilean wine, roasted beef, baked salmon, ice cream; it is ok in terms of food.

The space was empty and very quiet. It feels like a mix of D1 experience with a normal Skyclub feel. It is only missing restaurant style dining.

Still, the experience was very good and it is good to see LATAM invest more on its hard products. This will make the Delta-LATAM experience even better.",10,1752629742.0,delta,2,0.92,False
1m0zwxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnOfTheHollow/comments/1m0zwxa/the_night_hiker/,The Night Hiker,"I’ve always loved hiking at night. There’s something about the quiet, the way the forest feels alive in a way it doesn’t during the day. My favorite trail was a six-mile loop through the state park near my house, a place I’d hiked a hundred times. I knew every twist, every root, every overlook. So when I set out that October night with my headlamp and a thermos of coffee, I wasn’t worried about getting lost. I just wanted to clear my head after a rough week at work.
The trail was empty, which wasn’t unusual for a weeknight. The air was crisp, the kind of cold that makes your breath visible. My boots crunched on the gravel path as I climbed the first ridge, the beam of my headlamp cutting through the darkness. About a mile in, I heard footsteps behind me. Not loud, but distinct…crunch, crunch, crunch, matching my pace. I stopped, thinking it was another hiker, maybe someone without a light. The footsteps stopped too. I called out, but no one answered. I figured it was an echo or maybe a deer moving through the brush.
I kept going, but the footsteps started again, closer now. I turned around, shining my light into the trees. Nothing. Just shadows and the faint rustle of leaves. My heart was beating faster, but I told myself it was my imagination. I’d been stressed, working long hours, maybe even a little paranoid. I picked up my pace, focusing on the trail ahead.
At the halfway point, there’s a small clearing with a bench overlooking the valley. I stopped to catch my breath and take a sip of coffee. That’s when I saw the light. A faint glow, bobbing in the distance, like another headlamp. It was moving along the trail, coming my way. I felt a wave of relief—another hiker, someone to share the trail with. I waved my light, expecting them to wave back. The light stopped moving. Then it went out.
I froze. The forest was silent, no crickets, no wind, just my own breathing. I called out again, my voice shaking a little. No response. I started walking again, faster now, checking over my shoulder every few steps. The footsteps were back, closer than ever, but I couldn’t see anyone. My headlamp flickered, which it had never done before. I smacked it, thinking the battery was loose, but it went out completely. I was in total darkness.
I fumbled for my phone, using its weak flashlight to light the path. The footsteps were relentless now, right behind me, but every time I turned, there was nothing. I started running, tripping over roots, my breath hitching in my chest. The trail seemed wrong, like it was stretching out longer than it should. Landmarks I knew…a split oak, a rock shaped like a heart…were gone. It was like the forest was rearranging itself.
I don’t know how long I ran, but I finally saw the trailhead parking lot through the trees. My car was there, the only one in the lot. I sprinted to it, locking the doors the second I got inside. I turned on the headlights, expecting to see someone standing there, but the trail was empty. I drove home, hands shaking on the wheel, checking my rearview mirror the whole way.
When I got home, I checked my phone. The timestamp on a photo I’d taken at the start of the hike said 10:17 p.m. But my car’s clock said it was 4:42 a.m. I’d lost over six hours. I went back to the trailhead the next day, in broad daylight, to see if I’d missed something. My thermos was there, right where I’d stopped in the clearing, but the bench was gone. Not broken or moved…gone, like it had never existed. I asked a ranger about it, and he said there’d never been a bench on that trail. I haven’t hiked since. Sometimes, when I’m falling asleep, I hear those footsteps again, crunching just outside my window. I keep my curtains closed now, but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever was on that trail followed me home.",1,1752629639.0,DawnOfTheHollow,2,1.0,False

1m0zs1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1m0zs1c/can_i_ask_her_to_move_out/,Can I ask her to move out?,"I’ve been living with my current roommate for almost a year now, and we still have one more year left on our lease. The truth is, I really don’t like living with her, and I don’t want her to renew the lease or stay once it’s up.

We met a few times before she moved in, just dinner and coffee, and she seemed nice and pretty normal. I even did a bit of due diligence: Googled her, checked her Instagram and LinkedIn. There were no red flags. She moved into my apartment in the spring, and everything seemed fine at first.

Things started going downhill by September. I had made it clear from the start that I like to keep the apartment clean. It’s NYC, 600 square feet, and you really have to be mindful. I mentioned that I do a quick clean midweek and a deeper clean on Sundays, and that I try not to leave dishes in the sink. At first, she seemed to respect that, but slowly she started leaving dishes and food out. We ended up with a cockroach, and when I suggested we both make an effort to clean up right away, she sent a long, defensive text blaming the landlord and saying she wouldn’t change anything. It was frustrating, especially because this was my space and I had been upfront about my expectations before she moved in.

Then there were smaller things that piled up. She had a friend visit, and afterward, I noticed my wine glasses were missing. When I asked, she casually told me they broke but she’d been too busy studying to let me know. I replaced them myself and asked her to just give me a heads-up in the future if anything breaks.

The messiness continued. She left food and dirty dishes out regularly, and when I politely brought it up, she accused me of being passive aggressive. Around exam time, she started waking up at 5 a.m. to study, which I understand, but she was extremely loud. When I asked her to be a little quieter in the mornings, she was again very rude.

I went away over Christmas for three weeks, and when I came back, a swing-arm lamp of mine was snapped. She claimed it must have just been cheap or old. Another time I was walking around and felt something gritty on the floor. I said it felt like sand, and only then did she say, “Oh yeah, I spilled bread crumbs earlier” and hadn’t cleaned them up.

But the final straw was when she broke a Ralph Lauren barrel vase I own, worth $900 and gifted to me. It had been stored under the kitchen table because it’s quite tall and there wasn’t a better spot. She texted me a photo and apologized, but it took her over a month to replace it. I followed up twice during that time, and she accused me of harassing her, saying of course she would replace it and that she had so much going on. When I tried to be helpful and suggested she could just send me the money and I’d order it, she responded with “Jesus Christ” and sent a long, angry message saying things like “if it’s so important to you, why is it under the table collecting dust?”

Eventually, she did replace the vase, though it’s smaller and not quite the same, but I’ve been pretty cold toward her since. I’m polite, but I’ve stopped trying to engage. I don’t like how she treats me. She’s been unkind, messy, and dismissive. It’s especially frustrating because she moved into my apartment, where I’ve lived for two years. I own all the furniture outside of her bedroom, and I genuinely love the space and the location.

She does pay slightly more rent because she has the larger room, but I’m the original tenant and this feels like my home. I want her to move out when the lease ends.

Can I ask her to move out come next lease cycle? How should I go about it?",3,1752629249.0,roommates,1,0.81,False

I don’t read auras. I’ve never sagged a room. My crystals are actually just decorative rocks from IKEA.

But about 3 months ago, I was at a block party and slightly tipsy off sangria when my neighbor’s cat, Waffles, came and sat directly on my feet. She looked me dead in the eye like we were about to swap souls.

I jokingly said, “Waffles wants you to know she’s mad you switched her food. She misses the tuna.”

My neighbor gasped. **Because she HAD just switched Waffles to chicken kibble that same week.**

Everyone laughed. I laughed. We all moved on.

Or so I thought.

The next week, another neighbor knocks on my door with a small dog and says, “Could you… maybe try reading Baxter? He’s been acting weird.”  
I thought they were kidding.

They were not.

So I looked into Baxter’s eyes, panicked slightly, and said, “He misses the dog park. He thinks the backyard is boring.” (This felt like a safe bet. Dogs usually like parks.)

Cue gasp. Apparently, this family had stopped taking him because “he didn’t seem interested anymore.”

**Now it’s a THING.**

People bring me their cats, dogs, one guy even brought his parrot (named Kevin) who I swear gave me the dirtiest look a bird can give. I said Kevin wanted “more crackers and less judgment.” Nailed it. Kevin squawked like I’d unlocked something ancient.

I haven’t paid for a cup of coffee in my neighborhood in weeks. But the pressure is growing. I’m running out of generic pet advice. Last night, someone asked me if I could “channel the emotional trauma” of their bearded dragon.

I am **not qualified** for this. I work in IT. The closest I’ve come to psychic abilities is predicting when the printer will jam.

But I can’t stop now. I’ve created a monster. Or rather, a network of emotionally validated pets and their very convinced owners.
