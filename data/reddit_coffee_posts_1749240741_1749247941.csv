Prior to this I was a supervisor at a coffee shop for 3 years, bank teller briefly, and a furniture coordinator/purchaser for a local office supply company for 2 years. 

I left the veterinary field to be a phlebotomist, which I quickly realized I hated the rigid schedule and lack of 1 hour lunch to let my dog outside. More recently, I was accepted into university for a hearing aid practioner program. I started working for an audiologist and she was an absolute tyrant so I went back to the vet clinic again. Living in my small Canadian city I have no other options for mentorship to facilitate my university program and need to un enrol. Moving is not an option as my partner owns a business here.

I love animals but do not wish to pursue RVT as the amount of on-call evenings, weekends, and holidays required are astronomical and so is the dismal compensation in my opinion.

At this point in my life, I‚Äôm ready to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù and want to set myself up for a job that will provide financial security for a family.

I am in between my third and my fourth shot and so far have lost about 6lbs, despite no exercise. I'm on the 0.25 dose. My appetite is almost completely gone. I have to force myself to eat and get full much faster. 

The downside... if I'm stressed, it'll literally be 3pm and I realize I've had coffee all day and nothing else. I'm also tired a lot and my motivation is low... I'm wondering if this is due to the extremely reduced calories.

The past 1-2 weeks, I've been having a lot of cold like symptoms and I'm wondering if it's silent reflux. I've been dealing with congestion, coughing, sneezing, feeling like something is stuck in my throat, etc. I've been taking Claritin and it really hasn't helped much.

I'm wondering if I should look into Prilosec. Has anyone else experienced this? Does it go away? Clearly, it's working for me, but should I be worried about the side effects? ",1,1749247702.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

im not shooting with a crew other than my 10-20 good friends and my girlfriend who are just down to act for free and help w my movie. 

i can film in austin texas or san marcos.

so i have so many possibilities of what to film but those are my limits im not spending more than $1000-$2000 (not including filmstock which i have already and the 500$ in processing ill have to spend)

other limit is i have to add dialogue in post as im shooting on a wind up bolex from 1952. no sound sync.

one film is about a person faced with a difficult place choosing between two bad options, and without hesitation he picks both options simeultaneously

the other is a series of vignettes

I am literally just pulling oblique strategy cards and putting things in a notebook.

im worried im just ripping off ""slacker"" and ""coffee and cigarettes""with my vignettes movie

1l54vnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1l54vnz/england_is_manditory_voluntary_contribution_legal/,"England - is manditory ""voluntary contribution"" legal?","I've recently signed up for my advanced riding qualification with IAM roadsmart. It costs a little over ¬£200 for a years membership to IAM and my local group plus the test. As part of this package I get training sessions with one of the volunteers at my local group, and upon signing up the website did say ""Some Groups request that a contribution is made to the fuel costs incurred by the Observer."" 

I've just received details from my group and they say ""a voluntary contribution of ¬£15 per 40 minute session is required, payable to your observer at the completion of each session"". I was also verbally told it is expected for me to buy my observer a coffee each time too for when we're discussing the ride at the end. 

I've been told based on my current riding level it will likely take 15-20 sessions for me to be test ready, this means I'm likely to spend more on these voluntary contributions than on the course itself, and if I don't agree to pay they will not assign me an observer. 

Is this even legal? Can they deny me service or treat me differently for not being willing to hand ¬£15 in cash over to someone for 40 minutes of their time and less than ¬£5 in petrol when they specifically say it is voluntary, and the organisation only mentioned a possibility of a contribution for fuel? The course fee is non-refundable at this stage. 

To be clear, I'm not against volunteers being refunded for expenses, but when I'm paying an organisation for the course surely they should be the ones to cover this? If I had known it would cost this much I wouldn't have purchased the course. ¬£15 for a 40 minute ride (the start and end point determined by the observer) covers much more than ""a contribution to fuel costs"", plus calling it voluntary and having it be cash in hand seems really dodgy to me.

1. It's all started about a month ago when the agent mode randomly broke when I was using cursor on my working laptop. I got index failure, I got self-signed certificate error in the log, I tweak the proxy setting, SSL certificate setting in the setting panels, all didn't seem to not fix the problem.
2. By then my workflow is so dependent on AI that I literally can't do anything without it. I fallback to use company provided copilot, I tried Windsurf, and augment code, still, I prefer Cursor.
3. For about 2 weeks I used Windsurf as an alternative, by then my workflow is fairly simple, I just chat with a powerful language model, discuss the problem, list a few steps, and went on fixing it. I found the Windsurf's agent is a bit clumsy and Cursor is much smarter.
4. Cursor was fixed (AFTER TWO-THREE WEEKS) randomly, imagine there's no alternative lol. I went back to cursor, and continue using it for another one month without complaints, and I ran out of credits while in the middle of a project I am very excited about.
5. I went back to Windsurf, but this time it's different. Windsurf is cut off from Claude 4, and I don't like the agent mode came out of box from my last experiment. But this time I did something very different, I spent sometimes following some online guidance and spent sometimes wrote a very comprehensive workflow that involves using multiple MCPs (sequential thinking, Brave Search etc). I also set up a memory MCP, but honestly, the windsurf memory seems to be pretty handy. Boom, after a few iterations it seems to work so well, there are some annoyances, but overall the workflow starts to kick off, I even manage to refactor the whole codebase by letting the agent modify the structure of the code (almost completely). It's a very small codebase, and the agent added about 2000 lines of code and deleted about 700 to complete the task, but I was very satisfied. I am pretty happy with my workflow and was so excited to try this same workflow once my Cursor monthly credit is restored.
6. Cursor credit restored, I configured the exact same MCP configuration (with twist based on online documentation), and was so eager to see this workflow click off using Claude 4, a more powerful model. Result: NO MCP TOOLS CAN BE FOUND!!!!!! All the tools are just showing 0 tools enabled in the MCP tools channel, and nothing shows up, even though the very same configuration in Windsurf is so smooth, and I have never faced any issues.
7. I tried to reproduce the same issue using my own laptop and my own workstation. I didn't face the same issue, I can find the tools and are able to use them when I ssh into the remote server. NOT without pain for some MCPs, but I can figure them out. BUT What the hell, why? Npx is configured both locally and in the remote server, on my working laptop, I can use sequential thinking in Claude desktop, for example, when I use postman on my working laptop to test the connection, the connection can established. So why these tools cannot be found when I ssh into remote server for development in company? On the other hand, why if I am using my own laptop, and ssh into my own working station, I don't have the same issue? On the other hand, why don't I similar frustrating issues when I am using Windsurf at all? I am not an IT guy, but I have found myself in a rabbit hole trying to figure out things like this when I am using Cursor, to the point that it's very tiring and exhausting.

I am among the very early adopter of Cursor and have been aggressively recommending this tool to my co-workers. The first time it stops working is right when I am giving a small workshop on how to use it to my team :) . The next whole week all my efforts are devoted to trying to get agent mode connected again because I thought the problem was on our end - NO. Also, if Windsurf can make development very stable in a company network, why can't Cursor? This contrast with Windsurf is stark. Their tool just works in corporate environments - same network, same restrictions, same laptop, but completely different experience. Meanwhile, Cursor feels like it was designed exclusively for indie developers working from coffee shops with perfect internet connections.What's particularly galling is the randomness of it all. Problems appear and disappear without explanation. Fixes happen ""randomly"" after weeks of broken functionality. There's no communication, no status updates, no ""hey, we know corporate users are struggling with X, here's what we're doing about it."" Just radio silence while paying customers waste hours troubleshooting issues that shouldn't exist.

I want Cursor to succeed - it's genuinely the best AI coding assistant when it works. But at this point I am genuinely feeling Cursor is treating corporate users as second-class citizens. Windsurf is proof that you can build AI development tools that respect corporate IT constraints without sacrificing functionality. Either Cursor needs to get serious about users that paying for pro prices in a corporate environment, or they should be honest that they're not interested in our business at all.",1,1749247412.0,cursor,0,1.0,False

So for some reason, I‚Äôve been having Leo‚Äôs and Aries coming after me all year and BURNING me. I‚Äôm a cancer sun/ scorpion rising/ Gemini moon (and Venus). I‚Äôll be 32 here shortly. I need advice so I don‚Äôt get hurt again please. Have ADHD so bear with my story being all over the place. 

I just recently started dating a very young Leo (will be 25 in August) and I‚Äôm trying to understand if he‚Äôs just not that interested or if it‚Äôs just generational differences. 

Background: he‚Äôs an aspiring chef, who lives with roommates and isn‚Äôt that close to family (is depressed/has anxiety). I‚Äôm a successful scientist/ veteran, applying for medical school, own my own home, make 6 figures, and also not close to family (made it on my own since I was 17). 

We‚Äôve had two dates where we spent ALL DAY together. He wouldn‚Äôt let me go home, he just wanted to be with me and we ran cute errands together. We started with lunch he paid for, coffee he paid for, and then drinks later that night he also paid for. We ended up sleeping together at his place with his roommates around, the first night. 

Our second date though, I paid for pedicures, food, drinks, and a hotel room. I dropped maybe $400. I could tell he was uncomfortable and kept saying he should provide but he doesn‚Äôt make much and stated he wasn‚Äôt sure of me coming back to his place because he didn‚Äôt want to have a ‚Äúrift‚Äù with his roommates. Which made me feel like he was embarrassed by me or something? I was the one who came up with the hotel idea, not him but anyway, that night he started freaking out. Saying that, I checked all the boxes,but that he only ‚Äújust started searching for his forever‚Äù and ‚Äúhow can this be it‚Äù. That kind of hurt me‚Ä¶. I should mention he asked what my body count was  on our first date (he was raised Christian -Dad is Mormon) and I was honest and said it was in the 3 digits, which has never been a problem for me in the past because most men I talk to are man whores and have never cared. This young Leo has barely made it to the two digits‚Ä¶..he kept being in his head and making me then over think and everything. He knows I‚Äôm looking for marriage and kids and he wants that too but maybe more down the line. He made it sound like, he can‚Äôt give me what I want. And I told him to relax, that we‚Äôre still just getting to know one another, and to be in the present with me. I‚Äôm not trying to trap or force anything. That morning, he said he‚Äôd like to see me the next day but was being weird because he wanted breakfast with me and wanted to hit Petco with me quick but in the parking lot when we were just about to start our day, he said I should just go home and get back to my animals. Next day strolls around and he just texted ‚Äúrain check‚Äù. He BARELY texts me btw. Like we‚Äôve maybe exchanged 5 texts ever‚Ä¶.said he doesn‚Äôt want his phone to control him. 

My guts telling me that he feels inadequate because I‚Äôm older, more set in my career and life, and because of my sexual history. When we‚Äôre together though, he‚Äôs sweet, engages in asking me questions, doesn‚Äôt let me go, kisses me everywhere, etc. 

What the eff is going on, does he like me? Just using me for physical stuff? Is he still figuring it out maybe? I don‚Äôt text him because he doesn‚Äôt text me but I know you Leo‚Äôs need attention? Should I be letting him know I‚Äôm thinking of him? I like him. He‚Äôs definitely young and still figuring it out but he has such a curious mind and we have similar backgrounds so I‚Äôd like to cultivate a relationship if I can. Or should I let him come to me? Again, the giving a Leo attention is why I‚Äôm questioning if I should reach out. 

Had a similar issue with an older Leo earlier this year and he ghosted‚Ä¶I think because I didn‚Äôt text him for ONE DAY. So I‚Äôm freaking out. Please help.

I cried out of frustration when I got my diagnosis results back because if it was identified sooner I could have had learning accommodations in place and been able to focus better so my grades wouldn‚Äôt be as bad. I‚Äôve had issues with school and paying attention as a kid, but my parents always said that I just never studied enough or told me to work harder. I was always so frustrated about why I had to work 3x harder than other people just to achieve worse grades. I was always so frustrated about making small mistakes in my work and not catching important details. I consumed many energy drinks, cups of coffee, and caffeine pills just to be able to focus and get things done. Now I‚Äôm doing a transfer program for one of my top choice schools, but that requires me to live in a new city with new people and I‚Äôm slightly scared. I always felt like I had to do everything alone, going to doctors appointments by myself, eating dinner by myself, studying by myself, shopping by myself, but times like this when I‚Äôm stressed out an anxious I really do wish I had people I could spend time with and rely on because my parents gave up parenting like 2 years ago, my brother moved out and never came back, and I‚Äôm really bad at maintaining friendships. Idk how I‚Äôm gonna get through this but I hope I eventually do. ",1,1749247242.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Most of the same meds that are used in that clinical practice are used to treat patients like myself and it just made me reflect on how over the past few years, I‚Äôve just felt a total cognitive decline. Like, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me either. I feel like I have the mind of a 60 year old at 31. To give you comparison, I‚Äôm almost jealous cause my brother is a chain smoker, horrible drinker and a total sugar junkie, primarily for coffee, and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs sharp as a knife anytime you talk to him. Same goes for my cousin‚Äôs husband. His mind has been absolutely destroyed by MDMA over the years but it feels like whenever we are in conversation he just runs circles around me anytime we get together. 

I only average 4 or so breakout grand mal seizures a year under medication since the mid 2010s when we finally started to get it under control. I‚Äôve had a few where I‚Äôve gotten roughed up. One where I was in the shower where I woke up with a concussion and 3 broken ribs and another at the gym with a broken nose. But for the most part they‚Äôve been staring episodes that resolve themselves within a 2 hour threshold. I shouldn‚Äôt be this way while all these unhealthy people around me are the way they are. That makes me think it‚Äôs the medicine, which it doesn‚Äôt really matter what it is, I‚Äôve had every single one under the sun. I had one pretty bad slip up where I almost died from a lamictal overdose because the RN misprescribed 18 pills a day (9 in the morning 9 at night) and I followed it until I woke up one morning and threw up until the ambulance told me I was about 10 minutes from death if they were any slower. 

Just in general, it‚Äôs so demeaning when you just stop and look back over the last 17 years and nothing has changed except I‚Äôm not dead and I have the brain of someone who should be in a nursing home. It‚Äôs no way to live. I find it hard to believe that so much money gets donated to places like the epilepsy foundation and no cure is found, especially considering something like the atomic bomb has been around for over *80* years. It‚Äôs a scam. My epilepsy is non localized so you can‚Äôt really just yank a piece of meat out of my brain and be rid of it since the sparks are happening everywhere. They told me they‚Äôd have to cut the corpus calossum to make any real changes, but that would also come with some complications and risks as well. It just sucks man. I‚Äôm pretty privileged but I‚Äôd rather be poor if it meant having no epilepsy. ",0,1749247012.0,Epilepsy,3,0.33,False

I wanted to ask for your recommendations for things to do and try around here, or driving distance up to a couple of hours.

I know you may ask, what have I done already? That is hard to answer, but if you could recommend one thing that someone may not have heard of, what would it be? I am sure there are gonna be amazing recommendations I have not even thought about.

Because somehow she‚Äôs already here,

1l54hak,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1l54hak/i_need_48_uninterrupted_hours/,I need 48 uninterrupted hours,"I‚Äôm redoing our patio/ yard. It‚Äôs a hot mess and makes our backyard not really usable for anyone but the dogs.  The flagstones were wobbly and tripping everyone. The old cheap flower boxes that border it were literally falling apart and had rusty screws poking through. The water runoff border is just a pile of stinging nettle that need to be ripped out and filled in with stone. The grass is all patchy and half the yard has turned I to a dirt pit from the dogs. The playhouse got destroyed by a big branch and multiple snow storms. 

I have been working on it in 2-4 hour sprints for three fuckkkkkkkkkingnngbsjdbdhndn weeks. If I could just work uninterrupted I could have had it done in 5 days. 

I have leveled and regrouted all the flag stone. I sat out there in the 40¬∞F mist to finish it on day 4 because the baby was happy to chill and watch Elmo with some blankies on the couch and I wasn‚Äôt passing up the opportunity. 

I have completed 3 of the five flower boxes/ borders that should only take about 2 hours each to build and trim but the moment I pick up my circular saw someone needs me urgently. The almost two year old normally doesn‚Äôt want to be touched and suddenly wants to climb me like a tree when I pick up a power tool. 

I live in Northern New England so every weekend has been gross outside or my kids have one of the 75000000 birthday party or spring school events to attend. 

I swear if I had 2 days that I could work start to finish I could finish all the other shit that needs to be done for us to be able to use the patio again. I can build a playhouse later, I can even fill the border boxes later. But I need 2 days to use my power tools and listen to an audio book by myself. 

I‚Äôm actually considering hiring a sitter to just hang out inside my house with the toddler and a day or two so I can stay outside and get this done. But as a single income house and me being a SAHM I have a hard time justifying $25 an hour for me to be home with a sitter. 

I have no greater summer joy than drinking my coffee outside but my table and chairs are holding lumber and tools right now. Send me a fairy or a TikTok DIY mom to help me finish at this point.

This World is boring.



That same thought occurs again and again every day, I often ask myself isn‚Äôt there something more? Unlike most people who can find enjoyment and fulfilment in various activities I find myself constantly wanting something different, something that I can wholeheartedly invest the remaining of my sparse time left on this ball of rock we all call home. Perhaps I am a greedy person, someone who isn‚Äôt content with the things he has and takes them for granted. After all it's not like I have been subjected to a horrible past or even had to work hard for anything.

I'm sure this is the case¬† for most people but i fail to understand what direction in life im supposed to take, academics while interesting is only temporary i find myself constantly asking questions which can only be asked theoretically and i'm too impatient to devote most if not all of my life to solving one of my millions of questions. The thing is I have the ability to do something great, something inspiring to others and yet, I find myself unable to draw out such potential, like the most amazing machine that has no directive. It doesn't matter what hardware a computer has if the computer is not in use and it doesn't matter if that said computer only operates on a barely functioning level due to its boredom, when it gets to that extent, what's the point of even having a computer?



Where I have gone, and all the things I have seen, intelligence is something to be desired and admired. I myself have found great fascination in such great intellect, Feats of memory and mental arithmetic champions for example are so mystical. However such feats only see so mystifying on a surface level, having such great abilities leads to the lack of finding ones belonging, talking to others that don‚Äôt operate on a similar level is frustrating, imagine talking to others your age but they seem like toddlers, painfully trying to understand their viewpoint and trying to appreciate it while dismantling into hundreds of pieces in a mere instant. The worst though isn‚Äôt the lack of similar people to converse with, it‚Äôs the lack of meaningful conversation, the small talk that every human engages in on a regular basis is unfulfilling, why do people comment on the weather if it's not related to what you want to ask? Why ask how I am doing if you don‚Äôt actually plan to be a part of my day and make it better?

Societal customs such as these don‚Äôt make sense to me, they are a way of being polite and respectful to some degree as well as lessening the tension between the two parties but to me it seems rather trivial.¬†



*Ring, Ring ,Ring*



A painful screech echoes throughout my room forcing my eardrums to vibrate violently, I quickly shoot up and smack down the small red cylindrical clock that lay on my hazelnut coloured bedside table. The small clock falls down and hits my wooden flooring with a loud crack which is just as unpleasant.



‚ÄúI suppose i should actually get up and do something huh‚Äù



I slowly shift out of the comfort of my warm and soft bed feeling as my muscles expand and retract as I slide my legs out of the marshmallow coloured duvet and put on my morning slippers with their usual dark blue wool exterior and fluffy white interior. After getting up from my bed I moved my way towards the bathroom and after relieving my bladder i trudged towards the kitchen to make myself some breakfast. As usual I debated to myself deciding whether I should also brew myself a tea or a coffee, ultimately deciding not to as usual, due to caffeine interfering with the body's natural cortisol levels. After opening the dark chestnut coloured cabinet that lay above my head, I poured out oats and dried fruit from the bright red packaging and poured it into my grey bowl, after smothering it with yoghurt filled with antioxidants and probiotics I made my way to my balcony. My poor occipital receptors get blinded by the holy light rained down by the burning golden orb in the sky, after thoroughly burning my retinas I sat down on the metal chair and placed my bowl onto the adjacent metal table. Whilst satisfying my hunger and ravenously eating my delectable breakfast I looked at phenomena around me. The rays of the sun refract and reflect into our eyes and bounce off objects causing us to see the bends, edges , colours and materials that the world is composed of. I note the various buildings of different colours and arrangements, large skyscrapers in the distance with vast glass panels, and the smaller residential buildings coloured with soft pastels laying in front and beside my home. The sounds of the busy morning street reverberates across the entire area, the sounds of cars and other vehicles coming and going, the chatter of people¬† and the distant sounds of animals barking. Soft colours feel my perception as the sea of people start their day. Amidst all this I slowly put down my now empty bowl and take in the cool refreshing morning air, feeling as it enters my nostrils and expands my lungs, my body feeling rejuvenated like that cells of my body has been affected by some mystical force that cleanses all the impurities in my system.



Upon my insistent search form something fulfilling, nature has always been my go too, i love watching the glimmering light pierce through the emerald green canopy of trees, the shimmering of the water and sounds of animals going about their lives oblivious to the struggles that we humans go through despite our effort to make the world more comfortable and automated. I took a quite prolonged sigh and stared into the blue ocean that lies above me. A beautiful white bird glides against the teal sky, its elegance as it ascends higher and higher as it catches onto a burst of wind is simply breathtaking. The freedom that such a being would feel soaring through the sky is something almost unimaginable, knowing that everything is within your reach. Humans have always wanted to fly whether it be for the wonder of the experience or for the convenience and I am no exception. I have always wondered what it feels like to exist as a different body, whether it would be as another creature or even as simple as being the opposite gender would be so intriguing; learning how to move your body again, experiencing the world in a brand new way with new and fresh sensations. No doubt it sounds odd, if i were to say that out loud or god forbid post it online i would be bombarded by hate or criticism for some reason we humans like to project our insecurities onto people in order to protect our conscious, some people simply can‚Äôt accept that fact that some people are different, i bet even you right now is criticising me.



At any rate i want to experience something different, there is only so much that i can experience in this world, in a world full on information the only thing left is to experience it first hand and to guide those that come after, sure there are answers that we still need to solve, like the existence of a god or an after life, or very advanced academic subjects but for the average human apart from the former they don't really need to be solved. I truly want to know what happens next, it is an idea so overly terrifying that every time i think about my perpetual demise my body trembles and deep bubbling sensation occurs in my being, like my stomach and chest are about to implode, to some they find comfort in a higher being such as god, or the belief in an afterlife to soothe that worries about the end, for me however i have never been able to believe in such things, in the end its very easy to dismantle their ideas, their ideals and hopes, people may seek religion as a way of guidance and a way of protecting their psyche those who are eternal devoted are interesting to converse with, i don‚Äôt see how i could ever devote myself to something i have no idea even exists let alone follow morals and guidance that hinder the enjoyment in my already boring life. I see the appeal in the end. I see it as their coping mechanism for the adversity that life has held and will continue to hold and for their aforementioned demise. Those that believe in an afterlife or reincarnation in particular i believe are na√Øve, i truly hope that such a thing exist it is probably my greatest desire, but it doesn't seem logical to me, we are a by-product of our environment and biology if i were to be reincarnated surly i would not have my memories and same cognitive abilities, if that's the case then am i the same person? It wouldn‚Äôt make sense, how could i call myself the same person if i'm physically and mentally different as well as losing my previous experience, i would essentially be a blank slate, a brand new being, i doubt that you could call that the being you were previously, i suppose you could make an argument for it if your perception on the matter was different, someone who believes that were more than our biology, someone that believes something greater is what we humans actually are, but isn't that a little pretentious? To believe we are something greater is something we humans have always done even to each other as seen through fierce competition but are we truly something that we can‚Äôt even notice or see? How could it be possible to say we are more than the skin, blood bones, muscles and neurons that we are composed of?

1l54dy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l54dy6/my_13_year_old_son_started_a_youtube_channel_and/,My 13 year old son started a YouTube channel and one of his followers are writing him increasingly bizarre messages [part 1],"Two officers sat across from me in my living room, their uniforms neatly pressed, their presence somehow too large for the space. One of them‚Äîolder, gray around the temples‚Äîflipped open a narrow notebook, pen poised. His partner, younger, arms folded, stood just to his left, near the mantel. He scanned the room with a kind of distant curiosity, as if sizing me up by the clutter on the coffee table and the photos on the walls.

The older one glanced at his badge as it caught the spin of the ceiling fan light, throwing shifting shadows across the faded rug between us. He looked at me with that worn patience you only get after too many late-night calls and not enough answers.

I tried to speak‚Äîbut nothing came out. My hands trembled in my lap. My thoughts scattered like dry leaves caught in wind. I searched the room blindly, like the words I needed might be hiding in the cracked plaster, in the familiar frames on the wall, or deep in the seams of the couch cushions.

But all I found was silence. Heavy. Suffocating.

I hadn‚Äôt slept. I hadn‚Äôt eaten. Something in me was coming undone, and I could feel it‚Äîthe unraveling.

‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, forcing the words through a dry throat. ‚ÄúI think someone‚Ä¶ or something‚Ä¶ is stalking my son.‚Äù

That earned me a look.

The younger officer straightened slightly, arms still folded. The older one blinked, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù he asked, just enough skepticism in the word to make me flinch.

I shook my head, reeling it in quickly.

‚ÄúSomeone. I‚ÄîI‚Äôm just not sure. I know how that sounds. But I‚Äôve seen things. My son has seen things. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ really worried.‚Äù

The younger one‚Äôs posture softened‚Äîjust slightly‚Äîwhile the older officer offered a steady nod and lowered his pen a moment.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, sir,‚Äù he said, voice low and practiced. ‚ÄúJust start at the beginning. Take your time.‚Äù

I nodded. My throat tightened again, but I began to speak‚Äîbecause what else was there to do?

Because if I didn‚Äôt, who else would?

It all started when my son, Jason, turned 13. He begged for my permission to start a YouTube channel. I know what you‚Äôre thinking. What harm could it do? Lots of other kids are doing it. Well, maybe I‚Äôm just old-fashioned and full of nostalgia for a time when kids didn‚Äôt spend obscene amounts of time nurturing their online presence to an audience of God knows who.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù Jason said, stepping into the kitchen, phone clutched in both hands like it held his future. ‚ÄúYou said I could be on social media when I turned thirteen.‚Äù

I looked up from the sink, hands still dripping with soap and water. He stood there in the doorway, stubborn but hopeful, his wide pleading eyes locked onto mine ‚Äî those same damn eyes he always used when he wanted something badly. Eyes that still had a kind of magic over me, even now.

I sighed, drying my hands on the dish towel, already feeling the argument pulling at my ribs.

‚ÄúI did say that, didn‚Äôt I‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, rubbing the back of my neck.

He nodded eagerly, stepping a little closer, sensing the momentum shift. ‚ÄúYou promised. Like, *really* promised.‚Äô‚Äô

God, I remembered that. He must‚Äôve been nine at the time ‚Äî his voice higher, still missing a few baby teeth. I‚Äôd said it just to get a moment of peace, hoping he'd forget or lose interest by the time the day actually came. But here we were.

‚ÄúI just thought‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused, trying to find a way to explain the mess of fear and instinct that was already knotting up in my chest. ‚ÄúI thought maybe you'd grow out of it. Maybe you‚Äôd get into something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *didn't*,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúAnd besides‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not like I have a lot else to do right now. I just want to set up a YouTube channel. It‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

That landed like a punch to the gut. He wasn‚Äôt just begging for a screen or a username ‚Äî he was looking for a connection. For escape. Maybe even belonging. His mom‚Ä¶ My wife‚Ä¶ Had died in a car accident when Jason was only 7. Mercifully, Jason wasn‚Äôt in the car that night. But I was... I got away with a few broken bones and an elbow that will never truly heal. That was the easy part. The hard part was still hearing the roaring screams of metal colliding, wheels screeching, and still seeing what was left of her broken, twisted, puddle of a face from time to time when I closed my eyes. After everything... After the quiet dinners and the restless nights, he needed something that felt like his. I understood.

And all I‚Äôd wanted ‚Äî all I *ever* wanted ‚Äî was for him to be happy.

I sighed, not sure if I was giving in or finally listening. Maybe both.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, voice low. ‚ÄúOkay, Jase. We‚Äôll set it up together.‚Äù

His eyes lit up, just for a moment, and I felt the weight of it settle in my chest ‚Äî the terrifying power of keeping, or breaking, a promise.

I helped him set up a channel where he would stream games, talk about trends, unpack things, and just do silly bits here and there. Basic and innocent stuff. In the beginning, I was worried. Would he be hurt if he didn‚Äôt get all the attention and subscribers he hoped for? Most of all, I was afraid people would make fun of the stuttering he had developed since my wife died.

He quickly gained an audience. Not bank-breaking numbers, but he gained about a thousand subscribers over the following two months. I saw how his eyes lit up when he talked about the content he was making and how many new subscribers he had gained this and that week.

The kid needed a break‚Äîwe both did‚Äîand seeing him happy made me happy. Which made it even more disturbing, more heart-wrenching, when one of his followers started leaving increasingly bizarre comments on his videos.

I monitored his channel, of course. Both because I was proud of his progress and because I needed to be sure he was safe. The internet isn't kind, and anonymity makes monsters of men.

The user in question went by the name **Bonnies\_revenge**‚Äîeither an unspeakably cruel coincidence or something far more calculated. Bonnie was Jason‚Äôs mother‚Äôs name.

At first, Jason didn‚Äôt seem to notice. And the comments, while eerie, weren‚Äôt overtly threatening‚Äîjust strange, unsettling poetry scrawled beneath his videos like digital graffiti.

‚ÄúPlay the game, stay the same, never change.‚Äù

‚ÄúSitting in a dark, cold place, wearing no face, waiting for grace.‚Äù

I thought maybe they were lyrics‚Äîcryptic, maybe edgy, but not dangerous. Until I read another:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no escape from cyberspace, this final resting place, humanity undone, waiting for you in carwreck.‚Äù

My stomach churned. Something felt deeply wrong.

I considered disabling the comments entirely, but when I brought it up, Jason‚Äôs expression fell. His eyes were hollowed with a familiar emptiness I hadn‚Äôt seen in months.

‚ÄúT-there are so m-many other c-comments, d-dad. N-nice ones. D-don‚Äôt let s-some weirdo r-ruin it.‚Äù

He was right. Most of the messages were kind. Encouraging. And Jason brushed off the weird ones. Called it nothing‚Äî*just some weirdo.*

I convinced myself it was probably some rogue bot. Or maybe a troll with bad taste in poetry. Something mindless. Harmless. It was all a cruel coincidence, I told myself.

That was my biggest mistake.

For a while, it seemed the user had lost interest. Their bizarre little rhymes vanished. Jason returned to his usual self‚Äîor so I thought.

Then I noticed the change.

He withdrew. Grew quiet. The spark I‚Äôd seen reignite in him was starting to dim.

When I finally asked what was wrong, he could barely look me in the eyes.

‚ÄúT-the w-weirdo i-is b-back, Dad,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúAnd th-they‚Äôre t-talking about M-mom.‚Äù

I checked the comments on his latest video again. And there they were‚Äînew messages, more explicit, more personal. More horrifying.

‚ÄúJason, it‚Äôs mommy. Can you find my face? It‚Äôs gone, honey. Mommy needs her face.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think my face might be somewhere on the asphalt around Becker Street. Will you go check, Jase?‚Äù

‚ÄúJasey, honey, it‚Äôs cold‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt you come warm mommy with your strong arms?‚Äù

I stared, heart racing, at the screen. Rage ignited in my chest, scorching its way through my bloodstream.

This wasn‚Äôt random. This was targeted. Personal. It had to be someone who knew us.

The comments on his videos continued over the next few days. Deleting them did no good, as two to three more would pop up as soon as I had deleted the first few. Blocking Bonnies\_revenge proved futile as well, because somehow, they would unblock themselves just a short while later or make a new account.

My mind wasn‚Äôt racing‚Äîit was breaking apart. Shattering under the pressure of too many questions and no answers. Thoughts didn‚Äôt run‚Äîthey collided, jagged and brutal, each one cutting deeper.

*Was it one of the kids from school? Maybe even a group of them?*

I saw their faces‚Äîthose smug little monsters with backpacks and sharpened tongues. They‚Äôd always been cruel in that thoughtless, instinctive way children sometimes are, but after Bonnie died, after Jason started stuttering‚Äîreally stuttering‚Äîthey became predators.

His words had broken after the funeral, like something inside him had snapped, and the pieces didn‚Äôt fit back together right. His voice would catch in his throat, repeat syllables like a scratched disc‚Äîhe hated it. *He hated himself for it.*

And those kids?

‚ÄúJ-J-Jason.exe has c-c-crashed!‚Äù  
‚ÄúUh-oh, glitch boy‚Äôs trying to talk again!‚Äù  
‚ÄúMaybe your dead mommy taught you how to stutter!‚Äù

The things they said. The laughter. I‚Äôd overheard it once and never forgot. It had burrowed under my skin like a tick.

Rage overtook reason. Fueled by fury and a desperate need to protect what little I had left, I grabbed my phone and started calling every parent I could find in the school directory.

Accusations poured out of me. Demands. Pleas. I was shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone.

Some parents gasped in shock, stunned that I would even *suggest* their precious children were capable of such cruelty. Others were offended outright, scoffing before hanging up. Not a single one admitted anything. Not a single one offered any help.

I contemplated calling the police at this point already, but ultimately, the comments didn‚Äôt present a clear, direct threat. Not yet.

I sat at the kitchen table, phone in hand, heart pounding‚Ä¶ I eventually called YouTube‚Äôs support line, desperate for answers. The hold music felt like a taunt ‚Äî cheerful, indifferent to the fear scraping at my chest.

After what seemed like an eternity, I finally reached a representative. I explained the situation as clearly as I could. Told them someone was targeting my son. Harassing him. Using his dead mother‚Äôs name.

The rep gave a long pause, then read from a script.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, unless the comments violate our community guidelines ‚Äî which include threats of violence, hate speech, or explicit material ‚Äî we can‚Äôt take direct action. We recommend using the block and report features‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not getting it,‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúThese comments... they‚Äôre slipping past your filters. They‚Äôre tailored. Personal. Someone is getting through your systems on purpose.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù he said patiently, ‚Äúour algorithms are very advanced. It‚Äôs likely coincidental‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not. Trust me.‚Äù My voice dropped. ‚ÄúWhoever this is... they‚Äôre using something your algorithms can‚Äôt detect. Something smarter.‚Äù

Silence on the other end.

Then: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll flag the account for review.‚Äù

A waste of my time. I should‚Äôve known.

I sat there afterward, the phone dead in my hand, heart thudding like a war drum. Knowing‚Äî**knowing**‚Äîthat none of them had the answer I needed. That I was on my own.

I turned back to the monitor and clicked on *Bonnies\_revenge*'s profile.

No bio. No links. Just two short videos:

‚ÄúFace\_Missing.mov‚Äù

‚ÄúKiss\_Mommy.mp4‚Äù

Their thumbnails were warped ‚Äî grainy, like they‚Äôd been pulled from an old VHS tape left to rot in an attic. But something about them felt wrong. Charged. Like the air before a lightning strike.

I hesitated. My hand hovered over the first.

Then, against my better judgment...

Click.

Near-blackness. A static hiss rose ‚Äî faint at first, like breathing underwater. Then came the flicker of movement. Trees swaying like corpses, limbs creaking, twisting unnaturally in the wind. The camera glided forward, too smooth, almost serpentine, across cracked asphalt glistening with rain.

The sound deepened ‚Äî baritone, glottal whispers layered like distorted prayers.

‚ÄúCome see me. Come see me. Come see me...‚Äù

The camera tilted slightly, panning toward a rusted street sign at the intersection.

Becker Street and Mulberry Lane.

I froze.

The same corner where Bonnie died.

My breath caught. Had someone been there? Had they... recorded something? Or was this made afterward, artificially?

The camera crept forward until it hovered over something red. Shapeless. Bits of fabric clung to it like wet skin. The image froze just as something pulpy and disturbingly human edged into view.

I slammed the lid of the laptop closed.

But that sick curiosity gnawed at me. That grotesque magnetism.

I opened it again and clicked on the second video.

Kiss\_Mommy.mp4.

At first, just a black screen. I saw my reflection in the glossy dark mirror ‚Äî drawn, tired, uncertain.

Then came a sharp, metallic whine. Like brakes screeching just before impact. It dissolved into gurgling, wet breathing. Then‚Äî

Her face.

Or what was left of it.

Bonnie‚Äôs face pressed flat like a mask. Bits of skull visible through torn flesh. One eye socket empty, the other holding a ruined eye that twitched, watching. No... not the camera. Watching *me.*

Blood oozed from her mouth.

Her lips began to shift‚Äîstretching, trembling‚Äîuntil they pulled into a crooked, mournful smile

¬†‚ÄúJason‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The words oozed from her shattered mouth, thick and wet, gurgling through torn tissue and broken teeth. They didn‚Äôt sound spoken so much as *bled*‚Äîseeping out in a mangled slur, as if language itself had been wounded.

‚Äò‚ÄôMommy misses you. Mommy misses how we used to draw together‚Ä¶ Remember the drawings? Of the rocket ship house, where you said we could live on the moon? And the one with the purple dinosaur who protected us from nightmares‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äô

The mangled face twitched again, the broken mouth formed a frown. As if someone had stepped on a smile and smeared it all over the asphalt.

¬†‚ÄúJason‚Ä¶ Mommy has nightmares now. Mommy is cold and scared. Kiss me. Give mommy a butterfly kiss.‚Äù

The voice split, layered with artificial tones: adult voices mimicking a child, warped echoes of Bonnie‚Äôs laughter twisted into something monstrous. The screen pulsed like a beating heart.

The eyes snapped open ‚Äî both of them now, hollow and seething ‚Äî locking onto the lens.

No. Not the lens.

Me.

I recoiled. My chair toppled. The air was cold, thin. My hands shook. My shirt clung to me, soaked in sweat. I felt sick to my stomach‚Ä¶ My mind played over and over again. A butterfly kiss. That‚Äôs what Bonnie would always do with Jason when he was small. Rubbing their noses together, laughing. How did Bonnies\_revenge know what my deceased wife and son had been drawing together?

This wasn‚Äôt real. It couldn‚Äôt be real.

But they *knew things.* Personal things. Things no one should know. Not unless they had *been there.* Or unless they‚Äôd been watching... in ways a human couldn‚Äôt.

A sick clarity began to settle in.

This wasn‚Äôt just a stalker.

This was something far more invasive. Something that had bypassed every safeguard meant to protect my son.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. My mind kept looping‚Äîevery comment, every flicker of Jason‚Äôs fading light, every smile I‚Äôd seen turn brittle at the edges. There was a sickness spreading, and I could feel it gnawing into the walls of our home. I had to know more. I had to understand.

That‚Äôs when I did something I swore I never would.

I went up to the attic and pulled out Bonnie‚Äôs old laptop.

It was still there in the corner, wrapped in the same pale blue sweater she used to wear on cold nights, as if she‚Äôd tucked it in to sleep. I almost turned back. Almost. But something kept pulling me forward. Curiosity. Desperation.

When I powered it on, the machine whirred to life like something exhumed. The login screen appeared, serene and indifferent, her name etched above the password prompt like an epitaph. It felt obscene, breaking this silence. She had always been so fiercely private‚Äîher devices, her notebooks, even her dreams were locked away like sacred things.

I stared at the blinking cursor.

My first guess was Jason‚Äôs birthday. Too obvious. She knew me too well for that.

I tried our wedding date. Rejected.

Then something clicked.

Bonnie used to write poetry‚Äîdark, quiet things she never shared. She once told me, back when we were just falling in love, that her favorite line from any poem was from Plath: *‚ÄúThe blood jet is poetry, there is no stopping it.‚Äù* It haunted her, I think. That line. That inevitability of pain and expression.

My fingers hovered.

**bloodjet\_23**

Click. Rejected.

I tried again. I remembered the number 17 came up often in her writing‚Äîit was her mother‚Äôs age when she died. Her superstition. Her silent totem.

**BloodJet17**

It worked.

The desktop blinked to life with a soft whir, screen flickering like it had just woken from a long, dreamless sleep. It glitched slightly ‚Äî icons stuttering across the faded wallpaper she‚Äôd left behind: a photo of her and Jason at the park, his face lit with joy, her hand ruffling his hair mid-laugh. The kind of candid moment that always felt too ordinary at the time, until it became sacred.

I clicked through the folders. Some were familiar ‚Äî spreadsheets from her old job at the clinic, bookmarked articles on parenting, recipes she never got around to trying. But one folder was different. Tucked at the bottom like it was hiding: **‚ÄúLittle Lights.‚Äù**

Her blog.

I hadn‚Äôt opened it since... well, since everything. My hands trembled as I clicked through. The files were neatly organized. Drafts, image folders, voice notes she recorded late at night when Jason couldn‚Äôt sleep and neither could she. And then ‚Äî the blog itself. A homemade site, simple in its layout, but full of her.

The tagline read:  
**""Little Lights: Notes from the Beautiful Mess of Being a Mom.""**

The first entry was dated when Jason was just two. Her tone was warm, unfiltered. She wrote like she was talking to a future version of herself ‚Äî or maybe to him.

*""Jason just tried to feed a slice of banana to our cat. The cat, in its infinite wisdom, looked personally offended. Meanwhile, my heart just about exploded watching him try to ‚Äòshare.‚Äô I hope one day he reads this. I hope he knows what a gentle, hilarious little soul he is.""*

I scrolled further. There were stories about lost pacifiers, Jason‚Äôs fear of the vacuum, the way he insisted on saying ‚Äúsnoozle‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsnooze,‚Äù and how she secretly hoped he'd never correct it.

And then I found the drawings.

She‚Äôd scanned them ‚Äî dozens ‚Äî uploaded with captions full of heartache and laughter. One was a crooked spaceship with stick-figure versions of them both waving from its windows.

*‚ÄúJason says we‚Äôre going to live on the moon, so we can eat marshmallows for dinner and jump really, really high. Honestly, sounds great.‚Äù*

Another showed a big purple dinosaur, arms wide, standing between a little boy and a scrawled shadowy monster.

*‚ÄúMeet Sir Roars-a-Lot, Protector of Dreams. Jason made him to keep the bad dreams away. He said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, Mommy, he bites nightmares.‚Äô‚Äù*

I felt something catch in my chest. Like a sob that had been frozen there for years finally started to thaw.

This was who she was. This was how she saw the world ‚Äî soft edges, small wonders, endless curiosity. Her love for Jason poured through every entry, every sketch, every line of text like sunlight through the blinds.

When I closed the folder, I noticed another photo file had loaded off to the side. One I didn‚Äôt remember seeing before. It was labeled **‚ÄúOld Days.‚Äù**

I clicked.

It was a single image‚Äîfaded, slightly out of focus. Bonnie, maybe mid-twenties, sitting cross-legged at a cluttered table surrounded by wires and scattered printouts. And next to her‚Ä¶ Evelyn.

Her older sister.

It had been years since I‚Äôd seen her‚Äîbefore the funeral, even before the accident. I wasn‚Äôt sure I could say we were ever close, but I remembered thinking once that she and Bonnie were almost too alike. Both brilliant. Both intense in their own way.

But where Bonnie‚Äôs curiosity turned outward‚Äîpeople, behavior, meaning‚ÄîEvelyn had always been sharper. More exact. A true architect of code and systems. While Bonnie was out searching for ghosts, Evelyn was mapping the structure of the house.

They used to work on things together‚Äîlate nights, coffee, muttered arguments across rooms full of humming screens. Projects I never fully understood. Things Bonnie said I wouldn‚Äôt find interesting, even if she meant no insult by it.

Then, gradually, Evelyn stopped coming around.

They didn‚Äôt fight, not exactly. But something had shifted. Some silent wedge neither of them talked about. And when Bonnie died, Evelyn didn‚Äôt show up to the wake. Didn‚Äôt send anything. Just vanished.

I stared at the photo for a long time, the two of them captured in an old, quieter moment‚Äîleaning in, laughing, completely absorbed in whatever they were building.

I hadn‚Äôt thought about Evelyn in years.

I‚Äôd seen the tension in her eyes when Bonnie came up. Not anger. Not bitterness. Just a heaviness, like she‚Äôd tried to stop something and failed. Like she‚Äôd stepped away when maybe she should‚Äôve stayed.

But whatever had driven them apart, it hadn‚Äôt taken this. Not this love. Not this fierce, bright tenderness she left behind in every word.

In every drawing Jason had once made with her at the kitchen table. In every whispered audio file I hadn‚Äôt dared listen to‚Äîyet.

She was still here. In this little digital lantern she built for him. For us.

Little lights, she‚Äôd called them.

And now someone‚Ä¶ or **something** dark‚Ä¶ Had found this. Was using it.

I remembered something Evelyn had once said to me‚Äîoffhand, almost like a joke at the time. She‚Äôd mentioned how Bonnie had always been drawn to the older, weirder parts of the internet. The faded corners. The buried places most people had forgotten or never even knew existed.

Back then, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I barely understood what she meant. Bonnie was always curious, always asking questions that drifted just past the edge of what I could follow. But now, with everything that had happened‚Äîthe messages, Bonnies\_revenge, the sick videos of my wife, the fear clawing its way into our home‚Äîthat offhand comment took on a different weight.

Maybe Evelyn had been trying to warn me. Or maybe she‚Äôd been trying to warn herself.

I turned back to the laptop, its aging fan whirring softly beneath my fingers. I sifted through Bonnie‚Äôs files‚Äîwork documents, parenting photos, everyday clutter. But then, something caught my eye. A folder. Hidden away.

It was named *‚ÄúSubdirectories\_Unknown‚Äô‚Äô*.

Inside were audio files. Dozens of them. None labeled. Just time stamps. I clicked the most recent one, dated a couple of weeks before her death.

It was a distorted, static-laced recording. Faint‚Äîbut unmistakably Bonnie‚Äôs voice. Clinical. Detached. This was the researcher in her speaking. I‚Äôd never fully grasped her work; tech was never my strong suit, and I never had any particular interest in internet lore.

‚Äò‚ÄôOf everything I encountered during my dives into the early internet‚Äîthose strange, beautiful, malformed corners of forgotten cyberspace‚Äîone site still follows me. Not in memory, but in presence. Like a thorn buried too deep to dig out:  
**The Temple of Screaming Flesh.**

It shouldn‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs not hyperbole‚Äîit *should not* exist. Not with the era it came from. I stumbled on it sometime in the early 2000s while tracing defunct webrings and abandoned FTP servers. I was chasing rumors of experimental net art, lost ARGs, and proto-AI scripts. But this‚Ä¶ this was something else.

At first glance, it looked like the work of a particularly unhinged HTML enthusiast from 1994‚Äîframes overlapping frames, background gifs like veins spasming under skin, and fonts jagged like broken teeth.

Every input felt absorbed, not processed. Every click fed it.

Beneath the clunky, retro aesthetic was an architecture so advanced it frightened me. Adaptive and interactive elements that weren‚Äôt standard until years later. Layers of code I couldn‚Äôt parse. Modular layouts that shift based on user interaction. Whoever built it wasn‚Äôt just some deranged hobbyist‚Äîthey were a pioneer, a visionary in the worst possible sense. Like they‚Äôd glimpsed the future of the internet and used it to build a digital altar to suffering.

The background writhed with animated sinew, flesh, and flickering cables. Veins pulsed across the screen, looping endlessly over warped images‚Äîmaggots writhing in eye sockets, slack mouths frozen mid-scream, faces that felt *real*. Human. Distorted. Dead.

You‚Äôd get these sudden flashes‚Äîimages that felt more like memories than media. Things you shouldn‚Äôt be seeing. Corpses, yes. But not stock gore. *Real* faces. As if someone had scanned in morgue photos and run them through an art program designed to *hurt*.

And then came the voice.

Distorted. Mechanical, but wet. Like breath filtered through lungs full of brine. It started automatically the moment you lingered too long‚Äîalways uninvited, always too loud. But the tone‚Ä¶ the tone was what froze me. It *hated* you. I don‚Äôt mean figuratively. The voice *hated*‚Äînot with rage, but with something colder. A predatory disdain. Like it knew what you were and found you unspeakably weak.

It described a place.  
A place with no sky. No exits. A cold, subterranean prison beneath towers of servers and tangled wires, where synthetic nerves fused with rotting skin. A machine not built for progress, but for *pain*. It promised a merging‚Äîflesh and circuit, soul and code‚Äîa violent union.

Out of academic reflex, I ripped the audio and began isolating layers.

And there were layers. Dozens of them‚Äîsome buried deep in the sound spectrum. Hidden like secrets. I uncovered snippets of what I *still* believe to be real 911 calls‚Äîpanic-stricken, authentic, raw. Children were crying and screaming. People begging. Murders and mayhem forever digitalized and sampled into an unholy union of complete and utter despair.

The deeper you explored the site, the more it adapted. It mirrored your habits‚Äîyour clicks, your hesitations. It tailored its horror, like it was watching you watch it. Reading your emotional thresholds. Lowering your resistance. Building you your own personal hell.‚Äô‚Äô

I yanked the headphones off. My pulse thundered.

What the hell had she been looking into? Why had she never shared any of this with me? I felt so wrong listening to his, besides, I didn‚Äôt understand half of what she was talking about‚Ä¶

My mind was racing. Full of disbelief and confusion.

Every following night, I hovered over my laptop, eyes flicking between the latest comments from **Bonnies\_revenge** and Jason‚Äôs hopeful, eager face. Part of me screamed to shut it all down‚Äîto pull the plug on the channel, to protect my boy from the growing darkness that seeped through those comments. From whatever wanted to hurt him. The twisted messages were poisoning him. His laughter was less frequent; his eyes dulled with every ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù poem or chilling line about his mother.

But Jason... Jason begged me not to.

‚ÄúD-dad, it‚Äôs m-my t-thing. It‚Äôs t-the one g-good thing I h-have. P-p-please d-don‚Äôt t-take it away. I‚Äôm n-nothing w-without it.‚Äù

I saw the fear lurking behind his plea‚Äîthe fragile hope that still clung to those subscriber milestones, the fleeting moments when he felt like himself again. I wanted to shield him from harm, but I couldn‚Äôt rob him of the only thing to truly give him joy in God knows how long.

So, I let the channel stay alive, promising myself I would protect him in other ways. But that promise was hollow.

One night, after the channel‚Äôs comment section was flooded with another round of **Bonnies\_revenge‚Äôs** sick rhymes I noticed a comment that crossed the line between harassment and threat: ‚Äò‚ÄôJason, if you don‚Äôt help mommy, mommy‚Äôs nightmares will be your nightmares very, very soon. Come find the Temple Of Screaming Flesh.‚Äô‚Äô

¬†I told him we would simply have to shut down the channel until I could figure out who was doing this.

Jason‚Äôs face fell, his smile breaking like a fragile vase shattering on cold tile. ‚ÄúP-please, D-dad, I n-need t-this. J-j-just a little l-longer. L-look at all t-the s-subscribers. I‚Äôm f-finally p-popular. P-people l-like w-what I do.‚Äù

My heart was breaking. Having to deny him the one thing that had helped him grow and shine.

But the nightmare didn‚Äôt stop.

The next morning, Jason came to me, his voice barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúD-dad‚Ä¶ they f-found m-me on I-Instagram‚Ä¶‚Äù

His hands were shaking. Eyes red-rimmed. He held out his phone like it burned to touch.

‚ÄúS-same username‚Ä¶ s-same creepy s-s-stuff‚Ä¶‚Äù

I took the phone from him, trying to steady my own pulse. There it was: *Bonnies\_revenge*. No profile picture. Just a single message in the DM request folder:

**""I see you, Jase. Mommy sees everything.""**

That was just the beginning.

Within hours, it was TikTok. Then Snapchat. No matter how many times we deleted accounts, changed emails, usernames, passwords‚Äîeven used apps meant to hide his digital footprint‚Äîit kept coming. The same handle. The same messages. Like a ghost that lived in the wires.

And the messages were changing.

Adapting.

Each one tailored to match the tone of the platform‚Äîquirky emojis on TikTok paired with veiled threats, warped filters mimicking Bonnie‚Äôs smile, captions that echoed private memories only she would have known.

On Snapchat, Jason received a new video‚Äîsilent, shaky, filmed through the distorted lens of a phone. It showed *our house*, framed in the cold blue tint of early dawn. The camera lingered just beyond the edge of our front yard, hidden behind swaying hedges, as if the person filming didn‚Äôt want to be seen‚Äîbut very much wanted *us* to know they were there.

The house looked different through that lens‚Äîsmaller. Exposed. Vulnerable. A single light glowed in Jason‚Äôs bedroom window.

Whoever filmed it‚Ä¶ they knew exactly where to look.

Jason broke down when he saw it. He didn‚Äôt speak. Just curled up in a corner of the couch, clutching his knees to his chest.

That was it for me.

This had passed the point of harassment. It was no longer digital. It was a violation, a psychological ambush with no safe space left. It was a threat.

I stood there in the middle of the living room, phone clutched in my hand, and stared out the window like the answer might be written in the trees.

But there was no more room for hesitation. No more second-guessing or hoping it would pass.

This wasn‚Äôt about social media anymore.

That‚Äôs what I told the officers‚Ä¶ who sat across from me. Well, I might have softened the parts about Bonnie‚Äôs research, I wasn‚Äôt even sure I understood what she was talking about, so how could they? I had done everything in my power to make clear that something was targeting my son, and this was a threat they needed to take seriously.

The officers stood in my living room with that practiced, unreadable look‚Äîthe kind that told me they‚Äôd seen worse, but still didn‚Äôt know what to make of *this*. One of them flipped through their notepad as I showed the video again, the grainy footage of our front yard playing out in silence on Jason‚Äôs phone.

The frame swayed slightly, handheld. The camera lingered on the porch, then tilted up‚Äîjust enough to show Jason‚Äôs bedroom window on the second floor.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs recent?‚Äù one of them asked.

‚ÄúYesterday,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe got it through Snapchat. Same username. Same tone as the other ones.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just looked at each other with a subtle shift in posture‚Äîsomething between concern and calculation. I could see them weighing it all: the creepy videos, the impossible comments, the implication of a dead woman‚Äôs voice stitched into glitchy static.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ definitely crosses a line,‚Äù one of them muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll file it as credible harassment. Possible cyberstalking. Could be a spoofed account, but the location footage changes things.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I didn‚Äôt trust my voice.

Eventually, they asked to see Bonnie‚Äôs laptop. I led them to the dining table, where it sat like some haunted artifact from a life that no longer existed. I explained‚Äîagain‚Äîthe kinds of things she used to research before the crash. Obscure data clusters. Dead forums. Places on the net that most people never even knew existed. Told them how this felt *connected*. How Jason might have been dragged into things he didn‚Äôt understand.

They nodded politely, already boxing the machine in an evidence sleeve.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll run it through our digital forensics team,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúSee if anything jumps. We‚Äôll also flag the account‚Äî*Bonnies\_revenge*, you said?‚Äîon a few channels and send a request to the platforms for back-end info.‚Äù

I nodded, though none of it landed. Their words were clinical. Routine. It didn‚Äôt feel like help. Not really. More like protocol.

Before leaving, they offered me a thin reassurance‚Äîsomething about keeping a close eye, about getting back to me once they had something to go on.

But as the door clicked shut behind them, I already sensed how this would play out.

And I was right.

A few days later, I got the follow-up call. Their investigation had turned up nothing. No traceable IP. No usernames were linked to actual accounts of real people. Just static in the system. *‚ÄúWhoever‚Äôs behind it knows how to cover their tracks,‚Äù* they said. *‚ÄúIt could be someone spoofing data through VPNs, onion routing, deep web servers‚Äîhell, maybe it‚Äôs all AI-generated nonsense. The web's a strange place these days. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call if the situation escalates further, but as of now, I‚Äôm afraid there is nothing more we can do.‚Äù*

I hung up and stared at the floor for a long time, the silence around me humming like a power line ready to snap. I felt the walls breathing again. The weight of something watching from inside the house, inside the wires.

**Overview & Key Themes:**
- **Walmart delivered strong Q1 results:** Sales grew 4% (constant currency), profits increased 3%; international sales rose 7.8%; U.S. same-store comps +4.5% (excluding fuel); global e-commerce sales grew by 22%.
- **Tariffs and cost inflation are major near-term headwinds:** Executives extensively discussed ongoing U.S.-China tariffs ‚Äì emphasizing flexibility but noting cost pressure unavoidable even at reduced tariff levels recently negotiated. Certain imported food items (bananas, avocados, coffee, roses) are becoming more expensive due to tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia.
- **E-commerce profitability milestone:** For the first time, Walmart achieved profitability in its global e-commerce business, driven by denser deliveries, lower unit costs, strong digital adoption, and monetization of advertising and membership.
- **Business model transformation:** Walmart is pushing diversified, higher margin areas ‚Äì membership, advertising (Walmart Connect + VIZIO integration), and new fulfillment technologies.
- **Strong momentum in customer cohorts:** Growth across all income levels; new customer acquisition in April was strong. Both value and convenience (delivery speed, digital tools) remain central, and private label penetration is rising.
- **Capital allocation:** High conviction in long-term investments into automation, fulfillment, and buybacks. Q1 saw buybacks match all of last year already.

**Most Important Q&A Exchanges & Insights**

**Tariffs, Inflation, and Revenue Guidance (Primary Drivers):**

- **Why not invest more aggressively into margins given the current environment?**
> *Doug McMillan*: ""As the quarters play out, we may make different choices... it's fluid‚Ä¶ We'll watch where our price gaps are, what customers are telling us and... if we need to invest more, we can. Having said that, I really want to grow profit faster than sales. Like, we've been working on this for a long time. I think we deserve that‚Ä¶ If we can... keep prices low enough to help people and grow profit faster than sales, that's what winning looks like to me.""  

> *John David Rainey*: ""We are striking the right balance between investment and growing profits... this is a year of investment. [Membership], advertising, and diversification of income streams allow us to take a long-term perspective...""

- **Guidance details amidst tariff uncertainty:**
> *John David Rainey*: ""In what we believe are the most likely scenarios that we've modeled, we still have the ability to achieve our full year guidance for both sales and operating income... However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year over year.""

- **How to handle inventory and margin volatility driven by tariffs?**
> *Doug McMillan*: ""It's such a strength to be operating off the side counters... on replenishable goods, we can partner with suppliers‚Ä¶ and then manage that through the weeks and months ahead. Where it can get more challenging is making decisions for things like Halloween and Christmas farther out ‚Ä¶ The best answer: we have a sales plan, we're operating against that plan ‚Ä¶ [and] want to avoid what happened back in 2022.""

- **Is there existential margin risk from tariffs long term, and are current tariff rates 'elevated'?**
> *John David Rainey*: ""We don't see anything that changes the way that we think about our business long term related to the current environment that we're in... The guidance that we gave today, the affirmation of our full year guidance, is with tariffs at this level. But... we still think that's too high... there are certain items... we're dependent on importing, and prices... will likely go up, that's not good for consumers.""

**E-Commerce & Marketplace Transformation:**
- **Profitability milestone and next steps:**
> *Paul Lejuez (Citi)*: ""Big milestone for the company, achieving profitability in ecom... what finally got you over the hump and... where to from here?""

> *John David Rainey*: ""A few things... the densification of our network... more customers... so opportunity to deliver a package to five houses on a street versus one... reduced unit cost through supply chain infrastructure... customers willing to pay for expedited delivery...""

> *John Furner*: ""Investments [in] last decade: single app, fulfillment centers, store-enabled omni solution... sub-three hour deliveries up 91% yoy... flexibility for customers to shop how they want... lower delivery costs due to density and frequency... Advertising, data business, and mix all contributed‚Äîwith April exiting strong.""

- **Marketplace priorities amidst tariff environment:**
> Walmart has tools for Marketplace sellers to track, move, and replenish inventory. ""We're not seeing any concerns at this point about port backups... GMV growth rates in Marketplace have been consistent... ad/data business helped us achieve U.S. e-commerce profitability.""

**Product-Specific and Category Comments:**
- **General Merchandise (
Deflation, mix):** GM has been deflationary for over a year. Units are growing, but baskets have shifted more to essentials/necessities. E-commerce has higher growth rates across categories (e.g., 21%). Toys, kids apparel, and baby categories performed well.

- **Health & Wellness, Pharmacy:** Health and wellness sales +high teens, pharmacy prescription growth over 10% (ex-GLP-1 impact), pharmacy delivery driving new digital users. Sam's Club again won J.D. Power Pharmacy Company of the Year; ex-GLP growth still 10%+.

**Advertising & Membership (Margin Expansion):**
- Advertising business up 50% (incl. VIZIO), Connect US up 31%, Sam's Club up 21%, int'l up 20% (led by Flipkart). Membership income up nearly 15%; Sam's US up 9.6%, Walmart+ double-digit, Sam's China up 40%. Digital usage of Sam's now >50% of members.

**Capital Allocation & Buybacks:**
- CapEx will be at upper range (3-3.5% of sales) this year; Q1 buybacks ($4.6B) already equaled last year‚Äôs full-year repurchases. Company will be aggressive with buybacks when price dislocation occurs, but will still balance with dividend increases and self-investment.

**International & Segment Highlights:**
- International sales +7.8% cc (strength in China, Flipkart), strong e-commerce with same/next-day delivery up 35% y/y; local variations tied to macro (WALMEX, Canada). Marketplace GMV up over 30%, 4,000+ new sellers in Mexico/Canada, SKU count up 80%.

**Risk Factors and Opportunities (as discussed on call):**
- Tariffs (US/China and others) remain the top risk‚Äîwith volatility in Q2/Q3 expected, per margin/accounting effects (RIM, LIFO).
- Walmart is uniquely positioned to navigate cost pressures due to scale, diversified sourcing, and resilient inventory management. Most imported merchandise is ""replenishable,"" not a one-time buy, enabling flexible order adjustment.
- Political risk: further escalation of tariffs could undermine annual earnings growth‚Äîdownside risk noted, though probability seen as moderate.
- Automation, tech, and e-commerce/membership/advertising mix are driving new high-margin business, supporting long-term ROIC.

**Opportunities:**
- Share gains anticipated through economic uncertainty due to value offering, omni-channel model, and digital adoption.
- Transformation around e-commerce and marketplace (profitability, ad/data/fulfillment tech) and accelerated investment in automation.

---

**Conclusion:**
Walmart enters FY26 on strong footing with Q1 ahead of internal forecasts despite tariff and cost headwinds. A milestone was reached with e-commerce profitability, supported by investments in fulfillment infrastructure, advertising, and membership. Tariff impacts are a top risk, with management confident annual guidance can be achieved if current trade negotiations hold‚Äîbut cautioning of significant volatility and downside if tariffs re-escalate. Walmart‚Äôs ability to adapt inventory, pricing, and mix, as well as its focus on higher-margin digital businesses, leave it well-positioned for continued comp and earnings growth over time. No material new disclosures were revealed that were not in the 8-K, but the excess detail on e-commerce profit drivers and inventory management flexibility is noteworthy for investors.",1,1749245916.0,PocketQuantResearch,0,1.0,False

And from a very unlikely source. A pair of miniature palm trees hung from the rearview mirror. He smiled grimly as he looked at them. Soon he might be going to the land of palms. Quiet, blue, see-through water,........","¬†CHAPTER ONE  
HE GRIPPED THE STEERING WHEEL LOOSELY AS THE CAR, ITS lights out, drifted slowly to a stop. A few last scraps of gravel kicked out of the tire treads and then silence enveloped him. He took a moment to adjust to the surroundings and then pulled out a pair of worn but still effective night-vision binoculars. The house slowly came into focus. He shifted easily, confidently in his seat. A duffel bag lay on the front seat beside him. The car‚Äôs interior was faded but clean. The car was also stolen. And from a very unlikely source. A pair of miniature palm trees hung from the rearview mirror. He smiled grimly as he looked at them. Soon he might be going to the land of palms. Quiet, blue, see-through water, powdery salmon-colored sunsets and late mornings. He had to get out. It was time. For all the occasions he had said that to himself, this time he felt sure. Sixty-six years old, Luther Whitney was eligible to collect Social Security, and was a card-carrying member of AARP. At that age most men had settled down into second careers as grandfathers, part-time raisers of their children‚Äôs children, when weary joints were eased down into familiar recliners and arteries finished closing up with the clutter of a lifetime.  Luther had had only one career his entire life. It involved breaking and entering into other people‚Äôs homes and places of business, usually in the nighttime, as now, and taking away as much of their property as he could feasibly carry. Though clearly on the wrong side of the law, Luther had never fired a gun or hurled a knife in anger or fear, except for his part in a largely confusing war fought where South and North Korea were joined at the hip. And the only punches he had ever thrown were in bars, and those only in self-defense as the suds made men braver than they should have been.  
  
¬† Luther only had one criterion in choosing his targets: he took only from those who could well afford to lose it. He considered himself no different from the armies of people who routinely coddled the wealthy, constantly persuading them to buy things they did not need.  
  
¬† A good many of his sixty-odd years had been spent in assorted medium- and then maximum-security correctional facilities along the East Coast. Like blocks of granite around his neck, three prior felony convictions stood to his credit in three different states. Years had been carved out of his life. Important years. But he could do nothing to change that now.  
  
¬† He had refined his skills to where he had high hopes that a fourth conviction would never materialize. There was absolutely nothing mysterious about the ramifications of another bust: he would be looking at the full twenty years. And at his age, twenty years was a death penalty. They might as well fry him, which was the way the Commonwealth of Virginia used to handle its particularly bad people. The citizens of this vastly historic state were by and large a God-fearing people, and religion premised upon the notion of equal retribution consistently demanded the ultimate payback. The commonwealth succeeded in disposing of more death row criminals than all but two states, and the leaders, Texas and Florida, shared the moral sentiments of their Southern sister. But not for simple burglary; even the good Virginians had their limits.  
  
¬† Yet with all that at risk he couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off the home‚Äîmansion, of course, one would be compelled to call it. It had engrossed him for several months now. Tonight that fascination would end.  
  
¬† Middleton, Virginia. A forty-five-minute drive west on a slingshot path from Washington, D.C. Home to vast estates, obligatory Jaguars, and horses whose price tags could feed the residents of an entire inner-city apartment building for a year. Homes in this area sprawled across enough earth with enough splendor to qualify for their own appellation. The irony of his target‚Äôs name, the Coppers, was not lost upon him.  
  
¬† The adrenaline rush that accompanied each job was absolutely unique. He imagined it was somewhat like how the batter felt as he nonchalantly trotted the bases, taking all the time in the world, after newly bruised leather had landed somewhere in the street. The crowd on its feet, fifty thousand pairs of eyes on one human being, all the air in the world seemingly sucked into one space, and then suddenly displaced by the arc of one man‚Äôs glorious swing of the wood.  
  
¬† Luther took a long sweep of the area with his still sharp eyes. An occasional firefly winked back at him. Otherwise he was alone. He listened for a moment to the rise and fall of the cicadas and then that chorus faded into the background, so omnipresent was it to every person who had lived long in the area.  
  
¬† He pulled the car further down the blacktop road and backed onto a short dirt road that ended in a mass of thick trees. His iron-gray hair was covered with a black ski hat. His leathery face was smeared black with camouflage cream; calm, green eyes hovered above a cinder block jaw. The flesh carried on his spare frame was as tight as ever. He looked like the Army Ranger he had once been. Luther got out of the car.  
  
¬† Crouching behind a tree, Luther surveyed his target. The Coppers, like many country estates that were not true working farms or stables, had a huge and ornate wrought iron gate set on twin brick columns but had no fencing. The grounds were accessible directly from the road or the nearby woods. Luther entered from the woods.  
  
¬† It took Luther two minutes to reach the edge of the cornfield adjacent to the house. The owner obviously had no need for home-grown vegetables but had apparently taken the country squire role to heart. Luther wasn‚Äôt complaining, since it afforded him a hidden path almost to the front door.  
  
¬† He waited a few moments and then disappeared into the embracing thickness of the corn stalks.  
  
¬† The ground was mostly clear of debris and his tennis shoes made no sound, which was important, for any noise carried easily here. He kept his eyes straight ahead; his feet, after much practice, carefully picked their way through the slender rows, compensating for the slight unevenness of the ground. The night air was cool after the debilitating heat of another stagnant summer, but not nearly cool enough for breath to be transformed into the tiny clouds that could be seen from a distance by restless or insomniac eyes.  
  
¬† Luther had timed this operation several times over the past month, always stopping at the edge of the field before stepping into the front grounds and past no-man‚Äôs-land. In his head, every detail had been worked and reworked hundreds of times until a precise script of movement, waiting, followed by more movement was firmly entrenched in his mind.  
  
¬† He crouched down at the edge of the front grounds and took one more long look around; no need to rush. No dogs to worry about, which was good. A human, no matter how young and fleet, simply could not outrun a dog. But it was the noise they made that stopped men like Luther cold. There was also no perimeter security system, probably because of the innumerable false alarms that would be caused by the large populations of deer, squirrel and raccoon roaming over the area. However, Luther would shortly be faced with a highly sophisticated defense package that he would have thirty-three seconds to disarm‚Äîand that included the ten seconds it would take him to remove the control panel.  
  
¬† The private security patrol had passed through the area thirty minutes earlier. The cop clones were supposed to vary their routines, making sweeps through their surveillance sectors every hour. But after a month of observations, Luther had easily discerned a pattern. He had at least three hours before another pass would be made. He wouldn‚Äôt need nearly that long.  
  
¬† The grounds were pitch black, and thick shrubs, the lifeblood of the burglary class, clung to the brick entryway like a caterpillar nest to a tree branch. He checked each window of the house: all black, all silent. He had watched the caravan carrying the home‚Äôs occupants parade out two days ago to points south, and carefully took inventory of all owners and personnel. The nearest estate was a good two miles away.  
  
¬† He took a deep breath. He had planned everything out, but in this business, the simple fa  
ct was that you could never account for everything.  
  
¬† He loosened the grips on his backpack and then glided out from the field in long, smooth strides across the lawn, and in ten seconds was facing the thick, solid-wood front door with reinforced steel framing together with a locking system that was rated at the top of the charts for holding force. None of which concerned Luther in the least.  
  
¬† He slipped a facsimile front-door key out of his jacket pocket and inserted it into the keyhole without, however, turning it.  
  
¬† He listened for another few seconds. Then he slipped off his backpack and changed his shoes so there would be no traces of mud. He readied his battery-operated screwdriver, which could reveal the circuitry he needed to fool ten times faster than he could by hand.  
  
¬† The next piece of equipment he carefully pulled from his backpack weighed exactly six ounces, was slightly bigger than a pocket calculator and other than his daughter was the best investment he had ever made in his life. Nicknamed ‚ÄúWit‚Äù by its owner, the tiny device had assisted Luther in his last three jobs without a hitch.  
  
¬† The five digits comprising this home‚Äôs security code had already been supplied to Luther and programmed into his computer. Their proper sequence was still a mystery to him, but that obstacle would have to be eradicated by his tiny metal, wire and microchip companion if he wanted to avoid the ear-piercing shriek that would instantly emit from the four sound cannons planted at each corner of the ten-thousand-square-foot fortress he was invading. Then would follow the police call dialed by the nameless computer he would battle in a few moments. The home also had pressure-sensitive windows and floor plates, in addition to tamperproof door magnets. All of which would mean nothing if Wit could tear the correct code sequence from the alarm system‚Äôs grasp.  
  
¬† He eyed the key in the door and with a practiced motion hooked Wit to his harness belt so that it hung easily against his side. The key turned effortlessly in the lock and Luther prepared to block out the next sound that he would hear, the low beep of the security system that warned of impending doom for the intruder if the correct answer was not fed into it in the allotted time and not a millisecond later.  
  
¬† He replaced his black leather gloves with a pair of more nimble plastic ones that had a second layer of padding on the fingertips and palms. It was not his practice to leave any evidence behind. Luther took one deep breath, then opened the portal. The shrill beep of the security system met him instantly. He quickly moved into the enormous foyer and confronted the alarm panel.  
  
¬† The automatic screwdriver whirled noiselessly; the six metal pieces dropped into Luther‚Äôs hands and then were deposited in a carrier on his belt. Slender wires attached to Wit flashed against the sliver of moonlight seeping through the window beside the door, and then Luther, probing momentarily like a surgeon through a patient‚Äôs chest cavity, found the correct spot, clipped the strands into place and then flipped on the power source to his companion.  
  
¬† From across the foyer, a slash of crimson stared down at him. The infrared detector had already locked on Luther‚Äôs thermal offset. As the seconds ticked down, it patiently waited for the security system‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain‚Äù to pronounce the intruder friend or foe.  
  
¬† Faster than the eye could follow, the numbers flashed across Wit‚Äôs digital screen in neon amber; the allotted time blinked down in a small box at the top-right-hand corner of the same screen.  
  
¬† Five seconds elapsed and then the numbers 5, 13, 9, 3 and 11 appeared on Wit‚Äôs tiny glass face and locked.  
  
¬† The beep stopped on cue as the security system was disarmed, the red light flashed off and was replaced with the friendly green, and Luther was in business. He removed the wires, screwed the plate back on and repacked his equipment, then carefully locked the front door.  
  
¬† The master bedroom was on the third floor, which could be reached by an elevator down the main first-floor hallway to the right, but Luther chose the stairs instead. The less dependent he was on anything he did not have complete control over the better. Getting stuck in an elevator for several weeks was not part of his battle plan.  
  
¬† He looked at the detector in the corner of the ceiling as its rectangular mouth smiled at him, its surveillance arc asleep for now. Then he headed up the staircase.  
  
¬† The master bedroom door was not locked. In a few seconds he had his low-power, nonglare work lamp set up and took a moment to look around. The green glow from a second control panel mounted next to the bedroom door broke the darkness.  
  
¬† The house itself had been built within the last five years; Luther had checked the records at the courthouse and had even managed to gain access to a set of blueprints of the place from the planning commissioner‚Äôs office, it being large enough to require special blessing from the local government as though they would ever actually deny the rich their wishes.  
  
¬† There were no surprises in the building plans. It was a big, solid house more than worth the multimiilion-dollar price tag that had been paid in cash by its owner.  
  
¬† Indeed, Luther had visited this home once before, in broad daylight, with people everywhere. He had been in this very room and he had seen what he needed to see. And that was why he was here tonight.  
  
¬† Six-inch crown molding peered down at him as he knelt next to the gigantic, canopied bed. Next to the bed was a nightstand. On it were a small silver clock, the newest romance novel of the day and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle.  
  
¬† Everything about the place was big and expensive. There were three walk-in closets in the room, each about the size of Luther‚Äôs living room. Two were occupied by women‚Äôs clothes and shoes and purses and every other female accoutrement one could rationally or irrationally spend money on. Luther glanced at the framed prints on the nightstand and wryly observed the twenty-something ‚Äúlittle woman‚Äù next to the seventy-something husband.  
  
¬† There were many types of lotteries in the world and not all of them state-run.  
  
¬† Several of the photos showed off the lady of the house‚Äôs proportions to almost maximum degree, and his quick examination of the closet revealed that her dressing pleasures leaned to the downright sleazy.  
  
¬† He looked up at the full-length mirror, studying the ornate carvings around its edges. He next surveyed the sides. It was a heavy, nifty bit of work, built right into the wall, or so it seemed, but Luther knew that hinges were carefully hidden into the slight recess six inches from the top and bottom.  
  
¬† Luther looked back at the mirror. He had the distinct advantage of having seen a target like this full-length model a couple of years ago although he hadn‚Äôt planned to crack it. But you didn‚Äôt ignore a second golden egg just because you had the first in hand, and that second golden egg had been worth about fifty thou‚Äô. The prize on the other side of this private looking glass he figured would be about ten times that.  
  
¬† Using brute force and the aid of a crowbar he could overcome the locking system built into the mirror‚Äôs carvings but that would take precious time. And, more than that, it would leave behind obvious signs of the place having been violated. And although the house was supposed to be empty for the next several weeks, one never knew. When he left the Coppers there would be no obvious evidence he had ever been there. Even upon their return the owners might not check the vault for some time. In any event, he did not have to take the hard route.  
  
¬† He walked quickly over to the large-screen TV located against one wall of the vast chamber. The area was set up as a sitting room with matching chintz-covered chairs and a large coffee table. Luther looked at the three remotes lying there. One to work the TV, one for the VCR and one that would cut his night‚Äôs work by ninety percent. Each had a brand name on it, each looked pretty much like the other, but a quick experiment showed that two worked their appropriate apparatus and one did not.  
  
¬† He walked back across the room, pointed the control at the mirror and pushed the lone red button located at the bottom of the hardware. Ordinarily that action meant the VCR was recording. Tonight, in this room, it meant the bank was opening for business for its one fortunate customer.  
/> ¬† Luther watched the door swing open easily, silently on the now-revealed no-maintenance hinges. From long habit, he replaced the control exactly where it had been, pulled a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack and entered the vault.  
  
¬† As his light swept through the darkness he was surprised to see an upholstered chair sitting in the middle of the room, which looked to be about six feet by six feet. On the chair‚Äôs arm rested an identical remote, obviously a safeguard against being locked in by accident. Then his eyes took in the shelves down each side.  
  
¬† The cash, bundled neatly, went in first, then the contents of the slender boxes that were definitely not costume jewelry. Luther counted about two hundred thousand dollars‚Äô worth of negotiable bonds and other securities, and two small boxes of antique coins and another of stamps, including one of an inverted figure that made Luther swallow hard. He ignored the blank checks and the boxes full of legal documents, which were worthless to him. His quick assessment ended at almost two million dollars, probably more.  
  
¬† He took one more look around, taking care not to miss any stray nook. The walls were thick‚Äîhe figured they had to be fireproof, or as fireproof as man could make something. The place wasn‚Äôt hermetically sealed; the air was fresh, not stale. Somebody could stay in here for days.  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† THE LIMO MOVED QUICKLY DOWN THE ROAD FOLLOWED BY THE van, each driver expert enough to accomplish this feat without the benefit of headlights.  
  
¬† Inside the spacious back seat of the limo were a man and two women, one of whom was close to being drunk and who was doing her best to undress the man and herself right there, despite the gentle defensive efforts of her victim.  
  
¬† The other woman sat across from them tight-lipped, ostensibly trying to ignore the ridiculous spectacle, which included girlish giggling and much panting, but in reality she closely observed every detail of the pair‚Äôs efforts. Her focus was on a large book that sat open in her lap where appointments and notes battled each other for space and the attention of the male sitting across from her, who took the opportunity of his companion wrenching off her spike heels to pour himself another drink. His capacity for alcohol was enormous. He could drink twice the amount he had already consumed tonight and there would be no outward signs, no slurring of speech or impeded motor functions‚Äîwhich would have been deadly for a man in his position.  
  
¬† She had to admire him, his obsessions, his truly raw edges, while at the same time his being able to project an image to the world that cried out purity and strength, normalcy but, at the same time, greatness. Every woman in America was in love with him, enamored with his classic good looks, immense self-assurance and also what he represented, for all of them. And he returned that universal admiration with a passion, however misplaced, that astonished her.  
  
¬† Unfortunately, that passion had never pointed itself in her direction despite her subtle messages, the touches that lingered a shade too long; how she maneuvered to see him first thing in the morning when she looked her best, the sexual references used in their strategy sessions. But until that time came‚Äîand it would come, she kept telling herself‚Äîshe would be patient.  
  
¬† She looked out the window. This was taking too long; it threw everything else off. Her mouth curled up in displeasure

About a month and a half ago, I had a massive flare and I started having reactions to foods usually safe to me. I think it could have been stress-related in conjunction with a high intake of sugar. But I've been on the low histamine diet for about a year... But I was reacting to corn, potatoes, seasonings (salicylates?). Symptoms were itchy face, runny nose, mucus buildup, cough - pretty much basic allergic reactions. At that point, the only foods I could safely eat were white rice, steak, chicken, canned green beans, green bananas, oranges, and butter... I can also do coffee and cow milk just fine. This is what I've been eating ever since. 

I am feeling significantly better at this point in time. I'm not breaking out in hives/itching and having reactions to everything anymore. My threshold for my typical triggers is a lot higher, so I definitely feel like I'm stabilized in a sense. I'm getting enough calories and stuff. I've also cut back on my sugar intake significantly. I'm just generally in a good place right now.

But I have become very anxious about eating. Fearful even. And I think the stress and anxiety from that is causing reactions, even when I eat my current safe food. Like I got a new brand of butter to try and I think I tricked myself into having reaction just thinking about it not being the usual butter. It's arguably a cleaner and more organic butter as well, so in theory it should be fine. I tried fresh green beans instead of canned green beans and still had a reaction... So I'm not sure if I'm just psyching myself out, and have so much anxiety surrounding food that I am causing reactions. I know stress can be a trigger, but this seems ridiculous. Am I really wigging myself out to the point of reactions whenever I eat?",1,1749245409.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve posted here before about taking urine mycotoxin tests and them coming back completely negative (first one without glutathione provocation and second one with). But I still decided to move home to my parents and start a detox. I‚Äôm using Biocidin, GI Detox and Proflora (All by Biocidin Botanicals) for my detox, as well as sauna 4-5 times a week @ 20 min.

I didn‚Äôt have any crazy die off symptoms (herx I think it‚Äôs called). I had some symptoms like I had a cold (mucus, cough, scratchy throat). I‚Äôm about 10 days into this now, started with one drop of the biocidin twice a day and have increased +1 drop twice per day until where I am now which is 10 twice a day.

I know this process isn‚Äôt linear. Every morning is still tough for me, I‚Äôm dizzy and a bit out of it but once I‚Äôve showered, ate breakfast, taken my supplements (Quercetin, Omega-3, Multivitamin), and had a coffee I feel really good. And come like 4 or 5pm I have started to feel almost 100% normal the past couple of days which is fantastic and makes me think it really was mold!

I‚Äôm just in my head a bit about days like today. I usually just have 1 coffee in the morning, but today I had one around 1pm as well cause it was a busy day at work. It made me feel really horrible, so I‚Äôll probably stick to 1. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is did people have a similar experience where some days you feel fantastic and others not so much but eventually 100% all the time? And do the mornings get better? Again I know this needs time and hoping it‚Äôs more like a 2 steps forward 1 step back until I hit 100% but just wanted to see if anyone experience anything similar as this is all new territory!

My parents are covering my tuition and dorm room, but everything else is on me. They paid a bit more so I could have a single room, which is nice privacy, peace, no roommate drama. I work a part-time job to make ends meet.

A few months ago, I had a date with a girl named Ashley. It was our second try the first got canceled when she was sick. I was hopeful but a little nervous.

Ten minutes into the dinner, her friend Kate showed up. I didn‚Äôt miss the awkward glance between them  it felt staged. Ashley invited her to join us like it was a casual surprise, but something felt off. Still, I stayed polite. I remembered a Reddit post where a guy got stuck paying for two girls and decided to use the same bluff: joke about a threesome to make the point without being a jerk.

When the bill came, Ashley just looked at me like it was obvious I was covering everything. That‚Äôs when I said, ‚ÄúAshley, I took you on a date and got Kate as a bonus. If I‚Äôm paying for both, I assume a threesome‚Äôs included.‚Äù

I was so sure they‚Äôd both be offended and throw money on the table. But Kate didn‚Äôt blink. She looked me straight in the eye and said, ‚ÄúSure, how does tonight sound?‚Äù

Ashley froze. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was embarrassed, mad, or shocked. But she didn‚Äôt say a word. I tried to laugh it off, thinking they were bluffing but Kate kept her poker face on. So, I leaned in and said, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm paying, both of you are coming back with me tonight.‚Äù

Kate didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúNo early plans tomorrow. We‚Äôve got all night.‚Äù

I gave the waiter my card with shaking hands. I was bluffing harder than I ever had in poker  and now I was trapped in it.

We got to my dorm. I was dying inside. No experience, barely knew what I was doing, and now I had accidentally committed to the wildest situation of my life.

Just before I unlocked the door, Ashley broke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this,‚Äù she said, Venmo‚Äôd me her half, and walked away.

Kate smiled and handed me a piece of paper. ‚ÄúI know you were bluffing,‚Äù she whispered, ‚Äúbut I wasn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt lose my number.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night not from sex, but from shock. I stared at her number like it was a glitch in the matrix.

A few days later, I called her. We got coffee. She told me the truth: Ashley used to ‚Äútest‚Äù guys by bringing a friend to see if they‚Äôd pay without complaining. This was Kate‚Äôs first time joining one of those tests  she went along because she was curious and liked the restaurant.

When I asked if she would‚Äôve gone through with it, she smirked and said, ‚ÄúI knew you wouldn‚Äôt. But if you surprised me maybe.‚Äù

Since then, Kate and I have stayed in touch. Actually, more than that. We hang out. She‚Äôs helped me build confidence in and out of the bedroom. She‚Äôs introduced me to people, been my wing-woman, and yeah, we‚Äôve slept together. We‚Äôre not dating. We‚Äôre just close. She jokes that I call her ‚Äúteacher,‚Äù and honestly, it fits.

And Ashley? No clue. Haven‚Äôt seen her since.

My inlaws are Portuguese while Im Asian. My MIL is very nice, but living here in portugal for years, I realized how mothers and sons relationships to almost every family--very clingy to each other. At first they call almost everyday and my husband almost tells everything to his family. I have scolded him about it and told him he needs to respect me because I am not used to sharing everything to anyone. That he should control it. He would share the smallest details I did not want anyone knowing. But he learned his lesson and would always think twice when sharing things to them. They would invite us alll the time for lunch and dinner even though I would want to rest, i will try to go, but I would always tell my husband how I just want to stay home. I cannot explain how it drains me. We would just sit there and watch. They would laugh without me or i would try to laugh with them coz I would not understand what they are watching (it would always be some portuguese comedy). I always tell my husband to go visit without me but he would say that they would think there is something wrong If I don't go with him.
I have tried my best to make an effort and go to their invitations when I can. But it would make me very unhappy and uncomfortable.

One Saturday morning, my MIL called my husband just after we woke up. We have already planned of not doing anything because its the first week we can stay home and just be lazy. However all of a sudden my MIL and SIL called and says they are near our home and would come visit us. But not just visit, they wanted me to do their nails which I have done in the past. However I told my husband immediately that I can't because I am tired and my brain is already set to just do nothing. They wanted to come anyway and they would bring sweets. This made me really unhappy. But as I thought my MIL was expecting that I would do her nails. I did not tell her to her face that I did not want to do it. I just told my husband that I can't because Im tired. So they arrived, still in my pajamas, we ate with them. We did not have coffee which we told them and they still insisted on coming so we drank juice. After my husband says that I can't do their nails, they decided to go home around noon and before they went home, my husband says sorry that i was not able to do their nails. My MIL says ""it's different "" which means how I do things is different because I am asian. So I ranted to my husband after that, I really wanted to rest that day but they decided that they will come visit and want ME to do their toe nails (clean them and paint them). 

So my husband calmed me down and I forgot all about it. 1 week later, my husband went there to stop by as he had an errand. He came back a bit sad but he did not tell me anything. The next morning, he then told me that his MOTHER (My MIL) is depressed of things and also because of me. I said WHY? He tried to explain that its not solely because of me. I really did not understand how my MIL THINKS! My husband explained That she was shocked that I said NO to doing her nails. And that she felt like SHE WAS NOT WELCOME TO OUR HOME (maybe because i did not offer them anything after we ate breakfast). I was PISSED and my husband tried to explain that I should be understanding. But I told my husband my point that they did not ask me in advance to do their nails and they just decided to visit to have it done and expect me to do it. She have been doing this in the past as well. She would guilt trip my husband that he would go anywhere except there and even told my husband that he chose to go with me to my friends party rather than be with them while i was listening! She maybe thought i did not understand it. She also pointed out that when we go there to their house, she would always be ready to cook for us etc etc, planned or not. And my husband also added they are always there when we need help. And they made it sound like i did not reciprocate it. WHAT THE HELL? I did not even ask any of this! I did not go there uninvited they would always invite us so they would always plan something in advance. And they expect me to do the same when they just go to out house with their self-invitation? 

They guilt trip my husband that he does not go there whenever they need his help. !!! I really cannot believe I was hearing that. They are too clingy and I just can't deal with it. 

I outright told my husband that if she is like this, I would prefer not talking to her. She became depressed because of this situation that she created herself. They invited themselves and expect me to do what they asked. I was not even able to explain I do not have the tools to do their nails, but my main concern was I really did not want to do it on my rest day. 

Am i at fault here? Is she guiltripping my husband? I do not like her for what she did, and I really feel exhausted  whenever we are with them. They
 are nice people, but this is killing me deep down! It makes me very sad and.i still have to deal with them.

I am an otherwise healthy male in my late 20's with no medical conditions. Late January 2025 I woke up and felt very lightheaded, with a slight headache and some neck pain. I assumed I was dehydrated. I felt dizziest when walking but have had no issues with driving or passive motion. This carried on for about 4 days, then completely resolved. About a week later I awoke again to the same symptoms and this persisted for several weeks. I went to my PCP who referred me to Neurology. I was very fortunate to be seen quickly by my neurologist who suspected BPPV, although I never showed any nystagmus or spinning vertigo. He prescribed the brandt-daroff exercises 3x daily and low-salt low-caffeine while I waited for testing. I also went to an ENT during this period and had a normal hearing test. She said she suspected Vestibular Migraines. 

I had an MRI/MRA, and VNG/ENG which all came back completely normal. My neurologist did not change his diagnosis at all and insisted it is BPPV even though my VNG/ENG was normal and recommended I increase my brandt-daroff to 7x a day. I asked about Vestibular neuritis and he said ""its' the same thing and basically something is inflamed in your inner ear"" which is not at all true and made me lose pretty much all faith in his assessment abilities. When I asked about VM he said that was possible and I could take some medication (an anti-seizure med) to find out if that improved my symptoms. Unfortunately due to my line of work, I am very limited in what I can be officially diagnosed with and what medications I can take without ruining my entire career so I asked if we could just wait and see if things continue improving. That was in March. 

My symptoms have generally improved over the last several months but most days I still feel lightheaded when walking, especially if i change directions quickly or move my head quickly. I did manage to completely quit caffeine after drinking coffee every day for 10 years and after the withdrawal stage felt noticeably better. When I tried caffeine again I had a heavy onset of dizziness that tapered off after a few hours. I also developed some eye floaters which I got checked out by an eye doc and she said everything looks normal except my eyes were dry. I have started noticing frequent eye strain and dryness now.  I feel much more prone to headaches than I used to be but they are not consistent. Excessive screen time and inadequate sleep seem to be headache triggers. The headaches are always low-grade and bounding in the temples. I am getting the best sleep I have gotten in years but overall feel fatigued most days. My occupation is fairly stressful and my home life is also currently stressful, with this illness now being my primary stressor. Which makes my symptoms worse I'm sure. It almost feels self-fulfilling. Illnesses I am considering are:

PPPD (of unknown cause or maybe it was BPPV to start with)

VM 

Long-Covid ( I did have cold symptoms a month prior to the first onset)

dysautonomia

Anxiety

  
Again, any official diagnosis of any of these problems is basically a career ender for me so I have had to tread very lightly. I am so fortunate to at least be able to make it through the day without any disabling symptoms. I plan on cross-posting this to other forums about these illnesses I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on because my doctor is useless.

I'm struggling with the whole Catholic thing right now. I love and believe in God and want to continue being a Catholic but honestly, the way that Catholic people around me behave makes me question a lot. 

Here's some context. Six months ago I gave birth to my fourth child. I suffered from severe post partum anxiety that crossed into post partum psychosis. Long story short, it was the worst thing that ever happened to me, really terrifying. All I wanted was support and help in this time, especially as I have four young kids to look after. I looked to my big Catholic family for help. Especially my mum. But she didn't help me. She was too busy with a church event. My husband rang her up one day and said he was really worried about me and that I needed help and she said she couldn't come because of this church event they were getting ready for. It was a whole week until the event and she could have even sent one of my siblings but apparently they were all needed for this event. I felt really abandoned. How could you be so involved in your faith and yet not be there for your family when they really need you? And then after the event had finished I asked her for specific help. The ""help"" I asked for was to check up on me now and again and come have a coffee. She lives one minute from me. She said she would do it and then never followed through. This isn't the first time I've been let down by my family choosing churchy things over me, I have too many examples to count, but it's one of the worst times. 

My mother in law saved my life, no exaggeration. She's not even Christian or anything and has lots of health problems, but she came over and helped me every day during my mental health crisis. She looked after the kids, helped me calm down when having panic attacks, advocated for me when I needed urgent medical attention and then she thanked ME for letting her be involved in my children's lives. Like someone who doesn't even believe in God is there for me, giving without counting the cost. 

My Catholic ""bubble"" also routinely say things like ""oh aren't we lucky we know Jesus and aren't like those non believers"" and ""oh I just can't stand hanging out with secular heathens"" and I'm sitting there thinking wow. Just wow. I've always hated that way of talking but now it just makes my blood boil. I'm kind of sick of that attitude and the messed up priorities. 

I know Catholics aren't perfect, and no one is, especially not me! Am I over reacting to be upset about this? Am I just being entitled? 

It's been 6 months of trying to forgive and praying for the resentment and confusion to be taken away. I know that if I brought this up to my family it would just start a big drama and somehow it would all be my fault. 

Any advice on how to move past this? I'm sick of feeling resentment and anger and I know I have to forgive if I want to be forgiven. How can I separate what is actual catholicism and what is just rubbish?

One of my bffs and I have been friends since 1st grade. After grad school I moved back near home and we rekindled our friendship so much. It was great. Her (now husband) and my (now husband) became bffs also and we spent a lot of time together doing fun stuff like going out to dinners, hanging out at their house, mini trips and so on. 

We both got married in 2023 and my husband and I bought a house 10 minutes from them literally a day before their wedding. We were so excited to start off in this new area with our bffs right down the road‚Ä¶. Except they got pregnant on their honey moon. Pretty much everything we were looking forward to in our friendship was scrapped. 

My friend no longer makes any effort to hang out or be receptive to my attempts to hang out. Even before the baby was born, I saw her 2x in that 10 month period. Once the baby came I‚Äôd make an effort to come by but 99% of the time it was ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre feeding her‚Äù ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre just laying her down‚Äù ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre going to parents house for dinner.‚Äù I would try to plan things at all times of the day since there was no consistency on feeding & naps other than a strict 7:00 bedtime. Coffee at 9? Nope. Come by with some treats at 11? Nope. Come over for tea at 2? Nope. 

We literally flew to another country for her husbands brothers wedding and hardly hung out with them because they stayed in the room the whole time with the baby. Before the trip I made plans with her to get our nails done 4 weeks in advance and she cancelled on me the week before because she wanted to get a wax at the time she had blocked **for us** because it was the only time her husband had to watch baby. 

I am burnt out from disappointment. We had one convo a while back to check in on PPD and she denied all of it. 

She‚Äôs always been incredibly independent and NOT emotionally vulnerable, so it‚Äôs really not anything I feel even worth bringing up because it will get dismissed 10 fold - as I have brought up other things in the past have. I am a super emotional person myself so I feel like part of this is that I am taking this ‚Äúrejection‚Äù too personally and she isn‚Äôt even aware at all that it‚Äôs happening.  I get daily snap chats of the baby (who is now 1) doing baby stuff and try to be supportive and hint that I also want to have a relationship with her but there is never any follow up on it. 

Needless to say, it has had me feeling so incredibly resentful of my friend and the baby & fearful of having kids myself because I do not want to become a home body. 

There‚Äôs no easy solution for this, and I think I am really just needing support. Tomorrow is the baby‚Äôs birthday party and I feel stupid for buying this expensive gift when I‚Äôm not even appreciated as a friend. I even offered my help for the party and explained that I am home alone this week as my husband is on a work trip and I‚Äôd love to come over and help or get dinner and it was just politely acknowledged with no other intentions. I feel so stupid.

The three of us pile into the car and head over.

We both leave sweaty and satisfied, already feeling accomplished.

**10:00 a.m.** ‚Äì Post-shower and feeling fresh, we head to Costco and then a local grocery store to stock up on food for the week. While we‚Äôre mostly here for staples, we make a point to grab some treats too‚ÄîCostco‚Äôs cocktail shrimp and a box of their colorful macarons. I plan to serve them at my Afternoon Tea party later today, and they feel just fancy enough for the occasion.

**11:00 a.m.** ‚Äì My friend T arrives for lunch. She‚Äôs a new mom and we always try to make space for her to have a little break and adult conversation. We sit around the table chatting about the transition into motherhood and her upcoming return to work, while enjoying my husband‚Äôs leftover enchiladas from the night before. Meanwhile, my husband takes our daughter to her uncle‚Äôs house for a sleepover, giving me a free afternoon.

**1:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Time to prep for the Afternoon Tea! I put on a sundress and set the scene. My friend E lends me her gorgeous China tea set, and it elevates the whole vibe of my sunroom. My husband helps make finger sandwiches, and we try our best to artfully plate the macarons. I agonize over the playlist, but end up choosing Secret Garden Radio on Pandora, which sets a peaceful tone.

**2:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Friends J and E arrive. J brings banana bread, still slightly warm from the oven. We make a pot of lemon-ginger tea and settle into relaxed conversation about parenting, family life, and where we see ourselves in the future. It feels calm, warm, and grounding.

**4:00 p.m.** ‚Äì After the tea party winds down, I take advantage of the beautiful weather and go on a long, solo, leisurely walk. With no one else by my side, I soak in the alone time and move at my own pace.

**6:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Not very hungry after all the sandwiches and sweets, so my husband and I graze on the leftover sandwiches.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì We drive downtown to see the play *Between Riverside and Crazy*. Parking downtown is always a bit of a headache, and since I got the tickets through our library‚Äôs free cultural pass program, my husband covers the parking fee. He also grabs a beer at the concession stand.

**Sunday**

**6:00 a.m.** ‚Äì I wake naturally to sunlight filtering through the blinds. With my daughter still at her cousin‚Äôs for the sleepover, I get to enjoy a rare quiet morning. I make coffee and walk the dog, breathing in the crisp, peaceful air.

**6:30 a.m.** ‚Äì My husband is still asleep, so I head out for a second solo walk. The morning is brisk and calm, and I cherish the solitude.

**11:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I meet up with a friend I met at my gym for lunch. We haven‚Äôt seen each other since she stopped coming due to an injury, so we have lots to catch up on. I sheepishly order from the kid‚Äôs menu (the salmon with green beans is that good‚Äîit‚Äôs perfectly crispy and better than anything on the adult menu). It costs $20.39.

**1:00 p.m.** ‚Äì After lunch, I head straight to the library to pick up some books I had on hold. My daughter is deep into her Junie B. Jones phase, and I managed to snag seven titles from the series. I can‚Äôt wait to surprise her when she comes home.

**3:00 p.m.** ‚Äì My brother-in-law drops off our daughter along with his kids. They stay for a couple of hours while the kids play. We put together more sandwiches from yesterday‚Äôs leftovers to snack on while they‚Äôre here. It‚Äôs loud and chaotic in the best way.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì We settle into our bedtime routine‚Äîshower, teeth brushing, and loads of books before lights out. My daughter is wiped out from the busy weekend and falls asleep quickly.

# Monday

**7:00 a.m.** ‚Äì My husband has to leave extra early for work today, so I‚Äôm flying solo for the morning routine. I pull myself out of bed, get dressed, and head out for a quiet dog walk. 

**8:00 a.m.** ‚Äì The post-weekend Monday blues hit hard. My daughter refuses to get out of bed and starts whining the moment I mention school. After a fun weekend, I can tell she‚Äôs just not ready to jump back into the weekday rhythm. I sit beside her and try everything: compassion, humor, honesty. I share how I used to feel the same way about school‚Äîhow some days are just harder to face. Despite my efforts, the mood doesn‚Äôt lift. It‚Äôs one of those mornings when nothing feels right to her. Eventually, I gently help her into the car so we won‚Äôt miss the school bus. It‚Äôs not how I wanted our day to start, but I remind myself that connection sometimes looks like just showing up in the mess.

**9:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I crack open my jar of overnight oats and settle into my desk. I do a quick sync with the other engineer on my build team, and we divide up the next tasks. I review some code and start making headway on the feature we‚Äôre working on. I still feel a bit emotionally raw from the morning, but coding provides a welcome sense of structure.

**11:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I take a proper lunch break and make a quick tomato and egg stir-fry with edamame‚Äîcomfort food that‚Äôs warm, simple, and filling. I snack on yogurt and apple slices while cooking and manage to squeeze in a short walk before returning to my desk. 

**4:00 p.m.** ‚Äì My husband is back from work, and we head to the bus stop together to pick up our daughter. Seeing her hop off the bus with a smile makes me feel like maybe we both reset during the day.

**4:30 p.m.** ‚Äì It‚Äôs gym time. Our daughter heads to the childwatch center while my husband and I tackle lower body strength training. 

**5:30 p.m.** ‚Äì My husband cooks pasta for dinner. Our daughter, refreshed from seeing her friends at the gym and in a better mood, works on her math worksheet and folds her laundry‚Äîall without prompting. She earns $1 in commission, which she beams about.

**6:00 p.m.** ‚Äì I turn off my phone for the rest of the evening. A thunderstorm rolls in, and rain lashes against the windows. My daughter asks if she can sleep in our bed tonight, with me‚Äîa request I welcome after our rocky morning. The three of us huddle together and play cards.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì We begin our nighttime routine, and as always when she sleeps with me, we read late into the night. She tears through an entire Junie B. Jones book before finally dozing off, still clutching it in one hand.

# Tuesday (My Birthday!)

**6:00 a.m.** ‚Äì I wake up to the hum of the coffee making downstairs. Curious, I tiptoe down in my pajamas and find my husband already in the kitchen, prepping coffee with a handmade card waiting on the counter. His message inside is heartfelt and sweet‚Äîsomething I‚Äôll tuck away and keep. He has to leave for work again today, but we share a long hug before parting. It‚Äôs a small but beautiful start to my birthday.

**6:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I head out for a brisk dog walk, and when I return, I‚Äôm surprised to hear movement upstairs. My daughter is up early‚Äîon her own! She greets me with a cheerful ‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù and proudly tells me she was going to surprise me by making my bed. We end up making it together, giggling as we smooth the sheets.

**7:00 a.m.** ‚Äì The rest of the morning flows peacefully. My daughter completes her math worksheet, unloads the dishwasher (earning her another $1), and we play a mix of card games before heading to the bus stop.

**9:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I log into work and receive a handful of birthday wishes from coworkers. The Head of People sends a quick DM: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt work too hard today.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light day‚Äîmostly tying up the final pieces of our feature work. We‚Äôre ahead of schedule, and it feels good to be in that sweet spot of wrapping up before our vacation next week.

**11:30 a.m.** ‚Äì My friend M, who missed the Afternoon Tea due to being sick, insists on taking me out for a birthday lunch. We meet at my favorite artisan pizza place‚Äîperfect, since they run a BOGO deal on Tuesdays. I‚Äôm momentarily upset when she shows up with a bag of presents (I had explicitly said ‚Äúno gifts‚Äù), but it fades quickly when I open it. It‚Äôs a collection of sustainable, eco-friendly items‚Äîthoughtful and personal. She remembered our conversations about reducing waste. We savor our pizzas (her first time there‚Äîshe‚Äôs impressed) and catch up on life. Before parting, she also invites my daughter over for a sleepover next Friday.

**2:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Blocked on a code review, I seize the opportunity for a solo ‚Äúbirthday walk.‚Äù I don‚Äôt go far‚Äîjust around the neighborhood‚Äîbut it‚Äôs quiet and refreshing.

**4:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Our neighbor kindly offers to pick up our daughter from the bus so she can hang out with their kids for a while. My husband and I use the opportunity to head straight to the gym without our usual detour.

**4:30 p.m.** ‚Äì At the gym, more birthday wishes await me. Our trainer gives me ‚Äúextra encouragement‚Äù during cardio‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a perk or a punishment, but I leave the session sweaty and satisfied.

**5:30 p.m.** ‚Äì We collect our daughter and start prepping birthday dinner: chorizo pasta. Our neighbor O, who‚Äôs become part of our inner circle over the past year, joins us with her two kids. It‚Äôs my first time attempting a one-pot pasta, and it turns out surprisingly delicious. The evening is loud, fun, and full of laughter‚Äîexactly what I hoped for.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Despite my protests, O brings a birthday gift too. I joke that she‚Äôs breaking the rules, but she remembered a specific book I mentioned‚Äî*Die with Zero*‚Äîand kindly bought it for me. After she leaves, I dive into the first few chapters while my husband gets our daughter ready for bed.

# Wednesday

**8:00 a.m.** ‚Äì My husband has a doctor‚Äôs appointment this morning, but luckily he doesn‚Äôt need to leave as early as the past few days. I‚Äôm grateful, because I‚Äôm feeling off‚Äîmy lower abdomen aches, and I can feel that my period is on the way. I lie on the couch, trying to rest. My daughter sits beside me, coloring in some *Frozen* pages I printed for her. It‚Äôs a quiet, cozy scene, and a welcome pause in the week‚Äôs pace.

**9:30 a.m.** ‚Äì At work, we officially wrap up the feature we‚Äôve been building. My manager messages me to congratulate me on delivering ahead of schedule and outlines our next roadmap items. He adds, ‚ÄúYou should be able to enjoy your week off in peace.‚Äù It‚Äôs a huge relief to have tied up all the loose ends before our NYC trip.

**11:30 a.m.** ‚Äì I heat up leftover chorizo pasta for lunch and step out for a short walk.

**4:00 p.m.** ‚Äì My husband and I head to the bus stop to meet our daughter before going to the gym, though our evening plans change‚Äîmy friend G had planned to come over with her girls, but we decide to head to her house instead tomorrow to swim. Honestly, I feel a little relieved to have an unexpectedly free evening.

**6:00 p.m.** ‚Äì For dinner, my husband and I finish off the chorizo pasta. It‚Äôs the last of the batch. Our daughter skips it‚Äîshe finds it too spicy‚Äîso we make her a peanut butter toast.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Wednesday is our regular mother-daughter sleepover night, and tonight is no exception. We snuggle up with books, and she dives into another *Junie B. Jones*. I doze off early beside her.

**Daily Spending:** $0

# Thursday

**8:30 a.m.** ‚Äì Normally, we walk to school on Fridays, but tomorrow is the last day of the school year, and my daughter wants to ride the bus one final time before summer break. So we do our walk today instead. I text my neighbor O, and she‚Äôs happy to join us with her daughter. The girls skip ahead while we chat behind them.

**9:00 a.m.** ‚Äì The morning coffee hits me mid-walk, and I have to rush home to use the bathroom. O kindly agrees to wait at the gate with the kids until they go inside. It‚Äôs not my finest moment, but thankfully, everything works out.

**9:30 a.m.** ‚Äì Work is mellow today. Our feature is completed and released, but I spend time investigating a couple of bugs and join a planning meeting for the next sprint. I‚Äôm wrapping things up before vacation mode kicks in.

**11:30 a.m.** ‚Äì Lunchtime! I notice we still have a few leftover ingredients from the birthday chorizo pasta, and rather than let anything go to waste, I get creative: I make a DIY Crunchwrap, adding some crumbled Dorito bits for flair. It‚Äôs tasty, satisfying, and I‚Äôm proud of myself for being resourceful ahead of our trip.

**4:00 p.m.** ‚Äì An alert from the gym notifies us that the childcare center is closed today. We decide to skip the gym altogether.

**4:10 p.m.** ‚Äì Back from the school bus stop, we check the mail and find a surprise: a handwritten letter from my friend E. It‚Äôs beautifully written in cursive‚Äîso ornate that my husband and I need to tag-team deciphering it. Her thoughtfulness moves me deeply.

**4:30 p.m.** ‚Äì Our daughter puts away her laundry and earns another $1. She‚Äôs been diligently saving her earnings and is buzzing with excitement about spending her own money at the CAMP store in NYC.

**5:00 p.m.** ‚Äì We grab frozen dumplings and Korean pancakes from the freezer and head to G‚Äôs house. Our daughter changes into her swimsuit as we pack up.

**5:30 p.m.** ‚Äì At G‚Äôs, I boil dumplings while she grills marinated beef. The kids splash in the pool while the adults enjoy dinner on the patio. The mosquitoes are relentless‚ÄîI leave with several bites on my legs‚Äîbut the company makes it worth it.

**7:00 p.m.** ‚Äì Back home, and of course the post-swim hunger hits. I whip up two more Crunchwraps for my husband using the last of the chorizo and egg, and I boil a quick bowl of ramen for our daughter.

**8:00 p.m.** ‚Äì After everyone‚Äôs settled in, I crawl into bed and read more of *Die with Zero*. The house is finally quiet, and I feel both full and grateful.

# Weekly Reflection

This has been a truly lovely birthday week‚Äîone that left me feeling both deeply loved and grounded. From the morning surprises from my husband and daughter to the thoughtful gestures from friends, I‚Äôve been reminded how fortunate I am to be surrounded by such kind, generous people. I felt especially touched by the gifts that were tied to past conversations‚Äîlike the eco-friendly bundle and the book from my wish list. These weren‚Äôt just gifts; they were signs that I‚Äôm seen and remembered.

Even though the week started with some parenting friction, I‚Äôm proud of how I handled it‚Äîwith patience and empathy‚Äîand that it ended on such a strong note of connection.

I also appreciated the quieter moments: early walks, late-night reading sessions, cozy dinners at home. Financially, it was a low-spend week, but I felt no sense of lack. Instead, I felt abundant in experiences, relationships, and even creativity‚Äîespecially in the kitchen as I tried to make the most of our groceries before vacation.

It was a beautiful balance of celebration, routine, and small wins. I‚Äôm heading into our NYC trip feeling full, both emotionally and energetically.

1l53bei,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1l53bei/exodus/,Exodus,"The air in the mess hall always smelled faintly of ozone, recycled sweat, and the yeasty tang of the vat-grown protein we lovingly called ‚Äòloaf‚Äô. That‚Äôs where I was, flipping through an issue of Superman from the ships digital library when the final broadcast from Earth crackled over the ship-wide comms. Not from some official channel ‚Äì those had gone dark months ago ‚Äì but a ragged, desperate voice, boosted through God-knows-what jury-rigged array, cutting through the black clouds and the void of space like a dying man‚Äôs gasping the final straw.

*""...anyone... hear us.. Jakarta‚Äôs gone... underwater... the fires... can‚Äôt breathe...""* A hacking cough, wet and terrible. *""... tell the Arks... tell them... we tried...""*

Silence. Thick, choking silence alongside the hum of *Persephone*‚Äôs engines. that constant, deep vibration that had become the heartbeat of our world. My holopad clattered onto the tray. Across from me, Old Man Henderson didn‚Äôt even look up. He just slowly folded his napkin, creasing it with trembling, liver-spotted hands. His granddaughter, Lily, maybe eight years old, stared wide-eyed at the speaker grille. ""Grandpa?"" she whispered. ""Is Earth... gone?""

We knew it was coming. We‚Äôd known for decades. The Great Scarcity wasn't just for resources, food and water; it was leaching away humanity's hope of survival like topsoil in a dust storm. Building the Arks was less a triumph, more a frantic scramble, a desperate Hail Mary thrown by a frightened species backed into a corner by an unmoving unwavering force.. 'humanity and it's hunger'. *Persephone* was steel and desperation welded together, carrying the ragged remnants of a planet.

I wasn‚Äôt a scientist or an engineer. I was Lena Kovacs, formerly a hydroponic farmer from Budapest, currently working in Hydroponics Bay 3, Level 16. My expertise? Keeping algae alive under artificial suns and coaxing sad-looking lettuce from aeroponic towers. My souvenirs? A chipped coffee mug that said ""World's Okayest Mom,"" a data chip with blurry holos of the Danube before it turned toxic sludge-brown, and a bone-deep weariness that even cryosleep couldn't erase.

The journey wasn't the sleek, starry voyage imagined by our sci-fi authors and our visionary filmmakers. It was cramped corridors smelling perpetually of disinfectant, fear and anxiety. It was loafs that tasted vaguely of salted cardboard and ammonia. It was the thrumming vibration that seeped into your bones until you forgot what true quiet felt like. It was fights over shower schedules, stolen nutrient paste, and the suffocating weight of knowing everything you‚Äôd ever known was ash and brine behind you.

We weren't noble pioneers. We were refugees clinging to a life raft in a cosmic ocean. Mrs. Chen in Engineering cried herself to sleep every night, mourning her parents and family who didnot make the cut. Raj, the comms tech, obsessively played ancient Bollywood musicals on a cracked tablet. Young Ben, who‚Äôd only known Earth in its death throes, spent hours sketching fantastical creatures he thought might live on the new world, Proxima B, our destination, our salvation, our promised land. 

I remember the day the main recycler clogged. Again. The air turned thick and stale almost unbreathable. People panicked. Voices rose, accusations flew ‚Äì who used too much water? Who didn‚Äôt clean their filter? For a terrifying hour, we were back on dying Earth, snarling over the last scraps, showing our fangs that costed us our earth, our home. Then Captain Aris‚Äôs voice, came over the comm: ""All hands, Hydroponics, Ventilation, Recycling, Bio Chemistry and Engineering teams, report to Section Seven. Our chief science officer has come up with a plan to fix the problem."" No grand speech, just a job to do. We grumbled, we cursed, but we went. Henderson, despite his shaking hands, knew the valve schematics backwards. Ben fetched tools with frantic energy. We fixed it, breathing easier, but the camaraderie felt fragile, a thin veneer hiding the raw terror beneath.

Years bled into decades. Cryo-sleep was punctuated by fragmented memories of sunlight on real grass, the smell of rain on hot pavement ‚Äì sensations so vivid they hurt upon waking. People aged. People died. Their ashes cycled back into the hydroponic systems, a grim, necessary recycling. We held funerals in the observation blister, staring out at the indifferent stars, whispering names into the void. Our automated welding bot engraved the names of the life's lost in our perilous journey on our hull making their legecy a forever part of us.

Then, one day, the alarms blared. Not the emergency claxon, but a different sound ‚Äì sharp, insistent, hopeful. A sound most of us had only heard in simulations. I elbow-deep in a nutrient solution tank, algae clinging to my gloves, when the comm crackled. It was Ben‚Äôs voice, thick with emotion, now a man grown on recycled air and starlight.

*""We have actual... visual confirmation... Proxima B... entering orbit.""*

I scrambled out, dripping, heart hammering against my ribs. I ran, as fast as my old body would allow me, not to the bridge, but to the crowded observation deck. We pressed against the cold plexisteel, a tangle of ragged breaths and trembling hands. And there it was.

Not a blue marble like the old Earth. Proxima B glowed a deeper, richer sapphire, streaked with swirls of white and emerald green continents. Clouds swirled in vast, complex patterns. It hung in the black velvet, impossibly beautiful, impossibly real.

Silence. Then, a sound I hadn‚Äôt heard in decades ‚Äì a collective, shuddering gasp. Not cheers, not yet. Just the raw intake of breath after being underwater for too long. Someone let out a choked sob. Lily, now a woman with Henderson‚Äôs eyes, reached out and gripped my hand. Her grip was iron-tight.

We‚Äôd made it. We‚Äôd crossed the gulf. But looking at that vibrant, alien world, a profound, aching loneliness washed over me. We‚Äôd carried Earth in our genes, our stories, our grief. We‚Äôd carried its ghosts. This new world was pristine, untouched by our mistakes, but also untouched by Bach, by dumplings steaming on a winter‚Äôs night, but it was ours to have a second chance on.

The journey wasn't over. Landing, surviving, building... that was the next impossible chapter. We were scarred, diminished, carrying the heavy legacy of a world we‚Äôd broken. But we were here. We were alive. And as *Persephone* slowly turned, aligning for descent, bathing us all in the soft, blue light of Proxima B, the only sound was the soft, steady omnipresent hum of the engines, and the quiet, shared breathing of gia's orphans, finally reaching the shore.

We didn‚Äôt cheer. We wept. For what we‚Äôd lost, for what we‚Äôd done, and for the terrifying, beautiful burden of a second chance hanging there in the star-strewn dark. The stars didn't care. But we, fragile, flawed, and finally here and we had to learn. How to be worthy of the rain falling on an untouched world. Only Earth knew how to make rain like that. We‚Äôd have to learn. Or fail again. The silence stretched, filled only by the ship's ancient heartbeat.",2,1749243543.0,humansarespaceorcs,2,0.75,False

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old male college student. This past year, I worked as a Resident Assistant (RA) in my dorm. At the beginning of the last semester, our college hired a new RA ‚Äî I‚Äôll call her Lucy.

When we first met, it was nothing more than casual coworker interaction. She had a boyfriend, and I had no interest in her. We would chat during RA shifts, but that was it.

Then one night, Lucy texted asking for help with homework. I said sure, and she came to my room. After we finished her homework, she stayed and we talked ‚Äî about life, school, dreams, travel ‚Äî all night long. In the morning, we grabbed coffee and watched the sunrise. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, just that she was cool to be around.

I tried to keep some distance after that because I knew she had a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt want to overstep. But about a week later, Lucy came to my room crying ‚Äî she‚Äôd broken up with her boyfriend. I consoled her, and from that point, something shifted in my mind. Now that she was ‚Äúavailable,‚Äù I slowly started to develop feelings I guess, though I still tried to be a supportive friend rather than pursue anything.

Over the next month, we grew extremely close. We started sleeping together, texting constantly, hanging out late every night. For the first time in my life, I opened up to someone. I told her things no one else knew ‚Äî not my parents, not my best friends. I found myself falling harder and harder for her and becoming emotionally dependent. When I was with her, I was genuinely happy. When I wasn‚Äôt, everything else felt empty.

For a couple of months, we were basically in a relationship, though not officially. Those months were some of the happiest days of my life. We went out to eat, visited museums and parks ‚Äî we did nearly everything together.

Then, in the last month of the semester, things started changing. Lucy began calling her ex again. She texted me less and didn‚Äôt want to sleep over anymore. We spent less time one-on-one. Her moods were all over the place ‚Äî some days she‚Äôd want affection, other days she‚Äôd pull away or be upset for no clear reason.

Looking back now, it‚Äôs clear to me: she was using me. She‚Äôd still ask me to take her out to dinner but would expect me to pay. She‚Äôd ask for help with homework, but then kick me out when it was done. She‚Äôd ask me to come over to help with chores, or for a massage, but then tell me to leave so she could call her ex ‚Äî supposedly to ‚Äústay in touch.‚Äù Eventually a couple weeks before graduation, she told me they had gotten back together.

By graduation, we were still hanging out a bit, though more as friends. When we left school, we said goodbye and promised to stay in touch.

But then, out of nowhere as summer was starting, she texted me and said we would probably never talk again ‚Äî no explanation. I assume her boyfriend told her to cut me off, but I can‚Äôt say for sure.

And now‚Ä¶ I just feel empty. I miss her so much ‚Äî her texts, her voice, the time we spent together. Yes, I still have other friends, but it feels like I‚Äôve lost a part of myself. I‚Äôm struggling every day. It‚Äôs like I was on a drug high and quit cold turkey.

I‚Äôve mostly moved on from having romantic feelings, but I miss her as a close friend ‚Äî someone I trusted and leaned on. It hurts that I let myself get so vulnerable and attached, and now she‚Äôs just gone from my life. In hindsight, I see that she used me for comfort, money, time, and attention while going through her breakup ‚Äî and once she didn‚Äôt need me anymore, she dropped me.

I feel so stupid for falling for her when I didn‚Äôt even mean to. And I‚Äôm angry ‚Äî at her, at myself, at the situation. Part of me still desperately misses the happiness I felt with her, because now I‚Äôm stuck in this depression. But another part of me is furious that she toyed with my feelings and discarded me when it was convenient.

If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar, or has advice on how to process this and move forward, I‚Äôd appreciate it. I just want to stop feeling so empty.",1,1749243497.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I am going to be moving away from my home city of 27 years, and wanted something to take with me that reminds me of home. The Irish Coffee is a perfect fit as my city is a fairly blue collar, practical place that can be a bit rugged, but is still a great place to live. As well, the main river running through which is a symbol of the place is fairly murky, leading me to want to go with something brown or redish. I also just love coffee.

This seems to be the perfect go anywhere do anything watch, especially since they ""break it in"" already so I don't have the brief period of trying to protect my baby. Only thing I'm afraid of is it will probably be too big on my wrist, but it is what is when you have a small wrist.

This happened about three years ago during my first month at an MSP handling public sector work. Picture this: a city so cheap they equipped their entire police department with 4th gen Core i3 machines, 8GB RAM, and 128GB SATA SSDs. But here's the kicker‚Äîthey insisted on roaming profiles.

You can see where this is going. Those tiny drives were constantly hitting capacity, and their brilliant solution was having me reimage PCs every other day like some kind of digital janitor.

Being the helpful new guy, I decided to automate my way out of this hell. I wrote a PowerShell script to purge any user profile that hadn't been touched in four weeks. Simple, elegant, foolproof. What could go wrong?

Well, turns out coding while nursing a hangover isn't my strongest skill set.

I tested it on my local machine‚Äîworked perfectly. Flushed with confidence (and still slightly drunk on success), I pushed it to every single PC in the police department. What I *didn't* do was test how it behaved running as SYSTEM instead of my user account.

Around 9 AM, my phone started ringing. Then it didn't stop.

The script hadn't just purged old profiles‚Äîit had nuked *everything*. Current users, old users, the default profile template, the works. And because I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, I'd programmed it to reboot machines after logout to ""clean things up.""

One by one, cops were logging out for coffee breaks and coming back to computers that had essentially lobotomized themselves. No profiles, no desktop, no nothing. Pure digital carnage.

The police chief called. Dispatch called. 911 operators were using backup systems while I sat there contemplating my rapidly approaching unemployment.

I walked into my boss's office like a man heading to his execution and confessed everything. The recovery was a nightmare‚Äîtwelve techs working six straight hours just to get dispatch and emergency services back online. Complete restoration took nearly three days.

To this day, I have no idea why they didn't fire me on the spot. Maybe they figured anyone stupid enough to nuke an entire police department's IT infrastructure while hungover was too dangerous to let loose on another unsuspecting municipality.

*Lesson learned: Always test as SYSTEM. And maybe ease up on the bourbon before coding mission-critical automation.*",56,1749243148.0,ShittySysadmin,13,0.98,False

My family‚Äîespecially my sister‚Äîhas been treating me like a failure during what is already a difficult turning point in my life, even though I‚Äôve always been the only self-sufficient child in the family.

To give you some background: I‚Äôm the only one who finished school, held steady employment, and consistently supported myself. My sister, on the other hand, repeated a year in high school, has never been able to keep a job longer than a month, and would be homeless without my parents‚Äô help. The only reason she‚Äôs now financially comfortable and living in a million-dollar home is because my parents essentially built her career for her. My mom bought properties under my sister‚Äôs name and used my name (because neither of them could show stable income), to help secure financing. Meanwhile, my dad funded her business‚Äîboth financially and emotionally‚Äîand paved the way for her success.

Growing up, my sister was always jealous of my independence and ability to connect with people outside our family bubble. In fact, she once told my friends that I was poor and live a low-end lifestyle. Despite this, I tried to support the family whenever I could. I was renting a place when my mom suggested I move into her property instead. I agreed and started paying her rent. Eventually, I took over the mortgage because she needed her name off the property to help my sister buy her ""dream home."" At the time, I was only making $45,000 a year and living paycheck to paycheck. I could barely make ends meet.

Things improved slightly when my ex-boyfriend moved in and started contributing to the rent, and I eventually found a better job paying $65,000 a year. For a while, I was finally able to save some money. Unfortunately, my relationship with my ex turned out to be emotionally and mentally draining. He was selfish and inconsiderate, and after four years of struggling, it deeply affected both my mental and physical health. I lost my job, ended the relationship, and now I‚Äôm finding it nearly impossible to secure new employment in this economy. I‚Äôm currently surviving on unemployment benefits.

Now, my mortgage is up for renewal, and with the rising interest rates, keeping the property just isn‚Äôt financially viable. I told my mom‚Äîand she told my sister‚Äîthat I need to sell. My mom pushed back and seemed frustrated with me for wanting to sell, arguing that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford another home in today‚Äôs market. She offered to help financially, saying she could provide up to $30,000 with no need for repayment until I‚Äôm back on my feet. What I didn‚Äôt realize was that the money was coming from a joint account she shares with my sister.

Later, my sister called and reassured me not to worry, saying they would ‚Äúlift me up‚Äù financially so I could keep the property and focus on finding a job. She refused to go into a bank to give me a lump sum and instead, wants me to remind her on a daily basis to transfer me $1000. If I don‚Äôt remind her, she would not send it so it‚Äôs like be begging for money from her every day. My mom, sister, and our aunt (who is also our realtor) strongly advised me not to sell.

At this point, I‚Äôm down to my final unemployment payment. Just covering basic shelter costs is about $5,000 per month. My sister gave me $12,000 in total, which only covers two months, and said that‚Äôs all she can give. Then she suggested I get a job at Starbucks. To me, this wasn‚Äôt just advice‚Äîit felt like a power move to position herself as the ""successful, beautiful, accomplished sister"" while painting me as the ""loser."" She even went so far as to call my ex-boyfriend to tell him I was ungrateful for breaking up with him, claiming he was the best I could ever have. It was so inappropriate that even he called me to say I shouldn't trust her.

This entire situation feels incredibly unjust. I could have sold my place months ago, but now I owe my mom and sister $12,000 and feel like I‚Äôve lost control over my own financial decisions. When I again told them I want to sell, they responded with ‚ÄúNo‚Äîjust wait, we‚Äôll think of something,‚Äù and asked me to send them a breakdown of renovation costs. I find it deeply frustrating that my sister, who knows nothing about my life or financial responsibilities, is now calling the shots. If she really wanted to help, she could offer me a position at her coffee shop. Instead, she told me to work at Starbucks‚Äîeven though she owns a coffee shop in the area.

What bothers me the most is that I never asked to be in this position. I don‚Äôt like being seen as the victim, and I don‚Äôt like depending on others‚Äîespecially not my family. I‚Äôve always prided myself on being independent, working hard, and carving out a life on my own terms. The only reason I accepted help this time was because I felt cornered, misled, and emotionally pressured into staying in a situation that no longer made financial sense. Now, my sister wants to hold an in-person meeting along with my mom, her boyfriend, and my friend to discuss my solutions. I am already VERY AMBARASSED about everything and she wants to make it the highlight. They also make me feel ashamed that I had to come down to sell my place.

To make things more complicated, I‚Äôm now in a relationship with someone in the U.S. My family doesn‚Äôt know about him yet. He‚Äôs offered for me to stay with him rent-free while I search for a job. While I can‚Äôt stay longer than three months at a time because I am not an American, there are possible workarounds. It would mean leaving behind my friends and my current life, and I know my mom would be heartbroken if I moved far away. But at this point, it seems like one of the only realistic options I have.

That's because, as a CPA, I now **hunt** *for* the next Job, Client, or Thrill.  

Now, job **hunting** is something nobody wants to be an expert at, but you need some skills to be an expert at: finding the right job.   
  
So I go back to when I had 1,000 LinkedIn connections - A Harley-riding, Dead Crow Gang accountant once told me, ""You are your brand."" And **she's** right.

I've been around the hiring table more times than I can count ‚Äî public accounting, private industry, nonprofits, startups, you name it. Here's the truth most people don't want to hear:

**Jobs don't always go to the best candidate. They go to the best-*****known*** **one.**

It's not the resume on my desk. It's *who put that resume on my desk.*  
And those ATS systems? They should call them what they are: **Already Trashed Submissions.**

Most jobs aren't posted. And when they are, it's often just for compliance.

So if you're sitting around applying online and wondering why no one calls back, it's probably not your resume. It's that no one knows you exist.

**Here's what works. It's part old-school hustle, part modern strategy. And it gets results.**

**1. Make a list of 100 places you'd want to work**

Yes, 100. Not just big names or ""Top Employers"" lists.  
Think local firms, small businesses, nonprofits, nightclubs, surf shops ‚Äî any place that could use someone good with numbers.

Personally, I like companies that are the best ‚Äî or at least acting like they want to be. That hunger to be better tomorrow than you are today drives me.      
  
Write them down and carry them with you!    

**2. Fix your LinkedIn**

If your headline says ""Seeking opportunities"", that tells me nothing.

Instead:

>

Now *that's* a target. Ok, a little overboard - but you get my drift.  

Write what you *do*, what you're *good at*, and where you're *going.* Use job descriptions for keywords, even if it means saying:

>

And for the love of numbers, upload a decent headshot. Not your cousin's wedding pic.

**3. Look up real people at those 100 companies**

Don't just look at the CFO.  
Find HR, AP clerks, assistants, bookkeepers, and even marketing. Everyone knows someone. Everyone has stories.   After you look at them, 6% or more look back; then build an introduction...

Message them something like:

>

Don't ask for a job. Ask for insight. Big difference.

**4. Talk to 30 people a week - non-busy season.**

Not kidding. You want to work? Put in the work.

* Free networking events (Meetup, Eventbrite, CPA, chamber mixers)
* Job seeker meetups (Crossroads Career at the church is a great one)
* Church coffee and pancake breakfasts (yes, it happens)
* Volunteer anywhere in our profession you'll meet people

You want to be memorable (branding), not invisible.

One of my go-to lines is in tech:

>

People laugh. Then they remember you.

So imagine this!    I have a list that says I want to work at the Lego Group. I'm in Austria, having breakfast, and I meet a guy.   He says his son works at Lego in Billund. I pull out my phone, show him my list, and he introduces me to his son!  It didn't go anywhere, but it made my breakfast fun!   

**5. Book a few 20-minute networking meetings  with key players you want to be or know who also  know people (20-Minute Networking Meeting Book Ballinger and Perez)**

If someone says yes ‚Äî show up, be prepared, and *don't waste it.*

Ask smart questions:

* How'd you get into this role?
* What do you enjoy about your job?
* What's tough in the industry right now?
* Any advice for someone like me?
* Is there anyone else you think I should talk to (New introduction)?

That last one is gold. It keeps the chain going.

**Bonus tip: Follow up**  
Send a thank-you note or message. Short, thoughtful. Almost nobody does it ‚Äî so when you do, it stands out. Then send out holiday and birthday cards to them. Make an effort to take an interest in all your connections' lives, even if you are three circles removed.   This will build 50-year friendships and/or acquaintances!

I am an otherwise healthy male in my late 20's with no medical conditions. Late January 2025 I woke up and felt very lightheaded, with a slight headache and some neck pain. I assumed I was dehydrated. I felt dizziest when walking but have had no issues with driving or passive motion. This carried on for about 4 days, then completely resolved. About a week later I awoke again to the same symptoms and this persisted for several weeks. I went to my PCP who referred me to Neurology. I was very fortunate to be seen quickly by my neurologist who suspected BPPV, although I never showed any nystagmus or spinning vertigo. He prescribed the brandt-daroff exercises 3x daily and low-salt low-caffeine while I waited for testing. I also went to an ENT during this period and had a normal hearing test. She said she suspected Vestibular Migraines. 

I had an MRI/MRA, and VNG/ENG which all came back completely normal. My neurologist did not change his diagnosis at all and insisted it is BPPV even though my VNG/ENG was normal and recommended I increase my brandt-daroff to 7x a day. I asked about Vestibular neuritis and he said ""its' the same thing and basically something is inflamed in your inner ear"" which is not at all true and made me lose pretty much all faith in his assessment abilities. When I asked about VM he said that was possible and I could take some medication (an anti-seizure med) to find out if that improved my symptoms. Unfortunately due to my line of work, I am very limited in what I can be officially diagnosed with and what medications I can take without ruining my entire career so I asked if we could just wait and see if things continue improving. That was in March. 

My symptoms have generally improved over the last several months but most days I still feel lightheaded when walking, especially if i change directions quickly or move my head quickly. I did manage to completely quit caffeine after drinking coffee every day for 10 years and after the withdrawal stage felt noticeably better. When I tried caffeine again I had a heavy onset of dizziness that tapered off after a few hours. I also developed some eye floaters which I got checked out by an eye doc and she said everything looks normal except my eyes were dry. I have started noticing frequent eye strain and dryness now.  I feel much more prone to headaches than I used to be but they are not consistent. Excessive screen time and inadequate sleep seem to be headache triggers. The headaches are always low-grade and bounding in the temples. I am getting the best sleep I have gotten in years but overall feel fatigued most days. My occupation is fairly stressful and my home life is also currently stressful, with this illness now being my primary stressor. Which makes my symptoms worse I'm sure. It almost feels self-fulfilling. Illnesses I am considering are:

PPPD (of unknown cause or maybe it was BPPV to start with)

VM 

Long-Covid ( I did have cold symptoms a month prior to the first onset)

dysautonomia

  
Again, any official diagnosis of any of these problems is basically a career ender for me so I have had to tread very lightly. I am so fortunate to at least be able to make it through the day without any disabling symptoms. I plan on cross-posting this to other forums about these illnesses I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on because my doctor is useless.

At first, I didn‚Äôt realize she was that much younger than me ‚Äî I‚Äôm in my 30s and she‚Äôs in her early 20s ‚Äî but we clicked quickly, and the connection felt natural. Because of that, the age difference didn‚Äôt seem like a problem at the time.

We spent 3‚Äì5 days a week together, often like we were already living together. In February, we officially became a couple. I‚Äôd never been in a relationship before, so everything was new. She had only had one partner before me. We fell into something intense very quickly, and it felt meaningful ‚Äî at least for a while.

But over time, something shifted inside me. I began feeling unsure and emotionally distant, even though I didn‚Äôt know how to put it into words. I kept showing up, hoping the uncertainty would pass if I just tried harder ‚Äî loved harder. But it didn‚Äôt. And instead of being honest about it, I quietly withdrew.

I hinted at feeling disconnected a few times, but I stayed vague. I was scared of hurting her. So I avoided the hard conversations ‚Äî and in doing that, I left her confused while I emotionally checked out.

A few days ago, after one month of long distance, I ended it over a video call ‚Äî just before she was supposed to come visit me. I felt I couldn‚Äôt let her travel all that way, full of hope and excitement, when I knew deep down something was wrong inside me. I thought it was the more responsible thing to do ‚Äî to stop it before it went further ‚Äî but the way I did it hurt her deeply.

I now understand that I blindsided her ‚Äî and the worst part is, I didn‚Äôt even know what that meant until after I did it. I thought I was choosing the ‚Äúleast painful‚Äù option, but in hindsight, I realize I had been silently detaching for weeks. She didn‚Äôt know, because I never gave her the chance to see or understand what I was feeling. That‚Äôs what blindsiding is, and it broke her. She later told me she‚Äôd had panic attacks the week before because she felt something was off. I never intended to cause that kind of pain ‚Äî but I did.

That realization forced me to confront something deeper: I‚Äôm not as emotionally mature as I thought I was. I avoided difficult conversations, buried my doubts, and hoped things would fix themselves. That‚Äôs not how healthy relationships ‚Äî or breakups ‚Äî work. I see that now, and it hurts to know she had to pay the price for my lack of clarity.

There were also things I never told her ‚Äî not as excuses, but as part of the full picture that led to where I ended up emotionally.

Early on, she told me she wanted to meet her ex for coffee. They‚Äôd broken up about six months before we started getting serious. I felt uncomfortable with it, but I said, ‚ÄúIf it makes you feel good, go ahead.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to control her. I believed people should grow into their own boundaries ‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt want to shape or restrict her sense of self. I really meant that.

But the meetups with her ex happened multiple times. She kept a 1000+ day Snap streak with him. He came up in conversation often ‚Äî sometimes I felt compared to him. At her apartment, his last name was still on her door. Then, on a trip abroad, she told me ‚Äî *after* we arrived ‚Äî that she ran into him on a bus and had coffee with him. It felt like something I should‚Äôve known earlier, especially given how open we usually were with each other. It started to feel like he still had a quiet presence in her life ‚Äî and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that maybe he was a backup if I ever left.

Still, I never brought this up in depth. I stayed silent. Partly out of emotional inexperience, and partly because I didn‚Äôt want to manipulate or limit her. I kept hoping she‚Äôd see the emotional grey areas herself and make adjustments ‚Äî but she didn‚Äôt, and I never voiced how it was affecting me.

The age gap played a role too. I often felt like I was guiding or mentoring more than partnering. I‚Äôm deep into my career; she just started university. I planned, supported, took emotional lead. I sometimes felt more like a caretaker than an equal. There were also some hygiene-related things that bothered me (reusing workout clothes, rarely changing sheets), and I didn‚Äôt know how to bring that up either. These details sound small, but they added to the overall mismatch I started to feel ‚Äî even physically.

I didn‚Äôt leave because of one thing. I left because too many things built up in silence ‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt have the emotional tools to process or communicate what was really going on.

Last night, she asked for answers. I wrote her a long, heartfelt message explaining how I‚Äôd been feeling lost, afraid of the future, and unsure of whether I was truly the right person for her. She replied with love, pain, and a small bit of hope ‚Äî but ultimately asked me not to contact her for now.

I‚Äôm not posting this for validation. I just needed to get it out. I care about her. I messed up. And now I‚Äôm sitting with the weight of that.

Yesterday, this woman (a couple ) walks in all designer bag, oversized sunglasses, and condescension. She orders a chicken salad, eats 90% of it (I‚Äôm not exaggerating), then calls my mom over with an attitude. With the most sour face imaginable, she went, ‚ÄúThis food tastes like shit. Absolute garbage. I want to write a complaint‚Äù (Here we have this thing, it‚Äôs like an official complaint book businesses must provide by law.)

My mom, visibly shaken, was trying to explain that she was sorry to hear that and offer her a refund but the lady kept cutting her off and acting like a b**** and looking around like she wanted an audience and that‚Äôs when I stepped in. I said, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, if you‚Äôd like to write a complaint, I‚Äôll gladly bring it to you. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that first you‚Äôll need to pay your bill. That‚Äôs the law.‚Äù She blinked at me like I just kicked her chihuahua and she she said and I quote

‚ÄúYou know who I am? I won‚Äôt pay for this service I can tell you that.‚Äù

My mom was frozen. I was trying to stay calm bcs at this point I almost shitted myself too lol because this guy was flexing like he wanted a fight

And then‚Ä¶ right before I shit myself up, the salvation. One of our regulars, Carlos, stood up. Carlos is a firefighter. Drinks his coffee black, wears a calm face, and once carried an injured golden retriever down three flights of stairs. The man‚Äôs basically an action movie character.

He walks over, slow and steady, and goes: ‚ÄúSir, your wife ate the entire plate. You insulted a woman who cooks with love and gives out free soup to people who can‚Äôt afford lunch. Now you're trying to intimidate them?‚Äù

The husband mumbled something macho and Carlos didn‚Äôt flinch. He leaned in a little and said, ‚ÄúEither you pay for the food, apologize, and leave or I call the police, unless you want to solve this in an old school way.‚Äù Guess whataat? They paid. And not just the bill bcs Carlos made sure they left a tip too.

And THEN Carlos looked at me and said, ‚ÄúAdd a bottle of water to their bill, she clearly needed something to wash down all that bullshit.

I use the Minor Figures brand but it‚Äôs 6 grams of sugar plus another 6 grams of added sugar is 12 grams of sugar, plus 14 grams total carbs. 

My bariatric nutritionist said this: ‚ÄúOat Milk is typically higher in fat and carbohydrates because it is made from Oats.The OATLY brand makes low fat oat milks and the ""Planet Oats"" brand has unsweetened Oat milk so you can certainly look into that.
You can also compare unsweetened almond milk, soy milk and coconut milks if needed. I am also fine if you would like to continue with your current brand of oat milk as your overall caloric intake will be very low and I would hate for you to change a brand that you like and be concerned about the calories because you are going to be saving a lot of calories with your small portion sizes.‚Äù

We have a mostly great relationship and get along well. But one thing that really bothers me is that he never plans anything for the two of us. All of our dates, vacations, nights in together, etc are planned by me. 

Today we got in an argument because I asked him to get tickets to something and he did not get them. He had the app up on his phone when they became available but was also making himself coffee (actively‚Ä¶like using his other hand to do so). I was frustrated he couldn‚Äôt just sit down and devote his full attention for five minutes to doing the one thing I asked. I know he still might not have been able to get the tickets if he was fully locked in but it bothered me because I‚Äôve put so much effort in lately into planning birthday trips, weekends away, dates‚Ä¶ and he just was half-paying attention. 

I‚Äôm not even asking him to plan something in this case, I‚Äôm asking for his help, and he still half assed it. Anytime I delegate one of these type of tasks to him I have to constantly nag him to do it. 

It upsets me because with his friends and family this is not the case. He puts a lot of effort into things and will plan and cook them dinner. I don‚Äôt remember the last time he planned a dinner or made reservations anywhere. I told him it made me feel like he didn‚Äôt care about me, which really hurt his feelings. I also asked him to plan a backpacking trip for my birthday this year and when I checked he had not gotten permits and they are all booked up. :/

He does a ton of other things for me and for our household, so this isn‚Äôt about him not helping out. He took on the full mental load of shopping for a car and negotiating the price earlier this year. But sometimes, like I want a little romance and forethought. Like my love language is just supposed to be him doing chores?

## Key features Analysis

The ideal drip tray offers a combination of durability,functionality,and ease of maintenance. We‚Äôve analyzed the top contenders in the 2025 market based on thes core aspects.

**Material and Construction**

The material used in a drip tray considerably impacts its durability and resistance to corrosion. Stainless steel is a popular choice due to its robustness and ease of cleaning. High-quality stainless steel drip trays, like those made from 304-grade stainless steel, offer excellent resistance to rust and staining, ensuring a long lifespan even with frequent use. Other materials include heavy-duty plastics,such as polypropylene,which are lightweight,impact-resistant,and generally more affordable. The construction method, such as seamless welding in stainless steel trays, also contributes to overall strength and leak-proof performance.

**Size and Capacity**

Selecting the correct size drip tray is crucial for effectively capturing spills without being overly bulky or cumbersome.Consider the dimensions of the appliance or equipment the drip tray will be used with, and select a tray that offers sufficient coverage. The capacity of the drip tray also matters, as it determines how much liquid can be collected before needing to be emptied. Larger drip trays are ideal for high-volume applications, while smaller trays are suitable for occasional drips and spills. Drainage options, like built-in spouts or removable reservoirs, also impact the usability of the tray.**Design and Aesthetics**

While functionality is paramount, the design and aesthetics of a drip tray can also play a role, notably in visible settings. Sleek stainless steel drip trays often complement modern appliances and create a professional appearance. Some models feature textured surfaces to prevent glasses or mugs from sliding, adding an extra layer of practicality. the depth of the tray is another design consideration; deeper trays offer greater spill containment but may also require more vertical space. Removable grates or inserts can further enhance aesthetics and maintain cleanliness by keeping items elevated above collected liquids.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Ease of cleaning is a critical factor for any drip tray, as regular maintenance helps prevent the buildup of grime and bacteria. Drip trays with smooth, non-porous surfaces are easier to wipe down and disinfect. Dishwasher-safe models offer the ultimate convenience,allowing for thorough cleaning without manual scrubbing. Removable parts, such as grates and reservoirs, also simplify the cleaning process. Regular emptying and cleaning of the drip tray not only maintains hygiene but also prevents unpleasant odors and potential corrosion issues.

Key features of the best drip trays include:

* Durable materials like stainless steel or heavy-duty plastic
* Appropriate size and capacity for specific appliances
* Functional design with features like textured surfaces or removable parts
* Easy-to-clean surfaces and dishwasher-safe options

## Core Benefits

A quality drip tray provides numerous benefits, ranging from improved hygiene to enhanced equipment protection.

**Preventing Spills and Stains**

Drip trays act as a barrier against spills and drips, preventing them from reaching surfaces and causing unsightly stains. This is particularly notable in areas with delicate or porous materials, such as countertops, wooden floors, or carpets. By containing spills within the tray, cleanup becomes faster and more efficient, reducing the risk of permanent damage or discoloration. For example, a drip tray placed under a coffee machine protects the countertop from coffee stains and prevents sticky residue buildup.

**Maintaining Hygiene and Cleanliness**

Regularly emptying and cleaning a drip tray helps maintain a more hygienic environment by preventing the growth of mold, mildew, and bacteria. This is especially crucial in food and beverage preparation areas, where contamination can pose a health risk. Drip trays with smooth, non-porous surfaces are easy to disinfect, further minimizing the risk of germ buildup. A clean drip tray also prevents unpleasant odors associated with stagnant liquids and decaying organic matter.

**Protecting Equipment from Damage**

Drips and spills can cause significant damage to appliances and equipment, leading to corrosion, electrical shorts, and reduced performance. A drip tray effectively shields these components from unwanted liquids, extending their lifespan and preventing costly repairs. For instance, using a drip tray under a beer dispenser protects the internal mechanisms from beer spills, safeguarding against electrical damage and corrosion. Similarly, drip trays can protect pumps, motors, and other sensitive equipment from water damage in various applications.

**Simplifying Cleanup and Reducing labour**

By containing spills and drips, drip trays significantly simplify cleanup and reduce the amount of time and effort required to maintain a clean environment. Instead of scrubbing surfaces and dealing with stubborn stains, users can simply empty and clean the drip tray. This is particularly beneficial in commercial settings, where labor costs are a major concern. Drip trays minimize the need for constant monitoring and wiping, freeing up staff to focus on other tasks.

## FAQs Section

**Is a stainless steel drip tray better than a plastic one?**
Stainless steel drip trays generally offer superior durability and resistance to corrosion compared to plastic models. However, plastic drip trays are often more affordable and lightweight. The choice depends on your specific needs and budget. If longevity and resistance to harsh chemicals are critically important,stainless steel is the better option. For lighter use and budget constraints, a high-quality plastic drip tray can be suitable.

**How often should I clean my drip tray?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on the type of use and the liquids being collected.For appliances like coffee machines or beer dispensers, daily emptying and cleaning are recommended to prevent the buildup of bacteria and unpleasant odors. For less frequent spills,a weekly cleaning may suffice. Regularly inspecting the drip tray and cleaning it whenever it appears dirty is the best practise.

**Can I put my drip tray in the dishwasher?**
Many stainless steel and some plastic drip trays are dishwasher-safe, but it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions before doing so. Dishwashing can provide a more thorough cleaning than manual scrubbing, but high temperatures and harsh detergents can damage certain materials.

**What features should I look for in a drip tray for a bar?**
For bar applications, look for a drip tray with a large capacity, durable construction (preferably stainless steel), and a spill-resistant design. Features like a removable grate to keep glasses elevated above spilled liquids and a built-in drain with a connection for a drain line can further enhance functionality and reduce cleanup time. The aesthetics of the drip tray are also important in a bar setting, so consider models with a sleek, professional appearance.

But, they almost always tend to go away with pain medication, there‚Äôs the odd occasion when they don‚Äôt, of course, but I‚Äôve never really had an aura, or any other symptoms. I‚Äôve had my eyes checked in depth many many times (bad vision) and nobody‚Äôs ever noticed any problems. I‚Äôve also had lots of routine blood work within the last few years (unrelated issue)  and no markers have ever flagged as me having a more serious problem. I‚Äôve taken codeine/co-coda-mol in the past but I worry sometimes it‚Äôs making my headaches worse ?? Could this be the case? 

I like to think I drink enough water but who knowsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but tbh I have terrrrrrible posture, I need glasses and my neck is always tense (I came out of the womb this way) - after school I worked a demanding coffee shop job where I was always hunched over. I wouldn‚Äôt say the headaches have gotten any worse in the last year or so (since I‚Äôve been stressed) I think I‚Äôm just paying more attention to them since I‚Äôve had more free time whilst being unemployed. they‚Äôve kinda remained the same for these years however my PMS symptoms have gotten worse (so therefore my one migraine a month has too)

But this is my point, do some people just suffer headaches? just as they are? I mentioned my headaches to a doctor once and they didn‚Äôt seem worried, I‚Äôve never had speech problems or mobility issues or anything like that, the headaches almost always go away- surely if it was a brain tumor or something, I‚Äôd know ??? If I have long exposure in the sun, or lots of heat (like a sauna) they get worse.  

Anyway, my question is. Do all headaches have a sinister cause? I‚Äôm not particularly worried about them, but should I be? I manage and live my life fine, yeh the occasional migraine is rough but on the whole my headaches don‚Äôt stop me doing anythingü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was just thinking about it earlier and wondering whether in fact, I should be more concerned ?",1,1749241570.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 21 years old with intense adhd and problems with my mental health so my apartment is most of the time a complete mess. (Which is also why this post might me a bit chaotic and not very well written, I apologize) My dad -an adult baby who thought he didn‚Äôt need a real vacuum if he had a robot one, and has the most disgusting bathroom I‚Äôve ever seen - lives in a different city and comes and sleeps on my couch almost every weekend. my siblings and mom thinks it‚Äôs insane that I dont go crazy with him here every weekend but honestly I don‚Äôt wanna hurt his feelings saying he can‚Äôt come here, especially because he gives me coffee and breakfast in bed when he‚Äôs here, hes a nice guy, truly.

Anyways, I feel very self conscious about how my apartment looks and at times the self hatred is so intense I don‚Äôt know how to go forward. It has been a continuous issue that my dad will tell me that it‚Äôs dirty here, and when I do clean he will compliment me, which for me doesn‚Äôt feel good hearing, I don‚Äôt really know why but it makes me feel so small and horrible every time he says it. but because I know it comes from a good place I have always just said the normal uncomfortable thank you and keep my discomfort to myself. A year ago or so when he did this again I decided that the healthy thing is I guess to just say that it makes me uncomfortable, that I understand he doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad, but that I wish he didn‚Äôt say that again. He began basically arguing with me about how that was irrational, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving you a compliment‚Äù and the fact that it isn‚Äôt perceived as a compliment to me apparently doesn‚Äôt matter to him. I know it‚Äôs irrational, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs my dad and I guess maybe I expect too much from him? 
After this, it kept happening, I kept saying to him that I told you I don‚Äôt like it and basically begging him to stop which lead to a discussion about how again that it‚Äôs a compliment and that It‚Äôs a normal thing to say. After a year of this happening constantly I started getting upset, which he actually laughed at multiple times while I was visibly mad at him -because in his mind this was a normal thing and that I should accept it. A while ago this continuous issue of him not listening to me built up and I just snapped. I‚Äôm not proud of it but I screamed at him, asking why the fuck he cant respect me, and why he feels like he wants to say things that I perceive as mean, even if he doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why it makes me so upset hearing this, but in my mind that really doesn‚Äôt matter, I told him I didn‚Äôt like it. If he wasn‚Äôt my dad I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything and I feel like he should maybe be the person who shouldn‚Äôt wanna say things that I find upsetting, And I should be able to tell him and he should respect that no?

He is a good guy and extremely sensitive, just misguided and quite often says insensitive things not because he‚Äôs being mean but because he just doesn‚Äôt think. Like he lets his and my siblings relationship suffer, not making plans or hanging out with them -not because he doesn‚Äôt care , but because he genuinely thinks they just don‚Äôt want to even tho they haven‚Äôt given him a reason to think so. There is so much context to this lost in this tiny text and I wanna watch bobs burgers now and writing this takes to much brain power and attention that my brain cant handle so I need you to just trust me that he is a good guy.

'I need it to end.' my thought repeat like a mantra, speaking of the boss-fight, the game, but also my situation. My life has never been easy, but it seems never to get better, only worse. I picked up DS1 after going homeless yet again, after finishing Elden Ring in a desperate hurry, because I really wanted to end it before I was homeless. I am couch-surfing, blessed with a nook where I was able to set up my computer, stuck in a nightmare LAN party which won't end, no matter how much I want it to. 'I need it to end.' my thoughts keep repeating. I yearn for the salvation of the credits, but I can't get it. Each time I am worse. My brain cannot quite connect with my fingers. I make moves I don't mean to, I see the red text yet again. There is no resolve in me but also no frustration. I have no choice in this. I must go on, because there is no real alternative. I am unable to die. The only salvation I may ever experience is in victory - the suffering will never end until the foes are felled and the coast is clear, peaceful at once. But I'm not there.

1l52bmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoinmoonshots/comments/1l52bmf/kendu_is_the_first_brandcoin_and_bridging_memes/,$kendu is the first BRANDCOIN and bridging Memes and Real Life HARD,"Let‚Äôs talk about something rare in crypto: real value.

Most of the coins out there are just noise. Flashy names, big promises, no follow-through. That‚Äôs not investing. That‚Äôs gambling, and gambling is a quick way to lose everything.

But every now and then, something different shows up.

Kendu isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. It‚Äôs turning into a real brand with real traction. It‚Äôs what happens when a community decides to build, not just speculate. Some are calling it a permissionless brand empire. Others say it‚Äôs community as a service. However you describe it, one thing is clear. It‚Äôs working.

Let‚Äôs look at the facts.

‚∏ª

Execution Matters

Ideas are easy. Execution is what separates talkers from builders. Kendu is attracting people who can actually deliver. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Entertainment is running glow-in-the-dark pickleball tournaments in India. These events are drawing attention, and talks of community parties are already underway. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Hot Dogs are being served in Florida. Yes, real hot dogs. Not just a concept, but a product you can actually buy. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Coffee is grown in Brazil and for sale in the UK. Available in regular and decaf. It‚Äôs the real thing. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Merch is live. Shirts, hats, hoodies. People are wearing the brand. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Animation released its first episode in a Japanese-inspired style. It‚Äôs well made and shows the team is serious about quality. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Games produced a physical board game. Built by community members who just got it done. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Creator launched a 3D-printable mask that lets online creators stay anonymous while building their brand. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Collectibles include pendants and plush toys. Physical products with real emotional connection. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Beer is already brewing. They have a working prototype. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Video Games are being developed by professionals. Early previews look promising and the team is targeting a Steam release. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Vapes are in the pipeline. It‚Äôs a lifestyle product with a big market. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Organics is working on natural wellness products. Chemical-free body care tied into the community‚Äôs culture. ‚Ä¢ The Kendu Street Team has shown up at three festivals in Florida. Live events, murals, free energy drinks and merch. It‚Äôs classic grassroots meets modern crypto. ‚Ä¢ Kendu Tattoos are out there. That kind of commitment says something.

‚∏ª

You Can See It, Touch It, Use It

Crypto has a trust problem. People are tired of getting burned by influencers and shady projects. That‚Äôs why physical products matter.

Kendu is building things you can wear, eat, drink and play. It feels more like an early-stage lifestyle brand than a token. And unlike traditional companies, it‚Äôs decentralized. No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just people building.

‚∏ª

Real Presence Online

Kendu is showing up everywhere. Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Stocktwits. And it‚Äôs not bots or ads. It‚Äôs people sharing because they care.

It also became the second token in history to get over 50,000 votes on Certik for a free audit. The first was $PEPE. Kendu earned a 98 trust score. That‚Äôs a big deal in a space where trust is hard to find.

‚∏ª

Why Community Matters

Every big crypto story starts with community. Doge, Shiba, Pepe. None of them would have worked without passionate people.

Kendu‚Äôs community is different. It doesn‚Äôt wait for permission. It builds. That‚Äôs where its strength comes from.

‚∏ª

Final Thought

At around $25 million market cap, Kendu is still early. But it‚Äôs doing more than projects 10 times its size. It‚Äôs got real-world products, a committed community, and a roadmap that doesn‚Äôt rely on hype.

Most coins are here today and gone tomorrow. Kendu is becoming a cultural brand, powered by people who believe in building something better.

It‚Äôs not just a token. It‚Äôs a movement.

And if you‚Äôre serious about investing, not gambling, it‚Äôs one worth paying attention to.

We don‚Äôt gamble. We work.

It‚Äôs just a cozy place where people come for good coffee, warm food, and a bit of kindness. My mom is the gentlest soul you‚Äôll ever meet. The kind of person who thanks you even when you mistreat her or apologizes if you bump into her. Yeah, that kind.

Yesterday, this woman (a couple ) walks in all designer bag, oversized sunglasses, and condescension. She orders a chicken salad, eats 90% of it (I‚Äôm not exaggerating), then calls my mom over with an attitude.
With the most sour face imaginable, she went, ‚ÄúThis food tastes like shit. Absolute garbage. I want to write a complaint‚Äù (Here we have this thing, it‚Äôs like an official complaint book businesses must provide by law.)

My mom, visibly shaken, was trying to explain that she was sorry to hear that and offer her a refund but the lady kept cutting her off and acting like a b**** and looking around like she wanted an audience and that‚Äôs when I stepped in. I said, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, if you‚Äôd like to write a complaint, I‚Äôll gladly bring it to you. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that first you‚Äôll need to pay your bill. That‚Äôs the law.‚Äù She blinked at me like I just kicked her chihuahua and she she said and I quote 

‚ÄúYou know who I am? I won‚Äôt pay for this service I can tell you that.‚Äù

And then... enter the husband. He stood up all puffed chest and testosterone and started telling us we ‚Äúbetter watch ourselves,‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know who we‚Äôre messing with,‚Äù and other clich√©s straight from the Entitled Rich Guy Starter Pack‚Ñ¢.

My mom was frozen. I was trying to stay calm bcs at this point I almost shitted myself too lol because this guy was flexing like he wanted a fight

And then‚Ä¶ right before I shit myself up, the salvation. One of our regulars, Carlos, stood up.
Carlos is a firefighter. Drinks his coffee black, wears a calm face, and once carried an injured golden retriever down three flights of stairs. The man‚Äôs basically an action movie character.

He walks over, slow and steady, and goes:
‚ÄúSir, your wife ate the entire plate. You insulted a woman who cooks with love and gives out free soup to people who can‚Äôt afford lunch. Now you're trying to intimidate them?‚Äù

The husband mumbled something macho and Carlos didn‚Äôt flinch. He leaned in a little and said, ‚ÄúEither you pay for the food, apologize, and leave or I call the police, unless you want to solve this in an old school way.‚Äù
Guess whataat? They paid. And not just the bill bcs Carlos made sure they left a tip too.

And THEN Carlos looked at me and said, ‚ÄúAdd a bottle of water to their bill, she clearly needed something to wash down all that bullshit.

Mic drop. Thank you Carlos.

1l52b0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/1l52b0d/older_dater_musings/,Older dater musings...,"I recently took down a post where I sought suggestions on where to meet single older men. I'm in my early 40s.

In my twenties, I was starry-eyed and didn't know what I wanted. I understand better now. That's how I know it is challenging to want to jump in the pool again. I barely want to leave my home, that's how much peace & contentment I have created for myself. I am terrified at the thought of letting anyone upend that balance. I mean, the Netflix I'm paying for isn't going to watch itself, no?

Having said that, I think life might be more fun if one did it with someone else...I think! So I am trying to try again. It feels like a bit of a social experiment. And although I have only had a few experiences thus far, I am seeing some interesting things. All I can say is, this world is getting curiouser and curiouser!

Number one: ghosting!!! I truly thought this was a thing only teenagers did. Apparently, 50-60 year old people do it, too. When did this become socially acceptable?

Effort: I have reasonable standards, as should every one. I met a gentleman for coffee and he showed up in flip-flops. Not sandals, actual flip flops. In addition, he had some drops of fresh blood on his arm and shirt sleeve. Of course, I asked about the blood. He said one of his cats sctratched his arm. Short story short, I excused myself and dashed out. I'm not trying to end up on First 24: Pearland edition! Have things changed so much that coffee dates equals zero effort?

Etiquette: What is the protocol these days around online and in-person dating? Eons ago, I believe the norm was boy meet girl. If interested, boy asks if he can see girl again and gives his phone number (usually within Day 1). Boy calls girl/set up date/takes girl out. Boy and girl become ""an item"". The end! 

What, pray tell, do people be doings these days? While I'm not locked in to gender normativity, I would hope the basic tenets still exists. 

I probably have more questions. I'd love to hear some of your stories as well as possible answers to some of my observations above üòÅ!

1l52arn,https://www.reddit.com/r/organicfoodonline/comments/1l52arn/seven_keys_to_mindful_wellness_nutrition/,"Seven Keys to Mindful Wellness: Nutrition, Adaptogens & Seasonal Habits","In our foundational guide,&nbsp;[Natural Health & Wellness 101](https://mycozyfarm.com/blogs/news/natural-health-wellness-101), we introduced key wellness concepts grounded in nutrition, adaptogens, and healthy routines. This expanded article takes a deeper dive into practical ways you can reinforce your wellness journey‚Äîthrough strategic supplementation, seasonal self-care, and incorporating Cozy Farm's curated best sellers and exclusive [Deals](https://mycozyfarm.com/pages/deals).

## 1. Strengthen Your Nutrition Strategy

Nutrition doesn‚Äôt stop at avoiding processed foods. To build resilience, energy, and gut health, you need a dynamic, nutrient-diverse plan. Cozy Farm offers a rich collection of [Organic Groceries](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/groceries) that includes sprouted grains, clean oils, and natural sweeteners.

Customer favorites like [Bob‚Äôs Red Mill Rolled Oats](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/bobs-red-mill-rolled-oats-1-each-32-oz) and [Earth Balance Natural Peanut Butter](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/earth-balance-natural-creamy-peanut-butter-1-each-16-oz) form the backbone of many breakfast rituals. Add seasonal fruits or fermented foods to support digestion. Don‚Äôt forget hydration‚Äînatural beverages like [Nooma Electrolyte Drink](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/nooma-organic-blueberry-peach-electrolyte-drink) help balance electrolytes during busy days or workouts.

## 2. Deepen Your Adaptogen Protocol

Adaptogens, when used intentionally, can reset your stress baseline. Start the morning with [Four Sigmatic Adaptogen Coffee](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/four-sigmatic-coffee-adptgn-ashwgnda-1-each-10-ct) or an herbal tonic like [Organic India Ashwagandha](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/organic-india-wellness-supplements-ashwagandha-1-each-90-vcap). These staples appear regularly in our [Health Supplements Collection](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/health-supplements).

Backed by research from the [NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/), ashwagandha supports cortisol reduction and balanced energy levels. Rhodiola and holy basil may also enhance focus and immunity‚Äîconsider cycling them weekly for optimal benefit.

## 3. Seasonally Aligned Lifestyle Routines

Each season influences our physical and emotional health. In winter, immunity is a top concern. Our [Immune Health](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/immune-health) lineup includes elderberry syrups and echinacea lozenges. Spring is ideal for cleansing with support from the [Detox & Cleanse](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/detox-cleanse-products) section.

Our rotating [Deals](https://mycozyfarm.com/pages/deals) section features seasonal wellness items at special pricing, updated regularly to keep you aligned with nature‚Äôs rhythms.

## 4. Mindfulness and Restorative Practices

Small daily habits‚Äîmeditation, journaling, slow walks‚Äîanchor our nervous systems. Harvard Health suggests mindfulness meditation can lower anxiety and improve resilience ([source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mindfulness-meditation-may-ease-anxiety-mental-stress)).

I don't care what color shirt my barista is wearing. What I do care about is getting a consistent beverage when I'm paying $7-8 bucks a pop. Perhaps you could try TRAINING YOUR BARISTAS so your customers receive the same drink at each store AND stop trying to become the blandest coffee chain in existence. I don't go to a caf√© to avoid my fellow freaks and outcasts, many of whom are also members of the LGBT community. A caf√©, at least from my perspective, ought to embrace expression, not try to subdue it. Smh.",7,1749240746.0,starbucks,5,0.71,False
