Hi! I was just surprisingly dx‚Äôd with nutcracker (80% compression, and borderline MALS at 60% compression) but my kidneys are highly functioning and I am not in pain. My POTS doc (cardiologist) says to avoid surgery in my case.

I‚Äôve always had occult blood in my urine, but my main complaint in life is extreme fatigue - if I am not having pain or most other NCS/MALS symptoms, is it unlikely that it is the cause of my ridiculous fatigue?

I am confirmed dx‚Äôd (and being successfully treated for): hEDS, POTS, Hashimotos (hypothyroidism)

I‚Äôve ruled out so much via a sleep study, comprehensive blood testing (typical blood testing plus detailed endocrine testing and immunological testing), whole genome sequencing, CTs, ultrasounds . I DON‚ÄôT have CFS/ME (no PEM).

I‚Äôm SO tired I‚Äôve had to quit my job - I was constantly zoning out at work and wish I was asleep every second of the day!!! Armodafinil, Wellbutrin and coffee haven‚Äôt done shit üò≠. I also want to pass out the second alc or edibles pass my lips and can‚Äôt hang out with people anymore because I start zoning out and wanting to go to sleep no matter the time of day. No matter how much I sleep/nap I‚Äôm haunted by this üòÇ. 

I‚Äôve cleaned up sleep hygiene, thyroid numbers are good, exercise according to the CHOP protocol and drink 2L water + 10g mixed salts per day. ",1,1728447024.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve exhausted all the patience we had  
Over harsh words and watered-down

You look like you just can‚Äôt wait to leave  
So I‚Äôll leave  


This country does nothing for me  
This relationship does nothing for me  
This year does nothing for me  
This fight does nothing for me  
Let the world do all the punishing  
& let your na√Øvet√© do all the wronging  


When I look back in anguish  
You eyes shut off like dead battery  
Your face colder than I remember  
An overdramatized farewell plays in my dreams  
Almost couldn‚Äôt tell they were dreams  except I know deep in my heart  
What could have been, won‚Äôt ever be  


You stand here at this airport departure  
I can‚Äôt make out all the words  
When my tears flood and your voice  
quavers  


I will be here waiting

Call me on my cell I‚Äôll come meet you  wherever

One friend was across the street, and the other friend wouldn't come into my life until we were 11 or 12; We were inseparable. We went to school together. Everything. 

When college rolled around we'd still meet up every couple months at a little coffee shop. 

They're the first two people I think of if I had some life event. They're the ones first ones I texted when my mom died. I text them a few minutes before their birthday so they know I wasn't reminded by Facebook - I remember. They didn't say anything then. 

Even though as adults we drift away to some degree, this caught me off-guard and quite honestly hurts my feelings. 

I was just on IG and saw that one of them got married and the other friebd was her photographer. Two years ago the same thing happened; one of them got married and the friend was in the background of pictures. We view each other's stories, leave comments, etc. 

This is going to sound arrogant, but with the first friend, I suspected there was a jealousy or insecurity because I am pretty - she didn't want to be upstaged? It would still hurt my feelings but it makes sense if she did. Last time she saw me I had also lost a lot of weight and was doing some modeling. I gained some weight back so 

It doesn't make sense for the friend I just was married. Neither had a famiy-only or super small weddings. I didn't even get invited. 

I didn't know I didn't have two friends like that anymore. I don't know what hurts my feelings more, if I wasn't even thought about it or if I was and still wasn't invited. 

I congratulated both but with my congratulations comments I included a ""I wish I had known. Congrats!"" I am happy for them but they can't say I wasn't there because I'm a bad friend; I guess I wasn't invited,even informed, or if I missed something they didn't text to make sure.  It feels a little petty but I think understandable why it would bother me and a polite (perhaps petty?) way of saying that.

I am a 29-year-old (male) recent master‚Äôs grad, and ever since the start of the pandemic, I moved back home with my parents after living on my own for most of my early to mid 20‚Äôs Back in 2021, I got a job in my field and was saving up to move out. But by the time I was ready, the company got bought out, and I was let go after only 7 months. I spent the rest of the year applying to other jobs with no luck until I decided to go back to school and get my master‚Äôs, all the while living at home with my older parents‚Äîthey are in their early 70s and mid-60s, respectively.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my family, and I always want them to be a part of my life, but right now, it‚Äôs proving to be quite a struggle. 

You see, both of my parents are retired and spend nearly 80% of their time at home on the couch in the main room of our home, just reading their Kindles and talking to each other. They hardly ever go out except to the rec center to work out for about an hour, 2-3 days a week in the morning. They never have friends over or go out. This means I am pretty much stuck in my room, whittling away at refining my resume, portfolio, and cover letters as I apply for jobs.

It can be quite hard sometimes because of how my parents behave. My dad, for example, is always doing this dopey commentary on everything I am doing. I could be eating lunch, and every time my dad would say, ‚ÄúEating lunch, I see.‚Äù If I go out for a walk or hang out with my friends, the moment I open the door, my dad will go and say something like, ‚ÄúAh, the intrepid traveler returns,‚Äù or ask, ‚ÄúDid you go for a walk? Did you take any nice pictures?‚Äù He‚Äôs always in my face, and it can be quite annoying. He‚Äôs also constantly saying things like, ‚ÄúGot any looky los on that resume?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDid you send that company you applied for last week  ping asking about any updates ?‚Äù I know this is coming from a good place, but sometimes I want to be left alone with my thoughts and figure stuff out. The other side to my dad is that if he‚Äôs not doing his dopey commentary shtick, he‚Äôs trying to have these very in-depth academic conversations that feel more like lectures on whatever topic he‚Äôs been reading about. I could be on the couch reading or whatever, and my dad will get up in my face and want to have a long, one-sided conversation about quantum theory or the impact of the First World War on the Middle East . I‚Äôm fine with have those types of conversations every once in a while, but they become so one-sided, and he ends up doing all the talking. They are basically the only way he communicates with me. 

My mom, on the other hand, is quite an anxious person, and her anxiety gets imprinted on me. I remember when my parents got a new lawn mower this summer, and I was about to mow the lawn. My mom, in a very nervous tone of voice, was asking me if I felt comfortable using it and whether I would like my dad to help me mow the lawn. It‚Äôs a freaking lawn mower; how hard can it be? She also does a lot of infantilizing of me and my brother. My brother, who is only two years younger, will come home at like 11:30 pm on any given night and ask my mom to make him dinner. With no please or thank you. Most of the time, the food is basic microwavable personal pizzas or hot dogs and some rice‚Äîbasic stuff that a 27-year-old man can and should be able to make on his own. She almost will always wake him up at noon and make him his own breakfast. I ask why she does it, and she responds, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never turn down an opportunity to help one of my kids out.‚Äù I feel like this behavior has stunted his personal growth and plus prevented him from developing any self-reliance. 

I know this living situation is not as bad as it could be, and I am very thankful that I have a place to live as I get my life sorted out. But at times, I feel like I need my own space and not have to worry about my parents constantly coddling me. It‚Äôs why, lately, I‚Äôve been spending most of my days in coffee shops away from them. Apologies for the long post, but I needed to get that off my chest. Is anyone else in a similar situation? What Tips do you use with livng with older boomer parents who are retried?

I've tried dating apps like Bumble, Tinder, and Hinge. I've looked on Facebook dating and found nothing. I'm relatively shy, and find it hard to bring myself to find someone. If I see a girl with her friends, I back out because I don't want to bother

I've also experienced this stigma of waiting a few months to ask a girl out, to talk to them more. Just grabbing a coffee, and taking a walk in the park would be more than what I could ever hope for at the moment

What do you think I should do? Many people might ask ""What's the rush?"", but it's not about rushing. It would be nice to be with someone, someone to confide in at the end of the day

Spending time with someone who isn't my friend or family would be a nice change of pace

If anyone was in my situation, what did you do to overcome it?

Going to a bar? Finding someone on campus?

1fzijlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fzijlm/disowned_by_family/,Disowned by family,"I've just had a talk with someone who used to be my brother after 10 years of no contact. And my wife thinks I should give them another chance. I categorically said no.

I grew up with second child syndrome constantly being neglected by my parents or beaten.  By my late 20 I'd been disowned by my family about 3 times for daring to speak out about how I felt or the fact they were now ignoring my daughter.

During this 3rd time being disowned my wife coaxed me to give them another chance. I told her okay but when we have a child (the eldest girl isn't hers) and my parents neglect her I will not be saying anything about it. I will not be saying anything again. 
Fast forward a few years and we have a girl, it's now killing my wife they are neglecting her daughter. I told her I understand but I'm not doing this again.


My wife confronts my parents about what they have done to me over the years and my daughters. It gets so bad I have to go in and have a talk with my parents to explain to them how I felt growing up. I told them I don't blame them it just happened. Well they disowned me again.

3 months later I'm involved in a serious car crash. I suffer a brain injury,  PTSD,  right arm reattached and have severe depression. My parents come to see me, I tell them as far as I'm concerned I died that night and can we start again. This was in 2010.

For a few years I'm really bad and at a few stages I was close to being admitted to the mental ward. My wife is busy coping trying to hold everything together and begs my family for any type of support. I got absolutely none. My wife goes to them and breaks down again begging for help with me (I'm not doing anything bad, extremely suicidal).

Again I get no support, I phone my father and tell him we need to talk. I wanted to work this out, I needed him to be a father to me for the first time in his life. Just call out and take me for a walk 

Later that night about 11 a letter pops through the letterbox. From my parents, you guessed it. They disowned me, they had seen my medical reports, they knew I was suicidal. They knew my 7 year old daughter had taken to cuting herself because she couldn't cope with what had happened to her father and was seeing a counsellor. At this stage I now had 4 kids and couldn't work. 

The hurt and anger I felt was beyond anything I'd ever experienced. Slowly over the next few weeks my brothers and sisters walked away from me.

This was in 2014, I was seeing the brain injury team along with a psychologist, family counsellors and taking antidepressants. Along with a list of pain killers as I was in chronic pain with my arm.

Last year I happened to see my father out, I went over to his car and said to him. I will never understand how yous did what yous did but I forgive yous. I wish you no harm and wish you well but you will never be my father again. (I did this for him, I can't forgive them but at least they can have some peace).

Bar seeing my father nobody has come near me in 10 years. They have never tried to contact any of my children.  A few days ago my wife was in work and I accidentally put my phone on do not disturb. My wife phones  me constantly throughout the day as no matter what treatment I've received I still feel suicidal all the time. She couldn't get through and thought I had done something. 

I was awoken by the police, then the ambulance then in the midst of this the door knocks again. I open the door to my mother, I couldn't deal with this and said nope not today and closed the door.

Apparently my mother then sent me a text along with one of my brothers. I have long since changed my number. I know this because they contacted my eldest daughter. I did not want them coming near my door so I asked my daughter to get my brothers number. I wanted to tell him, I'm nothing to do with them anymore 

Today I was asleep when my brother called (I still need to sleep twice during the day).
My wife had brought him in against me saying under no circumstances are any of my family ever to be let into my house.

I did not ever want to speak to any of them ever again, I cannot and will not accept what they have done to me. I told him, I'm not your brother anymore and I will never be again. The anger in me was palatable, I have never gotten over this hurt. 

When he finally left he said your still my brother and asked for a hug. I told him to tell himself whatever he'd needs to so he can get through the day but don't go saying it to me. I said what was left of your brother after the crash you abandoned. He wanted to leave his number and I refused and told him never to come near my door again him or any of his family.

I said if you see me out and want to wave or nod, I'll do likewise but do not try speaking to me. 

My wife who witnessed me go through all this tried to make me hug him, then tried to make me shake his hand, i refused. She wants me to give them another chance.

As I write this my head is messed up, I can't seem to explain to my wife. I had to let them go, I couldn't live the rest of my life waiting for them to finally do the right thing. Somewhere between 2014 and 2018 I moved on and accepted they weren't my family anymore. 

My wife's parents said to me at the time of the letter, it's okay you can be our son. Between her parents and her brothers and sisters they took me to all my medical appointments and there were tons. They put food on my table and clothes on my children's backs. They lent me thousands, they help me with my kids.

My neighbours called in every day to help me, see I was okay they still do.

I wish them no ill will but I cannot forgive them for abandoned me in that state. I can't believe my wife put me through that, she knows I no longer want them. She hated them for what they did to me and for abandoned her kids. 

However she wants me to forgive them for my mental state, she hopes it may help me somewhat just to be taken for a coffee or a walk.

I honestly can't, at the lowest point in my life my parents could have actually helped me for once. They walked away, I can't and won't ever give them another chance to hurt me again.

I know with my brain injury I don't always see things clearly, but I fail to see how I'm wrong in saying what I'm saying. I can't do it anymore, they left me, I get to decide if I want them back. And I don't.",1,1728445122.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

For a bit of background, I'm a 24 year old woman who was recently diagnosed with adhd just this year and I've always had this issue with food. You see I often have days where I can binge eat all of my favorite snacks and meals with no problem and still be hungry. However, I also experience days where I'll end up craving a meal, or being offered a meal, and being absolutely unable to eat it. 

For example, just the other day I had no problem eating my lunch and dinner. Hell I was even craving everything I made. Yet today I'm suddenly hit with a severe pang of food aversion. I only drank some coffee today and when I finally decided to eat a late lunch, a chipotle bowl,  I couldn't bring myself to finish it or even stomach it after a few bites. The crazy thing is that it was my first meal throughout the whole day and I just couldn't bring myself to eat it as ended up feeling nauseous and sick. Thinking it was just the chipotle itself I ate some food my family had ended up making, only to struggle and take about 2 to almost 3 hours just to eat a small bowl of veggies and rice.

Does anyone else just suddenly suffer from a bad case of food aversion?? I've had this happen to me many times in the past and it always annoys and worries the people around me because I'm stuck at the dinner table for like 2 hours just to finish a small plate of chicken and rice. I just feel like I'm going crazy sometimes and that my relationship with food is way more skewed than I thought. 


TLDR: Took me almost 2 to 3 hours just to eat a small bowl of veggies and rice all cause I suddenly found it disgusting and couldn't bring myself to eat it even though I'm extremely hungry right now. Am I crazy?? ",1,1728445028.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I get a 16 oz iced caramel macchiato with four shots, and oat milk. My boyfriend gets the same, but with two shots on weekdays.

He said that it‚Äôs an awesome hobby for ‚Äúpretty women‚Äù. I just chalked it up to language barrier.

He told me that he sees this as a red flag because as a woman I should be possessive over my man. I said relationships are built with trust, and if my next partner wouldn‚Äôt like any of my friends then they‚Äôre not the one for me. With that he cut the date short.

I always like to give some introductions. I am a 21M and I've been roleplaying content like this for the past year or two and have just wrapped up some very long-term roleplays. I'm looking to get out and start a few roleplays with others (18+ partners only please)! I do live in a very awkward timezone that we can discuss later. But I will always respond within 12 hours! Or if I'm available within less than an hour

I always prefer doing OC/OC content (I will have a few plots down below!) But I will¬†***GLADLY***¬†get into some OC/Character from your fav show/game/movie/universe. I don't have many plots for those but I'm so willing to draft something up! Anyway here are a few of my OC/OC roleplays I've decided to try out.

**1: Setting:**¬†A very small town, way off the forgotten path. Nestled in the mountains, Popular for its stunning natural beauty and close-knit community. Very common for artists, and people who want to lie low in the town. and those seeking peace among breathtaking landscapes. (takes place in Medival times (Can always be changed))

**1: Characters:**¬†MY OC - A charismatic bard who has also found refuge in the town, captivated by its beautiful atmosphere and inspiration. Found himself playing at the local Tavern every night, singing Folk songs often singing of the wars out west. Or adventures he has had in the past. our initial Contact is brief but leaves a lingering impression... Will there be mutual curiosity?

**2: Setting:**¬†A charming caf√© located in the heart of a vibrant urban neighborhood, surrounded by eclectic shops, art galleries, and street musicians. The caf√© has a cozy atmosphere, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of soft jazz music.

\*\*2: Character:\*\* My Oc(or yours!) would be a barista at the caf√©, known for their exceptional coffee-making skills and warm smile. They take pride in creating a welcoming space for customers but often keep their personal life private.

**3:**¬†Bring your plots!! I'm willing to create a plot for really any situation! My only request is it's got some romance! Whether it's an SOL, Slow burner, or a fantasy world! I'm all for it. I will gladly work with you to find us a plot we will both enjoy doing in the long run!

**4:**¬†a few SOL roleplays!

Caregiver Dynamic: One character helps another recover from an injury or illness. The process of caregiving and the vulnerability it brings out in both of them slowly builds a deeper connection.

Unexpected Roommates: Due to a mix-up, two strangers end up sharing an apartment. Their initially awkward cohabitation turns into a comfortable companionship and eventually, love.

***I rarely Rp here on Reddit as I tend to forget about my message box :( So please bring a different form of contact! OFC message me on here first or comment so we can get something going!!***

TLDR: I'm an experienced roleplayer who would love to get some new long-term roleplays going!!

If I have started something with you in the past and have suddenly left I will gladly explain myself!

1fzhvhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/murdershewrote/comments/1fzhvhy/jessicas_house_in_the_sims_4_detailed_from/,Jessica's house in the Sims 4 (detailed & from reference!!) PART 1,"I grew up watching *murder she wrote* every tuesday with my mom. I recently became re obsessed with it because of the 24-7 Roku channel dedicated EXCLUSIVLEY to Jessica Fletcher. So I decided it was time to marry my two great loves and recreate JB's Cabot Cove house in the sims 4! Note: this build uses custom content (player created items) EXTENSIVLEY and loads of packs. (just counted - 40 of them). 

I spent about 4 weeks on this, so please let me know your thoughts! I'd love suggestions for more little easter eggs!!

**Floorplan:**

* Throughout the whole build, I was balancing matching Murder She Wrote's sound stage interiors & the 'real life' murder she wrote house - Blair house in Mendocino, California. The producers did a pretty good job keeping the dimensions in mind, but they do not match exactly. The master bedroom in particular gave me trouble -- there are so many weird angles!!! 
   * I also had to fabricate several rooms whole cloth because I just couldn't find any reference images, nor any in episode appearances. This applies to ALL OF THE BATHROOMS & the weird in between spaces we just don't see, despite knowing they MUST exist. 
* For the first floor, I had loads of help from murdershewroteshewrote.com's amazing & super detailed article, ""an iconic victorian"" ([An Iconic Victorian ‚Äì Murder, She Wrote, She Wrote (murdershewroteshewrote.com)](https://murdershewroteshewrote.com/2024/04/07/a-certain-victorian/))

*Processing img 2ekfqivgqgtd1...*

*Processing img htq3tafqrgtd1...*

The only major change to the overall shape was the mystery bump out - in real life, it's a long rectangle. I started with a smaller rectangle but ended up with a 5x5 square as I made concessions to the upstairs. 

*Processing img lpvqd6hysgtd1...*

* The second-floor layout was much trickier - we don't see many of these rooms at all, and the ones we do, it's rare to see characters moving in and out of them to get a sense of they fit together. I ended up kind of copying the downstairs. 
* The only information I could glean was that a) Jessica's room is at the top of the stairs on the right side (visual confirmation) b) the guest room was also right at the top of the stairs with the bathroom right next to it?? (Donna Mayberry in season 6, episode 21 ""The Szechuan Dragon"").
*  I was left with a lot of awkward space & doors leading to places I didn't have space for. Off of Jessica's bedroom, I had the door at the back lead a sort of dressing area & closet & then the bathroom. 
   * In ""The Szechuan Dragon"", the guest room is a lot bigger than I could accommodate, and the bathroom is clearly adjacent to it rather than down the hall. Oh well. I only saw the episode a good way into this build. I was flying by the seat of my pants until I had to totally re-do the guest room! 

**Exterior:** 

note - this build is in Brindleton Bay! Brindleton Bay is based on New England coastal fishing towns in the United States, particularly from the state of Maine!! Jess is right by the water, and can see the lighthouse from her backyard :)

*Processing img awjtf1v5vgtd1...*

For the front of the house, I pretty much copied Blair house. An entirely white house didn't look so great in the sims, so I tried to add texture and detail where I could. I had to piece together the fence because there are no three tile gates!! Please note Jessica's iconic bicycle! Jessica never drives a car - ‚Äúbecause it precludes, in a sense, the need for car chases."" to quote Angela Lansbury. 

*Processing img u0wy35hiwgtd1...*

The door was a different color in many photos - sometimes it's white, and others it's green or blue. 

*Processing img 26to04v3wgtd1...*

I included lots of flowers & several garden beds. In my head, Jessica is a big gardener. But I can't point to any specific instances, other than during earlier seasons intro sequence. 

*Processing img llt6f7q5wgtd1...*

*Processing img ix96amq6wgtd1...*

the back porch! I figured out later on that it was screened in. However, on Blair house, it's a full room. I decided to side with Blair house on this one, because the sims doesn't really have a way of making good looking screened in porches, much to my chagrin. I included an outdoor sink, the flower arranging table, and a wee little wind chime. I thought Jess would be careful to not track mud into the house. 

*Processing img jfz1vq8bwgtd1...*

*Processing img r2a3et29xgtd1...*

(Balls. I was trying to find a reference I used & found this video \[[Step inside Jessica Fletcher's ""Murder, She Wrote"" Blair House for photography (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79dRURhZ86g)\] showing a TOWER on her back porch that i didn't know existed till just now. Man!!)

**The entryway:** 

*Processing img jf0sm17xaltd1...*

*Processing img ow68qbbgaltd1...*

I think I got the basics down past here - a mirror with coats hanging on the corners, an umbrella stand, and the basket on one side. I'm just now noticing that the bird pictures I hung on the left have been deleted. The entryway is more narrow than in the reference, so I kind of had to smoosh things. The clock is on the opposite side. Also??? Has anyone noticed the door is different on the inside and outside??

I had a hard time matching wallpapers throughout the whole house! Jessica has lovely, detailed walls & soft tan paneling. The sims. does not have that. 

**Sitting Room:**

*Processing img 069upkohtmtd1...*

*Processing img hgjt6aaktmtd1...*

*Processing img azxuc4gmtmtd1...*

* Set up:
   * Jessica's house has a raised entryway. This looks super cute in the hallway, but gave me major trouble /everywhere/ else. The sims does not let you place stairs at a doorway. You also cannot wallpaper sunken segments. I simply did not have room nor logistical power to incorporate the steps. Sad! we love a split level! Simply was a nightmare. Alas..
   * I also couldn't faithfully recreate the fireplace. She's against a wall instead of on an angle.
* Color changes:
   * Jessica's living room is really blue. When I had everything in blue, it looked so soulless and sad and not Jessica-y at all! The sims can replicate form really well, but it often falls short with texture. I particularly missed the shiny layers of furniture wax on everything. In the show, loads of items also have patterns, graphics, or other details. I chose to introduce more variation in color to keep a more cheerful and cozy vibe. 
   * The paneling & wallpaper also gave me some trouble! A huge thanks to landverbunny for creating the vintage wallpaper and victorian millwork mod. It really added loads of detail without feeling modern or overwhelming. I really wanted this room to feel light and welcoming.
* Where does that piece of furniture go?? - There are three chairs in this room. A blue high back, a fat leather chair, and then a skinny little square guy. As I kept my eye out for the living room while watching MSW, the chairs! kept! shifting!!! they are in different places all the time!! I opted to remove the square guy, because its placement was awkward, and I couldn't find a good sims equivalent. RIP. 
* Jury-rigging furniture - Murder she wrote has a lot of unique, beautiful pieces without good sims equivalents. 
   * the fireplace. Jessica's fireplace is so beautiful and ornate. I really wanted to do it justice, but the options for a fireplace that isn't absolutely massive are limited. I used a fireplace from the university expansion & added a cc mirror on top. I wanted to add more dimension, so I tried using columns, then corbels, & in a fit of desperation, sized down statues and 9 keyed them up. Nothing looked right, so I'm left with a slightly lack luster hearth. 
   * Magazine holder side table. I've never seen a table like this. It's so curvy & strange. It looks like the Boston dynamics robo-dog. I ended up smooshing together a narrow side table & the remote holder from the parenthood pack. 
   * The window seat. for a good long while, I didn't even know there was a window seat! I used a window seat from cats and dogs, but it's built specifically for, like, trapezium bump out bits. So I ended up sizing down several side tables & nine key'd them to the right height. I had to remove them again to place the clutter. The things we do for love. 
* No canaries :((( I love Jessica's cute little canaries. It surprises me that she never has a cat or dog during the series; I think she'd love having a little friend. However, there aren't any pet birds in the sims, and I couldn't find any cute mods. As an homage, I put down an item called the bird cage. I guess it kind of looks like one? 
* My favorite corner
   * To be so real, I think the desk is my FAVORITE part of this whole build. Werewolves has a perfect match!! I gave Jessica a rolodex and an answering machine. I was thinking of her jewel thief friend, Dennis Stanton. The desk is where Jessica plays voicemails to introduce bookend episodes.
   * A pair of slippers. You KNOW she wants to be WARM.
   * A little pair of glasses. One for every room.
   * Also!! I just love the curtains. Pocci's lace curtains on curse forge were an mvp!!! I used them multiple times in every room. 

  
Alright. Reddit's not letting me add anymore images, and we've only gone through two rooms!! In order to do each room justice, I've elected to split this up into multiple parts. I apologize for the length of this post - I packed every corner of this house with detail, and I'm just so excited to talk about it all!! A special shout to my wonderful mother who was very impressed by all this. Also to my autism. Couldn't have done it without the autism. Cheers!!",7,1728442837.0,murdershewrote,0,1.0,False

Maybe I can offer to cook more at his place rather than mine to make it seem more sacrificial?

For those who don‚Äôt know, they‚Äôre a new big coffee shop with both seating and a drive thru right near the Book Exchange. They have a really handsome building, with bright blue and dark colors. 

I went there a week or two ago because I work close by. I went for my lunch break. I looked at the menu on their app beforehand. That location at the time wasn‚Äôt registered on the app. When I went in person to order, the sandwich I wanted they didn‚Äôt have (I saw it on the app). I ordered a different one. They‚Äôre still new, so there‚Äôs always going to be some weird stuff going on. The sandwich was good - it was a bigger portion than a Starbucks sandwich. But it tasted the same. I was a bit disappointed in the potatos, as they weren‚Äôt really crispy and the cheese wasn‚Äôt melted (it was just shredded on). The London fog (I got the pumpkin one with honey) was delicious though.

Where I became disappointed was the cleanliness of the area. I sat down at the booth closest to the window. The table was covered in crumbs and had a sticky spot prior to me being there. New people sitting down had to wipe off the tables before sitting down. And the employees were just talking behind the counter. I would‚Äôve liked to have seen that time just quickly wiping down a table that was recently vacated, especially at such a new spot. 

I also noticed that I‚Äôve never once seen anyone use the drive thru. I‚Äôm a standard 8-5‚Äôr. The parking lot when I did pull in was really wonky/beat up, and I would like to see that revised. 

I found it funny because after that, I got a text from Mozevo that they were looking for investors. They had a high valuation for their business, and I honestly just couldn‚Äôt see it happening. I also found it hilarious that Loose Caboose rented a billboard right across the street from Mozevo.

Title: Orange Encounters

Jack locates the employment agency wedged between a haberdashery and a delicatessen. He finds no joy in these compulsory appointments, and behind the graffiti-ridden door, he creates demand for a position nobody wants.

‚ÄòRachel will see you when she‚Äôs ready.‚Äô The receptionist smiles and points to a row of plastic, mismatched picnic chairs lined against the wall. ‚ÄòTake a seat, she won‚Äôt be too long.‚Äô

Further amplifying his irritation, Jack loathes Rachel‚Äôs bright orange two-piece suit. She stands out more than necessary and draws attention to herself. A Dunedin girl, she drifted into a Human Resources role after the Education Department rejected her application. At some point, the dickheads refused to acknowledge her New Zealand Bachelor of Arts degree.

‚ÄòFor your information, this is a job interview,‚Äô Rachel says, lowering her glasses. ‚ÄòNext time, put some polish on those shoes and turn the iron on.‚Äô 

‚ÄòI‚Äôve got a tie on, don‚Äôt I? And it‚Äôs a proper Windsor knot,‚Äô Jack replies and leans forward to grab a mint from Rachel‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm more than adequately dressed for the occasion.‚Äô

‚ÄòIs that right?‚Äô A stern Rachel slaps Jack‚Äôs hand and places the bowl out of his reach. ‚ÄòThe mints are not for you.‚Äô

Scared straight, Jack shies away and reverts to only providing his name, address, and social security number. Any other information irrelevant towards achieving the objective is unnecessary. What he did over the weekend is none of Rachel‚Äôs business, and he upholds his right to avoid small talk. 

In his mid-twenties and on the dole, Jack hasn‚Äôt worked a day in six months. Content to receive free money after endless rejections for entry-level positions, he‚Äôs given up on applying for jobs. His unemployment benefits run low, and every interview feels like a farce. There‚Äôs no room for another dickhead in this world, and with each passing day, the hope of escaping his predicament fades.

‚ÄòLook, your resume isn‚Äôt exactly a match for this job.‚Äô Rachel caps her pen and takes a liking to Jack. ‚ÄòFrankly, your chances are slim to none.‚Äô

‚ÄòWell, there‚Äôs a few minutes that I'll never get back.‚Äô Jack‚Äôs smile catches Rachel‚Äôs eye as he undoes his tie. ‚ÄòThank you for wasting my time.‚Äô

Whether their paths cross again remains uncertain, but the thought lingers in Rachel‚Äôs mind. She migrated to Australia over the summer for a fresh start, opting for Melbourne over Brisbane. The cooler climate and cultural appeal won her over. Yet, she struggles to acclimatise to the customary wayward weather.

‚ÄòI guess we're both stuck in this dead-end system,‚Äô Rachel mutters and scribbles something on her notepad. ‚ÄòHow about we‚Ä¶ discuss this over coffee? I don‚Äôt usually do this.‚Äô

‚ÄòEven the gatekeepers get pissed off.‚Äô Jack raises an eyebrow, catching the rare vulnerability in her voice. ‚ÄòA cappuccino, latte or any other type of coffee is not in my budget, but thanks.‚Äô

The shame of his poverty gnaws at him, making the idea of sitting down for coffee unbearable. He can‚Äôt even scrape together enough money for a packet of mixed lollies, let alone a coffee. What‚Äôs worse is the hollow feeling that he‚Äôs run out of things to pawn. One object at a time, he‚Äôs slowly disappearing from the world.

‚ÄòSome of us didn‚Äôt choose this either,‚Äô Rachel says and points towards the door. ‚ÄòI wish you all the best, but I have a long list to interview.‚Äô

‚ÄòYou must be living the dream,‚Äô Jack replies and stares out the window. ‚ÄòLook on the bright side, at least the sun is out.‚Äô 

No further persuasion is required, and Rachel‚Äôs forthrightness remains fresh in his mind. Too lazy to walk home, he takes the No.19 tram and reflects on the interview. No one has been that blunt with him in a long time, and it‚Äôs refreshing in a weird way. He smirks at the thought of her choice of clothing and that suit was a definite mistake.

Back in the office, Rachel's frustration simmers as the mundane repetitiveness slows down time. Another day and another line of applicants shows no interest in the vacant position. Restless, she locks the graffiti-ridden door behind her and longs for a caffeine fix.

‚ÄòThe bastard wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to snatch the last fucking sandwich from the platter,‚Äô she mumbles to herself and blends into the chaotic patchwork of pedestrians. ‚ÄòGod bless his soul.‚Äô

She disappears down the street, espresso in hand, and her mind drifts back to the day‚Äôs events. There‚Äôs a skip in her step, as she scans the faces, half-hoping to see Jack among the passersby. Perplexed by the fixation she clings to the possibility of a chance meeting. 

Jack‚Äôs defiance in the face of rejection strikes a chord with Rachel. She too was once broke and alone in New Zealand and Jack‚Äôs current predicament resonates with her own experiences. His belligerent attitude and the fire in his eyes, when he undid his tie and stormed out of the office, won her over.

Meanwhile, in his dingy flat, Jack leans back in his worn-out armchair and counts the ceiling cracks. Cobwebs cover the corners, and that bright orange suit remains embedded deep in his mind. Indeed, not a Melbourne colour, but something about her no-nonsense attitude intrigues him.

He replays their exchange, recalling her bluntness and despite the angst, this strange encounter may be the start of something different. An unspoken spark exists between them and for the first time in months, hope doesn‚Äôt feel quite so distant. The thought of a future with her fills him with a newfound sense of purpose, a reason to keep going.

The End.

1fzhken,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minairfanthescammer/comments/1fzhken/her_comments/,Her Comments,"As usual her going live was to scare women into thinking she has the solution after scaring them as you can see in first slide. She is not changing the planet, she is constantly changing her narrative to keep women feeling like we are never enough and if we send her on a shopping spree and help her to move into a mansion, or buy a Lexus like she is buying coffee; she will share the solution with us.

Someone asked what qaulifies her to talk about the subject. I believe it a sensible question all things considered. Her qualifications arent readily avaible online so it is only natural that the answer to that question would have to come from her.
She answers the question very vaguely: did not say which university she studied at and what level of qualifications she attained in the subject she is claiming to be an expert in. Based on what she has said over the years, she left university maybe two decades ago and if we know anything about evolutionary studies, biology and science; it is that new discoveries are always being made so where is she getting her updated information from that qualifies her as an expert?

Dr. Tara Swart's qualifications are easily available online. Not sure if this person was using the doctor's expertise to cosign what the scammer is peddling or if she was telling the other woman where she can start with her own research. Either way, the original commentor wanted to know what makes the scammer qualified to be a figure of authority in the topic she is speaking on.
The defensiveness of the one who chose to respond is just so unncessary. The scammer can handle herself. She really does not need youy armouring up to tell someone that she is free to do her own research. Again, it is not a matter of whether or not what is being said is valid, it is about if the mouthpiece it is coming from actually studied this stuff or if she is just regurgitating stuff.

What I noticed is how uncertain they are about the scammer's capabilities and knowledge themselves. The woman did not say she disagrees with what was said, she just wants to know what qualifies her. As we all know, the scammer likes to do the ""word dance"" so you have to be very direct and concise when you want her to answer any question that expose her. She goes on to call what the scammer is yapping about an ""opinion"", not facts or legitimate findings from research, observations and or studies; but OPINIONS.

Are we still in the era of going off what resonates with us when it comes on to the scammer? Being smart doesnt mean you only rely on gut feelings, it means you are also logical and open minded enough to listen to both sides of the coin. She attracted smart women, women who are also resourceful enough to  make the money she needs go to Brazilian steakhouses and women who are vulnerable. The women she is attracting now...

Side note: Every femininity coach has been yapping about the subject matter she chose to yap about today so what else could she be saying that we havent heard as yet? She really is trying to run back to what grew her channel the fastest. Perhaps she can find another black woman or lantina femininity influencer/coach to monkey bar her out of this slump.",1,1728441822.0,Minairfanthescammer,0,1.0,False

We would like to install a water filter under the smaller sink to use for drinking water, coffee, filling pet bowls, cooking, etc. During my search, I've come across a lot of different products but no clear winner.

I'd also prefer that it filters PFAS, which doesn't seem to be a guarantee. 

My one question with all this is, do any of these systems come with indicators that the filter needs to be changed? I've looked at numerous filter systems and none have explicitly mentioned filter indicators. Am I just supposed to change it on a set schedule? Based on vibes? What's the deal here?

1fzhj2d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fzhj2d,NW KTown sublet - 2 parking spots included,"I am renting out my 2 bed/2 bath as a 1 bed/1bath apartment for a short term sublease. Looking to spend a month deep in the desert with no worries about bills. Rent is negotiable:
$2300/month - Weekly plant helper included. 
$2100/month - commit to taking care of plants. 
Security deposit is $1000, fully refundable minus bills. You‚Äôll get free WiFi and a $50 credit towards electric, all other bills are covered by the complex owner.

What you get: a fully furnished apartment with bright light, good airflow, quiet neighbors, safe and walkable tree-filled neighborhood, a cooker‚Äôs kitchen with dishwasher, 2 HEPA air purifiers, a balcony great for people watching, 65‚Äù 4K television, two parking spots (secured gate, in tandem), new pay-by-app washing and drying machines (ground floor), and access to the rooftop area for bbqs and socializing. Bedroom can come unfurnished if you wish to bring your own things. 

The location is a short walk from both Larchmont Ave (farmers market on Wed and Sun) and the thick of Koreatown, which has everything you could want in terms of late night food, cafes, nightlife, etc. Hop on the Purple/D line for a quick subway ride to Staples/Crypto/whatever Center, downtown Los Angeles/Arts District, Union Station for the shuttle to Dodger Stadium or the LAX Fly Away, and other major connections that can take you all over the city. Multiple major buslines at your doorstep take you to Hollywood, WeHo, and SoFi Stadium, and the Wilshire rapid bus to Santa Monica is only a 10 minute walk away (stops at UCLA). Quick access to the 10 and 101 freeways.

What to be aware of: this is an old building, so you will notice wear and tear and an absence of luxury amenities. If you have pet allergies this home may not be for you; while I have the air purifiers there is a small dog that lives here along with me (dog will be elsewhere during rental time); that being said, no animals allowed unless ESA/service. In order to sublease you will need to fill out a simple rental form for the property manager for a background check (no credit check in this process). 

Curious about the location? Feel free to ask any questions! The neighborhood probably has whatever you‚Äôre looking for, and I‚Äôm happy to give recs. Some of my favorites within a mile walking distance: Biergarten (Korean-German sports bar, trivia on Tuesdays), California Market (Korean/Asian supermarket), several coffee shops set up for remote work (some very late night), Liu‚Äôs Cafe, Here‚Äôs Looking at You, Noshi Sushi, Tacos Juquilita (evening/late night, handmade tortillas), Birria Amigos (weekends, daytime), Pollo a La Brasa, Cafe Nandarang, Southland Beer, Bangladeshi markets, AYCE sushi, AYCE KBBQ, dessert shops galore, Larchmont farmers markets, the KTown clubbing scene. Trader Joe‚Äôs just a couple miles down the street, along with The Grove, Target, LACMA, etc.

So I work for a window cleaning company where we have an office but we only go in 1 or 2 times a week. 

We hop in a work van and get driven to multiple jobs sites a day. The problem that I‚Äôm having with this is that he will pay for the commute in the morning but once we finish the last job of the day our day ends. So the commute back to Toronto in the company vehicle we don‚Äôt get paid for which at times can be 1-2 hours. I just don‚Äôt think that is legal. 

What also makes me question this is that I was not feeling great last week and went home after 5hrs one day. Then I got told by my boss last night that he was only going to pay me for 4hrs because he wasn‚Äôt going to pay me to sit in the van for the first hour and drink coffee because it took us an hour to get to the job.

* The Importance of Cognitive Health

**Understanding Cognitive Health**

Cognitive health is about how well your brain works. This includes things like remembering information, paying attention, learning new skills, and solving problems. When your cognitive health is good, everyday tasks become easier.

* The Role of Cognitive Function in Daily Life

Think about your typical day. You need to remember appointments, focus on work or school tasks, make decisions, and learn new things. All of these activities rely on your brain functioning well. When your mind is sharp, you can handle these tasks more easily and feel more confident.

* Common Cognitive Health Challenges

As we get older or when we're stressed, we might notice some changes in how our brains work. Maybe you:

* Forget names or dates more often
* Have trouble concentrating on tasks
* Feel like your thinking is slower than usual
* Struggle to multitask like you used to

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

CogniCare Pro is intended to promote mental clarity, potentially reducing that foggy feeling some people experience. The combination of ingredients is meant to support overall cognitive function, which could lead to feeling more alert and mentally sharp throughout the day.

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

While many users might be looking for immediate effects, CogniCare Pro is also designed with long-term brain health in mind. Regular use of the supplement aims to provide ongoing support for cognitive function, potentially helping to maintain mental acuity as you age.

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

Some ingredients in CogniCare Pro, such as Bacopa Monnieri and Rhodiola Root, are believed to have stress-reducing properties. By potentially lowering stress levels, the supplement may indirectly support better cognitive function and overall well-being.

* **Antioxidant Support**

Several ingredients in CogniCare Pro have antioxidant properties. These compounds may help protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in cognitive decline.

* **Natural Energy Support**

While some other cognitive enhancers work on the principle of stimulants for energy, CogniCare Pro seems to be designed a bit differently and naturally. This could result in long-term mental energy without the ‚Äòcrashes‚Äô that are common with other caffeine-laden supplements.¬†

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

CogniCare Pro is intended to promote mental clarity, potentially reducing that foggy feeling some people experience. The combination of ingredients is meant to support overall cognitive function, which could lead to feeling more alert and mentally sharp throughout the day.

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

While many users might be looking for immediate effects, CogniCare Pro is also designed with long-term brain health in mind. Regular use of the supplement aims to provide ongoing support for cognitive function, potentially helping to maintain mental acuity as you age.

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

Some ingredients in CogniCare Pro, such as Bacopa Monnieri and Rhodiola Root, are believed to have stress-reducing properties. By potentially lowering stress levels, the supplement may indirectly support better cognitive function and overall well-being.

* **Antioxidant Support**

Several ingredients in CogniCare Pro have antioxidant properties. These compounds may help protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in cognitive decline.

* **Natural Energy Support**

While some other cognitive enhancers work on the principle of stimulants for energy, CogniCare Pro seems to be designed a bit differently and naturally. This could result in long-term mental energy without the ‚Äòcrashes‚Äô that are common with other caffeine-laden supplements.¬†

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study.

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

CogniCare Pro is intended to promote mental clarity, potentially reducing that foggy feeling some people experience. The combination of ingredients is meant to support overall cognitive function, which could lead to feeling more alert and mentally sharp throughout the day.

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

While many users might be looking for immediate effects, CogniCare Pro is also designed with long-term brain health in mind. Regular use of the supplement aims to provide ongoing support for cognitive function, potentially helping to maintain mental acuity as you age.

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

Some ingredients in CogniCare Pro, such as Bacopa Monnieri and Rhodiola Root, are believed to have stress-reducing properties. By potentially lowering stress levels, the supplement may indirectly support better cognitive function and overall well-being.

* **Antioxidant Support**

Several ingredients in CogniCare Pro have antioxidant properties. These compounds may help protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in cognitive decline.

* **Natural Energy Support**

While some other cognitive enhancers work on the principle of stimulants for energy, CogniCare Pro seems to be designed a bit differently and naturally. This could result in long-term mental energy without the ‚Äòcrashes‚Äô that are common with other caffeine-laden supplements.¬†

# Conclusion

As it is illustrated in this CogniCare Pro review, the program positions itself as an effective tool that addresses the desire of individuals for better cognition and overall brain performance.¬†

It contains a mixture of natural compounds including Bacopa Monnieri, Ginkgo Biloba, and Phosphatidylserine to assist in memory, attention, and clarity.¬†

The users have not shared complaints, but instead, they have praised the enhancements, with many of them experiencing enhanced learning and focus.¬†

It is always advisable to consult with a doctor before using any new supplement, however, if cognitive support is your goal, it might be worth trying CogniCare Pro.

In addition, I play some games such as: God Of War 5, Genshin Impact, Heroes Of The Storm, Cities Skyline, GTA V,.. Maybe will try other recent games like Black Myth Wukong..

Currently I am using Dell G7 7588 laptop (i7 8750h, GTX 1060 MaxQ, Ram 32GB 2666mhz, SSD 2TB), use it regularly (\~12h/day) and always plug it into the power outlet, connect the laptop to a 32inch 2K external screen with the keyboard and mouse also connected externally, I have used it for more than 5 years, it still runs well and has no problems, but because the task increasingly requires high performance, I want to replace it with another powerful and stable laptop moreover, to meet the need for continuous work like the G7 laptop that I have used continuously for the past 5 years.

I also often bring my laptop to a coffee shop to change the space, find new inspiration to work.

I have consulted many review videos through channels such as: Jarrod'sTech, Mash IT, GizmoSlipTech, Hardware Canucks, ShortCircuit, Lucas Ishii, Adrenaline... But still can't decide because there are 2 options below:

**Alienware M16 R2 (Price: $2,115):**

|CPU|Core Ultra 9 185H|
|:-|:-|
|**VGA**|RTX 4070 8GB GDDR6|
|**RAM**|32GB 5600MHZ|
|**SSD**|1 TB|
|**Display**|16"" QHD+ (2560 x 1600) 165Hz, 3ms, ComfortView Plus, NVIDIA G-SYNC + DDS, 100% sRGB|

*-> Advantages:*

* Compact machine weighs about 2.4kg and total weight is about 3.1kg (+charger)
* Long battery life
* Performance remains stable when unplugged
* Has NPU
* Runs stably for a long time without throttling

*-> Disadvantages:*

* VGA performance is almost 2 times lower than 4090.

**Alienware M16 R1 (Price: $2,766):**

|CPU|i9 13900HX|
|:-|:-|
|**VGA**|RTX 4090 16GB GDDR6|
|**RAM**|32GB 5200MHZ|
|**SSD**|1 TB|
|**Display**|16‚Ä≥ QHD+ (2560\*1600) 240Hz, 3ms, ComfortView Plus, NVIDIA G-SYNC + DDS, 100% DCI-P3|

*-> Advantages:*

* Strong performance

*-> Disadvantages:*

* Large and heavy power supply (1.4kg)
* The machine weighs about 3.25kg and the total weight is about 4.65kg (+charger)
* High throttling ability
* High temperature and noise

**The price difference between the 2 laptops is $651**

There is also the M16 R1 4080 version priced at around $2563.

The pros and cons that I have provided may be wrong, please give me your comments and advice on which laptop I should choose to meet my needs: durable, stable, continuous use, continuous charging, good use for the next 4-5 years.

(I also read about the Intel 13th and 14th generation CPU issue but it probably doesn't affect the HX series on laptops)

If you have owned one of the two laptops above for a long time, please let me know your performance, stability, and satisfaction after using it!

Thank you very much!
