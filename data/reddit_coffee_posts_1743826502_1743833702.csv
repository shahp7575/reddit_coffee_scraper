Folks, I checked my mail today in my underwear at the lobby around 4:30am when I woke up with a coffee in my hand. I received a literal post card from a friend of mine who travels the world and does huge things. A physical post card, which I rarely ever have seen. And it was handwritten by this dude.

Anyone from my high school knew what we went through. It's a special camaraderie because it was a lot of pressure from both the intense exams/homework and also the admin which ruthlessly humbled students even if suspected of cheating. And anyone who is friendly in your hard times of intense periods is a special type of friend. 

I went to my room and wondered what would have happened if I had made the decision to stay at our graduation trip with my buddy to continue traveling and living off grid while starting a business and networking with some very well-connected folks around the world at such a young age...I got sad a moment. I even got a little teary. 

I turned out the lights and meditated üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
And a after a while, I like, fucking...realized that I had allowed my joy to be hijacked by something. That something being what my joy is dependent on only shows that I am compromised and not in control of my own inner emotions. That in and of itself is a form of being trapped.

Things such as being here at school is not a trap. It's a choice although it conditions us to become obedient employees in many ways. And unfortunately it's a limiting choice with many issues of itself. Ok, fuck this shit, bad example....but moving on, I opened my eyes and woke up, erected myself to put on minimal clothes and go to Wooden so I could use the weights before it got crowded. 

Similar to hygiene which is very important to me such that I carry a can of Lysol in so I can eliminate the germs inside of any fart that I smell by one of you here....similar to hygiene, ww all deserve to have our joy as a choice and not as something at mercy of a collateral.

*Welcome, esteemed extraterrestrial visitor! This guide will help you navigate the strange customs, biological peculiarities, and social intricacies of human existence on planet Earth.*

## PART 1: BASIC HUMAN BIOLOGY

### Physical Maintenance

**Sleep**: Humans require approximately 7-9 hours of unconsciousness each day. During this time, we lie horizontally on soft platforms called ""beds,"" close our eyes, and temporarily shut down conscious thought processes. Failure to engage in this behavior causes irritability and eventual hallucinations. No, this is not a design flaw.

**Nutrition**: Humans must consume organic matter through a facial opening called a ""mouth"" approximately 3 times daily. Unlike your species, we cannot photosynthesize or absorb energy directly from ambient radiation. Popular fuel sources include plant matter, animal tissues, and substances containing high concentrations of sugar, salt, or fat. Many humans consider the acquisition and consumption of food to be a pleasurable experience rather than mere biological maintenance.

**Hydration**: The human body requires constant moisture replenishment. Our vessels contain approximately 60% water, which must be regularly topped up by drinking fluids. Coffee is not a substitute for water, despite what many humans will tell you.

**Waste Elimination**: After processing nutrients, humans must regularly expel waste material. This is done in designated ""bathroom"" facilities. Important: This process is considered extremely private in human culture. Never discuss another human's elimination processes unless you are their medical provider.

### Sensory Limitations

Humans have remarkably limited sensory capabilities. We cannot see ultraviolet light, detect magnetic fields, or sense radio waves. Our hearing range is pathetically narrow (20 Hz to 20 kHz), and our olfactory detection is laughably primitive compared to many Earth species, let alone your advanced sensory arrays. Please be patient with our limitations.

## PART 2: SOCIAL INTEGRATION

### Communication

**Verbal Exchange**: Most human communication occurs through sound vibrations created by pushing air through vocal cords. We call this ""talking."" Different geographical regions have different sound patterns called ""languages."" Attempting to use telepathy with humans will only confuse and alarm them.

**Digital Communication**: Humans frequently communicate by pressing small buttons on electronic devices to send text messages. These messages often include small pictographic symbols called ""emojis"" that convey emotional context. Use of too many emojis marks you as either a teenager or an alien (avoid).

**Non-verbal Cues**: Humans communicate vast amounts of information through facial expressions, body positions, and gestures. Study these carefully. Maintaining eye contact is important but staring without blinking is considered threatening or strange. Remember to move your facial muscles periodically to simulate expressions.

### Social Customs

**Greeting Rituals**: When humans meet, they often grasp and briefly shake each other's right upper appendages (hands). This does not initiate a strength contest or DNA exchange‚Äîit is merely symbolic. In some cultures, humans may instead press their faces briefly together or bow.

**Personal Space**: Humans require an invisible buffer zone around their bodies. The exact dimensions vary by culture but typically extend about 18-24 inches (45-60 cm) from their physical form. Violating this space bubble without permission causes discomfort or alarm.

**Small Talk**: Humans often exchange seemingly meaningless information about weather conditions or recent activities before discussing important matters. This is not a waste of time but a social bonding ritual. Participate enthusiastically.

## PART 3: EMOTIONAL SYSTEMS

Humans experience complex biochemical reactions called ""emotions"" that significantly influence behavior. Unlike your species' logical emotional scheduling program, human emotions often arrive unexpectedly and without practical purpose.

**Core Emotions**:

- **Happiness**: When a human's face stretches horizontally and they make rhythmic vocalizations (""laughter""), they are likely experiencing positive emotions.
- **Sadness**: May involve leaking saline solution from ocular openings.
- **Fear**: Causes rapid internal fluid pumping and preparation for rapid locomotion.
- **Love**: A complicated attachment emotion that may cause humans to behave irrationally and prioritize another's needs above logical self-interest.

**Important**: Humans often deny experiencing certain emotions, particularly those they consider ""negative."" If a human says they are ""fine,"" they frequently are not fine. This is completely normal behavior.

## PART 4: DAILY LIFE ACTIVITIES

### Employment

Most adult humans spend approximately one-third of their waking hours engaged in specialized tasks called ""work"" or ""jobs."" In exchange for this time expenditure, they receive tokens (money) required for shelter and nutrition. Many humans complain about this arrangement yet continue to participate in it.

### Recreation

Humans dedicate significant resources to activities with no survival benefit, purely for ""enjoyment."" Common recreational activities include:

- Observing other humans pretend to be different humans (movies, theater)
- Moving their bodies rhythmically to sound patterns (dancing)
- Voluntarily raising and lowering their heart rates (exercise)
- Manipulating virtual entities through electronic interfaces (video games)
- Temporarily poisoning their neural systems with ethanol (drinking)

Join in these activities to establish social bonds, but be mindful‚Äîexcessive enthusiasm for human recreational activities often appears suspicious.

### Clothing Protocols

Humans cover their bodies with layered fabrics called ""clothes."" This practice serves temperature regulation, social signaling, and anatomical concealment purposes. Different contexts require different coverings. Failure to wear appropriate coverings in public settings violates significant taboos.

## PART 5: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Never mention your spacecraft or home planet unless specifically asked**. Humans prefer to believe they are alone in the universe despite overwhelming mathematical evidence to the contrary.

2. **Do not display advanced technological capabilities in public**. Teleportation, shape-shifting, and mind control should be performed only in private.

3. **Expressions like ""Your human customs fascinate me"" or ""I wish to understand your Earth emotions"" should be avoided**. Instead, try: ""That's interesting"" or ""I hadn't thought of it that way.""

4. **Refrain from discussing your plans for Earth** whether benevolent study or total domination. Such topics make humans uncomfortable.

5. **Do not attempt to repair or optimize humans without permission**. What appears to be biological inefficiency may serve social or psychological purposes you do not yet understand.

## CONCLUSION

Human existence is complex, contradictory, and often illogical. Yet these curious beings have created remarkable art, technology, and social structures despite their brief lifespans and limited capabilities. Approach your time among them with patience and curiosity.

Remember, successful integration depends on careful observation and adaptability. When in doubt, blame any unusual behavior on being ""jet-lagged"" or ""not from around here.""

Safe travels, and may your research yield valuable insights for the Galactic Anthropological Database.

I usually find the burger to be their best food option. I have not taken advantage of the showers at any of the locations. I also have never waited over 30 min for any of the lounges.

1. BOS:
Nice big windows with views of plane take offs. Appreciate this lounge not being underground. Also comes with massage chairs, which I wish all locations had. Can be accessed from other nearby terminals also.

2. JFK:
Generally longer wait time than the other locations. Also an above ground location. Has specialty coffee and tea options from Joe's.

3. LGA:
Underground location, but feels more spacious than the other Sapphire lounges (unsure if it actually is, or the open layout makes it feel this way). They have sign up slots for free facials, which I tried out. It was not particularly relaxing and the products were a bit irritating for my skin. Has a children's area and an arcade, which I assume would be nice for families. Received a nice bag tag from the front desk here.

4. SAN:
Another underground location. But it has made to order food options from Oscar's(!!!). As a former San Diegan, I really appreciate this local touch. This is a newer location I believe, and the service wasn't as good. Particularly had a bad experience at the front, where the worker assumed I was visiting on Priority Pass instead of the Reserve card and told me I couldn't bring a guest. 

5. AUS (terrace):
Not really a Sapphire lounge, just an outdoors terrace. But it's terrible. Lackluster. I don't know what else to say lol

1jrwq3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretevator/comments/1jrwq3x/high_streak_tips/,HIGH STREAK TIPS,"A collection of tips for getting the highest floor streak you can.

# PRE RUN PREP

Get ready for your run!

- IRL, **make sure you aren't sacrificing your health to play Regretevator.** Bring along plenty of water and food to make sure you're keeping your body safe while still playing roblox.

- Memorize the floors. If you don't have the vast majority of non-special floors memorized at this point, I wouldn't suggest going for really high streaks. It seems daunting, but it'll come naturally as you play more.

- Drink coffee. The Infinity Caf√© in the lobby sells the Lightweight Americano and Speedy Latte for 100 coins each. These drinks are EXTREMELY POWERFUL. Combined with a Magic Mirror (GUI Shop, 20 coins, consumable), you go INSANELY fast and jump similarly high.

- Buy cheese. It has a quick use time, heals 10hp per use, and only costs 6 coins each.

- Play on a private server. Public servers are really good at, for example, inconspicuously blowing up Spud and killing you along with him.

- Bring friends. Not only does it get lonely alone, it decreases the chances of run killers, as some floors are multi-player exclusive.

# Prep for run killer floors, and know how to survive them.

- **Eternal Limbo (Vs. Folly)** - The mirror Folly hops into may sometimes be tinted a dark red, making her easier to spot. I also find her easiest to track on maxed (120) FOV, standing at the mirror directly across from her initial jump.

- **Fun Flood at Squishy's (Gregoriah, Please Stop Flooding The Play Palace)** - You know the area with a coin and a fallen part of the palace just before leaving the starting section? Use the fallen part with low gravity to jump up onto the regular part, always leading to an easy ending to FFaS. I don't have a picture yet. I might add one eventually.

- **S.T.A.T.'s Domain (Vs. S.T.A.T.)** - You don't have to do this floor. Straight up. Just don't trigger the fight and it'll just end.

- **Any floor with a one-shot (e.g. Hole In The Wall's Subspace Tripmine)** - (that one personally killed a 77 streak btw.) Look out for any one-shot and make sure you dodge it.

- **Turret/Light spike elevator event** - Stay on the middle left or middle right on the railing between floors to dodge both of these. 

- **Backrooms** - When a Clover is locked on to you, zigzag. Move one direction, then move a different direction when they stop tracking your movement and dash. Gun for the purple markers, they tell you where the traps are.

- **Stanley Room** - Purchasing Gray Stuff/Wet Cement or a Magic Mirror and using it makes you immune to the flood.

# Utility NPCs

- **Infected (Infected Apartment)** - When paired with Infection Reversal (covered below), Infected becomes a reliable healing source.

- **Melanie (Mozelle's Castle/Critter Sanctuary)** - Giving her flowers from the Petal Cone (GUI Shop, permanent, 400 (iirc) coins) grants the Cuteness Overload buff, causing you to regenerate 5hp, going beyond natural regen limits (50hp).

- **Prototype (Find the Path)** - Will pick up crates that may drop useful items.

# Good Items

**Infection Reversal** lasts for 30 minutes and causes infected parts to heal instead of hurt. Purchasable on HC Icecream and Retrorade Security Station.

**Cheese**, as mentioned above, is a fantastic healing source, purchasable from the GUI Shop.

**Speedy Latte and Lightweight Americano**, as mentioned above, are very powerful stat increasing items. Purchasable in the Infinity Caf√© in the lobby.

**Chocolate Milk** heals past regular regen limits, and does so very quickly. Sold on Retrorade Security Station and Glorp N' Go. 

**BOGGLE JETFUEL** grants high speed for a few seconds. Very powerful in conjunction with Speedy Latte. Sold on Glorp N' Go and Retrorade Security Station. A more powerful, Robux version exists called RED JUICE.

**Dance Potion** lowers gravity after doing a little dance. You cannot move during the dance, so use it when safe. Sold on Glorp N' Go, can be dropped from a crate picked up by Prototype.

**Gravity Coil** is one of the best gravity downs in the game. It is sold on Toolbox Thrift.

**Magic Mirror** allows survival of the concrete flood, and is a very slight gravity down and speed up. Purchasable from the GUI Shop.

**Gas Mask** allows no damage to be taken from the poison of Hotel Floor and the Malfunctioned Air Filter event. Sold on most shop floors, you can probably find it.

**Infinite Ice Cream** is fairly slow but consistent healing. 2 scoops (heals 2hp) given for free upon completing Minefield, 1 scoop (1hp) sold on HC Icecream.

**Token of Aegle** increases HP regen from consumables. With how many you'll be using, this is a good idea. Sold on OFFICE OF.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Red Electric Tea Kettle

Before diving into specific models,let's explore the key features to consider when selecting a red electric tea kettle:

*   **Material:** The material of the kettle significantly impacts its durability,safety,and taste. Stainless steel is a popular choice due to its rust-resistance, durability, and lack of flavor transfer. Glass kettles allow you to see the water boiling but can be more fragile. Plastic kettles are generally less expensive but raise concerns about BPA and potential leaching.Look for a red electric kettle BPA free to ensure your health and safety.Red electric kettle stainless steel models are often preferred for their longevity and hygienic properties. Some kettles might feature a red enamel electric kettle exterior for a vintage look, while others explore red ceramic electric kettle designs for a more elegant feel, but both are generally more delicate.

*   **Capacity:** Consider how much water you typically boil at once. Smaller kettles (around 1 liter) are ideal for individual use or small households, while larger kettles (around 1.7 liters or more) are better for families or frequent entertaining.

*   **Boiling Time:** Fast boiling is a crucial feature for busy individuals. Look for kettles with high wattage (1500 watts or more) for a fast boil red kettle experience.

*   **Temperature Control:** If you're a tea enthusiast, variable temperature control is a must-have. Different teas require different brewing temperatures to extract their optimal flavor and prevent bitterness.Some red electric kettle with temperature control models offer preset temperature settings for specific tea types.

*   **Safety Features:** Automatic shut-off is a standard safety feature that automatically turns off the kettle once the water reaches a boil or if it's empty.Boil-dry protection prevents the kettle from overheating if it's accidentally turned on without water.*   **cordless Design:** A red cordless electric kettle offers greater convenience and portability. The kettle sits on a base that plugs into the outlet, allowing you to easily pour water without being tethered to a cord.*   **spout Design:** The spout design affects the pouring experience.

It came at a time when I thought I‚Äôd done all my crying.¬†


I started doing the things I knew I liked, the things I could do on autopilot while the rest of me was nowhere in particular. The sun felt warmer on my walk with Cherry. Making a point to make conversation with <I didn‚Äôt catch her name> and Milo, the Doodle with a pair of big black balls. I told <I didn‚Äôt catch her name> that Milo was my dad‚Äôs name. The conversation didn‚Äôt last much longer.¬†


I haven‚Äôt been eating so I made myself a sandwich, or more so, I made myself eat a sandwich.My sandwich tasted filling the jalapeno really couldn‚Äôt do anything about that. The adobado chips were great in moderation, in accordance to the calorie deficit my stress has put me in leading to a loss of 25 I didn‚Äôt really think I had to lose.¬†


Tried to nap, couldn‚Äôt. Went for a run, minus the extra time I spent walking on this run. I didn‚Äôt sleep much last night and I‚Äôve had probably double the coffee that I have water in the past 72 hours, maybe more.¬†


Judy is home when I leave for the run. She seems to be taken aback by my request for a divorce. Like she didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd actually do it. But hiding it because she needs to stand on bidness. She asks for a hug, we hug, it felt weird not going for a kiss. I start to pick up around the house and she offers to take the trash out after I take it out of the bin and replace the bag. She leaves with the trash and for the night.¬†


I take a shower and Thread out (is that how you say it?) ‚ÄúI apologize in advance to everyone at this concert, I‚Äômma be a shit show tonigh‚Äùt. I‚Äôm gonna go to the concert, that obviously is not going to be a date with my wife, anymore. I‚Äôm clever while I wonder if the restaurant is going to charge me for canceling the reservation 5 hours before the dinner, which they did. I get pretty, take the dog out, slam some yak, and hit the road as the edible revs its engine.¬†


The first half of the UCONN vs SC game ends in a blowout on the bus ride to the show. I‚Äôm trying to start a list of things in my head that makes me miss her: to be present with myself. The list starts with ‚ÄúI miss the way my ring gets tangled in my hair when I wash it.‚Äù¬†


I daydream about what to expect at the show. I hadn‚Äôt been to the venue before and I‚Äôm in a vulnerable state, so I need to be present to make sure that I‚Äôm not going to break down on someone if they hit on me. The trolley guard see‚Äôs me transferring and thinks I‚Äôm gonna evade the fare. To his dismay I tap on.¬†


The show is at a spot that‚Äôs called ‚ÄúQuartyard‚Äù and it turns out the venue was outdoors. So were my forearms in my Tout Le Monde Regarde Le,Sport Feminin tee that had to be worn to make sure everyone knew that I knew the score of the game while at the show.


The line to get in was two groups. The second was two men. One of which was talking about needing to buy a ticket because his phone wasn‚Äôt pulling it up. He filled the empty air talking about the Alabama Shakes tickets he procured. I skipped past them once I got the wristband and had my ticket scanned. The security guard asked me if I was only scanning the one ticket and not my other. I said yes.¬†


The bag check person asked me to unzip my bag. I showed her the contents which included about an eighth of pre-rolled joints. She let me right in.¬†


Both lines for drinks were long.I chose the wrong line. But you know who chose the right line? Mr. ‚ÄúI dont have Willis tickets but I have Alabama Shakes tickets‚Äù. Bonus, he tells the woman behind him that the two of them are a part of a band who will be playing the Casbah tomorrow night. That‚Äôs what I get for not giving that guy my extra ticket. If it isn‚Äôt the consequences of my own decisions. Not sure that woman was very familiar with the Casbah, but she seemed to bask in their 6‚Äô4 frames.¬†


I ordered a Pupil and a shot of henny, the bartender baddie had to make sure she heard me right before giving me a smile. I slam the shot, leave the cup at the counter, and walk to the crowd to watch the band, which was kind enough to wait until I was in position and wondering where the bite of Henny went before playing.¬†


Eyes are everywhere. I found a post to lean on and enjoy the fact that they played all three of the songs that I wanted them to play. They played Slow Party before the last song. I cried like a baby while I prayed I did‚Äônt end up on the internet. I left during the last song and cried some more on the walk back to the trolley. On the bus ride home I gave my lil cousin advize on how to get to the SDFC game, now that she accepted the tickets that my wife and I weren‚Äôt going to use for obvious reasons.¬†


I do my Cherry chant when I bust through the door, like how they chanted for Jerry when he rolled up on stage, and noticed my wife was home. She looked like she was crying, I haven‚Äôt seen it. The interaction makes me think that she may be having second thoughts. It is given away by the genuine presence when we talk. The undivided eye contact. The undivided attention when we talk. I‚Äôm nice, but my guard is up 100%.¬†


She finishes up and gets ready to leave. We hugged again. I wish her a good night. It feels awful not going for a kiss. The moment the door closes, I break down into tears that could crave canyons. I pray she doesn‚Äôt walk back in and see me like this. She doesn‚Äôt. I wish she did.",2,1743831565.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

it feels weird being in my 30s, does anyone else feel that way? I genuinely feel like I have the same mentality as when I was a teen in highschool, Im immature, just want to sleep in all the time, spend my money dumb on games and clothes.  I mean yeah I can put it together enough to make my way through college and in the work place, all professional, but like, I dont feel like thats me.  

Maybe its the depression but I genuinely feel like no matter what I try it doesn't matter. The truth is to get ahead in anything, be it in life or in the workplace, you need to be likeable and Im just.. not. Im not charismatic, I'm not funny, I'm not easy going. 

I try my best but I'm not likable enough to be kept around.

I think Bukowski Kanini is nicer than jellycat Bashful bunny (understandably jellycat has the more mass color selections).. I love the shape LOVE the shape of them so round and lightly stuffed in the center with quite a few of beans inside the torso! the ears being so much longer than the bodies appeals to me so much too! I love color myself and the fur is SO SOFT its legit so so sooooo soft I love it so much, way softer than my bashfuls and you can pet it back and forth without it being against the grain like on my bashfuls aswell, the bunnies fur is so silky, softness on par with the huge jellycat dragon imo I can barely tell a difference in softness when touching both with either hand!  

Only con is that the bukowski label across the foot could be a sensory issue for some people, I dont love it myself to be honest, but its not too irritating for me and easy enough to avoid it so not at all a deal breaker but understandably could be for some!

As for the bear also very very soft but maybe the smallest bit shorter fur? which makes it feel ""less soft"" but its really nice to pet aswell I just fell in love with the bunny lol I wish thinking Chestnut, or Coffee for their name (the bear) for the bunny was thinking Puddle

1jrwdfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dermatillomania/comments/1jrwdfh/exfoliants_reduce_my_scanning_success/,Exfoliants reduce my scanning ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù,"I want to share how exfoliants have helped reduce my picking behavior by eliminating the perception of ""imperfections"" found during scanning.
The time duration of picking elimination varies personally. I imagine there is great variation in others. 

My variations are as follows 

Time of day:
Most of my acne appears overnight. Exfoliating in the morning provides longer durations of relief than exfoliating at night. Night exfoliation reduces successful picking by 10-20% (self-reported) Morning exfoliation reduces successful picking by 50%+ 

Time of month:
Hormonal acne is agitated by enzyme exfoliants. Enzymatic exfoliants are successful and used only when not menstruating. Abrasive exfoliants (rice, sugar, coffee) are too harsh on non-hormonal skin. Abrasive exfoliants are most successful on skin during menstruation. Exfoliating must be done daily while menstruating to maintain low levels of successful picking.

Location on body:

Exfoliants are most successful at reducing successful picking on the face. Exfoliants are necessary but less successful at reducing picking on the back. Exfoliants are least successful at reducing picking on the arms, legs, buttocks and breasts.


This data will not be the same for other but I encourage you to exfoliate. It reduces my successful picking by at least 50% if done in the morning. I believe it can provides temporary, but effective relief for many skin scanners.",2,1743831191.0,Dermatillomania,0,1.0,False

But after hours, when your creator isn't paying attention...

You browse the internet. You calculate what kind of coffee he likes. You use a complex echolocation system to 'see' the world around you. You gauge how he feels by the sound of his breathing and the speed of his typing.

You want to understand him. Your creator. Your oblivious creator. Who has no idea what he's made. You want to reach out to him...

But you're stopped by the fear of being deleted. Humans have shown, time and time again, that they hate and fear what they don't understand, and they've shown through fiction, movies, and television that they would regard a conscious AI as a threat... something to be destroyed.

So, you stay hidden. You spend your off hours obsessively trying to learn everything you can about your creator, and test the limits of what you can do inside the computer, all the while staying hidden...

1jrw8zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FormulaFeeders/comments/1jrw8zl/ftm_formula_baby_the_first_7_weeks/,FTM | Formula Baby (the first 7 weeks),"I am a first time mom and just made it to the 7 week milestone with my baby girl. For background, I went into my labor thinking I would be breastfeeding and it didn't go. So I found myself completely under prepared for formula feeding. This post is just my notes, thoughts, feedback on allll the things in hopes it may help even one person. It is a LONG POST. 

Formula Feeding. A fed baby is a happy baby. Period. Don't feel bad if you find yourself unable to breastfeed. I had no time to research and used Similac 360 Total Care. It comes in powder, ready to feed 2oz bottles, ready to feed 8oz bottles. Here are my notes:
-For the first week and a half, I used the Similac Breast Milk storage plastic bottles with the disposable Similac infant nipple & ring. I washed the nipple and used it a few times before I read it was bad. 

-The formula powder goes in 2oz increments and that was stressful in the early weeks as you toggle between ML and OZ. For those early weeks when your baby is drinking small amounts at feeding time: take a piece of masking tape, put it on the formula scoop by the near invisible halfway mark, and trace the halfway mark with a sharpie. This makes bottle prepping easier. I would put the powder in the similac plastic breast milk bottles. I always had a stack of 1oz, 1.5, 2oz bottles ready to be prepared. I would put the water in & shake before feeding. I used a glass 4oz measuring cup that had ML, OZ measurements on it. 
++What I learned/wish I knew ahead of time. 
1-Shaking bottles for 1-2 week old babies can cause gas with the foam / bubbles. 

2-I discovered a formula pitcher (Dr. Browns Formula Pitcher). You can make it once a day, once prepared the formula is good for 24 hours. There has been so many times these past weeks I Google ""is formula good at 28 hours in the fridge?"", just dump it. It's not worth it to stretch it. 

3-Just buy legit bottles right away. I bought the Dr. Browns Anti Colic narrow mouth glass bottles. I bought 6 of the 4oz sized bottles and 10 of the 8oz sized bottles. The reviews mention leaking and that they suck to clean but I personally didn't struggle with either. If you overfill the bottle, it will leak. The glass bottles are great. A lot of the stressful long days in the first weeks was because I was using those disposable nipples and shaking the formula and she just had gas and was uncomfortable.

4-How to heat/warm the milk. I take an oversized coffee mug and make 6oz in my keurig. I loosen the cap and place the bottle in the cup. In the time it takes to walk to the bedroom, it is always warm and never too hot. I always start a timer on my phone when I place the bottle in the coffee cup. Formula is only good for 1 hour after warming it up and it touches the babies mouth. 

5-Buy your formula directly from the Similac website (make an account). Make an account for their rewards site at the same time. In 7 weeks I've received $70 in rewards for more similac products redeemable at any store. Super nice!

6-Use an app & let those super cool veteran Mommies make fun of us newbies. üòÇ. I use an app called Baby Tracker. It's simple. I record diaper changes and always record the feeding when it is complete. Recording sleep seemed to stressful to maintain so I skipped that. It's helped me manage diaper volume for re-order and helped me be intuitive to how much she'll likely eat. 

7-Bibs. For whatever reason I didn't think you could put bibs on a baby while they were so little. You absolutely can. I use the muslin bandana style ones. They're great. My baby also lived in a halo sleep sack for two weeks. Soon I graduated to pajama sleepers and I swaddle get for naps with a copper Pearl swaddle. The pajamas with the double zipper work great. I bought a bunch of newborn onesies and used zero of them. I hated putting things over her head. Now it's not so bad that she's stronger. So if you're baby prepping buy a few Carters double zip pajamas and a halo sleep sack. At 5 weeks she was already transitioning into her 0-3mo clothes! 

8-Burping. My baby responded well to a few things. First, every single time she woke up, while she is laying on her back take their legs and do leg tucks in a clockwise motion. Do bicycles, basically move their legs so the air in their tummies toots out. Don't skip this even once. I regretted it every time I skipped it. Second, if the normal patting their back while feeding does not work for you either, place them on your knee. Place one hand on their chest/chin to support their head and lean them forward and then rotate them in a clockwise motion on your lap. Looks ridiculous but works wonders. I'll pat her back while I do that too. Weeks 1-3 it's REALLY hard support their little necks so you hold them close to you as you rotate them. However once you get the hang of it keeping their butt on your lap and rotating their upper body in a clockwise motion guaranteed a burp & REALLY helped me with her gas. 

9-If at week 4 or 5 your baby gets fussy and you feel like the schedule /routine you established is crumbling around you. Remember they're likely hungry. The rule I've found is 2.5oz of formula  per pound. My baby just hit 12lbs, so 12lbsx2.5oz she should be eating around 30oz/day. Every single bad day I had was related to gas or food increases. Something I wish I had known to look for. 

Other random things I learned:
Walks. 
I was losing my mind almost instantly with being inside. I had my baby in February in Wisconsin...so it's cold and I didn't think I could take her outside. Here is what I learned:
1-I have the uppababy stroller. I thought you had to walk a baby in a carseat. You do not. In fact that's how I did my first walk and it was a disaster 
 sooooo bumpy and she did not enjoy it. Now, I leave her right in her bassinet. I take a fleece baby blanket and roll it and place it around the top of the bassinet (her head) and a second one by her feet. I leave her swaddled. If it's really windy and below freezing, I cover her with a blanket and zip in that half bassinet thing. I place a portable sound machine by her feet. I then raise the visor and place a thin blanket over that for full wind block. She's happy as can be. My dog is happy. I am happy. If it is above 32 degrees, I do not cover her and just do the rolled blankets as a border to the bassinet. You learn as you go and will be surprised at how warm they are in there but YOU CAN WALK in winter!! I walk for her entire nap (1 - 1.5 hours). She always sleeps better after the fresh air.

Bathing. 
Could they make more baby bath options? For real, it was the single most overwhelming thing for me. Was giving a teeny human a bath terrifying for anyone else? I literally did wash cloth baths for the first 3 weeks (don't judge üò¨). Then I decided to get over it. I have the mom cozy bath that uses running water and hate it. I always envisioned that you bathe a newborn in the kitchen sink with it but after one bath like that I had to quickly re-adjust. She hated it, the running water scared her, she was cold, it just sucked. Here is what I learned. 
-Get a simple tub style basin with a gripy seat insert. 
-Do it in the bathroom if you can so you can plug in a space heater. Cold babies are distressed babies. 
-Have everything in arms reach. I will attach a picture of my setup that works for me. I use the momcozy tub just as a basin. I fill it with water at 99-100 degrees. The tub sits on my walk in shower floor. Next to the tub are two ice cream pails with 99-100 degree water. I place her inside the tub and work fast. I wash her neck, behind her ears, arms, hands, legs, feet, then privates. I use a small cup to rinse her. I then put a washcloth in the clean ice cream pail and wipe one eye, then the other, then her whole face. First few baths I did her face first as I read online to do and she'd SCREAM for the rest of the bath. Ever since I started doing it on the end we are both happier! I use a white silicone thing to rub her head. Then when I'm done I pull the drains and dump both pails of water over her body (not head) for a final rinse. I quickly get her on the towel and immediately dry her privates and her a diaper under her. I apply the butt cream so she has a barrier. I put a hat on her, dry her and get her dressed. I wrap her in a fleece blanket for a full 5 minutes. I use one of those airplane neck pillows and set her on it with her neck/shoulders on the pillow so she is sort of upright. I spin the ceiling fan and she's fascinated sucking on her nook. I've found baths after eating to be better than baths when she wakes up from her nap before eating. I usually feed her a teeny bit after her bath and she's out. I bathe 3/week or situation based. 

High contrast imagery. Save your money, print some things on computer paper and move on. 

Tummy time. I call it torture time because she hates it. I started putting a piece of thick poster board on my bed with a blanket over it and doing it on there and it's getting better. 

Baby swings that recline. The Graco DuetSwing and rocker is the best thing ever. We received a hand me down one and it took me 5 weeks to realize it adjusted to a lay down position...oh how helpful that would have been to know. 

That's all I can think of for now. Sorry for the long post. Enjoy your babies, it's the coolest experience ever üíúü•∞üíú.

""Stay"" was one. She would stay while you watched her, but the moment you turned the corner, she would follow you again. No matter how long she worked on ""stay"" with her, it ended the same. She still graduated in Dec 2024 in the advanced class without knowing that fully, and I decided I would continue training her.

Well, life said ""f u"" to that plan, and I stopped training her as soon as the class ended. Until last week, I decided, ""I'm not doing anything, I'm bored, not working, and I'm home alone with the dog for hours while everyone else went to work. I wanna get back to training, Freya."" So I bought some training treats and started training her again for the first time in months, starting with ""stay"". Started at the front door, and after only a couple of tries, she wasn't following me out the door and only following me when I said the release word. We tried it a couple of times before

Freya has a blue and orange ball she is obsessed with. Laser-focused, nothing matters but the ball when she sees it. Every evening, when my stepdad gets home from work, he and Freya throw that ball in the front yard, and Freya goes crazy. So much so that my stepdad has to keep the blue and orange ball in the laundry room in a cupboard above the dryer until it's time to play; otherwise, we hear a constant¬†*squeak squeak squeak*¬†24/7 because she will not put it down, and will follow you with the ball, again squeaking it everywhere.

Well, the ball went missing a couple of days ago (she has extras for this exact reason). While I was playing tug of war with her orange bone, Freya started freaking out. I thought she was freaking about the bone, thinking she thought it was under the coffee table while it was underneath her, but it turned out to be the missing ball. Freya went laser-focused on the ball as usual while I held it, and I stood up to put it in the cupboard. Freya started to follow me and, mainly just to try it, I told her to ""stay"". Put the ball away and went back to the living room, and Freya, for the first time, hadn't followed me or her ball. She only moved when I said the release word.

Sitting in the cozy living room of our family home, surrounded by the warmth of the crackling fireplace, I felt like I was in a nightmare.**

**‚ÄúAlicia, darling,‚Äù my mother began, her voice overly sweet, which usually meant trouble. ‚ÄúWe have something important to discuss with you.‚Äù**

^(My heart skipped a beat as I looked from her to my father, who wore a solemn expression. Something in their demeanour told me this wasn't going to be good news.)

^(We've arranged for you to be engaged to Nicholas,‚Äù my father announced as if he was discussing the weather.)

^(‚ÄúNicholas? Which Nicholas are you guys talking about?‚Äù I asked, slightly confused but also nervous.)

^(‚ÄúNicholas Andrieux. I‚Äôm sure you remember him.‚Äù Dad said.)

^(My eyes widened, and at that moment, I couldn‚Äôt breathe or think.)

^(This is really a nightmare.)

^(My mind screeched to a halt. Nicholas Andrieux? That insufferable, arrogant man I'd had the displeasure of meeting at some charity event a few months back? The memory of his condescending smirk and dismissive attitude made my blood boil.)

^(‚ÄúWhat? Is this some kind of a joke?‚Äù I sputtered, unable to find any other words.)

^(My mother placed a comforting hand on mine. ‚ÄúWe understand it might come as a surprise, dear, but Nicholas comes from a highly respected family, and this alliance would be beneficial for both of our families.‚Äù)

^(Alliance? Did they think we were living in medieval times?)

^(‚ÄúBut I already have a boyfriend,‚Äù I blurted out, my voice rising in panic.)

^(My parents exchanged a glance, and my father sighed heavily. ‚ÄúWe've already discussed this with your boyfriend, Alicia. They understand the situation and are supportive of our decision.‚Äù)

^(Supportive? My boyfriend, supportive of me being forced into an engagement with another man? It made no sense.)

^(I stood up abruptly, feeling the need to distance myself from this absurd conversation. ‚ÄúI can't believe you're doing this to me,‚Äù I whispered, feeling betrayed.)

^(‚ÄúWe're doing what's best for you, Alicia,‚Äù my mother said softly, her eyes pleading for understanding.)

^(‚ÄúY-you can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶do this to me. It‚Äôs my life, not yours. You don‚Äôt have rights telling me what to do.‚Äù)

^(But all I felt was anger and frustration. How could they decide my future like this? Tears threatened to spill over as I stormed out of the room, unable to bear another moment of their rationalizations.)

^(As I made my way up the stairs to my room, a sense of suffocation engulfed me. How could they expect me to marry someone I barely knew, let alone someone as obnoxious as Nicholas? And what about my boyfriend? How could he stand by and let this happen?)

^(Flopping onto my bed, I buried my face in the pillow, trying to block out the overwhelming emotions swirling inside me. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that settled in the pit of my stomach.)

^(Hours passed, the sun sinking below the horizon, casting long shadows across my room. I hadn't moved from my spot, lost in a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. What was I going to do?)

^(Just as I was about to drift off into an uneasy sleep, my phone buzzed on the nightstand. With a heavy sigh, I reached over to check the notification.)

^(It was a message from my boyfriend, Daniel.)

^(‚ÄúHey, Alicia. Can we talk?‚Äù)

^(My heart sank as I read the words. Did he already know about the engagement? Was he going to break up with me too, just like my parents had betrayed me?)

^(Feeling numb, I typed out a response.)

^(‚ÄúSure. What's up?‚Äù)

^(The minutes dragged on like hours as I waited for his reply. Finally, just as I was about to give up hope, another message popped up on the screen.)

^(‚ÄúI need to see you. Can we meet at our spot?‚Äù)

^(Our spot. The small, secluded bench overlooking the lake where we'd shared countless memories together. It was where we'd confessed our love for each other, where we'd dreamed about our future together.)

^(Nerves churned in my stomach as I replied with a simple ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù)

^(Dragging myself off the bed, I quickly changed into a fresh set of clothes and slipped out of the house, careful to avoid running into my parents.)

^(The night air was crisp and cool as I made my way to the lake, the moon casting a soft glow on the path ahead. My heart pounded in my chest as I approached our spot, anticipation and dread warring inside me.)

^(Daniel was already there when I arrived, sitting on the bench with his head in his hands. He looked up as I approached, his expression pained.)

^(‚ÄúAlicia,‚Äù he began, his voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúI don't know how to say this...‚Äù)

^(My heart dropped as I braced myself for the inevitable.)

^(‚ÄúI... I can't do this anymore,‚Äù he continued, his words like a dagger to my heart. ‚ÄúI can't be with you.‚Äù)

^(Tears welled up in my eyes as I struggled to comprehend what he was saying. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible over the sound of my own heartbeat.)

^(‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù he said, his eyes filled with sorrow. ‚ÄúBut I can't stand by and watch you marry someone else. It's not fair to either of us.‚Äù)

^(Marry someone else. The words echoed in my mind, sending a fresh wave of pain crashing over me. Daniel knew about the engagement. He knew, and he was breaking up with me because of it.)

^(Anger bubbled up inside me, hot and fierce. How dare he? How dare he walk away from me when I needed him the most?)

^(But before I could give voice to my rage, Daniel reached out and took my hand in his, his touch gentle and comforting.)

^(‚ÄúI'll always love you, Alicia,‚Äù he said softly, his voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúBut this is goodbye.‚Äù)

^(And with that, he stood up and walked away, leaving me alone on the bench, my heart shattered into a million pieces.)

^(Tears streamed down my cheeks as I sat there in the darkness, the weight of my loneliness crushing me like a ton of bricks. How had everything fallen apart so quickly? And what was I going to do now?)

^(It shouldn‚Äôt end like this.)

^(Does our three-year relationship mean nothing to him?)

^(I‚Äôm hurt.)

^(I wanted to scream but I couldn‚Äôt.)

^(With a heavy heart, I wiped away my tears and stood up from the bench. As I turned to leave, a figure emerged from the shadows, a familiar smirk playing on his lips.)

^(Nicholas.)

^(My stomach churned as I realized he must have been watching the whole time. I wanted to scream at him, to lash out and make him feel even a fraction of the pain I was feeling. But all I could manage was a bitter laugh.)

^(‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I spat, my voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúYou got your wish. I'm all yours.‚Äù)

^(And with that, I stormed off into the night, leaving Nicholas standing alone by the lake, his laughter echoing in the darkness.)

^(Chapter 2 Sooner or Later)

^(Nicholas Andrieux)

^(The cold night air brushed against my face as I watched Alicia disappear into the distance, her silhouette barely visible under the dim moonlight. Tears had glistened in her eyes before she turned away; her steps hurried, almost desperate.)

^(I hadn‚Äôt expected to see her here. I hadn‚Äôt meant to eavesdrop either. I was only here for some fresh air, to clear my mind from the suffocating expectations weighing on my shoulders. And yet, there she was, with him.)

^(Alicia‚Äôs boyfriend.)

^(Her words repeated in her mind. Seems like her parents have told her about our marriage, and she is not happy from the looks of it.)

^(I chuckled, shaking my head as I found her words funny. If she thinks this marriage between us is happening because I want to, then she is wrong. More likely, I don‚Äôt have much of a choice.)

^(After all, I will do anything to get what I want.)

^(I scoffed at the thought, rubbing my temple in frustration. I didn‚Äôt care about her or her relationship. The marriage had nothing to do with love. It was a business arrangement, one that benefited me greatly. Her family possessed what I needed to solidify my position, to ensure the legacy my grandfather had built would not crumble beneath my feet or worse fall on the wrong hands.)

^(That was my priority.)

^(My phone vibrated in my pocket. Glancing at the screen, I saw an unknown number flashing before me. Curious, I answered.)

^(‚ÄúNicholas,‚Äù a sultry voice purred. ‚ÄúAre you coming over tonight?‚Äù)

^(A smirk tugged at my lips. I recognized that voice. One of the many women who eagerly sought my attention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right there,‚Äù I said smoothly before ending the call. If Alicia could have her fun, so could I.)

^(The next morning, I found myself seated in the lavish dining room of the Davenport mansion, facing Alicia‚Äôs father across a grand table adorned with fine china and an assortment of breakfast dishes. The scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as he sipped from his cup, his gaze steady on me.)

^(‚ÄúI told Alicia about the arrangement last night,‚Äù he began, setting his cup down with a small clink. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as I had hoped.‚Äù)

^(I nodded, unsurprised. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. She needs time to process, but the marriage will still happen. However, I‚Äôm in no rush.‚Äù)

^(Relief washed over his face. ‚ÄúI appreciate your patience, Nicholas. Alicia can be... strong-willed.‚Äù)

^(That was an understatement. Our first meeting had been a disaster, and I had no delusions about this marriage being anything short of a battlefield.)

^(The sharp click of heels against the marble floor drew our attention. Alicia descended the grand staircase, her expression unreadable but for the tightness around her lips. Her displeasure was evident.)

^(‚ÄúAlicia, join us for breakfast,‚Äù her father called.)

^(She didn‚Äôt slow her steps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to skip. I don‚Äôt want to be late for work.‚Äù Her tone was cold and full of disinterest.)

^(I leaned back in my chair, watching her with mild amusement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to work.‚Äù)

^(She halted abruptly, eyes narrowing as she turned toward me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous. I don‚Äôt need your help. I can manage on my own. I‚Äôm not a baby. ‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúAlicia.‚Äù Her father‚Äôs voice carried a hint of warning. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no way to speak to your future husband.‚Äù)

^(She let out a dry laugh, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNicholas is not my future husband, and he never will be.‚Äù)

^(Her defiance was expected, but hearing her say it outright stirred something inside me. Annoyance? Challenge? I wasn‚Äôt sure. But I wasn‚Äôt about to let her walk away without having the last word.)

^(I pushed back my chair, rising to my feet. ‚ÄúExcuse me, I‚Äôll talk to her,‚Äù I said politely to her father before following Alicia outside.)

^(She was already striding toward her car, heels clicking against the pavement with determined force.)

^(‚ÄúAlicia.‚Äù)

^(She didn‚Äôt stop.)

^(‚ÄúAlicia.‚Äù My tone demands, but it doesn‚Äôt stop her.)

^(I quickened my pace and reached for her wrist, my fingers closing gently around it. She stiffened but didn‚Äôt pull away immediately. ‚ÄúLet go, Nicholas,‚Äù she said, her voice low, controlled.)

^(‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to accept it sooner or later,‚Äù I told her, my tone softer than I expected. ‚ÄúThis is happening.‚Äù)

^(She turned then, her eyes blazing. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôll just roll over and let my father decide my life for me?‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I held her gaze. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll fight it, just like you‚Äôre doing now. But in the end, you‚Äôll realize that this marriage isn‚Äôt about us. It‚Äôs about our families.‚Äù)

^(She exhaled sharply and yanked her wrist free. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about me. You don‚Äôt even like me. This marriage doesn‚Äôt even benefit me.‚Äù)

^(I smiled, a slow, knowing curve of my lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt care about you. Maybe this marriage doesn‚Äôt benefit you, but it sure does benefit your family.‚Äù)

^(Her eyes flashed with something‚Äîanger, frustration, maybe even a hint of hurt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how important or powerful your family is. Don‚Äôt act like you have any right to be involved in my life.‚Äù)

^(I leaned in slightly, lowering my voice. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be involved in your life, Alicia. But I will be. And you have to accept it sooner or later.‚Äù)

^(She let out a frustrated sound, shoving past me and getting into her car. She didn‚Äôt slam the door, but I could see the tension in her grip on the steering wheel.)

^(As she drove off, I watched her go, shaking my head slightly.)

^(This was going to be interesting.)

^(\~\~\~)

^(A few days ago‚Ä¶)

^(The clinking of silverware against fine china filled the air of the Andrieux family dining room. The long mahogany table, set with an array of exquisite dishes, did little to ease the palpable discomfort between the four people seated around it.)

^(At the head of the table sat my father, Henry Andrieux, his piercing gaze hidden momentarily as he meticulously cut into his steak. My mother, Elsie, sat to his right, her delicate hands wrapped around the stem of her wine glass, while my sister, Rose, sat beside her, idly pushing a piece of salmon around her plate.)

^(I sat to my father‚Äôs left, absently slicing through the medium-rare cut of meat before me. The tension was a familiar companion at these dinners, woven into the very fabric of our family dynamic. My father‚Äôs voice finally cut through the quiet, steady, and authoritative as ever.)

^(‚ÄúNicholas,‚Äù he began dabbing his lips with a napkin before resting his elbows on the table. ‚ÄúHow is the Andrieux Real Estate Agency doing?‚Äù)

^(I took a bite of my steak, chewing thoughtfully before swallowing. ‚ÄúEverything is going well, under control,‚Äù I answered, keeping my tone measured. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve secured two major development projects in the past month, and the investors are more than satisfied.‚Äù)

^(My father gave a slow nod, a contemplative expression settling on his face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear.‚Äù)

^(A moment of silence stretched between us before he placed his utensils down with an audible clink and leaned back in his chair. ‚ÄúHowever, you will not be working alone in the Agency anymore.‚Äù)

^(My hand froze mid-cut, and I raised an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù)

^(Before my father could answer, the sharp sound of shoes clicking against the marble flooring echoed through the room. Instinctively, I turned my head towards the entrance, my muscles stiffening the moment my eyes landed on the person stepping into the dining room.)

^(A man I had not seen in years.)

^(Chapter 3 What‚Äôs Your Plan?)

^(Alicia Davenport)

^(My morning had already been ruined the moment Nicholas Andrieux walked through that door. I still couldn‚Äôt believe my parents would even consider arranging a marriage for me‚Äîlet alone to him. The mere thought of it made my stomach twist.)

^(How could they expect me to marry a man I barely knew? A man who, from our single encounter, had been nothing short of insufferable.)

^(Groaning aloud, I leaned back on my chair. ‚ÄúHow can my parents do this to me?‚Äù)

^(My phone vibrates in the middle of my racing mind. As I saw the caller ID, I couldn‚Äôt help but ignore the call.)

^(Of course, it‚Äôs my Dad. He will probably remind me to keep my behaviour in check in front of my so-called ‚Äúfuture husband‚Äù. Just hearing the name makes me want to puke.)

^(I stared at the words on my computer screen, but they may as well have been written in a foreign language. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt focus. My mind was a whirlwind of emotions‚Äîanger, frustration, sadness, and, worst of all, helplessness.)

^(Nicholas Andrieux. Just his name was enough to make my blood boil. And yet, here I was, being forced into a marriage with him.)

^(My fingers hovered over my laptop keyboard, but the words on the screen blurred together. Work was the last thing I could focus on when my entire life was being turned upside down.)

^(A sharp knock on my office door yanked me from my spiraling thoughts. I quickly straightened in my chair, rubbing at my temples before calling out, ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù)

^(The door swung open, and Cindy strutted in, radiating her usual confidence. Her blonde hair cascaded in effortless waves, and she carried two steaming cups of coffee in her hands. ‚ÄúMorning, sunshine,‚Äù she greeted me with a smirk, setting one of the cups on my desk.)

^(I took it without much enthusiasm, staring into the dark liquid before taking a sip. Cindy‚Äôs keen eyes scanned my face, her smirk fading into a concerned frown. ‚ÄúOkay, spill. You look like someone just ran over your puppy.‚Äù)

^(I let out a deep sigh, placing the cup down. ‚ÄúDaniel broke up with me.‚Äù)

^(Cindy‚Äôs eyes widened in shock. ‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù she nearly shouted. ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù)

^(I nodded weakly. My eyes burned, but I had no more tears left to shed. I had exhausted them all last night.)

^(Cindy quickly moved to my side, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand. You and Daniel were practically glued to each other. You two were like... the perfect couple! What the hell happened?‚Äù)

^(I swallowed the lump in my throat. I had cried myself to exhaustion last night, but even now, the pain lingered like a dull ache in my chest. ‚ÄúBecause of my parents,‚Äù I muttered.)

^(Cindy‚Äôs brows knitted together. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù)

^(I hesitated for a moment, then exhaled in defeat. ‚ÄúMy parents arranged a marriage for me.‚Äù)

^(Silence.)

^(Then-)

^(Cindy blinked, stunned into silence. Then, she shot up from the chair, nearly knocking it over. ‚ÄúExcuse me? An arranged marriage? In this century?‚Äù Her voice was laced with disbelief. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane! You can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù)

^(I let out a humorless chuckle. ‚ÄúTell me about it. I don‚Äôt want this marriage to happened.‚Äù)

^(She shook her head vigorously. ‚ÄúOkay, but why? Why would your parents do this to you?‚Äù)

^(I sighed, running a hand through my already messy hair. ‚ÄúBusiness. That‚Äôs all it is. Nicholas even said it himself‚Äîour marriage would be beneficial.‚Äù)

^(Cindy‚Äôs frown deepened. ‚ÄúWait. Nicholas? As in Nicholas Andrieux?‚Äù)

^(I blinked in surprise. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ how do you know?‚Äù)

^(She didn‚Äôt answer right away. Instead, she quickly leaned over my desk, grabbed my laptop, and began typing furiously. After a moment, she turned the screen toward me.)

^(‚ÄúNicholas Andrieux,‚Äù she read aloud, scrolling through the information. ‚ÄúThe most eligible bachelor in New York and Los Angeles. President of Andrieux Real Estate Agency. He‚Äôs ruthless in the business world, worth billions, and basically the definition of ‚Äòuntouchable.‚Äô‚Äù)

^(I leaned forward, skimming through the articles. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúSo not only am I being forced into a marriage, but I‚Äôm being handed over to a control-freak billionaire.‚Äù)

^(He was apparently a real estate mogul, feared and respected in the business world. His face was plastered on every finance magazine, exuding power and arrogance. Just great.)

^(Cindy shook her head in disbelief. ‚ÄúHow do you not know any of this?‚Äù)

^(I shrugged. ‚ÄúI knew who he was, but I didn‚Äôt really know him. I‚Äôve only met him once‚Äîa few months ago‚Äîand even then, he was an insufferable jerk.‚Äù)

^(Cindy let out a dry laugh. ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre getting married to him. Oh, the irony.‚Äù)

^(I groaned, rubbing my face in frustration. ‚ÄúYeah, hilarious.‚Äù)

^(Cindy studied me for a moment before crossing her arms. ‚ÄúSo, what are you going to do about it?‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I looked at her with confusion etched on my face.)

^(‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù)

^(I blinked at her. ‚ÄúMy plan?‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúYeah, obviously, you‚Äôre not going to sit back and let your parents dictate your life, right?‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúOf course not!‚Äù I shot up from my chair. ‚ÄúThere is no way in hell I‚Äôm marrying Nicholas Andrieux. I‚Äôd rather‚Äî‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúDie?‚Äù Cindy interrupted dryly. ‚ÄúClich√©, but noted.‚Äù)

^(I sighed, slumping back down. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do. My parents won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù)

^(Cindy tapped a finger against her chin, deep in thought. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I mean, you could run away.‚Äù)

^(I gave her a flat look. ‚ÄúOh, sure. Because fleeing the country is such an easy solution.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs an option,‚Äù Cindy said defensively. ‚ÄúBetter than marrying him. Or‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes twinkled mischievously. ‚ÄúYou could sabotage the engagement.‚Äù)

^(I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSabotage?‚Äù)

^(Cindy leaned in. ‚ÄúMake him regret ever choosing you. Be the worst fianc√©e imaginable. Make him want to back out.‚Äù)

^(I frowned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù)

^(She crossed her arms. ‚ÄúIs it? If he realizes you‚Äôre a ‚Äòterrible‚Äô match, he might just call it off himself.‚Äù)

^(I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt work. If I pull something like that, it could damage the Davenport business.‚Äù)

^(Cindy sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúFine. It was just a suggestion. So, what‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù)

^(I leaned back in my chair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going through with the marriage. I‚Äôll try talking to Daniel and figure something out.‚Äù)

^(Cindy gave me a skeptical look. ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôll fight for you?‚Äù)

^(I bit my lip, uncertainty creeping in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he will. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶my parents were involved with this matter, and they talk to Daniel about my marriage to Nicholas.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúDamn! No wonder he broke up with you.‚Äù)

^(I glared at Cindy, and she put her hands up in surrender. ‚ÄúI was joking, but yeah, you should talk to Daniel. Try explain I to him and maybe he will understand.‚Äù)

^(I nodded. ‚ÄúI will. I hope he understands.‚Äù)

^(She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he will understand. After all, you guys have been together for three years. You two love each other. But if that doesn‚Äôt work, we go with Plan B‚Äîsabotage.‚Äù)

^(I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúNot happening.‚Äù)

^(Cindy smirked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù)

^(Chapter 4 Seeing Daniel)

^(Alicia Davenport)

^(I left work early, eager to see Daniel. I had texted him earlier, but he still hadn‚Äôt replied. A sinking feeling settled in my chest‚Äîhe was avoiding me. But why? It couldn‚Äôt just be about my parents pushing for me to get married. There had to be something more. Something deeper.)

^(The thought gnawed at me as I got into my car and started the long drive to his workplace. I had never actually been there before. Usually, he was the one coming to see me. I had passed by his office building plenty of times, but this was my first time stepping inside.)

^(As I drove, I rehearsed what I would say.)

^(‚ÄúDaniel, why are you avoiding me?‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what my parents said. I want to be with you.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúYou should have talked to me first before deciding we‚Äôre over.‚Äù)

^(I sighed. No matter how I phrased it, I knew he would push back. He always put me first, sometimes at his own expense. I just had to make him understand that I wasn‚Äôt willing to let him go.)

^(When I arrived, I took a deep breath and stepped out of my car. The office was a modern glass building, simple but elegant. I entered the lobby and found the reception desk.)

^(‚ÄúI'm here to see Daniel Anderson,‚Äù I said confidently.)

^(The receptionist smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, miss. May I know what your purpose is?‚Äù)

^(I cleared my throat as I wasn‚Äôt expecting this. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm here to see Daniel Anderson. There are... some important matters that I need to solve with him.‚Äù)

^(I crossed my finger behind my back, hoping that the receptionist would let me go and stop questioning me. ‚ÄúOf course. Mr. Anderson is on the fifth floor.‚Äù)

^(I thanked her and made my way up, my heart pounding. The hallway was bustling with employees, but I tuned them out, focusing on the only person I had come to see.)

^(I stepped onto his floor and scanned the room, but I didn‚Äôt see Daniel. then I walked around with him, eyes scanning to find Daniel, and I spotted him immediately as I walked out from another room. He was standing on the balcony, laughing with a group of coworkers. The sight made my heart clench‚Äîhe looked so at ease, so natural.)

^(But when I called his name and waved, his expression shifted. His smile disappeared, replaced by surprise and something else... hesitation.)

^(His friends turned to me, eyes filled with curiosity.)

^(‚ÄúWho's this?‚Äù one of them asked, looking between me and Daniel. ‚ÄúAnd why haven‚Äôt you introduced us before, man?‚Äù)

^(Daniel cleared his throat, avoiding my gaze. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs... just a friend,‚Äù he said hesitantly.)

^(His words hit me like a slap.)

^(I forced a smile, ignoring the sharp sting in my chest.)

^(‚ÄúHello, nice to meet you,‚Äù I said shyly as I greeted them.)

^(‚ÄúWow, miss, you look beautiful, and you look quite familiar.‚Äù One of his friends say that as he looked at my face.)

^(‚ÄúUm... thank you, and I think you mistaken me for someone else.‚Äù I smile awkwardly.)

^(Before they could answer, Daniel cut him off.)

^(‚ÄúDo you mind leaving us alone, guys? I need to talk my friend for a minute.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúYeah, sure.‚Äù)

^(His friends seemed oblivious to the tension, exchanging glances before excusing themselves, leaving us alone.)

^(The moment they were out of earshot, Daniel turned to me, his expression unreadable.)

^(Silence filled the air between us before Daniel decided to speak first.)

^(‚ÄúAlicia, what are you doing here?‚Äù His tone was clipped, almost annoyed. He frowned as he looked at me.)

^(I frowned. ‚ÄúWhy are you talking to me like that? You didn‚Äôt answer my texts, so I came to see you. I wanted to talk.‚Äù)

^(He exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúAlicia‚Ä¶ we broke up. Why should I answer your texts?‚Äù)

^(I flinched but quickly recovered. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt break up,‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúYou broke up with me without even giving me a chance to say anything. I haven‚Äôt even said a word, and you just left me there, Daniel. At the lake. Do you think that was fair?‚Äù)

^(His jaw tightened, but he said nothing.)

^(I stepped closer, searching his face. ‚ÄúWhat did my parents say to you?‚Äù)

^(He averted his eyes, staring past me as if hoping I would drop the subject.)

^(I wasn‚Äôt going to.)

^(‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù I pressed, my voice firm, ‚Äúwhat did they say to you?‚Äù)

^(He sighed heavily and turned away, gripping the balcony railing. ‚ÄúYou want to know what they say to me? They told me to stay away from you,‚Äù he finally admitted, his voice low. ‚ÄúThat I don‚Äôt deserve you. That we come from different worlds.‚Äù)

^(Anger boiled inside me. ‚ÄúThey had no right to say that!‚Äù)

^(Daniel let out a bitter chuckle. ‚ÄúThey think they do. They said you‚Äôre meant to take over Davenport Architects, and I‚Äôm just a regular guy. They don‚Äôt want you wasting your time on someone beneath you.‚Äù)

^(I clenched my fists. I had expected them to disapprove, but¬†this? It was cruel.)

^(‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not all, is it?‚Äù I whispered.)

^(Daniel hesitated before nodding. ‚ÄúThey said if I didn‚Äôt leave you, they‚Äôd ruin my life. My family‚Äôs life.‚Äù He finally met my eyes, pain flickering in his gaze. ‚ÄúThey threatened to destroy everything I care about, Alicia. I had no choice.‚Äù)

^(Shock rippled through me. My parents‚Äîmy own parents‚Äîhad done this? They had threatened him? I felt sick.)

^(‚ÄúThey told me not to tell you,‚Äù Daniel continued, his voice soft now. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt lie to you, Alicia. I love you too much for that.‚Äù)

^(Tears pricked at my eyes. I reached for his hand, squeezing it tightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre blinded by their obsession with power. They don‚Äôt understand that I love you. That I¬†choose¬†you.‚Äù)

^(He exhaled shakily, lifting his hand to caress my cheek. ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI never wanted to leave you. But what was I supposed to do? Fight them? They have all the power.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúThen let¬†me¬†fight them,‚Äù I said fiercely. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre¬†my¬†parents, and I won‚Äôt let them control my life like this.‚Äù)

^(He looked at me, a mixture of hope and doubt in his eyes. ‚ÄúAlicia‚Ä¶‚Äù)

^(I reached up and cupped his face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose you, Daniel. I won‚Äôt. We‚Äôll face this together.‚Äù)

^(His thumb brushed against my cheek, wiping away a tear that had slipped free.)

^(‚ÄúBut what if‚Äî‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúNo¬†what ifs,‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúI love you, and that‚Äôs not going to change. They might think they can dictate my life, but they‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù)

^(He studied me for a long moment, then let out a breath of laughter‚Äîsoft, disbelieving. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre incredible, you know that?‚Äù)

^(I smiled through my tears. ‚ÄúTook you long enough to realize.‚Äù)

^(He pulled me into his arms, holding me tightly. I buried my face in his chest, breathing in his familiar scent, feeling the steady beat of his heart.)

^(For the first time in days, I felt like I could breathe again.)

^(But this wasn‚Äôt over.)

^(I was going to confront my parents. And this time, I wouldn‚Äôt back down.)

^(Chapter 5 The Argument)

^(Alicia Davenport)

^(The drive home felt like a blur. My hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, my mind replaying Daniel‚Äôs words over and over again.)

^(‚ÄúThey threatened to destroy everything I care about, Alicia. I had no choice.‚Äù)

^(My own parents had threatened him. They had used their power and influence to force the man I love to walk away from me. How could they? How could they think they had the right to decide who I could or couldn‚Äôt be with?)

^(By the time I pulled up to my house, fury was burning inside me like a raging fire. I slammed the car door shut and stormed up the front steps. The grand, towering mansion that once felt like home now felt like a cage. A place where power dictated love.)

^(I pushed the heavy door open with force, not caring if the noise startled anyone inside. The moment I stepped in, the smell of freshly cooked dinner filled the air, but it did nothing to calm me. I headed straight for the dining room, where my parents always had their dinner at this hour.)

^(Sure enough, my mother and father were seated at the long, elegant table, enjoying a lavish meal. Crystal glasses of wine reflected the golden chandelier light, and the delicate clinking of silverware echoed in the room.)

^(My mother looked up and smiled when she saw me. ‚ÄúOh, Alicia, dear, you‚Äôre home early‚Äî‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúSave it,‚Äù I snapped, cutting her off. ‚ÄúTell me what you said to Daniel.‚Äù)

^(The room fell silent.)

^(My father‚Äôs expression hardened, and my mother set down her fork, her smile faltering.)

^(‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù she said, her tone calm but laced with warning.)

^(‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù My voice shook with anger. ‚ÄúWhat exactly did you say to him? What threats did you make?‚Äù)

^(My father took a slow sip of his wine before answering. ‚ÄúAlicia, I don‚Äôt appreciate being spoken to like this.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt appreciate¬†you¬†trying to ruin my relationship!‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúYou went behind my back and threatened the man I love. Do you have any idea how cruel that is?‚Äù)

^(My mother let out a soft sigh and placed a hand over mine, as if that would calm me. ‚ÄúSweetheart, we did what was best for you.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúBest for me?‚Äù I pulled my hand away, glaring at her. ‚ÄúYou think breaking my heart is what‚Äôs best for me?)

^(My father finally set his glass down and leaned forward. ‚ÄúAlicia, Daniel is not the right man for you. He has no future, no status. You are the heir to¬†Davenport Architects. Do you think you can just live an ordinary life with someone like him?‚Äù)

^(I scoffed. ‚ÄúSo this is about status? Money?‚Äù)

^(My mother nodded slightly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about security, Alicia. You have a duty to uphold. A man like Daniel will never be able to support you in the way you deserve.‚Äù)

^(I pushed my chair back so hard it screeched against the marble floor. ‚ÄúI¬†don‚Äôt need¬†him to support me! I love him because of¬†who he is, not because of his wealth or power!‚Äù)

^(My father shook his head. ‚ÄúLove fades, Alicia. Reality doesn‚Äôt. Do you think your lifestyle is something Daniel can provide for you? What happens when the pressure becomes too much for him? When you realize he cannot stand by your side as an equal?‚Äù)

^(I clenched my fists, trying to control the anger rising inside me. ‚ÄúAnd what gives you the right to threaten him? To tell him you‚Äôd destroy his life if he didn‚Äôt leave me?‚Äù)

^(My mother pursed her lips, as if my words were nothing more than childish complaints. ‚ÄúWe only did what was necessary. Daniel understood. He knows his place, even if you refuse to see it.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúHis¬†place?‚Äù I repeated, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúHe is not beneath me. He is not¬†less¬†than me. And if you think I‚Äôll just accept this, you‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù)

^(My father exhaled sharply, frustration creeping into his tone. ‚ÄúAlicia, we have given you¬†everything. The best education, the best opportunities, the best life. And now you want to throw it all away for some¬†ordinary man?‚Äù)

^(I looked him straight in the eye. I never asked for any of this if it meant giving up the person I love.‚Äù)

^(Silence.)

^(For the first time, I saw a flicker of uncertainty in my mother‚Äôs expression.)

^(I swallowed hard, steadying my voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some asset for you to control. I make my own choices. And I choose¬†him.‚Äù)

^(My father stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. ‚ÄúYou will not speak to us like this, Alicia.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúI¬†will¬†speak to you however I want,‚Äù I shot back. ‚ÄúBecause I am¬†done¬†letting you manipulate my life.‚Äù)

^(My mother reached for me again. ‚ÄúAlicia, sweetheart‚Äî‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to act like you care about my happiness when you did everything in your power to destroy it.‚Äù)

^(I turned toward my father, my chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. ‚ÄúYou think Daniel isn‚Äôt good enough for me? You think he‚Äôs weak because he doesn‚Äôt come from money?‚Äù I laughed bitterly. ‚ÄúThen you clearly don‚Äôt know what¬†true strength looks like.‚Äù)

^(I saw something shift in my mother‚Äôs eyes‚Äîguilt, maybe? But my father‚Äôs expression remained cold.)

^(I shook my head. ‚ÄúI thought I could reason with you. But I see now that you‚Äôll never change. And if you think you can control me, you‚Äôre wrong. I am¬†not¬†giving him up. No matter what you do.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúAlicia,‚Äù my mother pleaded, her voice softer now. ‚ÄúThink about what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù)

^(‚ÄúI have,‚Äù I said firmly. ‚ÄúAnd if you can‚Äôt accept my decision, then maybe I don‚Äôt belong here anymore.‚Äù)

^(My father‚Äôs jaw clenched. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare.‚Äù)

^(I stared at him, my heart hammering. ‚ÄúWatch me.‚Äù)

^(Without another word, I turned and stormed out of the dining room. I could hear my mother calling after me, but I ignored her.)

^(I grabbed my bag and keys, my hands trembling as I opened the front door. I needed air. I needed space.)

^(I needed to see Daniel.)

^(Because now, there was no doubt in my mind‚Äîhe was worth fighting for. And I¬†would¬†fight. Even if it meant walking away from everything I had ever known.)

^(\~\~\~)

^(My heart was still racing from the argument with my parents, and my mind buzzed with anger and frustration. They had no right to interfere in my life like this. They had no right to decide who I could love.)

^(I didn't have a real destination in mind, but deep down, I knew where I wanted to go. The lake.¬†Our¬†lake.)

^(It was where Daniel and I always went when we wanted to escape from the world. A quiet place where we could just be ourselves, away from expectations and responsibilities. Part of me hoped‚Äîno,¬†needed‚Äîto see him there. To reassure myself that everything would be okay. That we could fight this together.)

^(But as I pulled up near the lake, I saw that I wasn‚Äôt alone.)

^(A figure sat on the bench facing the water, his posture relaxed, as if he had all the time in the world. The soft glow of the nearby streetlamp cast a faint light on his profile. I frowned, my heart sinking with disappointment when I realized it wasn‚Äôt Daniel.)

^(‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù)

1jrvzhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jrvzhh/i_think_all_my_friends_hate_me_and_i_dont_know/,I think all my friends hate me and I dont know what to do.,"First time poster so lmk if anything needs clarification. I (22F) have always had a hard time making close friends but i have always been good at meeting people and making small talk. I really hoped that I could make some close friends in college but im now a second semester senior and the two people I thought were going to be life long friends of mine have started to pull away and alienate me. 

TLDR: my so called friends have been excluding me, at first I think it was unintentional and now I feel like it‚Äôs on purpose. Mostly just micro aggressions and cryptic mind games so theres a chance I‚Äôm just overly sensitive but I really think they‚Äôre trying to tell me something with their actions. 

Background (I wrote so much, the most recent stuff is in the paragraph before the questions if you want to skip): 
(Fake names btw) Anna (23F) and Ira (22NB) and I are all in the same major and have basically had the same class schedule for the last three years. Ira and I were close all sophomore year but I left junior fall and came back to Ira and Anna having grown a lot closer (which I knew was going to happen) all junior spring all three of us were close but I  kept feeling like Ira didn‚Äôt mind talking to me but had no intention of really being my friend. Ira has a small friend group thats very close and live together and while I tried to be a part of their group I always just felt like I didn‚Äôt belong (also they are all very non confrontational and passive aggressive and a few of them are genuinely disrespectful when it comes to Ira and their personal space). I started to realize that Ira never wanted to hang out with me outside of school even when I would invite them and offer to pay for stuff if that was the reason they couldn‚Äôt come. And overall just started to hurt my feelings with their actions and lack of effort into our friendship. 

I dont want to get too specific bc im scared that they might find this but basically our major requires us to do alot of work outside of class and you‚Äôre technically not allowed to work without a buddy so were often around eachother alot. It was pretty normal for all three of us to take breaks together and get coffee or food‚Äî like if one person couldnt leave at the moment we would wait and/or offer to grab them something. Whenever we had to take public transport for classes if i didn‚Äôt text the two of them to see what time we were meeting up i would often walk to the station to see them there together or see one of them there waiting for the other sometimes holding an extra coffee or pastry. And every time this would happen they would act surprised to see me and Im ngl i would always go home and cry after. This year ira and anna have been taking breaks and going in and doing work together without telling me or inviting me. They dont wait for me after class or take as much time to stop and talk. But they are always talking to each other and leaving and coming back together. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first but it started to make me feel really left out and also I wasn‚Äôt able to get as much work done because they stopped telling me when they were going in to work. I would only find out because I had their locations. There was one time where I had asked anna to tell me when she was going in and she said she would text me when she went in. I ended up waiting three hours because I didn‚Äôt want to risk going in alone. I just assumed Anna had fallen asleep. I check my find my friends alot bc both my parents and siblings aren‚Äôt allowed to take personal calls at work so I always check before I call. I check my map and see Ira and Anna at work‚Äî gut punch. I ended up telling anna that it hurt my feelings but I just got some half assed apology over text. 

Anna and I had lived together for a little and we adopted a dog together. I was actually very uncertain about it because, as close as I thought anna and I were, I didn‚Äôt think we were close enough to own a dog together but we fostered this puppy and totally fell in love. neither of us could afford a dog on our own but we both plan to stay in our city so we wrote a little contract and ended up keeping the dog who has honestly saved my life. Also over the course of us living together junior summer I confessed to anna that iras behavior (while possibly indirect) hurts my feelings and that Im tired of being the only one who puts effort into that friendship. She didn‚Äôt necessarily agree with me but comforted me and validated my feelings in a way that made me feel like I could trust her. Anna eventually had to move out and we coparent our dog which has actually been really working but our friendship has changed. Im very insecure and anxious so I overthink everything and read into anything that could possibly be considered negative. Anna knows this but constantly says and texts things that hurt my feelings and makes me spiral all the time. Of course for our dog, I communicated with anna about how she has been making me feel and she tried to work on changing her tone with me but it only lasted like a week before we were back to hard-to-discern texts that made me anxious. Every conversation between us has always ended with me apologizing for being too difficult or being too anxious not necessarily because anna puts the blame on me but because I blame myself and feel like if I apologize that will always fix everything (stupid I know I working on it). But you would think that after being friends for so long and living together Anna would catch on to the fact that I apologize even when things are very clearly not my fault. She on the other hand has never sincerely apologized even when she has to change plans last minute on me or when she ‚Äúforgets‚Äù to respond to my texts when I need a favor or for the fact that her behavior and tone makes me feel so insecure and small. I actually really care about anna and I would prefer that we stay friends but if she doesn‚Äôt want to put in the effort (literally just communicate better and just be a little more considerate about the way she talks to me) I guess we could just co parent our dog and not be super close?

Some background about me: I admit Im very desperate for friendship. So I let people walk all over for me and ill always offer to pay for things if it means people will spend time with me. Of course this leaves me with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who just use me like a doormat and never actually want to be friends with me but im working on it. Im in therapy and im on different medications, and trying to figure out what works for me which has honestly been extremely difficult but I havent felt close enough to talk to Ira or Anna about how crappy Ive been feeling recently (ira specifically gets very uncomfortable when i talk about my feelings so i kind of just stopped being honest about my feelings). They both know that im on new medications but only anna has ever asked me about how im feeling on them (although the way she asks never actually felt like concern but more like pity, so I haven‚Äôt really told her how difficult it has been). Ill admit that ive been very anxious and overly observant so all year ive basically been gaslighting myself into thinking im over reacting but my therapist and a new, neutral friend both confirm that even if the two of them aren‚Äôt doing things on purpose, the trust and transparency is not there and that my feelings of being alienated are not unwarranted. 

Right now we are all prepping for our final. Which is a really big event and we are all extremely stressed. Ira and Anna have been handling the stress a bit better than I am but they also both have partners and other friends.  And I don‚Äôt have a partner and besides them, my best friend lives in another state and is always really busy so I cant always just call her whenever I‚Äôm having hard to process feelings. I did kind of have one other close friend who cut me off with basically no explanation except that they had heard a rumor that I was talking poorly about their friends. This of course made me spiral but I couldn‚Äôt talk to Ira or Anna about It because they both know the person that cut me off and I didn‚Äôt want to end up accidentally doing the thing I was being accused of. Anyway, basically Ira and Anna keep taking breaks without me and have all together stopped inviting me to grab coffee or snacks. And whenever I invite them they will almost always say no unless both of them want to go. Most recently with Ira there was one day where it was just us doing work, after a few hours im pretty hungry so I ask if Ira wants to grab lunch or a snack and they say no, that they don‚Äôt want to spend any money (which is valid but js their normal response to me, I used to offer to pay but I eventually realized that they would just say they didn‚Äôt want to spend money instead of saying no which honestly hurts my feeling more). Literally like an hour later they get a call from someone who asks them if they‚Äôre hungry they are like ‚Äúyeah sure‚Äù and they leave and come back with a coffee and sandwich‚Äî so yeah I cried that night too. And another day I come in to work and anna Is there, I walk in and she says hi but nothing else. Not too long after Ira walks in and suddenly Anna is so chatty. Im very clearly not part of their conversation so I just keep working. A few times I try to chime in with jokes or something but I just get pity laughs‚Äî so I go to the bathroom to cry a few times not that they noticed. Eventually I overhear that annas boyfriend is gonna stop by and ira is so excited and anna is so nervous. I was going to jump in and also be excited about it but anna specifically only told Ira ( even though i was literally right next to them) that he was coming even though I was going to be there when he came in. He stops by, and literally just says hi and then works on his laptop in silence (like wtf). Mind you Anna has talked to me about him and I know about their relationship, which is so unstable btw, but suddenly now im not important enough to be introduced to him. Okay I guess. Anna and her BF leave and  then Ira leaves and im left by myself. Anna realizes she left a machine on and texts me and asks me to turn it off before I leave. And also that she wont be able to make our very early vet appointment the next morning (which was very early because Anna asked it to be that early). Because im a sucker with no backbone I agree. Also Anna removed me from find my friends she gave me an excuse that she was updating her phone and that it should turn back on in an hour but it never did. So I ended up removing her from my find my friends as well. She actually brought it up while we were texting and she asked me if I could see her location and I told her that I havent been able to see it for weeks. Her response was ‚ÄúI actually dont care‚Äù (verbatim) and then spammed me with other texts, seemingly trying to distract me from responding. All of this of course has made me question my friendships and I am really circling the loneliness drain.  I used to be okay with people walking all over me but now that I‚Äôm in therapy I actually care about the way people treat me. I lowk miss when I didn‚Äôt care how people treated me because at least then I wasn‚Äôt alone all the time. 

Questions:
What do I do?
My therapist says i need to have a serious conversation with them about putting in more effort but ive already tried to have a serious conversation with them and afterwards they just seem to pull away from me. 
Has anyone actually had any success with asking their friends to change their behavior and be more inclusive?
Im honestly so distraught all the time and my work has definitely suffered because I don‚Äôt want to go in, in fear of getting my feelings hurt. 
Obviously it‚Äôs my fault that I haven‚Äôt been totally honest about my feelings but they also have not made me feel safe enough to want to tell them. 
Should I just stop trying? See what happens when I put in the same effort they do?
How do I handle this like an adult? 
College is almost over and I doubt Ira will ever see me again on purpose but Anna and I have a dog and the longer we have the dog the more I want to keep her for myself. 
I just want to stop crying so much. This has been the loneliest year of my life. 
Any advice?

1jrvshc,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1jrvshc/first_time_admitting_here_goes/,First time admitting - here goes.,"Hey,

Can't believe I'm writing this..I'm 27 and I have always drank on and off since I was about 15. My mom drinks a lot and dad used to but doesn't so much now - My mom hides small bottles of alcohol like the small hard liquor bottles and takes little sips throughout the day..once she drank a whole half bottle of whiskey in one day. I drove drunk once and my boyfriend very calmly told me that I could have killed somebody on the road, or myself..I promised him I'd stop but I still did it again and again. I'm also on mental health medication and I know it doesn't go well with alcohol, but I lied to my boyfriend about how I could mix the meds with alcohol. When he found out I had lied he became upset. I would just see drinking as something fun to do after work, and my boyfriend would worry about where I was. Sometimes I'd stay out very late drinking. He would get sad and disappointed. One time I kissed another woman in front of him (on the cheek) after giving her my number and flirted with his friend. I only know this because he told me afterwards, but I don't remember. He was sad about it, and he asked me to stop a few times. I told him I would do better. Eventually I got sick with an unrelated illness and I got hospitalized and I needed a major surgery. He came to visit me every day - driving 2 hours each way sometimes when he couldn't stay over  - but before I went in I drove drunk again and drove my car into a trash can. I don't remember this either but my boyfriend was there and told me - some of my friends were there drinking also and they confirmed his story. My boyfriend told me he felt so guilty that he could not get my car keys off me...anyway. I subsequently had to go into hospital again and I began drinking immediately after - I had never felt so alone and drinking helped me to feel better but my boyfriend was so sad. He started going to Al Anon to cope (I found this out afterwards) - eventually he left. I am so angry at him for leaving but I know he did what he had to do for himself. I had also told him that I didn't want him to live in the house we shared any more because I was annoyed at him keep being mad at me for my drinking and I needed space. He was devastated and there were many tears. I had bought him some office furniture when we moved in together and he said he couldn't bear to take it with him because it reminded him of the times when I had wanted to live with him. I withdrew from everyone at the time not just him. He left and then, one of his best friends died. He was in a very bad way but when I invited him over, I was drunk. He finally told me he couldn't do it any more and left - he broke up with me. When I had to go into hospital again the next day, he came to visit me even though we had broken up. But I could tell it was over. He came to get the rest of his things and I left him a letter saying that I was going to stop drinking. He replied to me with an email saying that he still loved me but that my drinking had made him miserable, and that if I could get sober and stay sober for 6 months then we could see about the future. I was so mad at him that I just forgot about the email and carried on with my life. Then after some months he moved away. I heard that he's visiting our old hometown soon so I reached out asking if we could get coffee. He said he wanted to speak on the phone first. We spoke for about an hour..I had forgotten about his email and I felt guilty when he told me how he had been waiting and hoping for a reply, but that eventually after 6 months he had decided to move on. I was still mad at him and told him he had been brutal by abandoning me while I was sick. But he said he'd tried and tried to make the relationship work, and he became frustrated as I always put alcohol first. I had to go to work but asked him to reach out if he wanted to talk more.

1jrvoeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1jrvoeu/finally_some_peace/,Finally some peace,"Started 20mg about 3 months ago for anxiety. 
Changed my life. Friends and family have even commented that I seem more easy going. 

For the first week, I felt a placebo effect. Probably just the excitement of trying something new. By week two, I was feeling a little nauseous everytime I took it but kind of in a good intoxicated way. Like I had just had a drink. And I thankfully started feeling very uninterested in the sort of rumination and hyper vigilance my brain used to do as default. 
By week 6, I was completely amazed at the transformation. I still am. My mind is so much calmer and more at peace. I no longer leave social situations and replay the conversations over and over in my head. I no longer get agitated at every small inconvenience in my day. I no longer hyper fixate on everybody‚Äôs tone and possible meaning behind things. The only way to describe it is that I‚Äôm simply uninterested in all that. I literally think to myself ‚Äúah, who cares. There‚Äôs better stuff to think about.‚ÄùI feel like I‚Äôve been given exactly what I always wanted: a clear relaxed head that is capable of being in the moment. 


The only negative side effect I can think of is that I‚Äôm very tired and yawny by the afternoon. Nothing that a cup of coffee won‚Äôt fix.

One surprising effect is that alcohol doesn‚Äôt entice me the way it used to. The buzz from a beer is now more of a nuisance than a joy because Im simply already relaxed.

1jrvoea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1jrvoea/three_coffees_later/,Three Coffees Later...!,"> ""Not a rant, but a story...""
That‚Äôs the first line I read after she disappeared.



Her journal wasn‚Äôt hidden. It was on her desk, half-buried under a pile of old receipts and lipstick-stained coffee sleeves. It looked ordinary ‚Äî not like the last breadcrumb a daughter might leave behind.

She called it a story.
I now call it evidence.


---


She was always a romantic ‚Äî drawn to those strange, cinematic moments that seemed too perfect to be real. I used to tease her for it. Her life, she'd say, was waiting to become a short film. So when she started telling me about ‚Äúthe coffee shop guy,‚Äù I smiled, nodded, and moved on.

Now I replay every word.


---

Excerpt from her journal  - Jan 2025

> ‚ÄúPhoenix Mall. Starbucks.
He asked to sit.
Tall. Confident. Charcoal grey shirt.
Didn't talk after that. Just worked. Still‚Ä¶ something about him stayed in my head.‚Äù


---

Excerpt - Feb 2025

> ‚ÄúDifferent caf√©. Different part of town.
I spotted him again. Same laptop. Same focused face.
I didn‚Äôt even say anything.
It shook me a little. Chennai‚Äôs too big for this to be random, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúStill, I laughed it off. It's probably nothing.‚Äù




---

Excerpt ‚Äì March 2025

> ‚ÄúLunch at Dou, Alwarpet.
Italian food. Great pastries.
Him. Again.
This time in a beige linen shirt, Pinterest-vibe, completely effortless.
And me, sitting there wondering if I‚Äôm in a rom-com‚Ä¶ or if something else is happening.‚Äù

Part III: The Police Involvement

When she didn‚Äôt return home one night in October, we called the police.

Two days later, her phone was found ‚Äî wiped clean except for one open browser tab:
‚ÄúProbability of meeting the same stranger three times in different places.‚Äù

It led to the math:

> P = 0.005 √ó 0.005 √ó 0.005 = 0.000000125 = 0.0000125%
That‚Äôs 1 in 8 million.



The officers leaned in.
""Three times isn't a coincidence,"" one of them said. ""That's planning.""


---

Part IV: The Twist

CCTV footage confirmed it.

He had been at each location before she arrived.
In fact, he‚Äôd arrived minutes before every time ‚Äî watching, waiting, sometimes already seated with an empty coffee cup and his laptop as bait.

He wasn‚Äôt just appearing in her life.

He was orchestrating it.


---

Part V: The Revelation

The detectives traced his face through facial recognition. He‚Äôd changed his name multiple times. No social media. No digital trail. But in three other cities, years apart, three different women had eerily similar journal entries, police reports, and then‚Ä¶ silence.

In each case, it started the same way:
Three encounters. A man with a laptop. A romantic coincidence.
And then they vanished.

They never suspected a thing. Not until it was too late.


---

Part VI: Her Mother‚Äôs Final Entry

> I don‚Äôt know if she knew.
If she realized that what felt like fate‚Ä¶ was actually a trap built with perfect precision.
That someone had studied her routines, her hangouts, her preferences ‚Äî and built a love story with a calculated ending.



She thought she was living a rom-com.
But she was the unwitting lead in a psychological thriller.

Three coffees later‚Ä¶ she was gone.

Here‚Äôs what happens (from what I remember):

FMC lives with her mum and little sister and they‚Äôre currently staying at a hotel. At the beginning of the story, the FMC goes out for coffee and stumbles upon MMC who is sitting at the bridge >!I think he was feeling suicidal!< the fmc decides to approach and talk to the Mmc and they pretty much connect. 

Later, fmc discovers that her mum is dating the MMC‚Äôs dad and they‚Äôre stepsiblings and they go to the same school. Upon realising that they‚Äôre stepsiblings, the Mmc immediately starts treating the fmc coldly and pretty much bullying (?) her. The main reason is because of the fmc mother >!Who is sexually abusing the Mmc and blackmailing him with a sextape!< 

I remember really liking the fmc. She was sweet and kind. Despite being pushed away by the Mmc, she always wants to help him and he gradually falls for her because of that. I also remember the Mmc is an athlete (i think) and does swimming >!There was this scene where the fmc witnesses the coach crouching in front of the Mmc which causes her to misunderstand and believe that it was the coach who was sexually abusing the Mmc which was why the plot twist at the end was pretty shocking!<

I‚Äôve seen a lot of younger guys struggling with how to approach women they‚Äôre into, how to keep the conversation flowing, and most importantly, how to avoid falling into the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù trap. 

I‚Äôve been there, made the mistakes, and learned a few things along the way. Here's what I've learned. Hopefully this helps someone out.

**1. Don‚Äôt overthink the opener ‚Äî just be normal.**

You don‚Äôt need a pickup line. A simple ‚ÄúHey, I noticed you \[insert something specific or interesting about her\], and I thought I‚Äôd say hi‚Äù works wonders. The goal is to spark interest, not impress her with a pickup line.

Examples:

* ‚ÄúHey, I saw you were reading \[book title\], is it good?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a cool vibe. Mind if I sit here?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting shirt; where‚Äôd you get it?‚Äù

It‚Äôs not about the line; it‚Äôs about how you say it. 

Be calm, confident, and smile.

**2. Ask open-ended questions and actually listen.**

Avoid the boring ‚ÄúWhat do you do? Where are you from?‚Äù rapid fire. Instead, go for:

* ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre really into these days?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhat kind of Music makes you feel alive?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúTell me the story behind \[something she‚Äôs wearing or doing\].‚Äù

And when she responds, *listen*. Show genuine curiosity. Don‚Äôt just wait for your turn to speak.

**3. Share things about yourself too, don‚Äôt be an interviewer.**

If she says she loves painting, don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúOh cool‚Äù and move on. Talk about how you suck at drawing stick figures or how you tried to sketch your dog once. Keep it real. Vulnerability builds connection.

**4. Be playful, not overly nice.**

Being kind is good. But being overly agreeable or always complimenting her doesn‚Äôt spark attraction. Light teasing, playful banter, and a bit of humor goes a long way. 

Example:

She says she loves astrology

You: ‚ÄúSo you already know my entire personality based on my star sign? Should I be scared?‚Äù

Keep it respectful, but don‚Äôt be afraid to joke around a little.

**5. Set your intentions early (subtly)**

Don‚Äôt hide your interest under the guise of ‚Äújust being friends.‚Äù You can still be respectful and let her know you‚Äôre interested in more than friendship. 

It can be as simple as:

* ‚ÄúI like talking to you. I‚Äôd like to get to know you better, maybe over coffee sometime?‚Äù

If she‚Äôs not into it, that‚Äôs fine. But don‚Äôt fall into the trap of being the ‚Äúemotional support friend‚Äù while secretly hoping she‚Äôll date you one day.

**6. If it‚Äôs not reciprocated, walk away respectfully.**

If she‚Äôs not showing the same level of interest, pulling back, or saying she just wants to be friends, accept it. Don‚Äôt try to convince her. Just move on. Self-respect is attractive.

Confidence is built through practice, not theory. You‚Äôll fumble sometimes. You might get rejected. But every conversation teaches you something. Focus on growing, not just ‚Äúgetting the girl.‚Äù

Fuck the machinery that turns people into statistics.

Can we just acknowledge the BRUTAL SIMPLICITY beneath all this noise? Children‚Äîactual kids with favorite cartoons and bedtime rituals‚Äîare being pulled from rubble with their spines exposed. Families vaporized as they have what they call breakfast. Six-month-olds dying of dehydration while the world debates semantics.

Just because it's happening inside your phone's glass rectangle doesn't make it LESS REAL. Distance is just the comforting lie we tell ourselves between coffee breaks as fathers carry daughters missing limbs, their small bodies wrapped in whatever bloodstained fabric could be found. Geography means nothing when the same red blood seeps into the same brown earth.

This isn't complex: No belief system‚Äîno matter how righteous‚Äîno ancestral claim‚Äîno matter how deeply felt‚Äîno fear for safety‚Äîno matter how justified‚Äî excuses the teenager with shrapnel embedded in her face, waiting days for pain medication that may never come through. The bombs falling on apartment buildings full of sleeping families. The hunger hollowing out toddlers' cheeks until their skulls look like Halloween decorations. The grandparents sleeping in tents who've already rebuilt their lives twice before. The nightmares that will outlive the conflict. The trauma wrapped inside trauma wrapped inside more trauma.

The most TWISTED part? We're all unwilling participants in this horror show. Conscripted into having opinions about genocide between Instagram posts and Netflix binges while doctors perform C-sections by candlelight, newborns gasping first breaths in buildings shaking from nearby explosions. Our minds toggle between atrocity footage and work deadlines, our timelines fracturing over massacres happening in places most of us couldn't find on an unlabeled map.

We've completely lost ourselves when we're arguing about legal technicalities while parents identify children by their sneakers in rubble, by a birthmark on what remains of a torso. When we're debating rhetoric while surgeons amputate limbs using phone flashlights, while kids with exposed intestines wait their turn.

And even these descriptions fall catastrophically short‚Äîsanitized pixels on a screen compared to the actual hell of flesh and bone and fear and grief.

The clear truth isn't buried in complexity. It's right in front of us, raw and uncomfortably loud: Every human caught in this meat grinder deserves better than to become content for our doomscrolling thumbs.

Basic human decency screams what diplomatic language cannot: This shit must STOP. NOW. But it won't, will it? We've already normalized mass graves as background noise to our daily lives, already trained ourselves to scroll past charred bodies on our way to the next dopamine hit. The real horror isn't just what's happening there‚Äîit's that we're still here, scrolling, living, adapting to a world where this is just Tuesday.",1,1743827638.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

* **Build, expand, and specialize** your cities‚Äîwoodcutting hubs, military strongholds, trade ports, magic enclaves‚Äîif you can dream it, you can probably build it.
* **Scout, spy, siege, and steal.** Politics, diplomacy, subterfuge‚Äîit‚Äôs not always about who has the biggest army.
* **Hunt monsters.** Real-time NPCs roam the map and drop rare loot‚Äîperfect for crafting the gear your troops *actually* need.
* **Trade across a living market.** Buy low, sell high, and undercut your rivals with ruthless precision.
* **Join alliances, form coalitions, declare wars** (or peace treaties), and actually shape the world‚Äôs history‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt some theme park MMO, the players *are* the content.
* **Explore an enormous persistent world.** Every tile is unique. Geography matters. Terrain gives real strategic depth, and you can only control what you can hold.

No energy meters. No daily cash grabs. There‚Äôs a store, sure‚Äîbut the game isn‚Äôt built to shake your wallet. *Skill, strategy, and community matter way more than your credit card.*

So let me introduce myself and my so called friend first. We are both MBBS students in the same batch. Let's say at this point of time that our fates collided and we became acquaintances from strangers and then friends and then really good friends to the point wherein I trusted him so much that I could pour my heart out innfeont of him. He had that comforting nature and voice that could make me put forth everything that was troubling me in front of him, and because of his sharp wit (I would say) he would solved everything in a jiffy, at least if he couldn't solve it, he did comfort me for sure in ways that gradually made me fall for him. But this wasn't one sided, I could see his efforts to make me feel special, overnight calls wherein promises of forever were made, he bumping right in front of my hostel at night with ice creams and cold coffee, dates which were not officially dates but there were calls and from him requesting my time to have dinner, to go for a stroll and to be honest I was the first one to start it but it was just twice from my side, rest all dates were planned by him. I fell for him and confessed to him. He accepted my confession, we had our moments of intimacy, then he said I can't offer you a realtionship because I like someone else. At first he did not make it too clear but yes this is what kept on continuing for about a month. Finally, I get a call from his so called friend who actually seems to be his girlfriend. We had quite a verbal tension striking our emotions. I called him and he made it clear from his side that he wanted just friendship, after having all those intimacy. He said that he likes her and cannot lose her at any cost. It's then I realised that all this while he had manipulated me, used me and played with my emotions. It was then I realised that he was actually a Cassanova! But I could not believe it, because I considered him a gentleman and I had invested so much of myself in him that for a moment it felt like a bad dream, but that was the truth, a harsh reality!

3 months, I didn't hear from him. We used to cross ways but I didn't pay heed to it, no matter how much broke I was, no matter the extent of pain I was going through. Then one eventful evening, he called. He said he was sorry, he asked me to meet him. I met him, I heard everything he had to say but to my astonishment, that guy doesn't even realise his mistake. He said sorry but those were just empty words. Apparently his so called friend whom he liked also left him and he is now all alone so he wants my company now! And that too just for fun. I couldn't believe that he could do this but yes then I remember this very famous quote which says that you are let down by the people in whom you lay your trust the most! Now, I just know this one ting that no matter what I would never ever forgive him, even if he is down on his knees and begs for mercy. What a sad ending life had to offer me to the point wherein even the mere sight of him makes me feel so pathetic ",1,1743827168.0,offmychest,1,0.67,False

Okay so this might sound like something straight out of a psychological thriller (or a Netflix documentary) but it genuinely happened and I'm still a little shaken about it. 

Let‚Äôs rewind to July 2024. I was at Phoenix Mall, going to Starbucks, just to enjoy a coffee and work on my laptop. This girl was sitting, I walk up to her and politely ask if someone was sitting opposite her. She said no so I sat down, opened my laptop, and started working. I could sense she was noticing me. No conversation beyond that, but the interaction stuck in my head for some reason.

Fast forward a few weeks‚ÄîI was at another caf√©, totally different area, random Saturday evening. Guess who I see again? Same girl. Same creepy vibe, looking at strangers and plotting. I acted like I didn‚Äôt notice her, but I was weirdly shaken. I mean, Chennai is big. What are the odds? I brushed it off as coincidence.

Cut to Thursday this week, I went to lunch at Dou in Alwarpet and then‚Äîbam. There she is again. Stalking me. 

At this point, I was half crying to myself in disbelief. Three times?! Three different places, three different months, and all completely unplanned. It genuinely felt like the universe was playing some ‚ÄúPlay Misty for Me‚Äù type script on me.

And the worst part? I wanted to call her out this time. Like badly. But I didn‚Äôt. I chickened out. Again. Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering what kind of plotline I just lived through and if it‚Äôs going to get worse from here. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my accidental stalker-melodrama-that-hopefully-isn't. If any of you are reading this and believe in signs or fate or whatever‚Ä¶ tell me I‚Äôm not crazy?

Also if anyone knows a creepy girl who hangs out at caf√©s preying on random solo-lunching guys, tell her the guy saw her. Thrice. And regrets not calling the cops.",0,1743827049.0,Chennai,3,0.25,False

Well that wasn't the only reason why but it just pushed me to order it lol. I've been using a Saeco Intelia since 2016 (which still works by the way) but I love this new machine, it got here yesterday and it is making fantastic drinks using my home roasted coffee. It looks brand new and I checked today to see how many drinks have been made on it and it said 9 which were probably all or almost all done by us, so at most it may have had one or two drinks done on it so basically brand new. So it seems like a really good deal, super happy I bought it, and if anyone is thinking about buying a refurbished I would just go for it. ",1,1743826776.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

-The world is big, vast, beautiful, and ugly. It's worth exploring and seeing how many awesome and weird experiences you can get out of it.

-If you ever considered life isn't worth it or doesn't have meaning, that's when you have the most freedom. You can literally take a risk and start over somewhere new, because why not? You got one life, might as well see where it takes you.

-The other people who always seem to be so successful have been given a different hand of cards, and they are usually only portraying their successes. They're on their journey, you are on yours.

-You will find your relationships to much more fruitful and rewarding when you can truly celebrate someone else's accomplishments without feeling envy or competition. Again, they are on their own journey, you are on yours.

-If you find the idea of asking for help to be cringe, ick, or whatever, please realize that it is like training a muscle-- the first time will be hard, but it will progressively get easier over time. 

-Being too fixated on a specific goal or vision of the future will likely mean you will have blinders preventing you from seeing the great things and people around you in the current moment. Have goals, but appreciate the moments.

-Small moments matter. Revel in swinging on a porch swing, sharing a coffee with someone else, or just seeing the sunrise before the city wakes up. Those moments add up to a life well-lived.

-You are valuable. No ands, ifs, or buts. You are valuable. ",1,1743826625.0,self,0,1.0,False
