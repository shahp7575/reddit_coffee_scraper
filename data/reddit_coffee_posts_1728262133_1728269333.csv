1fxxp4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fxxp4x/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"üìåAlert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn‚Äôt want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn‚Äôt want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn‚Äôt serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn‚Äôt leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? 

HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn‚Äôt work out because he had a ‚Äúsexual hobby‚Äù that didn‚Äôt work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don‚Äôt want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It‚Äôs a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that‚Äôs the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""‚ô•Ô∏è"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she‚Äôs my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it‚Äôs fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' ü§î)""
But my point wasn‚Äôt about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people.

 I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn‚Äôt work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn‚Äôt have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn‚Äôt necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (üìå On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn‚Äôt match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I‚Äôm talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but‚Ä¶) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn‚Äôt talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; he made assumptions that even after I responded, he didn‚Äôt believe, especially if it didn‚Äôt perfectly fit his understanding.

 He didn‚Äôt question me the way I questioned him. But maybe what he did was worse; he jumped to conclusions and acted based on that. He asked if my breast augmentation was done with the intention of working in pornography, for example. I said no, it was to improve my self-esteem, so I would feel good wearing a bikini (the bikini was just an example), but he replied, 'It doesn‚Äôt make sense for someone to get breast implants just to wear a bikini.' Well, in my country, people commonly do this for aesthetic reasons; it‚Äôs quite normal. But according to his world, where he might only know about porn actresses who do this, it makes sense for him to think in those terms.
This wasn‚Äôt serious, but he did something similar by giving up on our relationship without telling me anything after an argument. Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn‚Äôt get any response, even if neutral. It‚Äôs all very confusing.""
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way‚Äînervous, sarcastic‚Äîand turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I‚Äôll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn‚Äôt understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn‚Äôt allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn‚Äôt keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. üìåThere we go: : we don‚Äôt live far from each other, there‚Äôs just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other‚Äôs homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don‚Äôt know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it‚Äôs worthy of a magazine article, lol

1fxxnq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fxxnq1/i_23f_wanna_break_up_with_my_34m_boyfriend_and_i/,I 23F wanna break up with my 34M boyfriend and I don't know how to go about it. ,"Warning: Please don't judge the huge age difference. I consider older guys my type. 

As you've seen from the tittle I wanna break up with my boyfriend. We really aren't a good match at almost anything. 
For some context: We live together, we lived together for 4 years, which wasn't really my choice. 
For some backstory:We met online through Ig I wasn't in the market for a boyfriend, but he was very persistent he wouldn't even get me back home after our date was over and he wanted to prolong it. I'm not the type that likes to go to other people's places cause i feel like im intruding (I'm AuAdhd so my brain is wired dif). After our date and the begging for me to stay with him longer I got home ghosted him for days. Not gonna lie i went to that day with the condition that hed buy me cigarettes, he already knew that he didn't mind. After ghosting him I needed a lift to the bank so I went out for coffee with him and hed take me. After that I felt obligated to hang out with him. He kinda forced me to his home, even though I didn't wanna go but I'm not really the complaining type from the beginning. And you know how things went from there. I didnt really like the aftermath so I faked that I was in pain to get it over with and just wanted to go home. We kept hanging out and it was nice getting to know him. 

Things were chill and interesting for a while before him deliberately not taking me home spiked a huge fight with my mum who kinda threw me out. He knew that would happen I warned him. So I started living with him. 

Due to trauma I can't sleep with other people in the same bed and sometimes in the same room, so I got my own room. 

After living with him I started feeling that Im 35 and he is more like 15. He is so immature. He has that need to be the certain of attention in everything in bed in life even when his mates have issues. For example it might be raining outside and his first reaction would be ""It's not my fault"", his friend broke his leg ""When I broke my leg"", when I was trying to open up about my childhood he'd be like ""I this. I that. My parents were nice. They got me this and that."". It's just I, I, I. 

I cant deal with it. I tried leaving lots of times but I keep coming back. And I'm not shy, like i told him face blank I dont see myself being with you in 10 years time I'd be miserable. We cant even have a conversation together. We dont match at all. We dont have any chemistry. He might think we do I don't know. 

He recently told me sideways that the only reason he keeps me around is cause he is old and cause he games chicks dont like it. He keeps me around cause im also a gamer i also watch soccer and don't bother him. Which is true tbh. 
I don't know if he knows that I don't bother him cause subconsciously I feel that spending time with him would be a waste even if in that time I'd be sitting looking at the wall. 

I don't know if he is like a toxic masochist or something cause we talked about this a lot. And I'm not the type to sugarcoat. I speak my truth and almost always it comes out harsh. 

I'm sure we are not a match. We can't have a conversation thats not about him or his job. We dont do anything together. He takes everything personally. And i find him less intelligent than me which is a huge turn off for me. We dont have chemistry in bed even though he thinks im awesome but thats only cause I'm kinky. And i cant take the constant fighting that only happens cause i dont wanna have sex with him. For some more context we recently moved to another house and now ive been sleeping on the sofa for almost a year. My health is deteriorating and im on edge all the time. I'm very impulsive and whenever i got in this situations in the past i ended up doing stupid things like drugs disappearing etc. 

How do I break up with him and never come back. I know its the right thing to do. But I domt know how. This would be my seventh try probably so I'm asking you guys. ",1,1728268962.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Symptoms haven‚Äôt gone away since. Should I be worried?","Doing my best to keep this as short as possible since there's a dozen stories like this a week in here. 

I have a DVT in my leg from a bad injury but am otherwise a healthy, active and athletic 23-year old male. I've been on Eliquis for over two months now. I've been a competitive runner for 10+ years and in that time my doctors have repeatedly commented on my fantastic lung capacity and heart health. I don't smoke, have maybe 1-4 alcoholic drinks per month if I drink at all, and caffeine gives me migraines so I don't drink coffee or soda. I don't mean any of this as a flex or anything, just context for my concerns with my ER visit.

Yesterday I got hit with sudden shortness of breath and dizziness while working (in a restaurant so I was moving around quite a bit) after feeling a twinge in my leg where the main clot is. Following the orders of EVERY doctor I've seen since they found the clot, I immediately headed to the ER.

The staff in the ER didn't seem to take me seriously at all because of 4 things:
    1. I forgot my Eliquis for the first time that morning so it MUST be anxiety (I fully understand that it stays in your system so I wasn't worried this would be an issue)
    2. My blood oxygen came back at 99% and my heart rate was consistently between 55-65 my whole visit there. My bloodwork showed everything in the optimal ranges
    3. I was told multiple times that I'm ""low risk"" due to my age and general health (the same thing they said when I made them check for a clot the first time)
    4. I have sports-induced asthma and a prescribed inhaler. The issue with this is that I almost NEVER have to use my inhaler even if I'm running 5 minute miles on end. I've only ever had asthma attacks a few times in my life and this feels very different.

Despite originally telling me they wanted to do a CT Scan and prepping me for one, they changed their minds and refused to do it once my bloodwork came back clean. I was quite literally laughed out of the ER after 4 hours of waiting for my blood results and my parents asking why we weren't doing the CT scan anymore.

Well now it's been over 24 hours and the pressure in my chest is still there and my COVID test came back negative. I have no symptoms of a cold otherwise. It's like I can take a full breath but something just *feels* wrong and I'm not getting enough air sometimes. 

My concern is that my lungs might be working well enough that even with the clot in there I'm getting plenty of oxygen. Since the clot was caught early, it's small so maybe the damage isn't that noticeable. They refused any further tests so is it possible for them to have missed it? Has anyone ever had a pulmonary embolism while still having otherwise good oxygenation? Or is it just flat out not possible, the doctors were right? 





Sorry for sounding extra hostile and doubtful, but the nurse taking my blood was incredibly condescending and rude the entire time and the doctor wouldn't even let me speak about my symptoms whereas in past visits everyone was fantastic. Every doctor I've seen has remarked about how uncommon a blood clot is in someone my age with my health and no family history of them. It took a second ultrasound a week after the first to find the clots after I saw bruising traveling up my leg and became convinced I had one. I'm fully willing to accept I'm wrong here, I just need confirmation that there's no way at all it reached my lungs considering my results before I go spend money I don't have on another visit to the doctor.",1,1728268856.0,ClotSurvivors,0,1.0,False

How can I talk to my friend about why I no longer want to be around her husband and that I'm worried how this will impact our friendship?,"I am new to reddit, so please forgive any mistakes. I'm trying to format this in a way that follows the rules. This might be considered a long read, so please take that into consideration now. I am looking for outside opinions and advice about how to constructively talk to my friend about what happened last night. I'd also like to know if people think I'm unreasonable for how I feel about this situation. Maybe some of you can help? 

For some background context, I have known my best friend (who I'll call BF) since we were 11 years old in elementary school. She has been with her now-husband for over 10 years, but they just recently got married this summer (July 2024). My sister and I were bridesmaids in their wedding. We have known BF's husband since the beginning of their relationship, and have never really had an issue with him (as far as I was aware...) before last night. 

Yesterday, I went over to BF's apartment that she shares with her husband. We started the day at the gym together and then went to get coffee (something we do pretty frequently on Saturday mornings since we joined the same gym). After that, we went to BF's apartment to hang out for the rest of the day. We had planned to hang out, cook dinner and dessert, have some wine, and just enjoy each other's company. My sister had planned to come over and join us later that evening. The idea was that, since we were going to be drinking, if my sister and I didn't feel comfortable driving home, we could stay the night in BF and her husband's second/guest bedroom and leave in the morning. This was ALL planned ahead of time. BF had invited me for this hangout a week ago. Her husband knew all of this was happening a week ago. BF had advised me and my sister to bring an overnight bag and that we were welcome to stay the night. 

When BF had originally invited me over, she mentioned her husband was going to be out with his brother on a long drive to a campsite where some of their friends were camping. She said she would like to have me and my sister over for some girl-time while her husband was going to be gone. At first, I was under the impression that her husband was going to be gone overnight, but my BF clarified for me a couple days before yesterday's hangout that he was actually going to be coming home later that night. I'm not entirely sure if that was always the plan and I just misunderstood, or if her husband and his brother (who is also married and has a 1 year old at home) changed their minds about camping overnight. This was not a problem for anyone, or so I thought... It certainly wasn't a problem for me. I fully understand that we're in his home, too, and that he is free to come and go as he pleases. He is also free to not want company over at his home he shares with his wife, and to express that to his wife. He deserves to have a say in what guests come into his home and when. I have always tried, as I do when I'm an invited guest in anyone's home, to be knowledgeable and respectful of people's boundaries and when the welcome is over. 

Me, my BF, and my sister hang out quite frequently and we talk/text almost daily. We're very close and have been for many years. We do also frequently (maybe once a month or every other month) have sleepovers that almost always happen at BF and her husband's apartment. THIS IS MY BF'S PREFERENCE. I have invited her (along with her husband if he's ever interested) to hangout at my place lots of times. I'm not in a relationship and don't have any roommates, so it's pretty much always available as an option, but she always wants to have these hangouts/sleepovers at her place. I make a point of asking EVERY TIME if her husband is ok with me coming over and BF always tells me it's fine and that he knows I'll be there. Since we are always at me BF's place, her husband often hangs out with us. I have always tried to make sure that BF's husband doesn't feel pressured (at least by me) to hang out or not hang out with us when I'm over. I'm genuinely fine either way. Or, I was...

On to the situation:
It's now the evening. My BF, my sister, and I are all having a great time at BF's place. We've just finished eating some of the dinner we made, we've got dessert in the oven, we're all a couple glasses of wine in. At about 8-9 pm, BF's husband comes home. We all say hello, but immediately he starts acting pissed off and a bit aggressive. He's walking around us three sitting at the table in the dining area and through the kitchen asking ""what the f--- is the sh--?"" about everything from the food we made, to the music we're listening to, to the conversation we're having. He's making pointed prolonged wide eye-contact with no other expression on his face to me and my sister. He asks my sister why she's not hanging out with this guy she's been on and off seeing. He stands over us all sitting at the table asking if he's ""in [our] space?"" and if he's interrupting what we're doing. He paces back and forth through the kitchen and declares ""I'm the man, I pay for this house!"" (My BF and her husband split all bills, including rent, equally.)

At first, we all kind of think he's joking around. It's not un-ordinary for BF's husband to make these sort of ""I'm the man!"" jokes and to say things facetiously. But it quickly becomes obvious to me and my sister that this is not his normal joking. He's being way more aggressive than I've ever seen him act before. To me, he is clearly angry and doesn't want me and my sister in his home. I even asked him if he wanted us to leave, and he just stared at me with that weird wide-eyed look. The whole time he's doing this, my BF is asking him what's wrong, and to stop, and telling him he's making us uncomfortable, and telling him my sister and I are uncomfortable because we ""can't tell that [he's] joking,"" and the whole time he's responding ""I don't care"" or ""I'm not sorry."" He did also loudly inform his wife that he hadn't drank any of the water that he'd brought with him, only beer, and that he also hadn't eaten. He then lays on the couch in the living area right next to us and watches TV loudly while my BF, my sister, and I make Halloween-themed cookie houses at the table in silence. The air was really sucked out of the room after that. We had planned to watch an already chosen movie to end the night. We had actually decided to wait for BF's husband to get home, because the movie was a little expensive to rent and my BF wanted to make it ""worth it"" by having more people watching.  

When we finished decorating the houses, my BF asked her husband if we could watch our movie after the episode he was watching was over. He agreed and we waited. Then, when his episode was over, BF asked him if he was feeling better, if he wanted to watch the movie with us, and if he could ""share space with us."" He says ""No,"" then quickly follows with ""fine,"" then says he's going to bed. 

At the point BF's husband came home acting strange and aggressive, I had decided there was no way I was staying the night, so I didn't pour myself anymore wine and began downing my water. After BF's husband went to bed, BF, my sister, and I ended up watching a few episodes of Impractical Jokers instead of the movie we had planned on. After I was sure I was sober, I drove home.

(All ""quotes"" are exact words/phrases I remember being said.)

Advice I'm seeking:
What is the best way for me to talk to my life-long best friend (whom I love, want the best for, and don't want to burden) about how her husband's behavior last night A.) made me so uncomfortable I don't think I want to be in his home ever again, B.) has completely shattered my good opinion of him, and C.) seems like a huge red flag that makes me a little worried for her? Is it unreasonable for me to feel this way? I'm not and have never been worried he would ever hurt her physically, but I am now a little worried that he's decided to dictate who his wife can hang out with and that he doesn't like her hanging out with me and my sister. If his problem is that he just doesn't want me over in his home so much, that would be perfectly fine and reasonable in my opinion. He could have said this at any point and I wouldn't have taken it personally or had any problem with it at all. He's never acted like this in front of me before and I was very shocked, as was my sister.  I've always thought he was a pretty genuinely nice guy up to this point. From my perspective, he was like a different person last night. I'm now also wondering if he acts like this with my BF often when it's just them home alone. 

My BF is clearly disappointed and upset about how all of this went down, but she seems to be excusing his behavior saying he was off with the guys, shooting and doing other ""guy stuff,"" and he came home grumpy and tired so that's why he was so amped-up and aggressive. She apologized to me last night before I left, and I told her she did nothing wrong to apologize for and that I hoped everyone got the rest they needed. I texted her this morning around 10:30am asking how everything was over there. She said her husband had got up around 8am, gave her a kiss, then left their apartment and hadn't come home. She didn't know where he went. They were supposed to go to her parents house at, like, 11:00am and since he hadn't come home or contacted her yet, she was going by herself. 

I really don't know what to say at this point. I feel so bad for my friend and I'm scared that this incident will effect our friendship negatively. I absolutely do not want, nor I have I ever wanted to come in between my BF's relationship. I don't want to make my best friend's life harder. But... what the actual fnck happened here? And how do I constructively talk to me best friend about why I no longer want to come over to her apartment? Or about how I'm a bit worried her husband may have flipped a switch now that they're married and decided he doesn't want her hanging out with her friends so much?

Tldr: 
My sister and I went to my best friend's apartment to hang out and drink wine, her husband came home acting uncharacteristically angry and aggressive, especially towards me and my sister, and now I don't feel comfortable around my best friend's husband. How do I constructively talk to my best friend about me not wanting to be around her husband, especially in his home, and how I think his behavior was a red flag and I'm scared this will negatively impact our friendship?",1,1728267996.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Either Mcdavid buys it or I buy it (not really).

1. The Stew Crew was booked and busy this week and spread so thin that for the first time in forever they couldn‚Äôt release a vlog telling us how exciting and awesome everything was. Carlin had canned content ready to role when Katie went into labor. We saw more of Layla at dance class and a family hug where Carlin turned into stretch Armstrong to film herself crying tears of joy, right there in the dance studio waiting room. Of course Carlin was with Katie as she checked in to labor and delivery. The nurses stopped her from changing into a hospital gown and made her stand beside the bed, although she really wanted to be in it. Evan tagged along to sit in the waiting room bc he certainly couldn‚Äôt be expected to stay home with his children. Kelly Joe praised Carlin for being such an amazing sister to drop everything and stay by Katie‚Äôs side‚Ä¶. Until all of the vlog was filmed and the Duggars hit town. Layla had to give up her room for Joy and Austin Forsyth, and Jessa and Ben Seewald also stayed with the Stewarts. It‚Äôs a shame the only person in that house who works had to give up their bed. Ten kids and 6 adults all packed in for a Duggar wedding that this time, Carlin had no problem talking about. Carlin took the Dugs late night shopping for a birthday basket for Katie. She captured and shared a picture that included Lauren Duggar, which according to DuggarSnark is like photographing Bigfoot. Carlin told Travis to get the tripod set up and push record bc she was dropping by at exactly midnight to wish her sister Happy Birthday. Finally it was time for the Duggar wedding, where Carlin wore clear plastic heels and Evan wore a white TShirt with a blazer. We get to see the Forsyths in the hot tub, all the kids swimming and there seems to be a flirtation between Jeremy Voulo and Evan as they tag each other and send lots of emojis back and forth on IG. Jessa and her passel of kids join The Stewarts at the Knoxville Zoo and then Carlin and Evan head to another wedding. This time it‚Äôs for a boutique employee. In exchange for room and board, Jessa offers up the services of Jana and her new husband Steven, and Carlin happily accepts. She puts them to work doing the one home improvement project we all thought Evan could handle‚Ä¶ installing a light fixture. That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ the dude will not so much as screw in a light bulb.

2. Harvey Clark is here and made his social media debut at less than 24 hours old. Katie and Travis were able to churn out tons of social media and a full part one birth vlog, even though the baby was transferred to the Children‚Äôs Hospital and was struggling to breathe. Proving that they do not believe in germs we see Zach and Whitney, Kelly Joe, Carlin and Evan and Michael and Brandon all holding and kissing the newborn. Ellie was in charge of Hailey and Kelly Joe, Carlin and Whitney were all in the room as Katie labored. Evan sat in the waiting room and went to the airport to retrieve Travis‚Äô parents. At least 46 times one of the women say how exciting this is and Kelly is practically coming out of her skin. The woman is just really into pregnancy and birth. Travis is wearing a huge sweatshirt and meanders around like a giddy high school kid rubbing his hands together. Katie cries and thanks everyone and the labor progresses quickly. Katie has the same delivery doctor as Josie and the same nurse as well. Travis is upset that his necklace push present for Katie has the wrong birthstone.  After 6 days in the hospital Harvey comes home. Katie turns 24 as a mother of 2. Kelly Joe gushes over their movie nights and secret telling and it sounds like they are 7th grade BFFs. Talk about arrested development. Travis says it is the  6th birthday he has spent with her. He decorates the empty apartment and has cake and pizza, but he can‚Äôt top Carlin, and frankly seems too exhausted to even try. 

3. Josie really got back to her fundamentalist roots this week on a work trip to Orlando for Kelton‚Äôs plumbing business. Bobby had to attend, which meant Tori and the kids could come. Erin was close enough to show up for a playdate and a free meal, and Jackson and Emy came by also. Michael was also there‚Ä¶ maybe as the babysitter, bc I never spotted Brandon. Josie seemed natural and happy surrounded by the most conservative family members and Kelton cooked for everyone. Josie didn‚Äôt wear her pool noodle once the entire week and humbled herself enough to make a Goodwill trip with Tori and Erin. After flying home from Florida, Josie tells us she has been craving wings, so Kelton made her some wings‚Ä¶ she shows us the wings and they are, in fact, frozen chicken tenders coated with Frank‚Äôs Red Hot Sauce. Does this chick think that Buffalo Hot Sauce makes chicken a wing?? I am scared of the answer. Josie is home just long enough to shill her usual links, repack their bags, wash off the culty stench and hit the road again. This time the Balka‚Äôs landed in New York to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary. They rented a car and drove straight to Emma Langdon‚Äôs home in Connecticut. We see lots of dreamy snaps of the New England Autumn, including Josie with her eyes closed in bliss‚Ä¶ on a hay ride. Next stop is Vermont for more dizzying excitement. 

4. With SO many Bates sisters in Orlando this week, surely they all saw Alyssa, right? At least some of them saw Alyssa, right? Nope. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Alyssa has met none of her new nephews and many of her siblings have not met Rhett. If she wants to get her numbers and engagement up‚Ä¶ she should start spilling the tea. Instead we get a lukewarm return to IG where she tells us how busy their September was bc of church, karate, and John‚Äôs softball. They did go on the yearly beach trip with the Taliban Dan crowd and she says the girls were beside themselves with excitement. I can‚Äôt imagine why. She shares a late night Costco run where all 5 children and John tagalong and it‚Äôs still light outside. Michael sent the girls cute little handmade aprons and Alyssa pushes links for body oil but not for Michael‚Äôs store. We haven‚Äôt heard a peep about the sad hat since Alyssa last promoted it in mid September, but while she was at the beach she threw it on the sand and filmed it sitting there. That helped her sell exactly zero hats. During the week, Alyssa tries out lots of different influencing tricks‚Ä¶ we see coffee, an unboxing of $68 PJs that got tons of backlash in the comments, cooking that featured some shoe leather beef slices in a pan, one of the girls feeding Rhett an apple and finally she shared a code for the super expensive sheets everyone else has been selling. She mentions that Carlin told her about the sheets. What I really think Carlin told her was to ditch the sad hat and focus on pushing links. This week‚Äôs vlog was the family beach trip except Alyssa can‚Äôt really show John‚Äôs family. Rhett whines and cries the entire time and Alyssa has to work taking everyone‚Äôs pictures. Allie skips into frame at one point and tries to add to the commentary but Alyssa pushes her back and ends up having to apologize for being a tad too aggressive. The beach trip sounds about as much fun as karate or watching school on a dvd player‚Ä¶ or listening to John Webster prattle on about anything.

5. Whitney Bates really thought she was a top level influencer this week when she dropped a brand new reel linking both Huffy electric bikes AND WalMart while also giving marriage advice. Her caption told all about how their recent trip to Hawaii reminded them they needed to spend time alone, just the 2 of them and lazy days of long romantic bike rides.  Is that what most couples with 5 kids and a mortgage do? Anyway, they ate her up in the comments, calling her materialistic, a sellout, and tone deaf to post such a thing while so many nearby were suffering with nothing after the hurricane. She went quiet for a few days and Zach agreed to appear in a reel for Medicorps and help them beg for money. They barely had to twist his arm. He must have been big mad about the comments bc he didn‚Äôt even take to the Bates Kitchen this week to slop around some mayonnaise and boxed cake mix. Whitney did shill her earbuds and shared pictures from the BSB employee‚Äôs wedding and the Duggar I do‚Äôs. We see little Lillie Joe toddling around at the wedding in a velour bubble with knee socks and hopefully a cute baby will calm down all of the negative comments so Momma can get back to hawking her links. 

6.  Trace and Lydia dropped Ryker with her parents and hopped a plane to Hawaii. Ryker should have gotten to go on the trip since he paid for it. This was their 2nd anniversary celebration and we see them on the island in a convertible. They are gone for a week but Trace is able to phone in for the Medicorps fundraising video. Kelly Joe says she is overjoyed they are married and they are her best friends.

7. Erin and Chad happily packed up their six kids and went to squat at the Balka‚Äôs Orlando vacation rental. Tempers flared when Kelton explained to Chad that they only rented the house for a week and the Paine‚Äôs could not move in permanently. Seriously though, Erin was tickled to see her soul sister Tori and posted a pic of all of the children together. The cousins seemed happy. 

8. Lawson Bates is in absolute heaven. He finally got to leave his extended paternity leave and go cosplay rescue hero. He didn‚Äôt have to be in Nathan‚Äôs shadow bc Nate had to sit this one out while waiting on the birth of his new son. Lawson was boots on the ground doing the hard and dangerous job of‚Ä¶ filming, providing commentary, delivering pizza and sticking a microphone in traumatized people‚Äôs faces. The back of his head made it into a picture with Ivanka Trump who showed up as window dressing and for the rest of the week he mentioned ‚ÄúEYE-vanck-UH‚Äù. Lawson interviewed a man who had just been rescued by local firemen. The man mentioned the volunteer firefighters and Lawson interrupted him to say ‚ÄúWE ARE HELPING TOO. WE ARE VOLUNTEERS TOO.‚Äù Kelly shares every Medicorp post she can. They use interesting wording like ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù and ‚Äúassist‚Äù and ‚Äúon sight‚Äù. They film lots of destruction and meetings but they aren‚Äôt heading anything up, and Lawson is not a medic. Or a cop. Or a police officer. No matter how much he pretends. He is a volunteer(fan). We do see him riding on the helicopter as someone rescues a 94 year old lady. Anyway, back at home, Tiffy is beside herself with happiness getting to hold and cuddle her baby as much as she wants and however she wants. 

9. Michael posts with Baby Harvey and Brandon and then takes JebJud with her to Florida to spend time with the sisters and his cousins. I think Kelly and Gil have turned him completely over to her at this point. She attends the Duggar wedding possibly without Brandon. His new job must be taking up lots of time. He didn‚Äôt even have time to film himself coloring this week.

10. Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ Alyssa reported that Janie and Bill‚Äôs farm was still without power midweek‚Ä¶ Josie and Grace worked a wedding together‚Ä¶Kelly Joe and Gil appeared in the Medicorp fundraising video‚Ä¶ Kelly is now tucking her shirts into her denim skirt.

Have a great week friends! As a Carolina girl, I ask you to keep the Carolinas in your heart and help if you can. It‚Äôs a long road to recovery.

In exchange for room and board, Jessa offers up the services of Jana and her new husband Steven, and Carlin happily accepts. She puts them to work doing the one home improvement project we all thought Evan could handle‚Ä¶ installing a light fixture. That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ the dude will not so much as screw in a light bulb.

2. Harvey Clark is here and made his social media debut at less than 24 hours old. Katie and Travis were able to churn out tons of social media and a full part one birth vlog, even though the baby was transferred to the Children‚Äôs Hospital and was struggling to breathe. Proving that they do not believe in germs we see Zach and Whitney, Kelly Joe, Carlin and Evan and Michael and Brandon all holding and kissing the newborn. Ellie was in charge of Hailey and Kelly Joe, Carlin and Whitney were all in the room as Katie labored. Evan sat in the waiting room and went to the airport to retrieve Travis‚Äô parents. At least 46 times one of the women say how exciting this is and Kelly is practically coming out of her skin. The woman is just really into pregnancy and birth. Travis is wearing a huge sweatshirt and meanders around like a giddy high school kid rubbing his hands together. Katie cries and thanks everyone and the labor progresses quickly. Katie has the same delivery doctor as Josie and the same nurse as well. Travis is upset that his necklace push present for Katie has the wrong birthstone.  After 6 days in the hospital Harvey comes home. Katie turns 24 as a mother of 2. Kelly Joe gushes over their movie nights and secret telling and it sounds like they are 7th grade BFFs. Talk about arrested development. Travis says it is the  6th birthday he has spent with her. He decorates the empty apartment and has cake and pizza, but he can‚Äôt top Carlin, and frankly seems too exhausted to even try. 

3. Josie really got back to her fundamentalist roots this week on a work trip to Orlando for Kelton‚Äôs plumbing business. Bobby had to attend, which meant Tori and the kids could come. Erin was close enough to show up for a playdate and a free meal, and Jackson and Emy came by also. Michael was also there‚Ä¶ maybe as the babysitter, bc I never spotted Brandon. Josie seemed natural and happy surrounded by the most conservative family members and Kelton cooked for everyone. Josie didn‚Äôt wear her pool noodle once the entire week and humbled herself enough to make a Goodwill trip with Tori and Erin. After flying home from Florida, Josie tells us she has been craving wings, so Kelton made her some wings‚Ä¶ she shows us the wings and they are, in fact, frozen chicken tenders coated with Frank‚Äôs Red Hot Sauce. Does this chick think that Buffalo Hot Sauce makes chicken a wing?? I am scared of the answer. Josie is home just long enough to shill her usual links, repack their bags, wash off the culty stench and hit the road again. This time the Balka‚Äôs landed in New York to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary. They rented a car and drove straight to Emma Langdon‚Äôs home in Connecticut. We see lots of dreamy snaps of the New England Autumn, including Josie with her eyes closed in bliss‚Ä¶ on a hay ride. Next stop is Vermont for more dizzying excitement. 

4. With SO many Bates sisters in Orlando this week, surely they all saw Alyssa, right? At least some of them saw Alyssa, right? Nope. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Alyssa has met none of her new nephews and many of her siblings have not met Rhett. If she wants to get her numbers and engagement up‚Ä¶ she should start spilling the tea. Instead we get a lukewarm return to IG where she tells us how busy their September was bc of church, karate, and John‚Äôs softball. They did go on the yearly beach trip with the Taliban Dan crowd and she says the girls were beside themselves with excitement. I can‚Äôt imagine why. She shares a late night Costco run where all 5 children and John tagalong and it‚Äôs still light outside. Michael sent the girls cute little handmade aprons and Alyssa pushes links for body oil but not for Michael‚Äôs store. We haven‚Äôt heard a peep about the sad hat since Alyssa last promoted it in mid September, but while she was at the beach she threw it on the sand and filmed it sitting there. That helped her sell exactly zero hats. During the week, Alyssa tries out lots of different influencing tricks‚Ä¶ we see coffee, an unboxing of $68 PJs that got tons of backlash in the comments, cooking that featured some shoe leather beef slices in a pan, one of the girls feeding Rhett an apple and finally she shared a code for the super expensive sheets everyone else has been selling. She mentions that Carlin told her about the sheets. What I really think Carlin told her was to ditch the sad hat and focus on pushing links. This week‚Äôs vlog was the family beach trip except Alyssa can‚Äôt really show John‚Äôs family. Rhett whines and cries the entire time and Alyssa has to work taking everyone‚Äôs pictures. Allie skips into frame at one point and tries to add to the commentary but Alyssa pushes her back and ends up having to apologize for being a tad too aggressive. The beach trip sounds about as much fun as karate or watching school on a dvd player‚Ä¶ or listening to John Webster prattle on about anything.

5. Whitney Bates really thought she was a top level influencer this week when she dropped a brand new reel linking both Huffy electric bikes AND WalMart while also giving marriage advice. Her caption told all about how their recent trip to Hawaii reminded them they needed to spend time alone, just the 2 of them and lazy days of long romantic bike rides.  Is that what most couples with 5 kids and a mortgage do? Anyway, they ate her up in the comments, calling her materialistic, a sellout, and tone deaf to post such a thing while so many nearby were suffering with nothing after the hurricane. She went quiet for a few days and Zach agreed to appear in a reel for Medicorps and help them beg for money. They barely had to twist his arm. He must have been big mad about the comments bc he didn‚Äôt even take to the Bates Kitchen this week to slop around some mayonnaise and boxed cake mix. Whitney did shill her earbuds and shared pictures from the BSB employee‚Äôs wedding and the Duggar I do‚Äôs. We see little Lillie Joe toddling around at the wedding in a velour bubble with knee socks and hopefully a cute baby will calm down all of the negative comments so Momma can get back to hawking her links. 

6.  Trace and Lydia dropped Ryker with her parents and hopped a plane to Hawaii. Ryker should have gotten to go on the trip since he paid for it. This was their 2nd anniversary celebration and we see them on the island in a convertible. They are gone for a week but Trace is able to phone in for the Medicorps fundraising video. Kelly Joe says she is overjoyed they are married and they are her best friends.

7. Erin and Chad happily packed up their six kids and went to squat at the Balka‚Äôs Orlando vacation rental. Tempers flared when Kelton explained to Chad that they only rented the house for a week and the Paine‚Äôs could not move in permanently. Seriously though, Erin was tickled to see her soul sister Tori and posted a pic of all of the children together. The cousins seemed happy. 

8. Lawson Bates is in absolute heaven. He finally got to leave his extended paternity leave and go cosplay rescue hero. He didn‚Äôt have to be in Nathan‚Äôs shadow bc Nate had to sit this one out while waiting on the birth of his new son. Lawson was boots on the ground doing the hard and dangerous job of‚Ä¶ filming, providing commentary, delivering pizza and sticking a microphone in traumatized people‚Äôs faces. The back of his head made it into a picture with Ivanka Trump who showed up as window dressing and for the rest of the week he mentioned ‚ÄúEYE-vanck-UH‚Äù. Lawson interviewed a man who had just been rescued by local firemen. The man mentioned the volunteer firefighters and Lawson interrupted him to say ‚ÄúWE ARE HELPING TOO. WE ARE VOLUNTEERS TOO.‚Äù Kelly shares every Medicorp post she can. They use interesting wording like ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù and ‚Äúassist‚Äù and ‚Äúon sight‚Äù. They film lots of destruction and meetings but they aren‚Äôt heading anything up, and Lawson is not a medic. Or a cop. Or a police officer. No matter how much he pretends. He is a volunteer(fan). We do see him riding on the helicopter as someone rescues a 94 year old lady. Anyway, back at home, Tiffy is beside herself with happiness getting to hold and cuddle her baby as much as she wants and however she wants. 

9. Michael posts with Baby Harvey and Brandon and then takes JebJud with her to Florida to spend time with the sisters and his cousins. I think Kelly and Gil have turned him completely over to her at this point. She attends the Duggar wedding possibly without Brandon. His new job must be taking up lots of time. He didn‚Äôt even have time to film himself coloring this week.

10. Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ Alyssa reported that Janie and Bill‚Äôs farm was still without power midweek‚Ä¶ Josie and Grace worked a wedding together‚Ä¶Kelly Joe and Gil appeared in the Medicorp fundraising video‚Ä¶ Kelly is now tucking her shirts into her denim skirt.

Have a great week friends! As a Carolina girl, I ask you to keep the Carolinas in your heart and help if you can. It‚Äôs a long road to recovery.

I would not say that I have a stutter as in stuttering my words. 
My problem is that I literally go to say the word and I can‚Äôt even get the first letter out my mouth to say it, but then I can replace it with other words after thinking of them and stumbling around words for about 5 seconds. (Which feel like the longest 5 seconds of my life every time) 

It comes and goes and I think it has to do with anxiety and stimulants and also alcohol. 

This probably started around 4 years ago for me, I am now 34 year old. 

I started drinking coffee when I was 28 and had no problems at all for the first two years. 

From 30 it was only coffee or very high stimulants like cocaine (only being honest) that would do this. 
I could cope with this because I could either decrease my coffee intake or just keep away from drugs which was fine for me. 

I still drink coffee (no more than two shots a day) But recently it has also been as little as having 1 pint of beer or 1 glass of wine that has set me off not being able to talk and as far as I know alcohol is not a stimulant. 

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on and feel like my speech is deteriorating by the week. 

Let me know if any one has any similar experiences please.

I messaged her week later to grab dinner but no response. Why would ex suddenly ghost me?,"Randomly ran into my ex almost one year after no contact and breaking up. The breakup was nothing bad, we just didn‚Äôt communicate well and it lead to misunderstandings. Well, she didn‚Äôt communicate her issues and made a decision to break up after a really healthy relationship. Anyways, I Kept it short and sweet for about a minute and I went on my merry way. About three weeks later my friend encouraged me to reach out and just to meet up since we‚Äôre both in our early 40s and we‚Äôre adults and there is nothing to lose. So I did and few days later she responded with yes so we met up for coffee for a few hours . It went fine, we just caught up. Afterwards, I gave her a gift of something I was holding onto before we broke up. I did tell her that I certainly missed her right after we broke up and it wasn‚Äôt easy, but I‚Äôm happy to see that she‚Äôs happy and that I would love to see her again. She didn‚Äôt really respond right away to that but she did linger and smiled and she said that maybe we‚Äôll see each other again.

About three days later, I texted her saying it was great to see her and it brought back great memories and I‚Äôd love to do dinner with her. Again, we are adults and I have nothing to lose. I haven‚Äôt heard from her for five days since I sent that text‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs sad that two ppl who cared for each other, that one of them is probably going to just ghost me instead of just saying no. This has caused me to be so annoyed all week and frustrated all over.

I have basically 0 social experience. Homeschooled growing up (please don't do this to your kids), depressed and anxious as hell my entire life, and really really bad at talking to people. I have two friends from years ago that I sometimes game with, but we're not ""close"", and that's it. Family is also out of the question.

I've just coped (poorly) up until now, but it's *really* eating at me, and I *really* need to do something about it. I'm desperate for friends and a social circle, but I realize I'm probably not ready for it right now. Every time I go out anywhere, I actively feel really uncomfortable, and like I really don't belong anywhere other than holed up in my apartment, and like everyone around me knows it too and wants me to leave, and it just gets to be too much. The more ""open"" the area (and therefore, the more people who can see me), the worse I feel. If anyone tries to talk to me I dissociate hard and try to exit the conversation asap (even though I really don't want to, but again, it just becomes too much.)

I'm thinking I just need to force myself to be outside. I've tried joining some groups/events locally to meet people, but I just can't make myself do it, I'm too afraid. I think if there were someplace I could just sit for an hour or two and do my own thing (read, work on laptop, play a handheld game, etc), that's something I *could* do, to start (would be more comfortable for me than having to do a group activity there, for now.)

I'm not sure where that'd be, though. Back in college it could've been any of the common areas, but I don't have that now. Coffee shops maybe, but ngl I don't like coffee lol (and I'd feel a little weird just going there for this?) I'm sure there's other places but I'm not that creative, hence why I'm asking here.

I started thinking about figuring out a way to carry or wear my Nano like a watch on my wrist. My wrists and hands aren't huge or anything, but I feel like I have seen all kinds of large watches out in the wild, and the Nano (to me) feels just small enough to do it. I haven't seen anyone who has done this yet, but that could just be my poor searching skills or there may be a good reason not to that I haven't thought of.

  
So, unless anyone is aware of something like this and can tell me more about it, I may try to come up with something myself and see what I come up with. I feel like I could use some existing things (watchband, thin nano case/shell-thingy) and just connect them together securely, but I have never attempted anything like this before and may quickly learn I am in over my head or am out of my mind. If I do try it myself, I'll post back and share in case anyone likes this crazy idea.

  
But again, if you have ever seen anything like this, please let me know. I just love the idea of wearing it so it is always with me (I know there are other ways to do that), I think it could make for some fun conversations with people, and could be another fun way to customize the nano and show it off.

On our first date, we had coffee at my uni library, held hands, and I put my arm around her. She seemed a bit awkward with this but didn‚Äôt object (asked her about hand holding and she agreed), so I thought she was just nervous. She seemed cheerful afterward and gladly agreed to dinner for our second date.

On the second date, a few days ago, we had dinner and then walked back to my place to eat while watching a movie sitting on my bed. I decided to put my arm around her after we finished eating, but she pulled away and asked, ‚ÄúCan we please not do this?‚Äù I immediately pulled my arm back and apologized and was taken aback since she hadn‚Äôt objected on the first date. The rest of the movie felt awkward, even though she still talked to me later in the night as if nothing had happened.

I walked her home after the movie, and we side hugged before parting ways (which she's totally comfortable with). It's interesting because we cheek kissed on the first date (la bise), and we side hugged when we met for the second date, but there was no kiss.

I‚Äôm surprised by this regression in intimacy since this hasn‚Äôt happened to me before. It makes me wonder if she‚Äôs not interested in me anymore or if she just wants to take things slower. I usually like moving a bit fast, but I‚Äôm totally cool with a girl who prefers to take things slow, so this experience really threw me off.

Should I bring this up with her? I want to make sure I‚Äôm respecting her boundaries, but I‚Äôd also like to clarify how she feels and why. I really hate making anyone uncomfortable, and this whole situation has left me feeling pretty bad about myself. Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.

(We do have an espresso machine but use it sparingly as it uses much more milk than instant.)

We are almost out and I‚Äôm hoping someone has a tip to find this at a reasonable price. 

TIA

My partner and I (both late 20s) visited Rosewood Kona Village and FS Lanai last week. We did 4 nights on the Big Island and 3 in Lanai. Thanks u/alex_travels for helping us plan such a special trip!

The Rosewood property was stunning - everything was beautifully and thoughtfully designed. We stayed in a tree top hale per Alex‚Äôs recommendation and loved it. The property is huge - they‚Äôre centrally located, private, and a great view. The outdoor shower and large patio were killer. I enjoyed my coffee outside listening to the birds every morning.

I know folks have had issues with service, but honestly we had none. We found everyone to be personable, attentive, and accommodating. Food/drink service except the first night at Shipwreck was fast. The property seemed pretty quiet so maybe that had to do with it.

Highlights: on property, we loved sitting by the pool and snorkeling in the ocean steps from the resort. The gym facilities are also great, including an outdoor area that looks out over a lava rock field. We did an excellent group yoga practice in the mornings. We also went out for a manta ray snorkel which was super cool.

I rented a car thinking that we would make it to the national park / do more exploring around the island. We had a long flight though and didn‚Äôt feel like sitting in the car so decided to save it for next time.

Food: this was our only complaint at Rosewood. It was really hit or miss, and lacking enough healthy options for us. Everything was also $$$$, which I wouldn‚Äôt have minded as much if it was dialed in.

We were sad to leave Rosewood but Lanai was also really special. We took the included charter flight which was a fun experience. The island itself is small and relatively undeveloped, very quaint. 

Room: Alex got us an upgrade to a partial ocean view room, which had a great view. The design is more traditional (I prefer the Rosewood KV aesthetic) but still beautiful. The patio was significantly smaller and didn‚Äôt have anywhere to lounge.

We were so impressed by the gardens and enjoyed feeding the Koi. Then we took the hourly shuttle over to Sensei to explore and have lunch. WOW those grounds are on another level. 

The pool at Lanai was not our favorite. The little lagoons felt like you were in a water park and no view of the ocean (though plenty of chairs on the periphery do). The beach was also not as appealing as KV. 

Activities: We enjoyed the observatory on our first night. I found the sunset sail to be a bit anticlimactic though honestly I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. The boat was beautiful but they weren‚Äôt actually able to put the sails up, which was disappointing. They schedule it so the sunset is at the tail end, so you‚Äôre on the water for an hour then you just turn around and go home + catch the sunset in the last couple minutes.

FS Lanai really shined in its F&B ‚Äî everything we ate was delicious (breakfast especially, I am still thinking about the Ahi Benedict on our last morning) and incredible service. We were surprised to prefer Mozza to Nobu ‚Äî we love sushi, and it was good but not the standout we were expecting.

Overall we‚Äôd probably go back to Kona Village, it‚Äôs a really unique property, but are glad to have visited Lanai, the service, gardens, and food were outstanding!",6,1728266508.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

1fxwtz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1fxwtz7/need_advicesfeedback/,Need Advices/Feedback,"Hello Everyone, i am a 26 Yo male non-Filipino and not Western and i dated a 25 yo cute Filipina, at first we were friends, both of us are international students in college, i used to find her with my other Filipina friend when they switched us the previous semester.

we slowly became friends, and then we got closer and closer until a bond was forged before we entered the relationship we set standards and we talked about lots of future subjects, like values, religion, and finances, and we agreed on them, what got me attracted to her was her personality and her intelligence and physically she was tiny and adorable.

she used to tell me i date to marry, she used to be in a 6 years relationship that ended before she came to a new country and my last relationship was in 2018 , we agreed that this is not a rebound relationship or wasting our time, we are here for the future since we are both building our life and we have shared goal.

we spent 8 months together, and lots of very good memories, I know how happy and comfy i made her feel, and the same for her to me, yeah we have disagreements here and there like any other couple out there and we know we are not perfect and we acknowledged that this relationship we will be challenging because we are not from the same culture however as long as we are together we can find solutions.

She lives here with her aunt , and this aunt at first wasn't accepting of me , (the aunt never saw me or even talked me , she just judged me based on my religion and ethnicity) she used to tell her go marry a canadian citizen (all the info i have of her aunt is from my gf)  however, my gf used to tell me that she spends lots of time and effort to paint me in a good image to her aunt.

and she used to tell me that her aunt gave her so much stress and hard time, especially taking care of her aunt's kids, that can be hard to manage as an international student in a foreign country.

days and months passed by , we had our highs and lows as any normal relationship but we always bounce back and our love never diminished.

even when i returned back home and we switched to LDR for 2 months our love stayed strong even though we had a small quarrels at that time but we always pushed through.

on September 24th 2024, on my other friend's birthday , we were in college going together to get those plastic forks and spoons , we passed by 2 other Filipinos that we don't like and they don't like us (especially me), one of them is a female that used to spread bad rumors about me to my gf aunt( all the infor i have about these 2 people are from my gf, especially the girl she doesn't like my gf they are roommates in my gf's aunt house) and since my gf is scared of her aunt that made things complicated, so when i saw my gf waving hi at them, as a reflex i slightly pushed her on the back as a le'ts go hurry, I intended no harm whatsoever. she trumbled a bit and said to me ""why did you push me infront of them?"" i said don't worry about it let's go our friend is waiting.

we took pictures with our friend and when we are going home together she started talking about how that slight push because it was infront them , they will go report it to her aunt and all her efforts of building my image will go to vain and she started crying because she thought i don't understand and it escalated i try to de-escalate by telling her they won't report it , it was a slight push and she was more enraged , we reached home we argued for abit and then i left her to go cooldown a bit and then comeback (bear in mind that i was dealing with some other personal stuff from other sides aswell) when i came back after few minutes i found her packing her clothes and stuff and i told her , are you going to keep doing this whenever we had arguments ? then she booked an uber and i was so tired and drained, i wished her a happy life in the heat of the moments when we were fighting, then she left in the uber, then couple of hours later i sent her a text message on messenger apologizing and such , she said she forgives me and that she wants peace now and then she removed the chat colors and removed the nicknames, and i asked why she said because she is serious, i left here be for couple of hours then i texted her if there is any possibility for her to come back and talk ? she spoke in slogans and said No that boat has sailed..

and since that i tried to reconcile and talk to her more and no text worked she was talking about how she tried and how i deserve someone better and that i am not happy with her and such and that she can only offer friendship and dramatic talks that is not true, then i met her after the incident face to face to further try and reconcile with her and tell her we passed by bumps before this is a small bump in our future and we are here for the long run and she started crying again and her aunt again was brought up and this time magically her aunt became nice and caring..we spoke for 3 hours i was trying to reconcile and we didn't reach anywhere she says she forgives me but she can't forget, as if i did this unforgivable catastrophic sin.. before she left for work she said if you want to be friends let me know your decision..

after that, i tried again and again to reconcile and Monday morning she said , she will considerate but i needed to give her time , so i let her be and on that night of that monday she texted me on how we cannot make it and we are not compatible and she brought up stuff that we already discussed and agreed on since we met as if she doesn't know me for 8 months and lots of dramatic texts not logical at all. so and this is my bad i panicked and i started begging and pleading and calling her and i lost control of my emotions , she picked up and my crying voice i tried reconciling again telling her we have been through bad and sour and good together , as long as we are together we can tackle everything , she brought up her aunt again and how difficult the relationship and she was saying stuff that doesn't make any sense, i tried to reason with her and use logical approach to paint the bigger picture and finally she agreed on trying again and she told me now i need to do damage control because she thinks my image is tarnished for her aunt (which i don't understand if this is a philipino thing where aunts are hold in higher regards or what, she is not even her mom, i always tell her i only care about your mom and siblings) , she cares about my image and other people opinions and her aunt sayings.

then she sent me a text about this is your second chance and whatnot don't fk up or i won't offer friendship and i will block and forget. (as if it is easy to forget all those good memories and how happy she was with me) i told her don't sacrifice me and our relationship for other people's opinions we are building ourselves here step by step.

a couple of days after that she returned to not agreeing and on Thursday i tried offering her her favorite coffee on our lunch break, french vanilla with quarter-coffee as usual one for me and for her, she texted something weird like as a concerned friend yes but as a bf no, like wtf does that mean ?? , you just said couple of days ago you are okay with us together and she even called me babe and she said something like , if your brought me a gift or food this will end sooner (the drama i suppose) , i was acting on her words, and before that night i was crafting a surprise gift for her a bracelet with her faviorite color that says ""Always believe my special and the word Mahal"" , on Thursday October 3rd 2024 , in the lunch break it was akward moments she kept hitting my legs under the table gentley i didn't know what she wanted or mean and before that i told her you want to go get coffee i will buy , she said no with face, then i asked if we can go talk outside, she was walking slowly behind me and then the shocker she stood like 4 to 5 meters across of me , i told her why are you far way get close so we can hear eachother, the moment i started approaching her she started going backwards, as if i am a monster or godzilla , i didn't know what she did that..the conversation started okay and good , she was still not making any sense and saying drama things and how what i did shocked her and made her terrified and how her neck twisted and etc , which btw not true because no neck was twisted and she was perfectly fine , proof is we took pictures after that , her only concern was not the slight push but because infront of ""them"" and she herself said if as a friend you pushed me , i will push you back. so the push is not the cause issue.

then she started with non-chalant and i was nervious and reasoning and she was on another personality as if the girl i knew for 8 months is not there and it is another personality filled with stuff that doesn't make sense, then she started accusing me of having a temper and said in hindsight i knew , as if she tool time to really think of everything from a logical pov not emotional dramatic one.

then i got angry and she got angry and she started personal attacks, we said bad stuff to each other and the convo went to shit and after she blocked me on Messenger, unfollowed me on insta but left my number unblocked.

I just want to know if all of this is justified, am i a a monster ? , what about the overall good relationship we had for 8 months, what about what i made her feel the good? will she come back and realize that she was not thinking straight?

I want Filipino advice for guys and girls because i ran scenarios in my head and not one of them gave a valid logical reason for her to break up like this nor all of this to happen.

Thank you for reading all of that, it is very hard on me because i remember all the good times and i will add that she is not an evil vile person, in the contrary she is one of the sweetest person i have ever been with, it is not fair to let this relationship go to waste because of hormones or unlogical reasons.

Sorry for the bad structured English as i typed fast and it is was not easy for me emotionally to recall the events Thank you all.",1,1728266349.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1fxwncg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1fxwncg/bibas_family/,Bibas family,"I was at a food truck in Austin, TX today enjoying the early morning breeze and a fancy coffee and breakfast taco and chatting with friends when I saw a family walk up to place their food order. They had two small red headed boys, probably a 3 and 5 year old, the pregnant mother had a brown pony tail, the dad had a dark beard. 
To clarify - I‚Äôm not delusional - I know the Bibas family is NOT in Austin Texas.

BUT, I FELT crazy, looking at them so happy and healthy. The Bibas family in an alternate universe. I momentarily disassociated and panicked, wanting to tell my non-Jewish friends at the table but also knowing one of them would have no idea what I was talking about and the other one is probably exhausted from the past year of my horror-processing to him about Israel and the state of Jews in the world. 

Thank you, Jewish subreddit for being here for me and you and everyone for going through what feels like never ending shock and terror and grief. 

A reminder to everyone who thinks they‚Äôre handling this gracefully but still have inner freak out moments in public - you‚Äôre not alone.

1fxwmy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fxwmy0/i_got_a_rocket_appartamento_tca_and_i_dont_regret/,I got a Rocket Appartamento TCA (and I don't regret it!),"I know there's a lot of hate for the Rocket Appartamento (even the new TCA seems to attract the same amount of hate as the original version) and going in I was very apprehensive about my decision to purchase one as a result of all the negative comments every time this machine is mentioned. 

I'm in the UK and I'm not sure if this deal is available anywhere else, but through Fuel Club we can buy an Appartamento TCA through a rental model. I signed up to this a few weeks ago (I have my reasons) and have had my machine for a few weeks now.

I've been happy with a Sage Dual Temp Pro for the last few years and it's served me well in that time, but I've had the itch for a while to upgrade to a big boy machine. When I found out about the rental model for the Appartamento I thought, why not? I can rent it for 3 months and if it's as bad as people say then I can just return it and get a dual boiler machine. Plus if it breaks in the time I'm making payments, apparently they'll send an engineer out to my house to fix my machine, I guess it's like the old days when TV rental was a thing.

After almost a month I've decided I'm definitely keeping the Rocket! Compared to my Sage it's just better in every way, not only are shots more consistent, they taste way better. Workflow is much quicker (apart from the initial heat up time obviously). I can easily make back to back shots for me and several guests with no issues. It used to take forever with my Sage.

Would I recommend it if you are looking to upgrade from Sage/Breville? Yes! definitely, I am really surprised just how much nicer coffee is with this machine.

If you had ¬£1600 ready to drop on a machine would I recommend it? I'd say rent the Rocket and earn the interest on the spare cash. If the rental offer wasn't available I'd be more likely to look at something like a Sage Dual Boiler or Silvia Pro X.",1,1728265730.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1fxwmov,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1fxwmov/feeling_drunk_on_adderall/,"feeling ""drunk"" on adderall?","hello!

so i was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago and have tried vyvanse, concerta and now im trying adderall. on vyvanse, i felt intense euphoria then a crash. concerta i felt absolutely nothing, but increased anxiety and beating heart.

  
i wanted to try adderall (15mg extended release) before giving up. yesterday i took it and i am not sure how to feel. i took it with coffee (probably shouldn't have) and this is how i felt:

-> i did not think it helped my productivity but then i realized i was working on something for hours 

-> i felt confident / happy

-> a bit dissociated

but the one thing i am worried about is that i kinda felt ""drunk"" and i didnt really help me focus on things. it felt like my brain was foggy and my eyes were harder to focus on words. i am second guessing myself that i fit the criteria for ADHD, as these effects kinda scared me. how many days would you keep taking it? i am scared that if i don't have ADHD and that i'm taking it i could get addicted.

1fxwl7i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxwl7i,Worried about tongue,"Sorry for the photo quality. I have recently been getting acid reflux so I'm not sure if this has to do with it, but the main thing is these small orange dots that come off if I use minimal force near the back of my tongue. When I use a tongue scraper, these orange dots sit upright pretty tall, and they break apart when they come off, although its a bit difficult to remove them.

I've been using a tongue scraper for the past year, and I'm worried that I used it too hard which may have worsened the white tongue problem? These photos were taken after tongue scraping within the past few days so I'm not sure why that's not as effective anymore. Is there anything I can do about this?

So all of this started around an year ago, I wasn‚Äôt in touch with him for around 1 month because of some stuff going on in my personal life. One random night he just called me up and asked me to come to a pizza shop, when I went there he asked me to pay for his pizza, I did that and we came back to my place and he was behaving very weirdly,  he kept on insulting me and people in our friend group. His behaviour was very narcissistic, he kept on boasting about himself and kept on putting others down. He also kept on repeating some sentences again and again, like ‚ÄúI guess we will find out in the next episode‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is the game of life‚Äù etc. all of this seemed to be very weird to me, when I talked to my other friend about it he told me that something is wrong with him from past few weeks, the other friend told me that he ‚Äúverbally harassed‚Äù someone in our university‚Äôs pub recently and tried to follow some girls to their home and then get inside,  tried to ‚Äúspike‚Äù someone‚Äôs coffee at the library all in all he was doing things none of us could have imagined him to do, we could clearly see he is not mentally well. He always looked as if he is very high but he wasn‚Äôt. We tried to call up his brother who happens to live in another city he came to town to stay with him for a while and apparently he was doing well for the time being his brother was around but when his brother left it all started again. I cut connections with him because his behaviour just kept on getting worse and worse. Anyway, after a few months he started showing some improvement and almost became the way he was before all of this, I was really happy for him and we started talking again, he apologized for everything and I was just happy for him.

I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes (I do vape- for the last few years). I don‚Äôt smoke weed. I don‚Äôt take any other medications besides supplements.  

About 12 years ago, I thought I was having a heart attack. Went to the ER, they did an MRI or CT? I don‚Äôt remember, just know they put dye through an IV, I was in so much pain that memory is blurry. They found stones. But didn‚Äôt act like it was a big deal. My doctor at the time didn‚Äôt act like it was a big deal either. I watch what I eat, mainly can‚Äôt have milk anymore and when I stopped drinking alcohol about 5 years ago, I stopped having attacks. Before they stopped, I had 2 (including the first one) that sent me to the ER. And a couple at home. 

I‚Äôm tired all the time. My vitamins are low. I supplement vitamin d (prescription) and iron (otc). My new doctor says to have it taken out. She‚Äôs had hers out. 

Besides feeling tired, my other issues are: rapid heartbeat sometimes (I have a cup of cold coffee a day, I add collagen and mushrooms- that‚Äôs it), ‚Äúhot flash‚Äù type face flushing- mainly at night, lower right back discomfort (especially when I move or stretch), constipated diarrhea (it takes a while to get it going but it‚Äôs never solid), and I feel it under my ribcage (like a ball/balloon).

I can‚Äôt post a pic of my last US but it says: ‚ÄúLiver: No focal hepatic mass.
Gallbladder: Cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. Technologist

Billary ducts: Borderline dilatation of the Incompletely visualized common bile duct measuring 7 mm in diameter. On the previous exam, the common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter.
Pancreas: No focal sonographic abnormality in the visualized pancreas.
Right kidney: Normal morphology of the visualized right kidney, which is partially obscured by bowel gas. No hydronephrosis‚Äù

My newest dr ordered it to make sure before referring me for surgery. I actually got a surgery date and freaked out and cancelled. I‚Äôve had problems with anxiety off and on since I was a teenager.

So I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as I can by reading on the internet. A lot of things are hard to google, though. These may sound silly to some of you but it makes me a nervous wreck so I‚Äôm just asking things that I‚Äôve been wondering about.

Do they cut through muscle with lap chole?

Is it routine they numb the abdomen? I‚Äôm very afraid of waking up with extreme pain that will seem to me to be ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù. 

Is there anything a patient can do before surgery to make the recovery go smoother? I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on everyone around me. 

Are these issues even caused by ballgladder? When I ask questions, I get shoulder shrugged.

This is an unusual trip for me, as I usually prefer longer stays in more affordable locations where I can do hiking and other outdoors activities.

So far my itinerary is as follows:

**Day 1**

Arrive at LGA in morning

Lock backpack at hostel (Chelsea International Hostel)

Grand Central Terminal & Lunch at Frankie's Dogs On the Go

Go up to Top of the Rock

Walk through Central Park - **Can I just see it en route from A to B or are there specific things I should see/take time at?**

American Museum of Natural History

Dinner at Los Tacos No. 1

Gotham Comedy Club - **Just stumbled across this, so if there is a better comedy club or way to spend my evening, let me know**

**Day 2**

Breakfast at Smith Street Bagels

Tattoo (in Brooklyn, relatively small piece so shouldn't take more than a few hours)

Lunch at Defonte‚Äôs

DUMBO - **Is there anything particular to do here?**

Brooklyn Bridge

Mural Project

Dinner at Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods

Broadway show (I'm quite flexible about what show/what venue)

See Times Square at Midnight - **Is this a safe idea for a young solo traveler?**

**Day 3**

Breakfast at Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company

9/11 Memorial Museum

Staten Island Ferry

Lunch at Scarr‚Äôs Pizza

Fly home in late afternoon/evening

He was driving late at night. It was pouring rain. Said he needed to pick up a stranded friend. I asked him not to go, but he insisted. He merged too fast, lost traction. Veered onto the shoulder.

He never saw the man walking on the side of the road until he was halfway over the hood. 

The legality took months to resolve. His guilt was immeasurable. He spent the first week in bed, sobbing ‚Äúmy fault‚Äù into the pillows. I did my best to support him through his grief, but I could only do so much. But after several months of counseling and my unending love, he slowly began to live again. 

Until the haunting began. 

We awoke one morning to find all of our living room furniture in disarray. The couch was backwards, the cushions stacked atop one another. Our coffee table was upside down. We were both perplexed. He was a heavy sleeper, but I wasn‚Äôt. Neither of us heard a thing. Nothing was missing, so a break-in seemed doubtful. And all the doors and windows were still locked from the inside. 

We laughed it off. *‚ÄúGuess one of us must sleepwalk‚Äù*, he joked. But I could see it in his eyes ‚Äî he was afraid.

The activity only escalated from there. 

We would hear footsteps and knocks in the night, sometimes echoing from multiple rooms at once. His things began going missing ‚Äî golf clubs, mugs, keys ‚Äî only to reappear later bent or smashed to bits. He swore he could hear disembodied voices, taunting him from behind the walls. Something even began leaving messages while he was in the shower, scrawled into the steamy mirror.

*‚ÄúI know what you did.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI will have my revenge.‚Äù*

He couldn‚Äôt sleep, barely ate. The man he killed had returned to make his life a waking nightmare. Seeing no alternative, we contacted a priest to bless our home. 

Soon, every threshold was bedecked with holy water. A crucifix hung above every door. The activity seemed to subside. It was finally over.

Until the following week.

I was awoken by a bloodcurdling scream from the bathroom. I found my husband on his knees, staring open-mouthed at the shower. The water ran steaming crimson. A declaration was smeared across the wall in blood.

*‚ÄùSoon.‚Äù*

He was afraid to be alone. I sat up with him all night, but I eventually nodded off. 

I awoke to an empty bed. Our upstairs window was open, the curtains flapping in the breeze. 

My husband lay in a halo of scarlet on the pavement below.

At his funeral, the other widows claimed they knew my pain.

But they didn‚Äôt know.

That the blood wasn‚Äôt real.

That I‚Äôd hidden speakers in the walls months ago.

That he‚Äôd been driving to meet his mistress that fateful night.

As I wept crocodile tears over his casket, a single thought crossed my mind.

*‚ÄúI know what you did.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI had my revenge.‚Äù*

1fxwd0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1fxwd0s/a_knock_from_the_past/,A knock from the past,"I hadn‚Äôt left my house in years. I, 24M, started working from home after COVID, and as the months passed, I found fewer and fewer reasons to go out. I didn‚Äôt have many friends to begin with, and now, my only social interactions were brief exchanges with delivery drivers. Groceries left on my doorstep. Faceless exchanges of mumbled thanks. It suited me just fine.

¬†The small house I bought just before the pandemic became my entire world. A refuge. The walls, though close, were familiar, comforting. I‚Äôd never spoken to any of my neighbors. Sometimes I heard their voices outside, passing by, but I never felt compelled to introduce myself. I didn‚Äôt miss anyone from my old life friends, family, or otherwise. Work was quiet. Emails only, the occasional conference call that I mostly slept through. It was like I had quietly detached from everything, and I was okay with that.

¬†But last week, something strange happened. I got a call‚Äîan actual call‚Äîfrom an old friend. His name flashed across my screen, triggering a surge of emotions I couldn‚Äôt quite understand. For some reason, I smiled. It wasn‚Äôt joy. Maybe a faint sense of nostalgia, but it felt distant, like remembering a life that wasn‚Äôt really mine anymore. Against my instincts, I picked up. ‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù he said, his voice oddly cheerful. The small talk felt stilted, mechanical. He told me he was back in the city after years of traveling and wanted to catch up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been forever, hasn‚Äôt it? We should grab coffee or something.‚Äù I hesitated, every fiber of my being rejecting the idea of leaving my house.

¬†‚ÄúNo, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really up for it,‚Äù I mumbled. But he kept insisting, his voice tightening with a kind of urgency that made me uncomfortable. There was something beneath his words, a need. After a few minutes of him pressing, I finally relented. Sunday evening came too fast. I dragged myself out of bed, stared at my reflection in the mirror. My face looked pale, thinner than I remembered. Taking a long, hot shower, I tried to shake off the unease, but it clung to me. The world outside felt foreign. The air felt heavier as I stepped out of my front door for the first time in‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt even remember how long.

¬†We met at a small caf√© downtown around 6 p.m. The sky was a muted gray, the streets quieter than usual, casting an eerie calm over the city. I spotted him before he saw me, sitting by the window, tapping his fingers nervously on the table. He looked the same, mostly‚Äîjust older. Worn down, like time had dragged him through rough terrain.

¬†As I sat down, he greeted me with a forced smile. We made small talk, like strangers trying to fill a silence. My eyes kept drifting to the street outside, wondering why I‚Äôd let myself get dragged into this. Then his tone shifted. The casual demeanor dropped.

¬†‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I need to tell you,‚Äù he said, his voice lowering as he leaned in. My stomach tightened. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù His eyes darted around the caf√©, as if searching for eavesdroppers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been getting threats. Someone wants me dead.‚Äù

¬†I froze, unsure if I‚Äôd heard him right. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúFor the past month, I‚Äôve been getting these calls. Messages. They don‚Äôt say much, but‚Ä¶ they know things about me. About us.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúUs?‚Äù I asked, confused.

¬†He nodded, gripping his coffee cup so tightly I thought it might crack. His eyes were wide, almost panicked. ‚ÄúThe first one came a month ago. A voice. Deep, cold. They said I couldn‚Äôt run. That I couldn‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

¬†Suddenly, his phone buzzed. His face went pale. Without thinking, he put it on speaker. A deep, gravelly voice echoed through the small caf√©: ‚ÄúYou cannot run.‚Äù The call disconnected. He was visibly shaking now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this is happening, but‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre coming for us. They already killed the others.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat others?‚Äù My mind raced, trying to make sense of what he was saying. ‚ÄúOur old friends. From high school. They‚Äôre all dead.‚Äù I blinked, my mouth dry. ‚ÄúWhat? How do you know that?‚Äù He pulled out his phone again, this time showing me news articles. Accidents. Murders. Four of them, all in the last year, all from different parts of the country. My chest tightened, an invisible weight pressing down on me.

¬†I shook my head. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why come to me?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre the only ones left.‚Äù He looked directly into my eyes, the fear in his expression so raw it unnerved me. ‚ÄúAnd because the killer knows what we did.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I asked, feeling a chill crawl down my spine. He stared at me for a moment, searching my face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù I shook my head again, more forcefully this time. ‚ÄúRemember what?‚Äù He swallowed hard, his voice shaking as he spoke. ‚ÄúThat night. After the party. We were drunk. Really drunk. We saw her walking home, remember? She was alone, and‚Ä¶ we offered her a ride.‚Äù

¬†I felt my stomach twist, but I stayed silent as he continued. ‚ÄúAt first, she said no, but we insisted. We took her out by the woods. And we‚Ä¶ we did things. We hurt her. All of us.‚Äù I stared at him in disbelief. The words felt like a distant echo, something happening to someone else. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, that‚Äôs not possible. I wouldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou were there,‚Äù he whispered, his voice barely audible now. ‚ÄúYou were just as drunk as the rest of us. You don‚Äôt remember because you blocked it out.‚Äù I stood up suddenly, my chair scraping the floor, drawing a few glances from nearby tables. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything like that! You‚Äôre lying. You‚Äôre trying to drag me into this‚Ä¶ mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying,‚Äù he said desperately, following me as I walked out of the caf√©. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt help me, you‚Äôll be next.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù I turned and walked away, his voice calling out after me, but I didn‚Äôt stop. When I got home, I felt numb. I poured myself a drink and sat at my desk, the old laptop screen flickering on. I sifted through photos of high school, yearbook pictures, group selfies. Happy faces. Laughter. But there was nothing. No memory of that night. Could he have been telling the truth? Could I have forgotten something so horrible? I drank more, trying to drown out the rising panic, but it was no use. By midnight, I was drunk. By 2 a.m., I was shaking. I turned off my phone and crawled into bed, my head spinning with conflicting thoughts.

¬†When I woke up the next morning, my phone was filled with missed calls. Dozens of messages. All from him.",1,1728264835.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Help?","I (25F) went on a first date with a guy (29M) last weekend. We chatted for a few days before that, then had good conversation and decided to get coffee. He seems really sweet, and I had a great time with him but I'm feeling a bit suspicious. Since we had a nice time, I saw him again the next day to grab lunch, and earlier this week we met again to play pool and hangout. I told him it's important for me to move at a very slow pace, and he was okay with this. He kissed me goodnight for the first time on our third date playing pool, which I was also okay with. By the third date, we had been talking for a week.

These are some signs I've seen though that I'm feeling off about. I haven't really dated much, so I'm not sure if this is expected early-on in dating? I was hoping to get some opinions and other perspectives.

* After the third date, which at that point, we've been chatting for just about a week--he brought up exclusivity. He told me that I'm the only woman he's entertaining and he's just into me, which I was okay with. I told him I only really date one person at a time anyways, so I'm fine with that, but I re-emphasized that I don't want to rush into any sort of commitment without really getting to know each other. He said that's fine with him, as long as he knows that ""I'm his"" and ""only his."" It felt a bit soon for that, I told him I didn't want to rush into any commitment and even though commitment hasn't been officially declared, it feels like there's some kind of expectation attached now? He mentioned he's been cheated on in the past so I'm not sure if maybe he's just insecure.
* There's some signs of slight jealousy already I think. He plays it off in a cute way, like ""oh, you talk to a lot of those guys at the gym?"" or flirty comments like that. I didn't really think anything of it, until we had a conversation about men and women being friends. I told him I believe men and women can be friends, and I have guy friends in my life. He strongly disagreed, and told me men just want one thing and one thing only. He told me that he only talks to women with two goals in mind, either a romantic goal to start a long-term relationship if there's long-term potential, or a sexual goal (he said he had more of a sexual goal in his early 20s, and he's looking for something serious now.) I'm okay with differing views, but this kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It feels like he's just boxing women into a goal for him and there's not anything more to them, and that's why they wouldn't have anything to offer in friendship. It made me wonder how he views me, if I'm just some sort of goal.
* He already started with pet names a week in. ""Baby, babe, hun, etc."" He doesn't know me well enough yet at all, but he's calling me pet names and wanting me to only be his. He can just really be into me and excited, but calling someone pet names so soon just concerns me that it's not sincere. He was texting me good morning beautiful since the second chat we had, and since the first date.
* He was giving me more insight into how he was in his early 20s. He had one 7 year long relationship starting in high school, and another 1 year long relationship more recently, but during the few years he was single in his 20s, he said he ""knew exactly what to say to women to eventually get what he wanted"" and that ""a lot of it was similar to what he tells me, wanting a relationship and all, but the difference is he was young and he wouldn't mean any of it."" And explained that now that he's older, he knows what he wants and wants to settle down--and that just messing around doesn't mean anything to him anymore. I get it... I guess, but how do I know he isn't just telling me what I want to hear if he was once capable of manipulating other women that way?

That's pretty much the rundown of it. Don't get me wrong, there's also been positives, otherwise I would've just completely cut the chord already. He has been understanding with me and has reiterated to me that he'll be patient for whatever I need because I was honest with him that my last relationship ended pretty badly and that I need time to really build trust and vulnerability with someone. He's been very kind, and has made me laugh a lot. We have some things in common, like video games and martial arts, so it's been nice sharing in those together. We've had a lot of conversations even just texting where we can talk a lot and conversation flows easily. Aside from those signs I've listed out, he seems like a nice guy and has treated me with respect--and has been receptive to anything I've told him as far as what I need. So I'm not really sure how I feel about all of this, something in me is feeling a ton of caution and suspicion, and another part of me is wondering if that's more because of myself and if I should just go with it.",2,1728264717.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

So I thought the best way to potentially salvage this is by dyeing it a different color. I don't really want to dye it yellow though...any suggestions on what color may go well on something that's a faded yellow? ",1,1728264401.0,dyeing,1,1.0,False

I hadn‚Äôt left my house in years. I, 24M, started working from home after COVID, and as the months passed, I found fewer and fewer reasons to go out. I didn‚Äôt have many friends to begin with, and now, my only social interactions were brief exchanges with delivery drivers. Groceries left on my doorstep. Faceless exchanges of mumbled thanks. It suited me just fine.

¬†The small house I bought just before the pandemic became my entire world. A refuge. The walls, though close, were familiar, comforting. I‚Äôd never spoken to any of my neighbors. Sometimes I heard their voices outside, passing by, but I never felt compelled to introduce myself. I didn‚Äôt miss anyone from my old life friends, family, or otherwise. Work was quiet. Emails only, the occasional conference call that I mostly slept through. It was like I had quietly detached from everything, and I was okay with that.

¬†But last week, something strange happened. I got a call‚Äîan actual call‚Äîfrom an old friend. His name flashed across my screen, triggering a surge of emotions I couldn‚Äôt quite understand. For some reason, I smiled. It wasn‚Äôt joy. Maybe a faint sense of nostalgia, but it felt distant, like remembering a life that wasn‚Äôt really mine anymore. Against my instincts, I picked up. ‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù he said, his voice oddly cheerful. The small talk felt stilted, mechanical. He told me he was back in the city after years of traveling and wanted to catch up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been forever, hasn‚Äôt it? We should grab coffee or something.‚Äù I hesitated, every fiber of my being rejecting the idea of leaving my house.

¬†‚ÄúNo, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really up for it,‚Äù I mumbled. But he kept insisting, his voice tightening with a kind of urgency that made me uncomfortable. There was something beneath his words, a need. After a few minutes of him pressing, I finally relented. Sunday evening came too fast. I dragged myself out of bed, stared at my reflection in the mirror. My face looked pale, thinner than I remembered. Taking a long, hot shower, I tried to shake off the unease, but it clung to me. The world outside felt foreign. The air felt heavier as I stepped out of my front door for the first time in‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt even remember how long.

¬†We met at a small caf√© downtown around 6 p.m. The sky was a muted gray, the streets quieter than usual, casting an eerie calm over the city. I spotted him before he saw me, sitting by the window, tapping his fingers nervously on the table. He looked the same, mostly‚Äîjust older. Worn down, like time had dragged him through rough terrain.

¬†As I sat down, he greeted me with a forced smile. We made small talk, like strangers trying to fill a silence. My eyes kept drifting to the street outside, wondering why I‚Äôd let myself get dragged into this. Then his tone shifted. The casual demeanor dropped.

¬†‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I need to tell you,‚Äù he said, his voice lowering as he leaned in. My stomach tightened. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù His eyes darted around the caf√©, as if searching for eavesdroppers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been getting threats. Someone wants me dead.‚Äù

¬†I froze, unsure if I‚Äôd heard him right. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúFor the past month, I‚Äôve been getting these calls. Messages. They don‚Äôt say much, but‚Ä¶ they know things about me. About us.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúUs?‚Äù I asked, confused.

¬†He nodded, gripping his coffee cup so tightly I thought it might crack. His eyes were wide, almost panicked. ‚ÄúThe first one came a month ago. A voice. Deep, cold. They said I couldn‚Äôt run. That I couldn‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

¬†Suddenly, his phone buzzed. His face went pale. Without thinking, he put it on speaker. A deep, gravelly voice echoed through the small caf√©: ‚ÄúYou cannot run.‚Äù The call disconnected. He was visibly shaking now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this is happening, but‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre coming for us. They already killed the others.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat others?‚Äù My mind raced, trying to make sense of what he was saying. ‚ÄúOur old friends. From high school. They‚Äôre all dead.‚Äù I blinked, my mouth dry. ‚ÄúWhat? How do you know that?‚Äù He pulled out his phone again, this time showing me news articles. Accidents. Murders. Four of them, all in the last year, all from different parts of the country. My chest tightened, an invisible weight pressing down on me.

¬†I shook my head. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why come to me?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre the only ones left.‚Äù He looked directly into my eyes, the fear in his expression so raw it unnerved me. ‚ÄúAnd because the killer knows what we did.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I asked, feeling a chill crawl down my spine. He stared at me for a moment, searching my face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù I shook my head again, more forcefully this time. ‚ÄúRemember what?‚Äù He swallowed hard, his voice shaking as he spoke. ‚ÄúThat night. After the party. We were drunk. Really drunk. We saw her walking home, remember? She was alone, and‚Ä¶ we offered her a ride.‚Äù

¬†I felt my stomach twist, but I stayed silent as he continued. ‚ÄúAt first, she said no, but we insisted. We took her out by the woods. And we‚Ä¶ we did things. We hurt her. All of us.‚Äù I stared at him in disbelief. The words felt like a distant echo, something happening to someone else. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, that‚Äôs not possible. I wouldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou were there,‚Äù he whispered, his voice barely audible now. ‚ÄúYou were just as drunk as the rest of us. You don‚Äôt remember because you blocked it out.‚Äù I stood up suddenly, my chair scraping the floor, drawing a few glances from nearby tables. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything like that! You‚Äôre lying. You‚Äôre trying to drag me into this‚Ä¶ mess.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying,‚Äù he said desperately, following me as I walked out of the caf√©. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt help me, you‚Äôll be next.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù I turned and walked away, his voice calling out after me, but I didn‚Äôt stop. When I got home, I felt numb. I poured myself a drink and sat at my desk, the old laptop screen flickering on. I sifted through photos of high school, yearbook pictures, group selfies. Happy faces. Laughter. But there was nothing. No memory of that night. Could he have been telling the truth? Could I have forgotten something so horrible? I drank more, trying to drown out the rising panic, but it was no use. By midnight, I was drunk. By 2 a.m., I was shaking. I turned off my phone and crawled into bed, my head spinning with conflicting thoughts.

¬†When I woke up the next morning, my phone was filled with missed calls. Dozens of messages. All from him.",1,1728264279.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

He refuses to see a doctor about his subsequent issues; things like prostatitis, UTI‚Äôs, painful muscle cramps, constipation, and sinus infections to name a few. 

I have tried telling him that his refusal to take care of himself is driving a serious wedge in our relationship. He is adamant that he does not need water when he is drinking all the above.

My ex and I have been on and off for the last year. We recently met up after a break up last week. What should have been a quick hello and catching up led to coffee and the whole day being spent together. In one of our conversations, he expressed to me something truly heartbreaking. He is much older and has experienced heartbreak from a divorce years ago, unrequited love and a ton of other trauma.  He‚Äôs had a lot of struggles. He has been someone who always has a sense of gloom about him, no matter how he appears to the world. I think of him and sometimes think only of darkness despite how I attracted I am to him and how beautiful of a person he is. He has admitted that he often carries a bit of sadness but still moves on in life and lives the best he can. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a highly religious and spiritual person. He has always been supportive, positive and uplifting towards me, though. He often helps everyone around him and loves to be there for the community. So it‚Äôs definitely something internal that he has come to terms with.

Several days ago, he opened up to me that he thinks he might not find love again and that it seems impossible now. He told me that he wonders if he can live being alone forever. We both know that we can‚Äôt be together and have come to terms with it (sort of) but I‚Äôm definitely having trouble letting him go. And our last meeting has got me worrying about what he said. I want him to be happy. I want him to thrive and find love even if it‚Äôs not with me‚Ä¶ but what he said broke my heart. I told him he experienced love before so it will happen again. 

I worry about him a lot. I worry for his safety. I worry if he is happy and in good company. I worry about his mental health. I know it is not my responsibility anymore as he has made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt think we should be together, but I am in love with him. I love him dearly and worry for his wellbeing. I‚Äôm afraid this feeling will suffocate me one day. It hurts to think of him and I don‚Äôt want to hurt anymore. I have cried way too much thinking of our memories.

We both agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt speak anymore despite how badly we both want each other in our lives. It hurts too much and I need to move on. We haven‚Äôt talked since then. But worrying about him is almost consuming me.

","Hi All - I'm living in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with two roommates (3 total of us. - 2 guys and 1 girl) We each pay around $1000 for our own room which is basically unheard of at this point economy wise.

Jackson (37) has been living in this place for over 11 years and it's rent controlled in a major city with a really great central location to multiple dining, bars, public transit etc.

Violet (32) has been living in the apartment for over 2 years now.

I Xavier (34) been here a 1 year 3 months.

The entire apartment has pretty much been curated by Jackson over the 11 year span. The couch, coffee table, dining table, chairs, etc. are his and Violet and I don't really have much of our own items in the common living area being the kitchen and living room which is fine but almost feels like we're not roommates but ""living in his apartment"" even though we're all paying an equal share of everything.

In the past Violet brought up cleaning as she sat us down to let us know, so i decided to start a google calendar of everyone's week to clean (one person cleans once a week the common areas of the living room and kitchen. The first cleaning session went myself, violet, Jackson and when we're talking about cleaning where it's deep and not just taking a wipe and spot cleaning (dusting, taking things off the counter, wiping down all counters, cleaning out the sink, cleaning the microwave etc.) During these deep cleanings Violet and I noticed that that there doesn't seem to be consistency and discussed with each other and noticed Jackson was really cleaning but saying he is.

Fast forward a few months later Violet brings up the cleaning situation again and says let's sit down and talk about this after she creates a physical paper chart of cleaning. We go over the cleaning duties and she expresses the e-mail she sent saying she feels nobody is listening to her and not cleaning anything. I fully admit to not doing a great job cleaning the microwave and vacuuming the living room but Jackson ""hears her"" but usually tries to change the subject.

So last week we cleaned out old pots/pans/etc and talked about cleaning to which Violet already deep cleaned one week previously before we sat down and talked and Jackson claimed he cleaned the week after to which Violet responds ""Well the vacuum job was done really shitty"" Jackson changes the subject and ignores and never addresses what Violet says.

Violet pulled me aside and asked if I cleaned last week to which I said no but Jackson filled out the chart saying he did to which there was stuff in the kitchen on the ground in the corners, and the the counters were dirty. He lied about him cleaning which is highly weird that a 37 year old man is lying about cleaning. Don't get me wrong. I'm not the best at cleaning and not under zero fault at all, but I've always admitted what areas I'm shitty at and have tried to improve and always said ""please let me know if I'm doing something that bothers you and I can fix it"" but I've pretty much given up because of Jackson and how he doesn't even try and decides to lie about it.

I share a bathroom with Jackson and it's never really cleaned, toilet seat is left up, bottom of the white shower is basically black feet marks on the bottom. I started cleaning only MY half of the mirror and side of the sink and Jackson still has not cleaned his side so it gets dirtier and dirtier. When we set down he looked at me and said ""oh i also forget to keep cleaning the bathroom"" I know this isn't my personal hygiene problem because he has a toothbrush holder/razor holder that I've NEVER seen him clean and there's dirt in it.

There always seems to be excuse with Jackson to which is pathetic given he's a 37 year old man. Violet and I have sat down multiple times and tried to be nice about it but it doesn't seem to resonate.

Other example that proves all of this above and shows he doesn't care

Jackson has left a candle lit and LEFT the apartment I text him and asked him what's the story with that and he said ""leave it lit please"" to which I told him that's very dangerous and I'm going to put it out. A few days later he has it lit again and he's left the house.

So what on earth can Violet can I do about this? Do we need to basically go hard and have a huge fight because this being understanding is NOT getting through to him at all. Violet and I don't want to move out because a lot of her friends are in the area and it's a good area for my work. Additionally the rent is controlled making both our rents increase probably +1000. We thought about getting a cleaner once a month but getting penalized for him financially doesn't make sense. Would love anyone's advice here on what we can do to solve this situation?

Over the summer, I started drinking Celsius energy drinks because I had a summer job that had me starting work at 5AM/6AM. This summer job was basically me working at a coffee shop/drive thru so I was moving a TON and never noticed any side effects of drinking caffeine. HOWEVER, I started back at school back in August (and quit my job) and as I continued drinking Celsius, I realized i was extremely jittery and it really exacerbated my physical ADHD symptoms- making it a lot harder to sit still.
Frustratingly, I am the type of person that needs at least 8 hours of sleep or I will literally be incapable of functioning the next day. Also, my university sits at ~7000ft above sea level and so the high elevation + my asthma makes it a lot easier for me to become tired up here.

I wanted to know, besides energy drinks, what advice do you guys have for staying awake/waking up?

As an espresso enthusiast, it‚Äôs tough to have to limit my caffeine intake as advised by my cardiologist. I have a condition called SVT, which, though infrequent, can cause my heart to race to over 230 BPM‚Äîdefinitely a scary experience. Just seeing my coffee setup in the corner reminds me of what I can‚Äôt enjoy right now.

On a positive note, I‚Äôm scheduled to meet with an electrophysiologist for a catheter ablation procedure, where they'll insert wires into my heart to eliminate some extra electrical circuits. I‚Äôm hopeful that I‚Äôll be back to enjoying coffee soon. In the meantime, please enjoy a cup for me while I can't! Also, grind finer please.",12,1728262919.0,espresso,19,0.94,False
1fxvpsy,https://i.redd.it/uvr04y1mg8td1.jpeg,No complaint here ,Stopped at Tim's this morning for my coffee & 20 pack of Timbits before we headed to the riverfront for a walk. My go-to for timbits is always chocolate glazed & honey dip. Didn't get the official count but there was definitely more than 20. And my XL triple triple with hazelnut was done perfectly. ,27,1728262802.0,TimHortons,10,0.85,False

I've never worked with this kind of furniture, though, and am worrying about everything from building/assembling it properly, to making sure I've measured my apartment correctly, to deciding between bookcase kits and buying pipes, fittings, and boards and putting things together from scratch.  (To add more pressure, I'm hoping to get this done before mid-November, when I have knee replacement surgery, so I'll have more space to move around without tripping over boxes of books.)

Has anyone reading this worked with this kind of project in the past, or do you know someone who has? Please get in touch with me either way, as I'm hoping to get rolling on this soon!  We could meet for coffee so I can explain the whole mess in more detail, and see how it goes from there, OK? Thanks in advance!",3,1728262750.0,Somerville,0,1.0,False
1fxvkfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1fxvkfj/reflection_and_apology_i_trust_youre_strong_enough/,Reflection and Apology. I Trust You're Strong Enough... ,"   Life isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Yeah, it has its ups and downs but for the most part is pretty chill. In my case tragedy happened but after the grieving period passed I continued with my life. Nothing really changed. 

   I still had a cup of coffee in the morning to alert your body you are supposed to go take a shit just to immediately after take a shower and get ready for the day. I kept doing it. 

   Not gonna say it wasn't hard to see only one cup on the table or watching the news instead of having some type of debate over whether or not we should just skip work and watch movies all day. 

   For every bad situation there's always an upside to it. For example if I had had one of my daily talks with my wife that morning I wouldn't have known black rappers sympathized with nazis. The other night I had a close encounter with a guy wearing a hoodie with the confederate flag. That one was easy to explain. He probably thought it was the British flag. The other guy is almost impossible to know what the fuck. Maybe he read the autobiography of Jesse Owens. I don't know. 

   In a way I wish the guy with the hoodie actually loved white people and supported the south. Maybe he wouldn't have shot my wife the night we met him. 

   It was a normal night. The guy came out of nowhere. He was obviously high out of his mind. Despite giving him everything he demanded more while looking so freaked out. I tried to explain. I even dumbed down my speech but he with his ever growing nervousness pulled the trigger. The guy just stood there. I was trying to save my wife. All I knew about helping someone was applying pressure to the wound. I was screaming for help. People came. I turned to look at the guy. 

   ‚ÄúDid you get everything you wanted, you disgusting monster?!‚Äù I yelled. 

   Despite the people he was still there. And then he wasn't. No, he didn't disappear into thin air. He shot himself. Soon after my wife died.

   Now there was nobody to love and nobody to punish. I felt empty. 

   But then again; I learned to live with it. Never moved on but life goes on. But I continued with my life. 

   The fact someone you love can be with you one moment and then just vanish in a second. She will never wake me up in the morning again, kiss me or encourage me. She's gone and there's no bringing her back. 

   That's something I believe to be the scariest thing about life. Forget about monsters and ghosts.

   Reality is frightening. 

   We're all going to die. How we die is what matters.

   Death is death. I don't believe it changes where we go. So I'll see her tonight.



My Yuna. I love you.



I'm sorry, Mom.
