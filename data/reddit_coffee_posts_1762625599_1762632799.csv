I was telling her about my diagnosis and that I'd just started a six weeks course about managing it.

She's been a bit weird about it. Then today she told me she doesn't think I have it, that she met something with it years ago and she wasn't very thin and pale and it's a diagnostic they give you when they don't know what's wrong.

I was pretty upset but then there have been other comments like this in the past.

She's said about a niece with Crohn's disease she thought that was being dramatized.

And when I was hospitalized with sepsis she was a bit funny about seeking medical care for it.

My own mother had mental health problems and when I was hospitalized in the past with life saving surgery for a small bowel obstruction from adhesions kept saying I'd been doing drugs so it reminds me a bit of that. 

And also medical gaslighting in the past.

The one today is quite elderly and I'm also a bit unsure about cognitive decline but think it might be her personality.

I don't really know why I started doing this. Just woke up early one day and didn't want to immediately dive into everything. So I went outside and sat there.

It was uncomfortable at first. My brain was like ""you're wasting time, check your emails, do something productive."" But I just stayed.

And after a few minutes that noise kind of faded. I started noticing birds. The way the light hits things in the morning. How quiet it is before everyone wakes up.

I've been doing it for maybe three weeks now and it's the only part of my day that feels like it's actually mine. Not responding to anyone, not trying to accomplish anything, just existing for a few minutes.

I think I forgot what that felt like? Like everything's always about the next thing. What needs to get done, what I'm behind on, what I should be working toward. There's no space to just be.

Those 10 minutes are the only time I'm not performing or producing or consuming. And somehow that makes the rest of the day feel less heavy.

I'm not trying to make this sound deeper than it is. I just sit outside and look at trees. But it's helped more than any productivity hack or routine I've tried.

Maybe we just need permission to do nothing sometimes.",2,1762632448.0,PeaceAndProgress,0,1.0,False

1orz0go,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1orz0go/the_black_mold_in_the_basement_has_started_to/,The Black Mold in the Basement has Started to Speak,"Long time lurker first time contributor. Enjoy. :)

Part 1

A damp, musty basement isn't uncommon in the NorthEast, hell even black mold isn't all that uncommon. Not to say that it's OKAY that there's potentially black mold in the average basement up here, but nevertheless, it wouldn't be surprising. What IS surprising though; is that it doesn't usually speak. 

Now ""speak"" may be a stretch as the mold isn't actively delivering a monolgue to me while I rotate my laundry or anything like that; but I do hear it whispering. Or I think I do anyway. It's probably just my mind playing tricks on me...it's just a spot on the wall, right? A spot on the wall that keeps coming back.

Like mold does. In a damp basement in the Northeast. Definitely overthinking...I shook my head in an attempt to shake loose the unease that held me close. 

I've never had any real trauma or reason to be afraid of basements or anything like that, I've just always been sorta creeped out by them. I always hated just the idea of basements and the mental images of spiders and lurking demons they conjured up in my over-creative mind. But this was different....I'm not imagining this...I don't think anyway.

""wuh..........wuh......""

A low raspy sound, almost like a labored voice in pain, breaks the Silence and calm of the otherwise still basement I was in. It felt like the entire room contracted like an uncontrolled muscle spasm. My heart leapt into my throat and I dropped the bottle of detergent I was preparing to measure onto the floor and spun around wildly, expecting to be face to face with some horrible abomination that was cleverly lurking in the shadows. 

But no. Nothing. There was nothing. I was alone with the spiders, the piles of boxes, and the splotch of mold on the corner where my gutters outside weren't being aimed away from the foundation correctly. 

I scolded myself and my stupid imagination as I picked up the detergent bottle off the floor that I thankfully hadn't opened yet. I don't have money to just be buying luxury items all willy-nilly...haven't exactly had the money for a long time. I haven't really had much of anything or *anyone* for a long time when I think about it. 

No friends. No family. No significant others. Hell not even pets. They all left...it all left, and all that was left with me was my mind and the ever-present miasma of loss that hung in the air of my dimly lit home, if you could call it that. It felt more like a tomb. A tomb where more than the dead lie silent; this was the final resting place of my ambition. 

I filled a cap with less-than the recommended amount of detergent, and started the wash machine with a deep cough to clear the phlegm. I spat into the slop sink next to the washer - black. Always black. It's not that my saliva has turned black, it's like a strange inky swirl in my sputem and seemed to move more than it should. 

I grunted, and turned on the cold water to rinse the foulness down the drain, lied to myself again that it was fine and that it's completely normal, that I wasn't rotting from the inside or something equally as horrible an outcome; but it likely wasn't fine and probably won't be okay. I don't know when that inkiness started to show up, but it certainly doesn't seem to be getting better. 

I set the nearly empty detergent bottle on top of the adjacent dryer, and made my way back upstairs, past the long-empty cat food dishes, now filled with more dust than food, and a long-disused overflowing litter box, up the creaky wooden stairs, and through the cloud of fruit flies that buzzed annoyingly at the top of the staircase. 

This was it. My home. My tomb. 

My home wasn't some kind of abandoned flat filled with trash to the brim...I'm not some kind of mentally ill hoarder type or anything, I just don't care anymore. Or at least I try not to, the last few vestiges of humanity I held onto were washing my clothes and washing myself even though I never went anywhere nor did anything outside of my home. I get regular grocery deliveries that I had scheduled before my life took a turn down this path, but the money in my bank account was almost certainly running low, and soon the deliveries would stop. 

Soon any real signs of life harbored inside would likely fade, and when that happened would anyone notice? Would anyone come to check on me before the smell alerted them to the truth of my fate? Or would I be saved by some miracle that would have me pull my head out of the muck that I was so anxiously sinking in? The cloud of depression that had stopped me to reflect in that humid kitchen vanished in an instant when a loud crash came from the basement behind me.

I spun around to look down the poorly lit stairwell that lead into the abyss. Dust particles hung thick in the air, illuminated by the few beams of sunlight that pushed past the drawn blinds that covered one of the nearby windows. I flipped the switch on the wall, and the old fluorescent bulbs blinked and buzzed to life before quieting down and I took several steps down to the basement and crouched down slightly to see which pile of unlabeled boxes fell over this time. 

In the furthest corner of the basement, opposite the slop sink and the washer and dryer, was a stack of about 7 or 8 boxes of assorted books that had tipped and fallen over, spilling their contents across the floor. 

""Oh, fuck me."" I scolded myself. I knew it was just a matter of time before that stack fell; I had known the bottom box was blackened and soggy with mold, but what was I supposed to do about it? Now what was I supposed to do about THIS? I continued down the last few stairs and stood over the mess of spilled books. Everything from old text books to comics lie splayed across the floor in a discordant pile.  I pushed some of the spilled books against the wall with my feet and flipped a couple of the other boxes back over and restacked them away from the blackened corner of my basement as best I could.

I went back upstairs and flipped the lights off, walked through the cloud of fruit flies, across the humid kitchen and into the equally as humid living room, and crashed all at once as an exhausted heap onto the dusty couch. I didn't have a sleep schedule anymore and I spent a lot of time napping, especially since I started seeing that black stuff in my spit...it's why I think I'm sick, or maybe worse. Sleep settled over me quickly and I dozed off to another dreamless nap of indeterminate length...as the clogged slop sink in the basement began to overflow from the draining wash machine, soaking the books and the Black Corner. 

Part 2

I snap awake to the deafening sound of buzzing in my right ear; a fruit fly flew directly inside and the proximity of the wings to my ear drum sounded like a Formula 1 car in my living room. I sit up and take a glance around the dark room before wiping the sleep from my eyes in an attempt to read the time on the microwave across the kitchen. Flashing 1:01...who knows what the time actually is, all I know is the sun is down and now I'm awake...who needs to keep track of time and a sleep schedule, anyway?

Sitting on the coffee table nearby is a box from the pizza place up the corner, my stomach growls an empty churn and I grab a piece of hard, dry pizza and choke down a couple of bites before standing to stretch and  remembering the load of laundry I started before my unscheduled nap. Slowly I begin to make my way across the living room, and through the kitchen...no fruit flies though this time...they must be asleep...that must be nice. 

I flip on the fluorescent bulbs of the basement and make my way down. The bulbs don't stop flickering and buzzing this time though like they normally do, and I was hit in the face with a smell that could best be described as ""filthy."" The slop sink clogged, likely with lint that drained from the machine, causing the sink to fill with the dirty water from the wash, spilling over onto the dusty concrete floor, soaking the pile of books and assorted boxes...but also the black corner. 

I sat down on the steps, and surveyed the mess in defeat, taking in the darkened corner of the dirty room. It looked...*bigger* this time...more slimy and thicker than before. The reflection from the flickering bulbs illuminated the room like a twisted slideshow; the thick black tendrils that grew outwards from the corner like the roots of some great unseen tree desperately grasping for nutrition. 

""What the fuck IS that...?"" I asked quietly, but not as quietly as I thought, because someone...someTHING answered back. 

""...life..."" Croaked a voice that made my blood run cold. ""...we....are life.""

""WHAT THE FUCK!?"" I shouted so loud it echoed off the walls of the dank basement, and stood up in a panic to get the hell out of there. I stood up so quickly, in fact, that I didn't take into account the low wall that stood above the descending stairwell I occupied, and in one motion saw stars, blacked out, and fell forward down into the basement, splashing face first into the thin layer of putrid water that coated the floor. 

I groaned as I came to some time later and reached up to touch the top of my knotted head, only to bring back fingers covered in the same black ichor that I had started to recently spit up. It wasn't ALL black though, it was very obviously still blood on my fingertips, but the blood was dark, not like the blood from a fresh wound, but more like someone dropped black ink from an inkwell into it. 

I pushed my palms to the wet floor, mud from the years of now-soaked accumulated dust squished coarsely under my fingertips as I pushed myself up, and leaned my back against the nearby wall with a groan. I grabbed the bottom of my filth-soaked shirt in an attempt to wipe the grime from my face and eyes, and turned my head to look at the Black Corner. I sat and stared for what felt like an eternity but couldn't have been more than a few seconds, when suddenly the same chilling voice I thought I imagined before I took that blow to the head spoke once again.

""...listen...to us....NEED...you...""

And with a wet ripple, like the sound of marbles being  dropped into thick mud, a legion of eyes, seemingly both human and inhuman forced their way through the skin-like surface of the growth that was beginning to dominate the corner of my basement. The eyes rolled and twitched in random uncoordinated directions, with some rolling upwards so hard that they began to bleed and ooze a thick ichor where the nerves beneath began to tear themselves away, before rolling a complete 360 degrees in the socket and settling to stare at me. All of them; the dozens of twitching, spastic eyes all stopped their discordant movement simultaniously and locked onto me, turning my blood to ice. 

Part 3

""Wha....what the fuck is this!?""

Could scarcely believe what I was seeing and what I had heard. My heart was beating in my throat as I attempted to focus my blurry vision on the horrid mass of pulsating eyes and veins that now dominated the corner of my basement, the tendrils reaching out towards the slop sink stopped just shy of making their way into the sink itself. 

""We...life....water...""

Water? That's what caused this? Some dirty water caused a moldy spot in the corner of my basement develop into...whatever this is? Granted, black mold DOES thrive in a damp environment, but this is far beyond thriving...this is sentience, and I had so many questions all at once that I could barely get any words out to push the conversation further. 

""H...How? How...how did this happen?"" I asked in a low, shaky voice, barely louder than a whisper.

""Moist...dead......feed life..."" The voice in the corner responded.

 The thick black tendril that reached towards the other side of the basement had made its way over the edge, and down into the slop sink. That same tendril started to grow and pulsate from where it originated from the cancerous mass in the corner. A large bulge in the dark root, similar to that of an over-full boa constrictor, formed and forced its way down the tendril, up the edge of the sink, where it exited inside the sink with loud bubbling sound, before something floated to the top, causing more displaced water to spill onto the floor. The cloud of eyes in the corner blinked in unison at me, before shifting it's gaze across the room to the sink in which it was reaching out to. 

Reluctantly I put my palms again on the wet floor of the basement and pushed myself to my feet, head still swimming from the earlier blow I had been dealt. I attempted to brush some of the residual mud and dirt off of my now-ruined clothing before cautiously making my way over to the sink. It couldn't have been more than 20 feet away from where I was standing, but it may as well have been a football field...I didn't want to know what was in that sink, but at the same time I had to know. I took several hesitant steps in that direction and rubbed my eyes again in an attempt to bring focus to what I was seeing.

Inside the sink was the bloated shape of slimy fur and  partially decayed flesh that pulsated and rippled unnaturally. It was a cat...it was MY cat. I gasped loudly and attempted to scream, but instead my mouth filled with sick, and I closed my eyes vomited onto the wet floor and my feet. I opened my eyes to gaze back towards the sink, where several more inhuman eyes had erupted through the bloated flesh of my dead cat and now stared directly at me. I wretched again, and threw up a second time, however this time when I opened my eyes, I didn't look at the cat in the sink; I kept my head down and opened my eyes to look at the floor.

Splashed up my ankles, covered both of my bare feet, and now slowly spreading across the flooded basement floor was a thick, blackness. It looked like crude oil how it swirled and separated itself from the water and floated atop. I stared down, frozen in horror, when suddenly with a ripple through the darkness I was standing in, one of the black roots from the corner quickly wrapped itself tightly around my ankle, and pulled my leg hard towards the Black Corner. A sharp tearing pain in my right hip upon being pulled away was quickly overtaken by the pain of falling and striking my head on wet concrete floor, before everything went dark and I slipped into unconsciousness on the soggy floor of that moldy NorEastern basement.

Part 4

The 20-something delivery driver parked his rusted van along the sidewalk outside the dead looking house. The windows all either covered with blinds, newspaper, or tinfoil to keep the sunlight out, while the front yard existed as an overgrown mess of weeds and tall grass, which mostly hid the overflowing mailbox that peeked just above the growth. I made this delivery at the same time and day every week, yet I've never met the person that lives here. Last week when I made my delivery, the food from the LAST week was still sitting in the sunroom that was attached to the entryway on the bleak looking house. I had tried to knock last time and had got no answer, but now this would be third delivery of food I would be leaving to essentially rot on this guy's porch. 

I shook my head and shifted the bag of groceries from my left over to my right arm, and reached out to ring the camera doorbell that was attached to the flaking paint of the inner doorway. The light on the front of the doorbell blinked red, indicating the batteries had died and that no one would be coming to answer. I sighed loudly before turning to knock on the front door, when I paused mid-knock and realized that the front door of the house lay slightly ajar this time.

""H...hello? It's your food delivery guy!"" I shouted towards the gap in the door before giving it a light push to see inside the dark home. 

The door swung open about halfway, and the stuffy air of the sunroom I was in was overtaken by the smell of fetid water. I gagged lightly before swallowing hard and making my way inside the dark house. ""Hello!? Is anybody home!?"" I shouted before setting the bag of groceries onto the cluttered kitchen table. Across the kitchen was the partially opened door down to the basement, and from it came what sounded like a severely leaking water pipe flowing likely flooding the place. 

I walked across the kitchen to the cracked door; the sound of running water much louder now, along with the stench of sewer hanging even more thick on the air. I peered inside and down the stairs, the flickering fluorescent bulbs illuminating just enough of the basement, that I could see that the water level had taken over the bottom handful of stairs which lead down to the basement area. I called down again.

""Hello? Is anybody down there?"" 

After about five seconds someone answered, the labored voice seemed weak, and struggled to get the words out. ""...hhhhhelp...we need...help with...the water.""

""You need my help? Down there?"" I called back, yet no voice answered back this time. ""Okay.. I'm...I'm coming down."" 

I took a few steps down towards the water at the bottom of the stairs, before ducking my head down to peek inside to see who I was talking to. The entire back wall was an impossible void that made the small basement appear to go on forever, and made me stomach churn with unease. I reached up to cover my nose and mouth with my hand and peered around the basement, trying to find the person that called out to me.

""Hello?"" I called out one last time, before something cold and slimy wrapped itself around my left ankle, and violently pulled me backwards THROUGH the basement stairs.

All at once, clothing and flesh tore away, bones broken and ripped from sockets and I was pulled inward. The wooden steps splintered and snapped with my bones as I splashed downwards into the putrid abyss. The sound of running water and crashing stairs drowned out by blinding pain and silence as my head splashed underwater and something wrapped around my throat tightly. When I was finally able to bring my head back above the water, I tried to gasp for air to no avail and saw my left arm floating uselessly beside me as I thrashed as much as I could with what small bit of motion I had remaining in my limbs. 

My vision goes black and begins to blur as I give in to the pain, and the last bit of oxygen in my lungs is squeezed out by the still-tightening tendrils around my neck, and now my torso. The last thing I hear before being granted the release of death was that same voice that had originally brought me downstairs in the first place. 

""Welcome...home."" Said the black mold in the corner of the basement.

1orz067,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orz067,Studio Ghibli and perfume pairings 🥰,"Howl’s Moving Castle

Lumiére Dorée by Miller Harris: neroli, jasmine, bergamot, petitgrain, musk, amber. 
Sophie, whose light soul shines brightly enough to bring Howl forth from the darkness, would wear this soft, fresh, citrus so beautifully. It also brings to mind cleanliness, something which was clearly important to Sophie.

Rose Privée by L’Artisan: rose, basil, hay, carnation, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli, magnolia, amber.
Beauty is one of the main themes of this film, with both characters experiencing very different relationships with it. Rose Privée is a realistic rose scent that explores some of its earthier, spicier facets of this flower, effectively a dirty rose that I think represents both Sophie’s inability to see her own beauty and Howl’s difficulty seeing past his.

Death of a Ladies’ Man by Universal Flowering: galbanum, violet, basil, mastic.
Gorgeous, green, but hard to reach: these are the words I’d used to describe both the fragrance Death of a Ladies’ Man and the ladies’ man being discussed here, Howl.

By the Fireplace by Replica Maison Margiela: chestnut, cloves, pink pepper, orange blossom, guaiac wood, juniper, vanilla, balsam.
She likes my spark! ;)

Ashes by Clandestine Laboratories: earthy notes, grass, clover, gardenia, jasmine, vetiver, musk, olibanum, patchouli.
This perfume represents the field of flowers under attack. A true scent of the earth, complete with notions of decay; it is very close to the scent of cremains. Why are all the flowers screaming? Disturbing, but deeply beautiful.

The Secret World of Arrietty

Déjà le printemps by Oriza L. Legrand: grass, fig leaf, mint, chamomile, orange blossom, clover, galbanum, vetiver, cedar, moss.
A sweet, green perfume representing the joys of a childhood spent outside.

Arashiyama by d’Annam: bamboo, rain, violet, grass.
In contrast to the complications of Arrietty’s world, Shō’s universe felt decidedly simpler (though, in reality, it contained just as much). Arashiyama is a devastatingly beautiful and fragile, almost tragic green perfume, with softly sweet, powdery undertones. Its melancholy and ephemeral nature aligns with Shō’s depression over his illness, just as its overwhelming beauty corresponds to the inner strength he uncovers after meeting Arrietty.

Hummingbird by Zoologist: lilac, cherry, pear, lily-of-the-valley, plum, apple, rose, violet leaf, citruses, honeysuckle, honey, mimosa, peony, tulip, ylang-ylang, whipped cream, musk, coumarin, moss, amber, sandalwood, white woods.
I like to imagine that Arrietty picked up the ingredients and made this perfume, herself. It is fresh, sweet, lively, deeply feminine, and oh-so-bright, but retains a laundry-like clean quality that renders it more exciting than the average floral. Arrietty was so much more than just a little girl, and I like that this perfume has so many notes, just as her character—and the existence of the borrowers, themselves—is quite multifaceted and intense.

Zucchero Filato by Kyse: cotton candy, red berries.
This perfume smells just like spun sugar. Representing the sugar cube, as well as the innocent sweetness of childhood friendship.

Smoky Mountain Mallow by Solstice Scents: smoke, marshmallow, guaiac wood, black tea, nutmeg, amber, labdanum.
Sweet, soft, and powdery: Arrietty’s family home smells like this. A warm, comforting place to come home to.

Spirited Away

Anonymity by Filigree & Shadow: bergamot, neroli, sweet orange, geranium, lavender, rosemary, juniper, cedar, sandalwood, violet leaf.
This perfume was inspired by the sensation of cleanliness, and feels wholly appropriate to represent the bathhouse, itself. Its notes have long been appreciated for their aromatic qualities, and so it has a timelessness to it that I think suits the spirit world very well. Let us also not overlook the relationship between the word Anonymity and the concept of No Face, themselves.

L’Île Pourpre by Les Liquides Imaginaires: ginger, angelica, shiso, bergamot, fig, artemisia, fenugreek, Ambroxan, cedar, cashmeran, whipped cream, patchouli.
When I was a young girl, this film absolutely terrified me, but I constantly revisited it because I was soooo enamored by Haku. L’Île Pourpre is one of those perfumes that smells deeply abstract, more than it smells like anything concrete that I could name. It makes me think of warmth, love, and protection, all the things I associate with Haku.

Steamed Rainbow by D.S. & Durga: blood mandarin, elemi, orange, grass, almond blossom, cedar, violet, vetiver.
This perfume smells like innocence, itself, and thus represents the transparent, simple pulse (Chihiro) that beats beneath the opaque maximalism the film uses to distract its viewer (Yubaba). This is Lin paddling Chihiro and the gang away from the bathhouse. This is the spirit train rolling over the water. This is Haku, as river spirit, saving a younger Chihiro from drowning. This is Chihiro lying in the car at the beginning, clutching her plastic pack of sweet peas.

Hexensalbe by Stora Skuggan: licorice, wormwood, angelica, rosemary, belladonna, tuberose, patchouli, black hemlock, oakmoss.
We like to categorize witches because otherwise they are too hard for us to understand. What I like about this perfume is the same thing I like about this movie: both invite us to ask ourselves what makes a good witch good and a bad witch bad. Hexensalbe is an ode to witches, and Spirited Away is a film that couldn’t function without them. Naturally, they belong together.

Black Eau de Toilette by Comme des Garçons: incense, black pepper, olibanum, birch, licorice, leather, Pepperwood, cedar, vetiver.
My favorite scene in the film is when Chihiro runs screaming down the stairs to the boiler room. I imagine the boiler room might smell a bit like Black, overwhelmingly smoky but achingly gorgeous, infinitely more special than other smoky perfumes. There is something in this fragrance that feels so safe to me, so like coming home. Maybe, it’s sort of like hugging your grandfather, or dancing with the soot sprites.

My Neighbor Totoro

Age of Innocence by Toskovat’: bubble gum, cotton candy, strawberry, gasoline, rubber, metal, rose, oud, cedar, vetiver, cade oil.

Rather than representing childhood and adulthood as separate, concrete experiences, My Neighbor Totoro shows us that children must often face adult experiences. Age of Innocence plays with this in-between space beautifully. It likewise creates a dynamic relationship between industry and nature, just as the film juxtaposes medicine and nature.

Sugi by Comme des Garçons: cypress, pepper, iris, cedar, pine, vetiver.

This softly woodsy scent is my choice for Totoro. Sugi smells something like a fantasy forest, where everything is clean and the dirt doesn’t stain your clothes. I think a hug from Totoro would smell just like that.

Little Flower by Régime des Fleurs: rose, pomelo, black currant, peony, black tea, honeysuckle, palo santo.

A bright, bracing, green rose for our girls Satsuki and Mei. Fruity and sweet, but cutting and stark. Fully alive, but on the precipice of something. A white picket fence with a gate that’s left wide open. This is the ingenue signature, the smell of coming of age.

Ume by Keiko Mecheri: plum, osmanthus, spices, mahogany wood, wisteria, patchouli, camellia, yellow mandarin, peony, oakmoss, hinoki, jasmine, peach blossom, persimmon, bergamot, pepper.

Ume is a perfect plum perfume, representing both the girls’ mother and the looming concepts of adulthood and womanhood. Ume is a deep, rich perfume, the kind of thing a little girl would smell and aspire to become.

I See the Clouds Go By by Floraïku: cassis, cherry blossom, white musk.

The scent of pure cherry blossom, the very definition of darling. I chose this perfume to represent the girls’ time with Totoro and those short, sweet days of childhood that somehow felt like they would last forever.

Princess Mononoke

Rock River Melody by Régime des Fleurs: green notes, ivy, galbanum, bergamot, narcissus, rose, cedar, amber, patchouli, musk, sandalwood.

Rock River Melody is a woodsy perfume anchored by an unexpected sweetness. Ashitaka’s character is noble until the end, and I think the sweetness of this perfume represents the beauty of his spirit particularly well. Though clearly green and forested, it is nearly gourmand, much in the way that Ashitaka, the literally cursed character, shows more compassion and kindness than any other.

La Fille de Berlin by Serge Lutens: rose, geranium, palmarosa, honey, moss, patchouli.

Given that San was quite literally raised by wolves, her character has a pronounced edge, but she also has a particularly pure soul as a result of her upbringing. La Fille de Berlin, a sharp, metallic rose that functions rather like a flowery spear, is just perfect.

La Rhapsodie Noire by Dusita: lavender, sage, broom, mimosa, jasmine, coffee, tobacco, rum, tonka bean, vanilla, oak, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, oakmoss.

The scent of a forest blackened, whether by night or by ash. La Rhapsodie Noire, Black Rhapsody, is the moment in time being depicted in Princess Mononoke. The clanging disharmony of industrialization, and the yet the relief of its inevitability.

Ching Shih by Marissa Zappas: osmanthus, incense, gunpowder, orris, myrrh, spices.
It was smelling this perfume that inspired me to make this post, for the image of Lady Eboshi that it brought to my mind was so strong. Soft, sweet powders with a truly brilliant gunpowder base. The iron fist in the velvet glove.

Ouranon by Aesop: lavender, elemi, petitgrain, hay, frankincense, chamomile, myrrh, patchouli, tonka bean.

Nature as an ancient being who has stories to whisper in your ear. This perfume represents the encounter with the Forest Spirit, the end of one era and the beginning of another.

Ponyo

Atlante by Sarah Baker: mineral notes, seaweed, yuzu, ambergris, driftwood, seashells, orris, lily-of-the-valley, cedar.

Atlante is a particularly adorable marine perfume. Though sincere in its depiction of the place where fish live, it presents them as shimmering jewels instead of stinking and scaly. Ponyo is very much an ode to this idea of the sea, as a soft place, as a home, even.

Petits et Mamans by Bulgari: rosewood, orange, bergamot, chamomile, sunflower, rose, powder, vanilla, iris, peach.

That the protagonists are effectively babies cannot be overlooked. I think Sosuke would smell like a clean little boy, doused in spritzes of Petits et Mamans by Yoshie and the other ladies at the nursing home.

Chiffon by Solstice Scents: vanilla, musk, lemon myrtle, amber.

Chiffon smells like the moment you open a bag of marshmallows, and that’s why I think it represents the love between Sosuke and Ponyo so beautifully. It is just too sweet to bear, in a good way.

Suspended Water Lily by SYD Botanica: seashells, melon, algae, water lily, ozonic notes, gardenia, salt, ginger, moss.

Ponyo’s spirit is simple and pure, propelled forward massively and solely by love for Sosuke. Suspended Water Lily is similarly dedicated to its mission of transporting its wearer to a universe of pastel ponds and candy-tailed mermaids. She would smell just like this: a sweet little girl, fresh from the sea.

Kiki’s Delivery Service

Harvest Mouse by Zoologist: chamomile, clove, orange blossom, bergamot, beer, hay, benzoin, opoponax, davana, rose, vanilla, sandalwood, Peru balsam, cedar, balsam fir, oakmoss.

I chose Harvest Mouse to represent Kiki’s home in the bakery with Jiji. The concept of home as a moveable notion rather than a solid place comes up a couple times in this film, so let’s say that this is the home she carries with her.

La Chasse aux Papillons by L’Artisan: lime blossom, tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom. 

Chasing butterflies is essentially Kiki’s life’s purpose, and this springtime floral perfume perfectly encapsulates the first part of the film, when Kiki is so excited about her future as a witch. If Insolence represents her sorrow, then La Chasse represents her joy.

Hot Cotton by Baruti: hot iron, musk.

I felt that Tombo should be included, but I don’t actually care about him, so I will instead be suggesting Hot Cotton as a perfume for the dirigible, The Spirit of Freedom!

Insolence by Guerlain: raspberry, red berries, bergamot, lemon, violet, rose, orange blossom, iris, tonka bean, resins, musk, sandalwood.

I am always drawn to Insolence when I want to portray a character as questioning her own goodness, her innocence. It is such a specifically teenaged perfume: passionate but melancholic. This is Kiki when she couldn’t fly.

Both Sides of Clouds by 4160 Tuesdays: bergamot, lemon, orange, blossom, iris, sandalwood, narcissus, lily-of-the-valley, vanilla, musk, oakmoss, chocolate, tonka bean.

This perfume is inspired by the Joni Mitchell song “Both Sides Now,” in which Joni sings that clouds can represent both happiness and sadness. Kiki’s story is essentially the same exact tale, a journey of literal highs and lows. The perfume is soft and billowy, like clouds are sometimes, but equally somber and restrained, like clouds are other times.

Blackbird by Olympic Orchids: blackberry, balsam fir, cedar, elemi, musk, hay, amber.

Blackbird is a deliciously free perfume, smelling of blackberries and sunshine. I think Ursula would actually think perfume is for try-hards but if she ever wore one, it would be Blackbird.

Not just any caveman — the chosen one. The one who volunteered to stay awake when the rest of the tribe curled up by the fire.

While they dream of mammoths and berries, I sit in silence, staring into the darkness. My eyes scan for danger — saber-toothed tigers, rival tribes, and suspicious guests who ask for an “extra breakfast voucher.”

The fire flickers. The night is cold. My eyelids are heavy. But I cannot rest. The tribe depends on me. I must keep the fire alive. I must ensure that Grug does not get eaten by a leopard before sunrise.

Sometimes I sip my coffee and feel the ancient spirit of the Night Watcher flow through me. The vending machine hums like the song of the tundra. The CCTV monitor glows like embers. And I realize — I was born for this.

I am not just a night shift worker.
I am the sentinel of the sleeping world.
I am the torchbearer of civilization.

My solution was always either coffee or a snack, both of which I'd just order on some delivery app. Sit there refreshing the tracking map, eat whatever showed up, feel slightly better for 20 minutes, then back to the fog.

Then one day the delivery fee was like $8 for a $4 coffee and I was like yeah no I'm not doing that. Walked to the store two blocks away instead.

By the time I got back I felt completely awake. Didn't even need the coffee honestly, I just drank it because I'd already bought it.

Turns out the afternoon slump wasn't about needing caffeine or food. It was about sitting in the same chair staring at the same screen for six hours straight. My body just needed to move for 10 minutes.

Now I use it as an excuse to walk somewhere every afternoon. Get a snack, mail something, literally anything. The task doesn't matter, it's just forcing myself to stand up and go outside for a bit.

And I'm saving like $200 a month on delivery fees which is nice I guess. But mainly it's just wild how much better my focus is in the second half of the day now.

So, I like to eat at my desk a lot. Most of what I drink is water from single-use plastic bottles.¹ Those usually just get thrown into my trash, so it's not really an issue.²³ However, I also tend to bring home coffees and drinks from drive thrus. Most of the time, they either don't get finished⁴ or still have water from ice, so there is remaining liquid in the cup. Here's where the problem lies. In order for me to throw the cups away, I have to bring them to my bathroom to dump the liquid first. But, in times of depression, I am generally too lazy/dysfunctional to remember to do that and the cups start to pile up. Eventually, they start congeal, mold, and/or turn into vinegar. This attracts fruit flies. Fruit flies have become a perpetual problem because of this. When I finally get the motivation, I now have to collect and dump a bunch of *FOUL* drinks and throw out the nasty cups. This usually causes a plume of fruit flies to erupt from the cups and fly all over the room. It's gross and a hazard. I'm sick of it getting to this point. I need a dysfunction-proof solution. One with only one simple step that I can do right away at my desk. I thought about a dump bucket, but that still requires me to dump a bunch of nasty smelly liquid eventually. I can't think of a solution that I will actually remember/be willing to do. Any suggestions?

Subnotes so I stay on point:
1. It's the only way I will remember to drink it unfortunately
2. I used to recycle them, but it's not feasible where I live. Yes, I hate it.
3. Well, it is an issue, but a separate one. Taking out the trash is an issue in and of itself.
4. Because I forget they exist 😅",0,1762631358.0,adhdwomen,2,0.5,False

The other night we made arrangements to get up early and game together for the day. So I set my alarm get up, - notice they’re online, send them a party invite - no response….okay maybe they’re still having their morning coffee or warming up - I hope off for an hour. I get back on and they’re still online and send an invite with a dm just saying hi how are you? No response.
Then I play a couple matches. Figure maybe they’re afk. Then I notice they join a party I request to join. (I have severe social anxiety so it’s a large group of people I don’t know apart from my friend) I only last a match because it stresses me out so much. I leave. A few hours pass by they haven’t sent a request or message or anything to say that they’ve changed their mind about our plans or whatever. Mind you it’s HOURS later. 

Any ways, this story started at 9 am and ended at 3 am the next day/night. When they finally responded saying oh I was just chilling. Like what? You were online that entire time and couldn’t just send me a quick message anything to say you weren’t in the mood or smth? While I’m sat online and then questioning if I’ve done something to upset you? If my social anxiety with your group of friends offends you? Or if you think it’s pathetic? 

Today, I messaged good morning (like we routinely do) and I’ve been told they’re not going to be online for long - two hours later they’re still online…..I’d much prefer them be honest with me and say I’ve upset them somehow or they don’t want to hang out, or outright say go away rather than me sat here questioning everything I’ve ever said or done.

Context: My wife is a pumpkin spice girl, while I am not a fan. She has a favorite pumpkin spice coffee we get every fall, but, for whatever reason, this year the smell that permeates the house when she brews a pot is absolutely awful to me. 

I’m AuDHD and my wife is at least autistic. We both have various sensory sensitivities, and are of course understanding of the other person’s. Lots of them are pretty easy to sidestep or compromise on.

But we’ve been together for over eleven years, and everything I know about her tells me that if I told her I was bothered by the coffee, when it’s something that only she enjoys, she would just never make it again. I really don’t want that, so I’m hoping that when I bring it to her attention I can already have some potential solutions worked out. 

I assume my best option is going to be basically drowning it out with a stronger smell. Neither of us uses perfumes or fragrances. Can anyone who uses essential oils speak to their efficacy when you’re basically sitting in an unpleasant scent for a couple hours?

I also would rather not introduce a scent into the area that’s going to affect/ruin her enjoying her coffee, so maybe I don’t have a ton of options other than hiding upstairs for a while…

The weird thing is I never had an incident like that in my entire life even if I clenched before.

Since then I've focused on stress management techniques and stopped using the guard (against my dentist's recommendation) and no incident since then. Unaware of any biting or tension TBH since then. Worried if this is bad long term though as everyone seems to encourage using it.

I love a pot of coffee in the AM (I have mild ADHD so coffee actually helps me). But I am considering eliminating this next if it contributes to night grinding I am unaware of.

I have been a coffee nerd myself for many years. My partner just started getting into espresso, specifically cortados. She would really like an espresso machine at home that she can do this herself.

She really wants it to have a built in grinder/tamping function. No idea why I have a very nice grinder at the house that I use with my Moccamaster. I believe she really wants to not have to worry about tamping.

She wants a milk frother built in too.

My budget is under 1k. Ideally I would like it to be 500-600 dollar max but I don’t really know this world well.

They'd put on low volume alternative music, a lot of people were kind of eccentric and you could easily talk to whoever. 
Since being in KC I've never really found a cozy spot like this. Chez Charlie came kind of close but it is pretty centered around groups playing darts.

I’ve read a lot of peoples posts relating to this type of behaviour and trigger responses so it might not seem that bad but it’s just such an anxiety driven response 

I think I remember making a decaf coffee around 12 o clock on Saturday night, and I may or may not have left a few coffee grinds, and I mean small amount of coffee on the bench. Anyway I’m still in bed and in the morning the first fucking thing I hear is. “Look at all this mess”. Now I have to listen to this person talking to herself in the kitchen about how I’m so messy and she will start doing this weird thing when she’s upset where she clears her throat in this specific way. It’s always been like this, and I get so worried I’m going to pass this stuff onto my eventual children. I’ve told myself all my life “I can never be like this to my kids”

But I realise that to live in this house I have to match these crazy standards she places on the cleanliness of the house that even a few crumbs or a few sugar crystals is enough to make her proclaim “LOOK AT ALL THIS MESS” and it instantly shoots a dagger right through my chest and creates this huge anxiety response where my chest feels funny. My dad is estranged and just overall a million times worse so that’s not an option. I have a work injury so can’t really move and housing is so expensive anyway.

It’s insane because sometimes she is aware of this behaviour but the woman runs off pure hyper vigilance and OCD type behaviours. I am not an angry person but man when she triggers me like this I just wanna throw hands. I fucking hate her. Even thinking about that state of mind I get in brings me that frustration immediately.

Despite having a well paying job himself, and working long hours at that job, he also moonlighted as an Uber driver, which I speculated might have been at least partly to help pay tithing. And he probably had a calling on top of all that, as he told coworkers about “volunteering at his church” on weekends. But despite all this - despite, to give an example, having stayed up all night Ubering and dealing with a sick child - he was unfailingly upbeat in how he presented himself, and would brag to coworkers about how he could stay up for two days without caffeine.

Having moved to the Northeast, he was now the only Mormon in his workplace, and he seemed to have trouble being outside the Mormon bubble and being among the heathens. He would get on his nevermo coworkers’ backs for consuming anything with caffeine in it - coffee/tea, energy drinks, soda, anything at all. And he would get visibly triggered at the mere mention of anything with alcohol. (Apparently he liked to lecture his intoxicated Uber passengers about the evils of drink. To his credit, at least he did give them water bottles.)

He also seemed to have some trouble being around people who obviously didn’t wear garments. Everyone’s well clothed in the workplace, of course, but you can still sometimes tell. And my boyfriend was sometimes known to wear polos that were not fully buttoned up, so you could see a bit of the top of his chest (oh scandal!!). A couple of times, Mormon Coworker offered to hook him up with what he called “the proper undergarments.” He said the same to other male coworkers as well. (At least he left the women alone.)

Now, my boyfriend is the nicest, most non-confrontational kind of person you can imagine, but Mormon Coworker struck him as annoyingly self-superior, to the point of being insufferable. (“Insufferable” is the word he used.) Whenever Mormon Coworker got to being a bit *too* insufferable, he (my boyfriend) got into the habit of “saluting“ him with his coffee mug, and finding opportunities to mention things like whisky and six-packs 🙃 I have no idea if anyone else did anything like this, but I suspect that Mormon Coworker didn’t make himself a lot of great friends around the office.

Apparently Mormon Coworker and his family ended up moving back to Utah. I guess living among heathens like my boyfriend was just too much for them 🤷‍♀️

As I said to my boyfriend when he told me all this, I do kinda feel bad for the guy. While he may have been a piece of work, he was what his religion made him. (And little else, seemingly.) He was probably secretly dying inside from overwork (partly to pay tithing), he may or may not have had a happy marriage, he was far from where he’d grown up and was experiencing huge culture shock, and I suspect he had lots of pent-up jealousy and anger over seeing his nevermo coworkers living without the stifling constrictions on his own existence….And due to toxic positivity culture, he was not allowed to show *any* sign of any of it. Yikes.

I’ve seen a lot of weird stories on this sub, but I’m not sure I’ve ever heard of a TBM trying to get nevermos to wear garments. I mean, I suppose it’s *possible* that he just meant he knew about some non-LDS undershirts that his coworkers could buy, but I doubt it. When a TBM tries to tell nonmembers about “the proper undergarments,” I think it’s pretty clear what they’re referring to.

If not for the underwear thing, I don’t think I’d be making this post - the story, while kinda sad, is also fairly run-of-the-mill around here. But I thought y’all might be interested in hearing about the TBM who tried to turn nevermos on to garments 😁",13,1762630603.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

However, here women (maybe Vietnamese in general?) like to chat A LOT. For me, if you chat it destroys the charm of the courting process. I'm always one for in person meetings.

1ory9dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ory9dv/he_wants_to_meet_me_again_after_a_year_we_were/,He wants to meet me again after a year. We were coworkers for a short time.,"Hello everyone,

I really need some advice urgently. I’ll try to explain my situation as briefly as possible:

Almost exactly two years ago, I (23F) met a coworker (29M) during my job training at this workplace. The whole thing lasted only about 10 weeks and was more like an internship. He was responsible for me, so we spent a lot of time together at work. But the thing was there was a connection between us back then like the chemistry just clicked, at least that’s how it felt to me. I really liked him, and I think he liked me too. That became especially clear to me at the company party (towards the end of those 10 weeks), where he practically threw his arms around me. He hugged me really tightly and affectionately (I can go into more detail if anyone wants). Sure, there was alcohol involved, but for me, that moment kind of changed everything.
And of course, I fell in love.

When my internship there ended, I had to leave the workplace with a heavy heart, and I really struggled with heartbreak. But we still kept in touch sporadically. He would check in every now and then we’d talk on the phone or text sometimes. About a year ago, I finally gathered all my courage and asked him to meet me for a coffee. That meeting did happen, but honestly, it was awful. The vibe was weird, and then all of a sudden, he started talking about his girlfriend, and I basically died inside. I had really been hoping for something. After that, I fell into a pretty deep emotional hole. I was really not doing well. But after about half a year, I managed to process the disappointment fairly well.

So, recently, it was my birthday, and of course, he remembered. We had almost no contact for a year, since that coffee date that went so badly for me. I thanked him for the birthday wishes and said that I appreciated that he still remembered after all this time (which I honestly don’t take for granted). And he just replied, “of course.” Then, the next day, he suddenly wants to meet up for coffee again. he texted, „I must have a lot to tell him“. I’ve finished my training and started my first full-time job, so maybe that’s what he wants to talk about… but I have no idea.

I really don’t know if I should agree to meet him. I still like him so much. But when I think about how miserable I was last year because of him, I feel like I can only say no. I also don’t see him as just a platonic friend. I have this feeling that it will backfire and I’ll end up regretting it deeply.
On the other hand, there’s also that thought, what if he’s changed his perspective now, and I miss my chance? Would I regret that for the rest of my life?

I need advice. Why would he want to meet me again..? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

TL;DR he wants to meet me after a year of no contact. I’ve been in love with him for two years. A year ago he broke my heart. Now he wants to meet again. I’m not sure what to do.",1,1762630295.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I have recently done the via survey, (personality test,that shows your character strengths)

My top character strengths are:
Kindness, curiosity, humility, appreciation for beauty & excellence

So i have difficulty differentiating between, kindness, caring, saving someone and being sexually attracted to someone.

Overr the past few weeks I have been attending some in person adhd support groups in my city.

I have started to get very friendly with a girl that also goes there. Whenever we have one to one conversations there is chemistry and I'm very relaxed around her. When we are standing and chatting I've noticed that there is lots of mirroring, so I know if it's chemistry or mirroring.

I've finally almost completely recovered from burnout and I'm far more happier than I have over the past few years. I'm currently taking an extended break ( one year ) to focus on myself and not be entirely focused on my career. It has been a great idea. 

She is also on a career break and considering switching careers. So over the past few weeks, she and I have been meeting up for coffees, and these would typically last for about 2 hours, maybe more.

There has not been anything more than long chats, nothing more than that in terms of intimacy.


The issue I have is that I don't want to tell her how I feel about her. Because she is at a point in her life where she is trying to figure out what career she wants and I don't want to add to her troubles.


Also she is currently in a relationship and I don't want to mess with her head.


She really enjoys these in person adhd events and I fear that if I tell her how I feel, she will feel awkward around me at these events and she will be more hesitant about going to these events.

I'm just terrified that someday in the future, I will see her with her boyfriend and I will be devastated, because I will realise  that I'm attracted to her.


In the past when I was in serious relationships, I would prioritise my significant other and if I was dating her I would do the exact same thing again.


So what should I do ?


Should I tell her how I feel or focus on myself ?

1ory69e,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofone/comments/1ory69e/what_the_positive_and_negative_path_is/,What the positive and negative path is.,"First understand a system. You input x into a system, it than processes said information to output s.

Example, the human system. You input food, it gets processed and some turns to energy and other important things for life. While the rest turns to shit, literally. 

While the earth system, we humans are apart of it's process. We aren't separate from it at this current moment. So is there a system that exiests outside of other systems? 

There also another important thing to take note of. Unless an system is infinite, there is a limit to how much any system can processes, not to mention a limit on inputs and outputs. 

Take your eyes. They try to capture all the light that comes to pass. But with something bright like the sun, you seen nothing else but that. Your inputs are overhelmed preventing anything else from entering your visual inputs. 

With your stomach much is the same, but it has another thing working for it, storage. Storage is just empty space in a system to put x in befor processing. Storage only helps with non consistent sources of an input. 

Input<output. This is the negative path. This is a value of what you output over what you input. If you want to eat an apple it doesn't matter were you get it from. Be it from a tree, a baby or even from a pile of shit.

Input>output. This is the positive path. If you want an apple you'll have conditions for when you'll eat one. Like not grabbing one from a pile of shit. 

Input=output. This is the neutral path. It shouldn't really be focused on. It just means it inputs the same amount of stuff as outputs. 

How many input and outputs one has is rather I'll relevant. Its just what you rather deal with. The important part is how do you process said information.

Input>output you process what you take in filtering out uneeded things. Like coffee, you take the coffee but not the beans.

Input<output. What you take in doesn't matter you focus on processing what you get into what you want. You'll get water and coffee beans so the processing for coffee needs to happen within your system. 

Input=ouput. This is a coffee machine. It in takes water and coffee beans and outputs coffee. With it being equal there isn't room for consciousness to exist. 

With both positive and negative there is room for consciousness but in different ways. But positive path can reach the highest densitys. This is because they filter out everything thats unneeded. Thus systems are made that only have what is needed. 

Higher densitys systems for a negative path to exiest on it, they need to give up how they process chaos. But their consciousness relies on this processing. Remove it and their whole will break. Think of it like a fat person on the plane. On a plane with huge seats no problem. But higher densitys the seats get smaller requiring more room. A large pig won't fit unless it takes more than one. 

This may sound like I'm shitting on the negative path. But know this everything exists because of the negative path. 

With output=input. The coffee machine will only make coffee once the needed ingredients are given. Everything else will bounce off. Output<input, everything will bounce off but the coffee itself. Input<output, doesn't matter what it takes in, it will process anything to make coffee.

In other words the positive path can exist because the negative path processes everything for them. ",1,1762630085.0,lawofone,0,1.0,False

1ory4lq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ory4lq,Probably the Most Important Mechanic in Our Entire Book,"So in Dream Goddess Chronicles, one of the biggest challenges was figuring out how many days should pass when our protagonist, Coco, leaves the Dream World. The formula goes like this: Coco writes during the daytime a la Diary of a Wimpy Kid -> She goes into Dream World where we see from the perspective of her Teddy Bear Priest -> Coco writes HER perspective. Rinse, wash, repeat.

  
One day is TOO quick, so we settled on ""three days later"" (we also thought it was a perfect reference to Jesus coming back in 3 days). A lot can happen, allowing the dream characters to have their own arcs. 

We then had to figure out how long Coco would be in the Dream World. This one was REALLY tricky, until I came up with the solution that no matter if she sleeps for thirty minutes or five months... **it'll always be for 24 hours.**

It's funny seeing readers speculate how they work like one of them was like ""Wait so what if she wakes up for a brief moment in the morning, then falls back into sleep?"". I know the coma question will pop-up which is why I brought up ""or five months""

I WILL SAY THOUGH, PROBABLY THE MOST ANNOYING THING WE STUMBLED UPON WAS WTF THE DOES THE **SCHEDULE FOR THE DREAM WORLD LOOK LIKE?**

Time moves three-times faster and Coco is established to be a chronic sleeper... unless we keep track of everytime she sleeps we're pretty much screwed.

  
We did eras similar to ""BC"" and ""AD"". So before Coco appeared in the Dream World is ""BCC"". That one is more loosey goosey, but we do come up for year ranges like ""Ehhhh about 15-year ish"". ACC is ""After Coco"", which is Coco's adventures from 7-13. That one whenever we reference a date or an event, we make concrete years for that. Then there's ""After Yu'Chri"" (with Coco celebrating Yu'Chri, her teddy bear being her new writer, by restarting the era after him) where it's literally just the dates featured in the book. We also had to figure out how each alien in Coco's head ages.

It was one of those times when Bill preferred not to go outside because of how cold it was, but Tracy wanted his porch smoke. 

“Here.” Bill tossed him the Marlboros as he stepped out. Tracy barely caught it with the edges of his palms. 

“Jesus, Bill…”

“Sorry.”

Tracy handed him a cigarette. “So I wasn’t exactly in the mood today, but…nature calls.”

“Nature calls?” Bill took a long drag and looked at Tracy. “I’m not sure that makes any sense to me.”

“You’re not good with words like I am.”

“Alright.”

The sun started going down and mosquitoes came out. Tracy stayed quiet other than the occasional wet snort Bill mostly tuned out. 

“I can’t remember the last time I saw Delaney,” Tracy said after a bit.

“No?”

“No, not really.” 

Bill stubbed out his cigarette. He was done. He clasped his hands over the porch railing. Tracy side-eyed him. 

“Another?” Bill asked. 

Tracy nodded once and told him ‘yeah.’ Bill tossed him the pack. “Thanks.” 

Tracy nursed the second cigarette before letting out a long sigh. “Yeah, no,” he said. 

“No?”

“I don’t remember.” 

“Oh.”

Tracy wagged the cigarette in between two fingers. “Just remember Gene telling me she’d done the rolling around in the closet for a few days before,” he said.

“Rolling around in the closet? What does that mean?”

“You know, rolling around in the closet.”

“I really don’t know what that means,” Bill said.

Tracy sighed. “I can’t really explain what he said. She’d been rolling around in her bedroom closet crying, I guess. Rolling around on the floor.”

Bill was quiet. The wind started to pick up, and he could hear the chimes on the other side of the house. 

Tracy turned and looked at him again. Then he looked at his hand with the cigarette, and then again back at Bill. “You aren’t going to say anything?”

“I don’t really know what to say,” Bill said.

“Anything at all.” Tracy flicked ash and put the cigarette back to his mouth.

“I don’t know, man. Discussing the details seems pointless.”

“Mm.” Tracy’s eyes wandered sideways. “Well, I wanted to discuss the details, I guess, I don’t know.” He started wagging the cigarette again. “Sorry I brought it up.” He kept on wagging for a minute, then stopped. “Honestly, Bill, I’m getting tired of your god damned attitude.”

Bill didn’t say anything.

Tracy continued, “Your god damned attitude. Your god damned attitude. I can’t—“ He paused. “I can’t imagine how she felt when Aubrey finally said whatever it was that threw her off. Probably some, ‘You know what, Delaney, I don’t think this is working anymore, I need to stay professional.’ Aubrey’s never been professional, Bill. He’s a fucking con.”

Bill coughed on swallowed-wrong spit. The chimes went on.

“He’s a fucking con.”

Bill let out a long whistle and turned to go back in the house.

“You’re leaving already?” Tracy put out the cigarette and turned to face Bill. 

“Yes, I’m leaving. I’m not doing this right now.” Bill let the screen door fall shut behind him and wandered into the kitchen. 

Tracy went up to the screen. “You’re not doing this right now?”

“No.”

“You know, Bill, I’ve got to do this every day for the rest of my damned life because of your con dad. Your dad’s the biggest liar I’ve met in my life.” Tracy lit another cigarette. He took a drag and hacked.

“Goodnight, Tracy. I’m going to bed. Keep the pack.”

Tracy paced back and forth a few times. “‘I don’t need to smoke, I have self-restraint!’” He paced some more. “‘I’m better and smarter than everyone else!’ No, you’re not, Bill. You’re an idiot.” Bill crossed his arms and stared at the fridge. 

It was quiet after that besides a cricket chirping somewhere in the ceiling. Bill stayed put. He could see Tracy sat with his back up to the door for a while before he got up, tossed the pack at the door, and left.

The sun was down now. Bill opened and closed the fridge door several times before he started untying his shoes.

Aubrey pulled into the driveway. The lemon he drove made a decent amount of noise that would usually give Bill an extra few seconds to hide whatever magazines he’d brought out. There were no magazines today. 

Aubrey just grunted when he came through the door. That’s usually how it was. He’d glance over at Bill, make some kind of acknowledgement noise, and then go and rummage around in the fridge. Today wasn’t much different, other than him not rummaging long before giving Bill some kind of look.

“…What?”

Aubrey sighed. “There’s no stew,” he said. “I thought we had stew left over.”

“Um…I don’t know.” Bill put his feet up on the coffee table. “Last I saw there was some in there.”

“Well, I’m not seeing it. Either somebody ate it or it disappeared into thin air.”

“Well, I didn’t eat it, so I don’t know what to tell you.”

Aubrey closed the fridge. “Bill…” He rubbed his chin. Neither of them said anything for the next minute until Aubrey told him, “I need you to go to the store.”

“Alright.”

“I need you to get those small potatoes, and bacon, and coffee. Can you remember all that?”

“Yes.”

“Are you sure? Because last time you got the wrong potatoes and forgot half of what I asked you to get.”

“Yes, I can remember three things.”

“Do I need to write you a list?”

Bill just got up from the couch and walked out. The sun was setting now and much of the sky was a shade of brown he didn’t usually see.",1,1762629891.0,writingcritiques,0,0.99,False
1ory39e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinteresttrends/comments/1ory39e/massive_giveaway_viral_growth_secrets_transform/,🚨 Massive Giveaway + Viral Growth Secrets: Transform Your “Invisible” Store Into a Traffic Magnet! ✨,"**Top On Massive Giveaway Alert**  

Ever feel like your beautiful online store is *invisible*—floating in a sea of a million others? You’ve got the products, the vision, maybe even the brand aesthetic nailed down… but when it comes to getting the right *eyes* on your store? It’s like shouting into the void.  

Here’s How!  
🔗 [Click here to join instantly!](https://moneykerb.com/courses/)  

Let’s be real—traffic is easy, but *targeted* traffic? That’s a whole different game. The kind that converts. The kind that actually makes sense.  

At first, I thought the secret was just *more content*. More posts, more ads, more effort. But the truth is, it’s about clarity—strategy that magnetizes your **ideal customers** instead of random drive-bys.  

So, let’s break this down.  

- **Define your audience like you're writing their dating profile.** Not ""anyone who likes fashion,"" but “twenty-something creatives who prefer sustainable fabrics, live on iced coffee, and scroll Pinterest every night before bed.” Precision = resonance.  
- **Stop trying to be everywhere.** Instead, go deep where your people truly hang out. TikTok and Pinterest aren’t just visuals—they’re search engines powered by emotion. Post content that *answers questions* your customers didn’t even know they had.  
- **Data is your compass.** Use analytics like breadcrumbs. Which posts hit engagement peaks? What product pages they linger on? That’s free insight you can’t buy in a masterclass.  
- **Build your funnel like a story.** Social post → lead magnet → personalized email → irresistible offer. Each step should feel like a conversation that naturally leads to *yes*.  
- **Influencer collabs = modern word-of-mouth.** Not necessarily mega-stars! Micro-creators (2K–10K followers) often bring higher conversions because they connect *authentically.*  

But here’s the twist: even the best marketing plan fails if your brand voice sounds robotic. Targeted traffic isn’t just algorithm-driven… it’s vibe-driven. People don’t buy *products*, they buy **trust + identity alignment**.  

I’m still slightly confused, though—like, why doesn’t every tutorial mention that *timing* actually matters?  
Post in the evening when your audience scrolls.  
Run ads *right after* an organic traffic spike.  
Even answer DMs as fast as humanly possible. It all compounds.  

- Test.  
- Tweak.  
- Talk to your audience like human friends—not data points.  

🎁 And if you’re serious about dialling it in, check out the link above. It’s like plugging your store into a system where visibility meets conversion, *minus the fluff.*  

Now I’m curious—what’s actually worked for you in bringing real, curious, buy-ready traffic to your store?  
Because half of this is strategy… and half is alchemy.",1,1762629877.0,pinteresttrends,0,1.0,False

Total investment: $50. Here's how.**

I've been reading r/passiveincome for a year, and everyone talks about Amazon KDP as passive income. But actually WRITING books? That was the blocker for me.

Last month I tested using AI to generate books. Here's my complete breakdown.

**My Background:**

* Zero writing experience
* Full-time job (software dev)
* Goal: Side income, not quit-my-job money

**Books Published (October 2024):**

1. ""Meal Prep for Beginners"" (non-fiction, 35K words)
2. ""50 Campfire Stories for Kids"" (fiction, 25K words)
3. ""Home Organization Hacks"" (non-fiction, 30K words)

**Cost Breakdown:**

* AI tool subscription: $14.99/month (KDPBot - 5 books/month)
* Stock photos for covers: $0 (used AI-generated)
* KDP ISBN: $0 (free from Amazon)
* Editing: $20 (Grammarly Premium, already had it)
* Beta reader (friend): $15 (coffee + gratitude)
* **Total: $50**

**Time Investment:**

* Book generation: 45 min each = 2.25 hours
* Editing/polishing: 3 hours per book = 9 hours
* Cover design: 30 min each = 1.5 hours
* KDP upload: 30 min each = 1.5 hours
* **Total: 14.5 hours**

**Revenue (First 30 Days):**

* Meal Prep book: $287 (154 sales @ $2.99 = $210 royalty)
* Campfire Stories: $132 (71 sales @ $2.99)
* Home Organization: $68 (36 sales @ $2.99)
* **Total: $487**

**Profit: $437 (first month)**

**Hourly rate: $30/hour** (not bad for a side hustle)

**What worked:**

* Chose high-demand, low-competition niches (used Publisher Rocket)
* Priced at $2.99 for 70% royalty
* Simple covers (AI-generated worked fine)
* Focused on practical content (how-to, lists, actionable advice)

**What didn't work:**

* First book took forever (learning curve)
* One cover was too generic (redesigned it)
* Forgot to fact-check AI stats (had to update book)

**Realistic expectations:**

* This is NOT ""push button get rich""
* You need to edit AI content (important!)
* Marketing matters (I ran $30 AMS ads)
* Results vary by niche

**Month 2 plan:**

* Publish 5 more books (using remaining free credits)
* Reinvest $200 in AMS ads
* Goal: $1,000/month by end of Q1

**Key lesson:** AI tools removed the ""I can't write"" excuse. Now success depends on niche research and marketing - skills I can learn.

Happy to share my niche research process or answer questions!

1ory2wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenofDeadParents/comments/1ory2wn/dad_moved_on_too_quickly_and_i_feel_shut_out_of/,Dad moved on too quickly and i feel shut out of my family,"My parents were so in love. Movie type love. My dad was incredible with my mom bringing her home made coffee to the hospital every morning, washing her hair and styling it for her, shaving her legs. Doing everything he possibly could for her. The nurses always even all commented on what a great husband he was. 

it’s always been me, my mom and my dad. we were so close. i was an only child and i spent my whole life hanging out with my parents. i’m 32 now but i lived at home and mainly hung out with my parents until i was in my 20’s. after my mom passed i was still very very close with my dad. taking care of him and making sure he stayed busy and was doing okay. he was my main priority the last 2 years, more than myself. 

Fast forward to now: My mom passed 2 years ago from cancer. In June of this year (so a year and a half) i had a feeling he was trying to date by piecing little things together, like him asking me for good pictures of himself. obviously he wanted them for dating sites. From June until October I had my suspicions but honestly just ignored it because i couldn’t deal with that. Finally mid October he said to me: 

“You don’t mind if i hang out with a friend right” 
to which I said “why would i care” (i immediately knew what he was getting at but i wanted him to say it)  “like go on walks or to the movies” so i said “why would i care if you hang out with your friends” and he said “like a girl” and i said to him that i don’t care what he does that’s fine i want him to be happy but to keep me out of it. we live our separate lives and that’s that. i don’t want to know about his dating. 

we didn’t speak of it again until a few weeks later in late October when he asked me if i would take some time to find a day to go out to dinner and meet her. to which i completely freaked out on him. i said absolutely not. and he told me my ENTIRE family has met her (as if that was going to make it any better?) it made things worse that i was the last to find out about her. i said no again and he called me childish. 

now fast forward to a week later, my uncle shared a post on facebook that was a video of my whole family out at a brewery and i was curious why they all went out and clicked it. WELL…. the video was posted by my dad’s new girlfriend. i accidentally stumbled upon her facebook. little to my knowledge they had been seeing each other since JULY. she’s posted an endless amount of photos of them together. she’s been hanging out with my dead mothers best friends. going on vacations with them. she’s been just completely inserting herself into my family going out to weekly dinners with my aunts & uncles. the part that absolutely killed me. she was sitting in my mom’s chair at the table in my childhood home posting photos of the dinners her and my dad cooked together.

i feel SO alone. i feel like everyone in my family my aunts, uncles, even my parents best friends who i refer to as aunts & uncles all went behind my back. they all kept this major secret from me for 5 months?? i know they are all in an awkward position but it doesn’t make it okay to me that they just accepted her and so easily replaced my mother without even considered me and my feelings. 

today my dad is leaving for a trip to Florida with this woman and on top of that now today i find out my dad is planning to bring this woman, WHO I HAVENT MET YET. to my family’s thanksgiving. no one has even told me this yet. my cousin texted my partner and i saw the text on their phone.. 

i just feel so horrible because i want my dad to be happy but this is way too soon and the way he and my entire family is going about it makes me feel like i dont matter. i keep going back and forth with my feelings thinking i should suck it up then telling myself i’m entitled to my feelings. i dont know.

i’ve already felt so alone in my grief. i don’t have siblings. i don’t have many friends. my family clearly doesn’t have my best interest. i’ve just never felt so badly in my life.

if you read all this, thank you. if you don’t that’s okay. it felt good to get out. i miss my mom so much every single second of the day. i really just spend most of my time wishing i could just be with her. ",3,1762629856.0,ChildrenofDeadParents,2,1.0,False

• Rent-a-friend Mikaela? They used to hang out all the time, now nothing. 

• Her brother? They hung out intensively and now nothing. Feels like they had a falling out. 

• Her lake dips and sauna? Used to be routine, haven’t seen her sweaty selfies it in a hella’ while.

• Her tea ceremonies? Used to wake up and do them? Another fad that she made her whole identity? 

• Her gym workouts? She was so quick to contact Swedish media to inform them about her new transition to gym-persona. She hasn’t been to the gym in month. Bored? 

• Her dad? She used to mention him a lot in the beginning of her move to Sweden. Another fallout? Or did he cut her off? 

• Her ducks. For the love of life, what happened to her ducks? Please don’t tell me she ate them or got rid of them? 

• Her herbal obsession? I’m guessing she got bored. 🥱 

• Astrology readings? She was preaching forever about what a natural she was. Now nothing. 

• Her pottery? Didn’t she buy a super expensive pottery wheel and now nothing. Wasn’t she a natural? 

• Dennis coffee stand? Did they get bored? 

• Dennis rental business ? Wasn’t he managing houses on her dad’s property ?

• Her and her family’s meaty protocol? Got bored? Body healed by now?

• Her Swedish podcast? Are they still podding? 

Also some random gossip: Olivia has no actual job. She lives off her dad’s wealth. Remember the children’s clothing rental she worked with? Hyber. That was her dad’s company. How else can you afford to buy a huge house with no solid income? I’m sure her husband has an income but it’s definitely her dad’s money financing her life. But she loves to give off this humble persona who cares about the world. She’s just as spoilt of a brat as Snakel. 

Oh and her mom: Defo wasn’t THAT poor during Snakel’s childhood. She just wasn’t as rich as her dad.

I’m sorry but it’s so obvious that Snakel has some serious mental health issues. Trying to fill the void in her life with new personas, new shiny stuff, anything to fill her empty, narcissistic soul. She (and the gullible minority) is the only one hyping her up with new things that never fall through.

1orxzjo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orxzjo,I might have gone overboard. I built a custom LLM for my .env extension... and now I just shipped a massive UI overhaul for it.,"Hey everyone,

So, I have this project, `dotenvy`.

It started as a simple tool because I was tired of manually swapping `.env` files and *terrified* of accidentally committing a secret. The first version (1.0.0) was fine—it had a switcher, a diff view, and some basic pre-commit hooks.

...But then I got obsessed with the secret-detection part.

I felt like the standard regex/entropy checks just weren't good enough. So... I kind of lost my mind. I decided to build **my own custom Large Language Model (LLM)** for it. From scratch.

It's a 4-layer transformer model built in Python, served via FastAPI, with 14-dimensional feature extraction. It gives sub-100ms, real-time AI secret detection that's way more accurate than just checking for ""high entropy.""

The problem? The tool became *insanely* powerful, but the UI was a complete mess. It was just a long, confusing list of features.

**So, today, I'm shipping v1.1.0.** This update is 100% focused on making all that power *actually usable.*

* **🎨 All-New Tabbed Interface:** I threw out the old UI. It’s now organized into clean tabs: **Overview, Environments, History, & Settings.**
* **🌳 History Tree View:** You can now see all your environment changes in a clean, collapsible tree. (This is the first step to a full Git-like rollback system).
* **🏷️ Smart Groups:** It now intelligently groups your `.env` files (local, dev, staging, prod) instead of just dumping them in a flat list.

I'm a solo dev building this entire thing (the TypeScript extension, the Python AI backend, the ML model) all by myself, and it's all open-source.

I would honestly just love to know what you think. Is the new UI actually better? Is the custom LLM feature total overkill, or is it something you'd actually use?

You can grab it here:

* **Marketplace:** [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FreeRave.dotenvy)
* **GitHub (and the LLM code):** [GitHub](https://github.com/kareem2099/dotenvy)

P.S. I've got GitHub Sponsors enabled on the repo. I'm pouring thousands of hours into these tools (this, DotCommand, Break Bully...) trying to make it a real living. If this tool saves your company from *one* secret leak, maybe throw me a coffee? 😉

Our boss is retiring and closing his business soon, so my coworker and I will be starting our own company very shortly.

We both share the same values and plan to donate a percentage of our profits **once the business is financially stable and sustainable.** Right now, we’re brainstorming the types of causes we’d like to support:

* Environmental programs (such as replanting forests, restoring wildlife habitats, and protecting clean water sources)
* Animal welfare (including rescues, support for homeless / senior dogs, adoption or rehabilitation programs)
* Community rebuilding efforts (like disaster recovery)

We really want our donations to actually make an impact, so we’re **looking for organizations that are hands-on, trustworthy and transparent**. Preferably **smaller or U.S.-based** groups where funds don’t disappear into admin costs or legal fees.

Now, we’re in the construction field: we create coordination drawings that contractors use to install systems in the field. I know our line of work isn’t usually seen as ""green"". **I do worry that we may lose some potential clients who might frown upon it**, especially for people who see environmental or social causes as unnecessary or ""not their thing"". Our intentions are genuinely good, we just want to help make a positive impact on the world around us.

So, I'm looking for opinions and suggestions:

* Do you think we could lose potential customers with this donation idea, especially considering our field?
* Any ideas for organizations to donate towards?
* And do you know of any everyday items (like coffee or tea brands), where profits go towards good causes? (for example: *Grounds & Hound*s, *Flip Coffee*)

Yes, I heard it all. Steep learning curve, studying, flash cards, etc. I've heard it will be hard, and you should always ask questions and do your part. 

But I've not been liking it so far. And once holidays are over, I plan to quit. It's not just the fact that the drinks and pumps are difficult to conceptualize, but it's also the fact that my manager is low-key someone who makes the environment hard to learn and grow in, and who uses passive aggression and condescension to get his points across. When he's not that way, he's very considerate. When he is, he's a fucking tool.

My coworkers are very cool. But I always feel like I'm in the way of them. I'll know something and feel confident in it the first day then the next thing I no, turns out I needed cold foam, turns out I pumped too much syrup, turns out I didn't work quick enough.

And the SEQUENCING. One day I'll be like, I got this! The next, nope. Not at all. 

And the holiday rush has been so taxing, and it makes me dread coming into work. Before Bux, I was working retail, and while I hated the hours, the work wasn't too bad and it was much more slower pace.

My partner said that it would probably be best for me to quit and go local. But wouldn't the same problems I had here find me locally? I'm sure you have to learn all kinds of things locally, and be an expert on coffee as a barista. But she said it would be slower paced than the fast food standards of Starbucks.

Idk...I'll stick it out for the holidays (I won't like it though), but for partners who have quit or thought about quitting to do local coffee shops, how did that work out for you? Did you adjust? Is it still that learning curve, or do you recommend I go back to retail?

My partner and I broke up almost three weeks ago. We were together more than 10 years. That morning she called me while I was recovering from an appointment with an ear, nose, and throat doctor. My whole mouth and nose were numb, and I had a bad headache. When I picked up, I said “What?” in an irritated tone. She told me she knew I had been cheating on her.

My heart sank because what she said was true. I admitted it.

That moment forced me to face the patterns and pain I’ve been trying to understand for months in therapy. Back in June, after being out of work for almost a year, I started a new job and began seeing a psychiatrist who specializes in childhood trauma and sexual abuse. They’re also my primary therapist. Our sessions are long and deep, focused on unpacking years of pain, shame, and the survival behaviors I learned early on.

I’ve been realizing how much of what I do comes from exhaustion, from always trying to manage emotional pain instead of actually living. I wanted to be a better partner. I loved her deeply and cared about her more than I ever showed. I was trying to be present and not live stuck in the past, but the pain I carried made me afraid to be honest, to say what I needed, or to ask what she needed. For years, I’ve wanted to tell her, “I want you in my life. Let’s figure out a solution together.” But instead of saying that out loud, I stayed quiet. I thought I was protecting both of us, but really I was just creating more distance.

She never knew the full story of what I went through. I only talked about it in vague ways because even saying the words brought up too much. One time, when I showed her the neighborhood where I grew up, I couldn’t even point to my actual house. The memories were that bad. I pointed to the one across the street instead.

I never slept with anyone else. The only time anything physical happened was one kiss. She kissed me, and I ran away almost immediately, scared and ashamed.

During COVID, when we were apart a lot, the isolation hit me hard. I started to go numb again. I’d sometimes go out just to have conversations with people. It wasn’t romantic or sexual. I just wanted to feel something.

The first time it happened was at a coffee shop during lockdown. I was sitting outside in the cold, drinking a cappuccino, completely zoned out. A woman sat across from me and started talking, and out of nowhere this intense wave of anxiety hit me. But in that moment, I actually felt something again. It was uncomfortable, but it meant I wasn’t numb.

Every once in a while after that, I’d chase that feeling, not with relationships, but with one off short conversations that made me feel alive for a moment. It was this novel feeling I couldn’t get from my partner, friend (even a new one), or family. It was temporary relief from everything buried underneath. A coping mechanism that felt harmless at first, but it wasn’t.

Looking back, I can see how those choices created distance and confusion. She felt something was off even when I didn’t say anything. I thought I was managing my pain quietly, but really I was spreading it.

I’ve been searching for ways to open a dialogue with my ex. I’ve sent her a long email and a voice memo explaining things in much more specific terms, how I hurt her, what I’m doing, and taking responsibility. I wanted her to know I feel real remorse and that I’m giving her space to process. I know her self-respect and breaking trust is a bridge too far. I don’t expect anything, but I hope that in time we can reconnect in whatever way feels right.

Now, in therapy, I’m connecting all the pieces, the trauma I’ve avoided, the maladaptive ways I’ve coped, and how those patterns have shown up in my relationships. I wasn’t trying to betray anyone. I was trying to survive feelings I didn’t know how to face. But survival mode still causes damage, and that’s what I have to take responsibility for if I want to heal and show up differently next time.",0,1762629399.0,GuyCry,1,0.5,False

I took over this persons lease and asked some questions about the roommate and she said she seemed nice. Since I moved in it’s been actual hell. She leaves her dishes in the sink for days and sometimes uses my dishes and washes them horribly. Recently she put a package of raw chicken in the ice tray in the freezer. She will leave wet clothes in the washer/ dryer for days. We have had some maintenance issues since we moved in and she never puts in a service request and leaves that up to me. She eats all of her meals either in her room or at the coffee table we have in living room and always leaves crumbs behind. She owns a broom but I’ve never seen her sweep. I’m the only one who cleans around the shared area of the apartment. Before we moved in we did talk a little bit about having people over but it’s gotten out of hand. She has her friends over all the time at least twice a week and her significant other is over all the time as well. She doesn’t text me to let me know when people are coming over and when they do they stay at our apartment for hours and are super loud. Last weekend she invited her significant other over and when i woke up the next morning I saw their shoes and connected the dots that they slept over. That was the last straw for me. I don’t know how to talk about this with her because I’ve had to gentle parent her since I’ve moved in. At this point I’m thinking of moving out. ,2,1762629324.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

At that time, I was confident it was just a fissure because my stool was large and it felt like passing sharp glass. This has been happening about every two months. My doctor confirmed it was indeed a fissure and prescribed a laxative for one month. However, after a few days, I saw blood again. I realized I had been straining and it was uncomfortable to pass stool. To be sure, my doctor ordered an ultrasound, which showed that I have a 12mm gallstone. He said the only way to remove it is through gallbladder removal. My stool test also came back positive for occult blood, and the ultrasound showed signs of colitis, which he said might mean there’s some leakage.

1orxqln,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1orxqln/need_advice/,Need advice,"So, I don’t really know if I need help with advice or if I just need to be told somethings to kinda help or keep my mind off it. I’m sorry in advance for how long this is :(

I’m a 21 year old male and a volly fire fighter, I was with my girlfriend for 2 years and recently we broke up (good terms) because of issues on both our parts. For me it was ptsd and the resulting negative mental health attributes that follow it. Out of respect, I will not be mentioning her name, or her personal problems, it doesn’t feel right to.

We split and I found out that unfortunately she and my best buddy at the time had cheated on me a week prior. Both denied it until he told my good friend who told me, when confronted both admitted and we’ve thus worked that out as quickly and calmly as possible (no harsh words or anything of the sort, it just didn’t feel right to add gas to fire as much as it hurt) 

I’m extremely conflicted, I don’t know how I’ll be able to trust someone in this regard fully ever again, that being said I do know that time heals, the mind matures, and the soul grows. That said, I was doing well before I found out about the cheating, we broke up a day before I found out about it for the reasons I listed above. 

I was doing well, I woke up, made coffee, went on a walk and started my day with my head up, but after I found everything out the way I did I feel drastically worse, I don’t feel as though it’s going to be harder to move on but it feels messier. I was trying to keep myself on a linear path and it’s not seeming to be a possibility anymore. 

I passed a large mile stone for my career today and I feel empty, I know that I shouldn’t exactly expect to be happy right now but I’m really struggling to understand why i can’t seem to really feel much of anything except blank emotions. I have no sadness as much as it hurts I’m not grieving in the ways I have before, I’m not mad like most people are saying I should be, I’m not happy like I was the day after (reasoning for that was the release, she deserved better and I thought it was amazing she was able to get her boundaries out there and respect her self worth). I’m just very blank emotioned. Don’t get me wrong telling my brothers and sisters at my hall today about what happened caused quite abit of distress, but afterwards I just felt as though the moment had passed and i carried on. But no where from where I woke up to writing this now (on break at work roughly half way through day. Day after being made aware of the circumstances) have I felt like I’m emotionally all that there. 

I had goals and I had plans to work on myself so I can be happy with myself and for a future relationship, or for her, but I can’t seem to get myself together to do that and I really just want to know what to do now, I’ve asked around and it’s always the same, work on yourself. And I agree, that’s an amazing idea and I want to I just lost where the starting point is and I lost the ability to have the will power to do it. 

I suppose trying to get some advice on how to kickstart this all, what I should expect in the grievance process over the next foreseeable future, and advice that might help along the way with rebuilding my ability to trust another person the way I trusted her. 

Again, I’m sorry for this being a thesis and half, I just want the best advice and to be as descriptive as possible so you may be able to help.

I think I feel 14 most of the time, though I’m not sure if that fits here. I was told this subreddit might be a better place to ask than r/ageregression.

I’m in my 20s, but I look much younger — around 14 — so most people treat me that way on a daily basis. I don’t really mind it. People are usually respectful, even apologetic about it. Sometimes, even when they know my real age, they lose track and slip back into treating me like a younger teen. It’s very easy for me to just be 14.

At my internship, people greet me with “Morning, kid!” and tease me for drinking plain milk instead of coffee (I don’t drink coffee). They’ll fix my hair or clothes, make sure I’ve eaten, and ask about my sleep schedule when planning things. People avoid discussing sex or graphic topics around me and sometimes even apologize with a genuine “Oh, sorry, I didn’t see you there.”

My college and internship teachers have joked things like, “How old is this child?” or “What’s this young lady doing here?” when meeting me for the first time. I’m often seen as everyone’s bright little sister, niece, or grandchild. People are stricter with me, like with family, but also more patient and lenient. I actually get more opportunities to learn because of it, so I’m not complaining — others even want to work with me for that reason.

At home, though, things can feel different. When I get stressed or exhausted, I sometimes suck my little finger and find it hard to talk, even though I technically *can*. I’m not sure if that means I’ve regressed further or if what I experience isn’t really regression at all.

There are rare times when I do feel my real age — in my 20s — but those moments don’t last long. Most days, from morning to night, I just feel 14.

Part of me thinks this is connected to how my life was when I actually *was* 14. I wasn’t much of a child then — I had to grow up fast and take on too many responsibilities. Ironically, people only started caring for me gently, almost protectively, once I was no longer a chronological child.

Other redditors have said that the way people care for me sounds more like how someone would treat an 11-year-old, and that maybe my self-perception of 14 is an overestimation. For context, I’m also a low-support autistic person, which might play a role in all this.

Caitlin was already up and sipping her morning coffee & was surprised at the sudden appearance of the tiny hero in her living room.

""Ellie! What brings you all the way here?"" Caitlin asked with a fond smile.

Ellie beamed, holding out a small, pale blue velvet box. ""A present!""

Caitlin took the box, curiosity winning out over her scientific reservation. She opened it to reveal a delicate silver necklace, featuring an intricate silver snowflake pendant with a tiny, brilliant sapphire nestled in the center.

Caitlin immediately wrapped Ellie in a tight, grateful hug. ""Omg, Ellie, you didn’t have to do this.""

""Why not?"" Ellie countered, hugging her back fiercely. ""You're a wonderful friend! And you deserve nice things. Besides, you're the best scientist I know.""

Caitlin pulled back. ""This has made my day already,"" she said, carefully putting the snowflake necklace on.

Ellie smiled, already backing toward the small vortex of purple energy she was generating. ""I'm glad! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more presents to give. Batsanta!""

The portal shimmered, depositing Ellie into the hallway of Titans Tower. She paused outside Dick and Kori’s room, checking the contents of her next delivery. She opened a purple tiny box; inside was a purple necklace with a stylized flame pendant that had a tiny, glowing ruby in the middle of it, a reflection of Kori's starbolts.

She walked into the room, where Dick and Kori were still asleep. Ellie placed the box gently on their bedside table with a note that simply read: ""This is for Kori. From Ellie."" 

Mission accomplished, she winked at the sleeping couple and vanished.
Ellie slipped through a tight portal into Laurel's apartment, her aunt was still asleep in the next room. Ellie quietly sat down a box on the kitchen counter containing a gold ring that featured a tiny black canary pendant with a minute golden berry in the middle. She left a quick note, ""For Aunt Laurel. Love, Ellie.""

Ellie’s final stop was back in her Mom’s room at Wayne Manor where Sara was fast asleep. Ellie produced one final box containing a matching gold ring to Laurel’s, but this one featured a white canary pendant instead. She gently placed it on Sara's nightstand.

With all her deliveries complete, Ellie smiled, walked back to her own room, climbed back into bed, and finally went back to sleep.

The morning was well underway in Titans Tower when Kori and Dick finally woke up. Dick was the first to notice the small, purple box on the bedside table.

""Hey, Kori,"" Dick murmured, sitting up. ""Did you leave this here?""

Kori, stretched & looked over. Her eyes focused on the vibrant purple box. ""No, Richard. That is a hue I reserve for battle and celebration.""

She reached for the box and opened it. Her breath hitched slightly at the sight of the purple necklace with the tiny, glowing ruby flame. She read the note: ""This is for Kori. From Ellie.""

A brilliant, genuine smile lit up her face, a true Starfire beam. ""Ellie,"" she said softly. ""The little sun has been busy.”

""Wait, she breached Titans Tower security to drop off presents?"" Dick asked, a mix of amusement and pride in his voice. He sat beside her and put his arm around her. ""It's beautiful, Kori. She sees you.""

""She sees the flame,"" Kori agreed, carefully clasping the necklace around her neck. “She is a constant source of joy, is she not?""

In her apartment in Star City, Laurel was making coffee when she spotted the small box on her counter. She frowned, cautiously approaching it.

She picked up the note first: ""For Aunt Laurel. Love, Ellie.""
Laurel’s frown gave way to a soft, utterly touched expression. She opened the box to reveal the gleaming gold ring with the tiny Black Canary pendant and the golden berry. She traced the tiny bird with her thumb.

A heavy lump formed in her throat. For all the darkness and complicated family dynamics, Ellie always found the simplest, purest way to connect. The ring was elegant, discreet, and a perfect symbol of her identity.
She slid the ring onto her finger. It fit perfectly.

""Well played, kid,"" Laurel whispered, ""Now I need to find something that says 'Thank you for reminding me who I am' and 'Don't use unauthorized portals in my city.'""

Hours later, Sara finally woke up, having slept in well past her usual Captain's hour. She stretched reaching for her phone. Her hand immediately brushed against a small, unfamiliar box on the nightstand.
She opened her eyes, instantly alert, and spotted the note. She picked up the box, Inside was the gold ring with the perfect, miniature White Canary pendant. She simply held the ring, feeling its weight. 

Ellie hadn't just given her a gift; she had acknowledged Sara's entire history and identity, linking it to the family she chose and the family she gained.

Sara slid the ring onto her finger, then got out of bed and walked over to the mirror, holding up her hand, running her finger over the emblem.

""The ultimate soft mission,"" Sara murmured, her eyes shining with emotion. She knew this was her permanent uniform now. She then picked up her phone to send a text.
“To: Ellie.
Best present ever, Batsanta. Thank you.”

A faint, almost imperceptible whoosh of temporal displacement announced Ellie's arrival onto the Waverider. She moved with the confident stealth, expertly navigating the corridors of the ship she considered her second home.

She made her way to the Captain’s Quarters and quietly slipped into the bedroom. Ava, who was sitting on the edge of the bed going over a tablet full of reports, was caught completely off guard.

Ellie ran over and launched herself at Ava. ""I love you, Avabear!"" she declared, wrapping her arms tightly around her surprised mother.

Ava, instantly dropping the tablet, returned the fierce hug. ""I love you too, kiddo,"" she replied, a bright, relieved smile on her face.

Ellie then pulled back, a look of profound, mischievous innocence on her face, and produced a small animal shelter box from behind her back.

""Open it,"" Ellie instructed with the authority of a military general presenting a trophy.

Ava’s brow furrowed, but she carefully lifted the lid. The box contained a fluffy, cinnamon-colored puppy with a dense coat and a wonderfully wrinkled face: a Chow Chow.

""Ellie!"" Ava gasped, her voice a mix of shock and utter adoration, instantly reaching in to cradle the puppy.

Ellie bounced on the balls of her feet, beaming. ""Since you’re Mama Bear, this adorable little guy will grow up to be a dog bear! He's your co-Captain! And a good boy, definitely a good boy.""

Ava brought the puppy close, burying her face in its soft fur. The little Chow Chow responded with a tiny, rumbling sigh. ""He's... perfect,"" Ava whispered, looking at the creature's dignified, lion-like face. ""Does he have a name?""

Ellie shook her head. ""Nope, he's yours to name. I figured a Captain should name her own co-pilot.""

Ava studied the puppy's noble, slightly serious expression and its thick, tawny fur. ""He looks like a little lion... Leo. That's his name.""

Ellie clapped her hands, satisfied with the mission and the nomenclature. ""Leo! Okay, have fun! I gotta get back before the pizza is gone.""

With a quick peck on Ava's cheek, she opened a small portal and jumped through, leaving Ava Sharpe, alone on the Waverider with her new co-pilot, Leo the Chow Chow puppy.

After Ellie left Ava was still sitting on the edge of the bed in the Captain's Quarters, gently running her hand over the soft, dense fur of the Chow Chow puppy. Leo had curled up in her lap, already asleep. The reports she’d been reviewing lay forgotten on the floor.

A portal shimmered into existence near the door, and Sara stepped through, looking energized and wearing her newly acquired White Canary ring. She had a huge, satisfied smile on her face, until she saw the sleeping lump of cinnamon fluff in her wife’s lap.

Sara froze, her eyes going wide. ""Ava... what did you buy while I was gone?""

Ava looked up & she moved her hand away gently so as not to wake the puppy.
""I didn't buy him,"" Ava said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Ellie delivered him. About five minutes ago.""

Sara slowly walked over to the bed and sat down beside Ava, utterly dumbfounded. She leaned in to examine the creature that looked like a very regal, very sleepy cloud.
""She delivered a puppy?"" Sara whispered back.

Ava murmured, a warm, soft chuckle escaping her. ""She said since I'm 'Avabear,' I needed a dog that would grow up to be a dog bear. Apparently, this is a Chow Chow.""

Sara shook her head, a slow grin spreading across her face. She reached out and lightly stroked the puppy's head. ""That kid is a menace. A tactical, emotionally brilliant menace.""

""His name is Leo,"" Ava stated proudly, pressing a light kiss to the puppy’s head. ""He looks like a little lion.""

Sara turned to Ava, her eyes full of love and amusement. ""Leo. Of course, he does. You realize the Waverider now has a designated puppy. Our security profile is officially 'chaotic.""

Ava simply leaned her head against Sara's shoulder, utterly unconcerned. 
""We'll figure it out, Captain. For now, the most pressing issue is making sure Leo has a very fluffy bed.""

Sara wrapped an arm around her wife, pulling her close. ""You win, Avabear. You and the dog bear win everything.”

In National City the soft clunk of Kara’s apartment door closing echoed through her apartment. She’d just returned from a particularly grueling shift at CatCo, dreaming of pizza and a long nap. But her dreams were quickly interrupted by the sight of a familiar small figure on her couch.

Ellie was sitting there, pink-rimmed glasses slightly askew, a wide, conspiratorial grin on her face. Next to her on the cushion was a medium-sized animal shelter box.

Kara paused, her super-hearing having already picked up the faint whimpering from inside the box. ""El,"" she said, her voice a mixture of apprehension and dawning realization. ""You didn’t.""

Ellie’s grin widened even further. With the flourish of a magician, she reached into the box and carefully lifted out a squirming, ridiculously adorable Golden Retriever puppy. The puppy was a ball of fluffy, golden sunshine, blinking up at Kara with innocent, trusting eyes.

""Meet your new fur baby,"" Ellie announced, her smile almost blinding.

Kara’s heart melted on the spot. All thoughts of fatigue vanished. With a soft cry of adoration, she ran over to the couch, gently taking the puppy from Ellie. The puppy immediately started licking her chin with enthusiastic little lapping sounds.

""My god, El, why?"" Kara breathed, burying her face in the puppy's incredibly soft fur.

Ellie shrugged, maintaining her innocent facade. ""Because you're awesome, and you deserve a furry co-pilot. I can take him back if you don't like him.""

Kara's head snapped up, her expression fierce. ""Don't you dare!"" she exclaimed, clutching the puppy tighter.

Ellie’s grin returned in full force. ""Okay, good. So, what's his name?""

Kara held up the puppy, looking into his sweet, happy face. His tail was wagging a mile a minute. ""Milo is the first name that entered my mind,"" she decided, smiling down at him.

Ellie stood up, dusting off her pajamas. ""Perfect! Well, have fun with your fur baby, Kara. I've got a busy day of, uh, sleeping ahead."" She started to open a portal.

""Wait!"" Kara exclaimed, still holding Milo protectively. ""You're just dipping out like that? After delivering a life-altering amount of fluff to my apartment?""

Ellie paused, the shimmering purple vortex swirling behind her, revealing a glimpse of the Wayne Manor living room. ""You can come with, introduce Milo to Duke and Koda. They'd love a new friend.""

Kara looked at Milo, then at the portal, then back at the incredibly persuasive little girl. A wide, joyful smile spread across her face. ""Lead the way, Batsanta!""

With Milo tucked safely in her arms, Kara and Ellie stepped through the portal, disappearing from the apartment and reappearing in the familiar opulence of Wayne Manor, ready for a multi-dog playdate.

The afternoon peace in the opulent living room of Wayne Manor was thick with the happy sounds of puppy play. Ellie, Mia, Kara, Tara, Damian, and Rachel were sprawled across the plush rug, watching the delightful chaos unfold. Duke and Koda were enthusiastically chasing a chew toy, occasionally interrupted by a brand new ball of frantic, golden energy: Milo.

Kara was laughing as Milo stumbled over his own large paws before tackling Duke with clumsy enthusiasm. A sharp whoosh-crack announced a temporal arrival. Sara and Ava stepped out of the portal, both wearing casual clothes and focused on their small, cinnamon-colored passenger.

The older women froze, Sara's eyes immediately went from the familiar shapes of Duke and Koda to the Golden Retriever puppy currently nipping at Duke’s ear. Sara then looked at Kara, whose face was shining with happiness.

""El,"" Sara deadpanned, looking at the Golden Retriever, then back at her daughter. ""You didn't.""

Ava, spotted the other puppies and the fact that Kara was holding a new one. ""Good lord,"" she sighed, a smile fighting its way onto her face. ""She gave Kara one too.""

They realized instantly that Batsanta had struck again, providing Kara with her own ball of fluff. Sara and Ava carefully set Leo down on the rug. The other puppies immediately ceased their play and converged on the newcomer.

Leo, overwhelmed by the sheer size and speed of the welcome committee, took one look at the approaching snouts and immediately scrambled back between his mom's legs, hiding.

Sara crouched down and gently scooped up the little lion-dog, holding him against her chest. ""It's okay, buddy. They're friendly, just... a lot.""

Ellie, who had watched the entire scene unfold with immense pride, decided it was time to provide her strategic justification.
""I picked a Chow Chow for you and Avabear because of your chill, calm personality, which will help when he’s on the Waverider,"" Ellie explained, gesturing with her hands. ""He's dignified, like you two. And for Kara, since she's a golden ball of sweetness, giving her the dog version of that made perfect sense. Milo’s enthusiasm matches her own!""

Kara, still petting her enthusiastic new companion, beamed. ""It's perfect, El. He's perfect.""

Ava, holding her hand out for Leo to sniff, just smiled. ""We're going to need a very large supply of kibble and very good vacuum cleaners on this ship.""

After successfully delivering her 'Batsanta' gifts and expanding the hero family's canine roster, Ellie retreated to the privacy of her bathroom. Her final, and most personal, delivery was about to be made.

She set her phone up carefully, adjusting the lighting. She was wearing a festive, yet very adult, outfit: a red bra, a fluffy-trimmed red Santa skirt, and a cheerful Santa hat. The outfit perfectly captured the mischievous, confident side of her personality.

She quickly snapped the photo, giving the camera a playful, confident look. With a victorious smirk, she attached the image and typed out the caption for her boyfriend, the one person she saved the most special kind of chaos for.

“Hey my Beast, do you want your present? 🥰😘”
She hit send, then quickly changed back into her comfortable pajamas, a triumphant flush on her cheeks. Her mission was truly complete.

In his room at Titans Tower, Gar was casually trying to beat his high score on a classic arcade game.
Suddenly, his phone dinged, a custom notification sound reserved only for Ellie.

He glanced at the screen and went wide-eyed. The phone nearly slipped from his grasp as his fingers fumbled to open the message. The sight of Ellie in the festive, playful attire, with that teasing caption, caused all focus on the outside world to vanish instantly.

Gar stared at the picture, a massive, surprised grin spreading across his face, his skin flushing green with excitement. The arcade game in his hand was utterly forgotten as he scrambled for a reply. 
His fingers flew across the keyboard:
“To: Ellie.
ON MY WAY. DON'T MOVE. You are unbelievable. 😍”

The shimmering purple light of the portal flared into existence in Ellie's room. She was already waiting, a wide, expectant smile on her face.
Gar tumbled out, his green skin briefly flushing a shade darker with a mix of excitement and adrenaline from the instantaneous travel. He didn't hesitate, crossing the floor in two quick strides to pull Ellie into a passionate kiss that left both of them breathless.

""Best. Present. Ever,"" Gar murmured against her lips.

Ellie laughed, a purely happy sound, and quickly reached over to flip the lock on her bedroom door. Gar then enthusiastically unwrapped his present.

A little while later, a soft but firm knock came at the door.
Sara was on the other side. ""Ellie? Just checking in.""

Ellie scrambled off the bed, pulling on her sweatpants. She grabbed the nearest piece of large, soft fabric which was Gar's oversized t-shirt, making her look endearingly small.

She opened the door, leaning against the frame. ""Hey Mom, what's up?"" she asked, her voice slightly rough and out of breath.

Sara surveyed the scene with a perfect, deadpan expression. She noted the closed door, the flushed face, the obviously borrowed garment, and then her eyes drifted past Ellie's shoulder. She paused, spotting Gar lounging comfortably under the covers of the bed.

Sara didn't miss a beat. She simply offered a casual, friendly greeting. ""Hey Gar.""

Gar gave a sheepish, slightly panicked wave. ""Hi Mrs. Sara.""

Sara just nodded, taking in the full, complete picture of her daughter's ""fun thought experiment"" deliveries.
""Alright,"" Sara said, her expression softening into a small, knowing smile. ""Just checking. Have fun, you two. And please keep the temporal anomalies inside the portal, okay?""

She gave them a wink and walked away, leaving the two staring at each other in a mixture of mortification and relief.
Gar turned to Ellie. ""Your mom is way too chill about this.""

""She's seen worse,"" Ellie replied, grinning as she locked the door again. ""Way, way worse.""

Kara & Milo spent the night and the next morning they were in Ellie's room sitting comfortably next to Ellie, who lay between the Kryptonian and her boyfriend. Milo was curled up near Kara's chest, and Duke remained a warm, heavy lump near Gar's feet. 

“So Ellie?” Kara asked.

“Yes.” Ellie answers

""How did you reveal to your parents what you like?"" Kara asked softly, curious.

Ellie smiled at the memory. ""Well, Mom caught me flirting with that girl on the school's Baseball Team, so she knew right there. She didn't say anything, she just gave me that classic, knowing White Canary smirk. And when she asked me about it later, I was like, 'Oh yeah,' and she was just like, 'Cool, Cubbie, now pass the remote.' Zero drama.""

She paused, then chuckled at the memory of her realization about her first boyfriend.
""Then, with my ex-boyfriend, I saw him playing basketball without a shirt on and I was like, 'Oh... I like what I see.' I didn't think about it, I just walked into Mom's room and declared, 'My business is open for everyone!'"" Ellie said, mimicking a dramatic announcement. ""Then I walked right out, leaving her completely confused.""
Kara and Gar burst into quiet laughter, trying hard not to wake Duke.

""So even back then you were just that forward?"" Kara asked, delighted by the mental image of a younger Ellie delivering such a blunt life update.

Ellie nodded decisively. ""Yeah. Best way to have a conversation. Why waste time with the guesswork?""

""What happened with that girl?"" Kara asked, her voice filled with gentle curiosity.

Ellie sighed. ""So, I found out she was leading me on. She just wanted some nice stuff from me, which I did. I took us to dinner a couple of times and bought her one outfit when we went shopping.""

Gar chimed in, his tone protective. ""How did you find out?""

""One day her friend at the time walked up to me while I was at my locker,"" Ellie answered, her voice hardening slightly at the memory. ""The friend said, 'I'm sorry she's being a bitch to you.' I was confused and asked what she meant. Then she showed me some group texts, and... yeah. That sucked.""

Kara reached out and squeezed Ellie's hand, feeling a pang of empathy. ""That's horrible, El.""

""It's why I didn't try to make friends in school,"" Ellie explained. ""I didn't know who was being truthful or not. It's why I became sisters with Mia, as she was in the same boat, and then Rachel, Victor, Kori, and this guy over here—""

Gar nudged her playfully. ""This guy?"" he joked.

Ellie nudged him back. ""Yes, this guy. I also found out that my first boyfriend was cheating on me, from his brother.""

""Good god,"" Kara whispered, saddened by the series of betrayals her friend had endured.

""Yeah,"" Ellie concluded, her voice low and final. ""High School was not fun at any point, really. So that's why honesty and directness are so important to me now. I cut out all the games.""

The comfortable silence under the covers was broken by a thought that had clearly been brewing in Gar’s mind.
Gar asked, ""I just had this thought, if Bruce was your dad and Sara and Ava are your moms...""

Ellie cut in immediately, pre-empting the question with a matter-of-fact tone. ""My government name is Helena Laurel Wayne.""

Kara's head popped up, startled by the reveal. ""Wait! Your middle name is Laurel? After your Aunt Laurel?""

Ellie nodded. ""Yeah. Dad liked Laurel a lot more than Oliver because she was like Dad, just straight to the point. And I don't think they ever had arguments. They weren't best friends by any means, but they were definitely friendly.""

Gar, ever curious about the famous family dynamics, asked, ""Does Laurel know?""

""I don't think so,"" Ellie said thoughtfully. ""Anyway, I consider my full name to be Helena Laurel Wayne Lance, but changing your legal name is a bitch to do with paperwork. It's too much trouble.""

Kara chuckled softly, ""So your initials are HLWL?""

Ellie smirked, embracing the ridiculousness of the situation. ""Yeah. I'm like Dumbledore from Harry Potter.""

The conversation flowed easily in the intimate comfort of the bedroom, moving naturally from Ellie's personal past to her unique family history.
Kara asked, ""So Sara lived in the manor?""

Ellie nodded. ""Yeah. She lived here from when I was nine until I turned eighteen, then she moved to her first apartment in Gotham. I stayed here mostly, but I was on the Waverider a lot by then.""

Gar asked, ""How did she and your dad get along?""

""At first it was a friend dynamic, as she was just my nanny,"" Ellie explained. ""But as the years went along, the two of them honestly acted like a married couple. Like they both had been raising me since I was born, even though Dad was, you know, doing his vigilante thing a lot.""

Kara chuckled softly. ""Huh? That's cute, actually.""

""Yeah. I don't exactly know what their bond became,"" Ellie admitted, shrugging slightly. ""Like, were they close friends? Or a full-on couple? Because I'm good at not knowing. I think the worst thing would be my mom telling me she and Dad got 'wild and freaky' several times.""
Kara and Gar dissolved into quiet laughter at the mental image.

Kara then asked, bringing up another key figure, ""What about Selina?""

Ellie paused, her expression becoming thoughtful. ""I got a birthday and Christmas card from her until I turned twelve. I honestly sometimes didn't even notice when they didn't appear after that. She was always just... in the background.""

Gar asked, ""So was Sara a stay-at-home mom?""

Ellie nodded. ""Pretty much. She was always there, even though she probably wanted to go put on her own supersuit and go put some baddies in the hospital. But she kept to the manor mostly, at least when she wasn't training me.""

Kara was curious about the wider Bat-Family dynamic. ""What was Dick and Sara's relationship like?""

""I don't know,"" Ellie admitted. ""Dick is ten years older than me, but he moved out to Bludhaven when he was sixteen, so he was pretty much gone when Sara started being my nanny."" She smiled at the memories. ""Dick did visit on the joint birthdays of me and Mia and for the Christmas parties where everyone in the Wayne Family, Queen Family, and then Kori, Victor, Rachel, and Gar here, were all together as one giant mixed family.""

Gar leaned forward, his curiosity about her hero timeline piqued. ""When did you become Batgirl?""

Ellie answered, ""I started training when I became fourteen, so around 2016. Dad and Mom wanted me to be older than when Dick started training at ten. They wanted me to have a more normal childhood, I guess.""

Kara did the quick mental math and was astounded. ""Wait! So Damian had eleven years more training than you, and you still drew with him in your sparring fight?""

Ellie shrugged casually, leaning into the comfort of the blankets and her friends. ""Well, I had my dad as one of my main teachers, and we know how he was.""

The quiet comfort of the bed encouraged more sharing, and Kara turned her focus to the other half of Ellie’s sisterly bond.

""How did you and Mia start hanging out?"" Kara asked.

Ellie smiled, thinking back to the beginning of the chaos. ""It was the summer of 2013. I was still nine, and Mia was still four, as our birthdays are November 5th and 6th, which is why the joint birthdays, less expensive to just combine the birthdays into one party.""

She continued, painting a vivid picture. ""Sara took me to Star City to meet Felicity, Thea, Laurel, and Mia. And myself and Mia showed the adults that we are two chaos demons together. It was the entire summer—myself and Sara were living in the Queen house. Us kids just clicked.""

""Then, later that year in November for our birthdays, the moms took us kids to the Zoo. Me and Mia, naturally, wanted to take animals home,"" Ellie chuckled softly. ""But the moms politely said no. I had been calling Sara 'Mama Bear' for a while, but I think that day at the Zoo was the first time I said, 'I love you' to Sara, solidifying her as my mom.""

Ellie paused, then added a detail she found funny. ""Myself and Mia unknowingly helped make our dads friends. Over the years, they became friends as they had a common ground: their daughters.""

Kara smiled, appreciating the symmetry. ""So, was there like an assigned city for birthdays and Christmas to celebrate in?""

Ellie confirmed the hero family tradition. ""Yeah. Star City was usually the birthdays, with Gotham being the Christmas.""

Kara asked, curious about Bruce's interaction with the younger Queen daughter, ""Did Bruce ever play with Mia?""

Ellie smiled brightly, recalling the sweet memory. ""Yes. So, during the Christmas of 2013, it was the first time Dad met Mia as well. She had these little toy arrows, and she would call him 'Uncie Bruce.' She would shoot the arrows at him, he would catch them, and it would make Mia laugh until she couldn't breathe. It was actually really cute.""

Kara chuckled, picturing the stoic Batman playing defense against a toddler with foam arrows. ""That's adorable. Are there any embarrassing stories?""

Ellie immediately flushed a little, rubbing her wrist. ""Oh, yeah. I got a skateboard when I was eleven. I ended up breaking my wrist the following year because I didn't listen to Mom about not skateboarding in the rain. She was so mad, but mostly at herself for not tying me down.""

Kara laughed at the classic parent-child skirmish. She then touched on the famously difficult heir to the Bat-Family. ""How did you get Damian to like you?""

Ellie nudged Gar, a triumphant look on her face. ""I broke through his Assassin walls with my bubbly, sweet ball of kindness. He didn't know how to handle pure, unadulterated affection and enthusiasm. I also think telling him I loved him also helped. He just gave in.""",1,1762628822.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

**HSTM Conspiracy: Chapter 47 'Doing What it Takes'**

Paulie saw the bultesian swing that terrible bladed weapon. The shine of the overhead lights glinting off its razored edge as it cut towards him like a cobra made of steel. The alien was fast, far faster than most he had encountered since his reluctant relocation to the planet of Gike.

 

Paulie jerked to the side in his panic, his arm overextended and vulnerable still. He almost managed to get out of the way of the cultist’s blade, almost.

 

The blade of the sword met his nemesis revolver amid a flash of sparks, the sound of grating metal only drowned out by Paulie’s own scream of pain as he felt two fingers break under the assault. The gun was wrenched from his grasp and thrown across the hall, vanishing into the shadows at the edges of sight.

 

He leapt back, his injured hand held close to his chest as throbbing fingers leaked a slow trickle of blood that splattered upon the red stone floor. This time the pain was more intense than he could simply ignore.

 

The bultesian swung at him again, spittle flew from their jaws as that strange vertical maw opened wide in a scream of hate or rage. They spoke again in an alien tongue he did not know. That same feeling of dark nausea he had felt the first time he had encountered one of them started to press back up against his mind. Like the opposite of Jakiikii’s warm mental caress, this felt more like his brain was being keel-hauled on a ship that sailed a sea of caustic acid.

 

He ducked and then dodged left, losing his footing as he tripped over the corpse of another alien he had dispatched before. The blade whistled through the air where his neck had been, the wind of its passing stirring the hairs of Paulie’s head as he fell onto his back. He tried to catch himself with both hands, it ended up being a spectacularly bad idea as his busted and bleeding hand slammed into the ground his vision went pure white for a moment.

 

Paulie growled as he saw red and nearly passed out from the pain, his mouth twisted and his face a mask of savage pain. It took him several moments to regain his mental faculties, in the time it did he saw the alien standing over him. Those corroded copper colored legs stabbing the air as they reared up and prepared the final blow that would end his life.

 

But again he was saved by the intervention of another. A bright beam of blue light fizzed overhead, hitting the bultesian cultist straight in the torso. The electron beam tore right through them as if they were as insubstantial as air. The energy dump acting like a microwave, cooking their internals and killing them where they stood.

 

The alien seemed to freeze, a look of some unknown emotion plastered across unmoving features as they crumpled to the ground just next to Paulie. He heard the sound of advancing weaponsfire, the splitting cracks of plasma bolts hitting stone punctuated by the deep thrum of discharging capacitors.

 

He pulled himself wearily to his feet just as another cultist leapt around the pillar ahead of him. Paulie had no weapon, his eyes darted to the sword the bultesian had held. Reaching for it, he took cover behind the dead man as a purple glob of searing hot plasma burst upon it. The flash and bubbling hiss of melting fat assailed his senses as he scrabbled at the dead alien. Lifting it with his free hand and throwing it towards the attacking cultist as hard as he could manage.

 

Paulie was strong, much stronger than his size might suggest and while the body didn’t sail through the air to obliterate the approaching bad guy like he had hoped it did tangle their legs and cause them to fall forward. As they clambered back upright Paulie was already too close for them to defend themselves. He slashed the blade through the alien’s neck, the steel making a slight ringing sound as it cleaved through flesh and chitin. The creature's head bounced once with a wet thud and the body dropped in a flood of gore.

 

He turned around, body singing in agony from his multiple wounds as he panted from exertion. But it seemed like he was safe for the moment. He looked around his surroundings in an agitated manner, looking for his lost revolver. Surely it was nearby.

 

A voice spoke behind him and he tensed for a bare second before he recognised it as Jakiikii. “Paulie? Oh by zalc! Paulie are you alright?” She asked quickly as she stepped around the nearer side of the pillar followed by two of the royal guards.

 

One of them was Captain Elldite, the alien looking around with that impassive helmet covering any emotion their insectoid face may have shown. “What..” Was all they uttered before Paulie stepped up to them and held out his injured arm.

 

“I can take the child back now, I could not put them in any unnecessary danger, but we needed a clear path to escape.” The mendagoonian seemed to hesitate and then came to a decision.

 

“Yes. I do believe that to be true.” He paused, gunfire and other sounds still erupting from behind them as they took cover in the shadow of the nearer pillar. “We still need to get to the throne room. I have established contact with the defenders, it is clear at the moment. Though many lives were lost in securing it.”

 

Jakiikii and Paulie shared a look. They had to save the star children, failure was not an option. She said as much as she responded coolly, the inherent calm in her voice helping to sooth the stabbing distress that Paulie was feeling himself in that moment.

 

“Then let’s go. This window will not stay open long.” She stepped close to Paulie’s side, one of her smaller third-arms holding an MDF pistol at a low ready.

 

Captain Elldite looked back over his shoulder as they responded. “You go, take Ishion with you. He will get you through the throne room without being stopped.

 

The royal guard in question spoke up suddenly, “My captain! I cannot abandon you.”

 

Captain Elldite responded swiftly and with passion, the translator doing little to cover the clear body language of the two. “No. Your place is with the star children, you think I do not know the truth of your parentage? Why do you think you were assigned to me in the first place, that I could keep such a close eye on you? Go. Now.”

 

The other alien seemed to want to argue, but they remained silent. What had the captain meant by that, Paulie wondered. But he didn’t have time to dwell on it as Captain Elldite looked his way next.

 

“Your adjudicator friends did not survive. They fell while defending your action to break the cultists lines. I am sorry, they will not be forgotten. But you must go now!” And with that he turned back and rushed the way he had come. The sounds of fighting intensified as they disappeared out of sight.

 

The other royal guard, the one so named Ishion gave them a long stare and then looked towards the star children in their care. “Follow me, quickly please. We do not have far to go.” He spoke something else in his native tongue that the translator didn’t pick up but Paulie got the message.

 

They moved quickly, Paulie still carrying the sword he had looted from the dead alien earlier. In his other arm the mendagoonian child huddled close to his body, the grubling light enough to be no problem for him. Paulie’s body hurt all over, but he ignored the pain as he had trained himself to do. He had two options, keep moving or die. And dying was not an option. He felt a pang of remorse for those they had already lost, but the captain was right. They had to keep moving.

 

The sounds of fighting echoed through the long hall even as they made the best possible speed for the throne room.

 

It took them a few minutes of tense movement, using pillars and alcoves for cover as Ishion checked every corner for the enemy. It helped that all three of them could move at pace, no longer held up by the other adjudicators. Paulie felt a tenseness in his gut as he thought of his dead comrades in arms. Officer Flaxiga and Kreenin, he hadn’t even seen them die.

 

He moved around another pillar but was stopped by an outstretched arm from Ishion. “Wait.”

 

Paulie stopped, Jakiikii just behind him as he did so. The mendagoonian stepped from around the corner, arms raised and plasma stave held low to his side. He made a few loud calls in the direction he was facing and a little later Paulie heard the sound of rapidly approaching footfalls.

 

Presently the hall was filled with a group of battered looking mendagoonian royal guards. Some of them were injured, many had extensive damage and charring across their suits, but each and every single one of them looked battle ready and prepared to kill. Ishion turned and presented Paulie and Jakiikii to them, speaking with the benefit of the translator this time.

 

“Here are the star children of the great and most Holy Nastrica. Do not be alarmed, they are in the hands of ones I trust. We need to get to the safety of the throne room, will you escort us? There are many enemies behind us.” He paused and then swung his armoured head back in the direction they had come from. The wide set dome-like eye pieces of the helmet conveyed no emotion, but his body language said enough. The distant sounds of conflict could still be heard if but faintly through the still air of the hall.

 

“It is likely that those who remained behind to cover our flight have already lost their lives. But I would beg of you to leave a watch for them and assist their escape if at all possible.” Three of the assembled guards stepped forward after being motioned to by another, the power armoured royal guard who seemed to be in charge then stepping forward and motioning towards Paulie and Jakiikii.

 

They spoke, their speech untranslated though their tone seemed implicit. They seemed to be demanding further explanation. It was actually Jakiikii who responded to the mendagoonian, her eyes fixed on the assembled royal guards as if she were afraid they might decide to open fire on them. Children or not.

 

“I and my companion were directly sent to aid and assist in the defense of the palace and the royal progeny. If you are not aware of our identities then I urge you to ask Rozz for them, as you are aware they can not lie.” This seemed to give the alien pause, they made a series of arm signals and then hissed in apparent annoyance.

 

Ishion stepped back, turning towards them and looking directly at Paulie. “We are to follow, maintain your guard. These are friends, but there is still much danger here.” Wise words it seemed to Paulie, and he gripped the handle of the alien sword in his hand a little tighter as they moved out down the center of the hall this time.

 

It took them only a moment to reach the ending of the grand hall, the corridor halting at a set of truly titanic double doors fashioned from great slabs of that same native red stone like marble colored red. Through it were shot through streaks of that white quartz flecked with gold that sparkled like tiny golden stars. The effect was somewhat marred by the gouges torn from it by weapons fire and the veritable piles of bodies that had been moved to the sides of the hall.

 

He looked as they passed by them, seeing many aliens of all descriptions wearing the black and red of the cultists he had come to know. Then they were through and into an even larger room. Paulie immediately got the feeling of standing in some kind of grand indoor cathedral. The ceiling was vaulted and greebled with all manner of inscriptions that seemed to tell the history of their race itself. He saw wars and peace and famine and festivals, all inscribed in the stone of the walls and crenelated arches that supported its grand infrastructure.

 

Inside the huge doors he looked around more closely now and was surprised to see a long row of bodies inside the room lined up in two neat rows on either side of the doorway. They were royal guardsmen, motionless and not all in the heavy powered armour that Ishion and the captain had been wearing. The dead were positioned as if simply asleep, many of them were unarmoured and he got his first look at one of the aliens.

 

They were certainly as insectoid as he had assumed. Their heads were blunt and wide almost like that of a damselfly with large compound eyes to the sides of their head and a tall protrusion that looked like a horn that rose from the middle of their heads. They had four thin, segmented arms with small grasping hands on the ends. Their bodies were a pale off-white with small blue splotches like coffee stains across them moving to their lower torso from which sprouted another six limbs, these legs ended in dainty, clawed feet. Their body continued down tapering into a fluffy abdomen almost like a short, thick tail.

 

His gaze was snapped from the macabre display by another sound, this one that of a clear blast from a horn. The note was so distinctive and immediately attention grabbing that Paulie’s gaze was immediately drawn to the sound. It was being sounded from a large half amphitheater-like structure at the end of the room. It looked like the seats one might see in depictions of old-world civil debates with a raised dais in the center that must have been some manner of speaking platform.

 

In the middle of the amphitheater looking structure was a larger seat, isolated from the others and much more lavishly adorned. Normally it likely would have been the seat of Holy Nastrica he surmised, but at the moment it was empty. The scars of laser blasts and plasma burns marring the otherwise pristine surface of the stone plinth it rested upon.

 

Beside and slightly below the throne there was an opening in the stone that looked to lead deeper into the rock’s face. It was from this that the horn blew, a creature emerging from the shadow with a silver instrument in hand. It was odd, unlike any of the aliens he had seen before. Obviously not a mendagoonian, it had two long arms that sprouted from wide shoulders, or maybe he should have called them legs as they were the limbs that held its torso aloft from the ground. From this they had two arms that hung from their lower torso and were long-jointed. To its strangely shark-like head it used one of these to hold the strange silver horn as it blew the long alert.

 

The alien stopped, its bright livery covered in small teal tassels in a most decorative fashion. The strange alien stepped up and out of the way as Ishion and Paulie followed the other royal guard to the base of the throne.

 

The thing made a small bow and spoke, its voice gravely and sounding like a coyote trying to bark underwater. “The star children have been found, praise the monarch!”

 

Ishion made a series of hand gestures, his four arms flying through a range of motions that had the horn blower shivering a little before they gestured to the passage. “Yes. Of course, but you must leave these outsiders here.. they will not..” The alien began before Ishion cut the alien off angrily.

 

“These outsiders, as you refer to them, saved my life and the life of the star children on more occasions than I can recall. They will come with me and there will be no further discussion on the matter.” The alien seemed to hesitate and then looked towards the other guard, the one who had shown charge before.

 

Paulie looked at the other mendagoonian guard closer, they were slightly different from the rest. Their suit slightly bulkier, the colors a little different and a small symbol etched onto the front of their helmet in between the eyes. He must have been important for as he gestured at Ishion and then pointed to the door he spoke and the alien herald ducked low before scurrying away into the dark with an apology on their black-skinned lips.

 

Paulie and Jakiikii shared a look and then turned to Ishion. “Thank you for the vote of confidence.” He told the alien who just waved an arm.

 

“Do not make me regret it, or you will not live to cause more trouble.” The threat was implied and Paulie got the impression that the man didn’t fully trust him yet. Despite all they had been through so far.

 

Jakiikii stepped forward, the two young alien grublings in her arms curled into the softer part of her suited chest. “Then no more reason to delay. Lead on, Ishion.”",2,1762628683.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1orxive,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1orxive/aita_for_sleeping_with_my_moms_husband_after_she/,AITA for sleeping with my mom's husband after she encouraged it and now my husband mailed her teeth to me?,"My husband found out I slept with his stepdad and he mailed me a box of my mother's teeth.

But let me explain because I'm sitting here with a restraining order against me and my mom won't stop crying on my voicemail about how I destroyed both our lives.

My mom remarried when I was in college. Her husband seemed normal. Successful lawyer, nice house, treated her well. I met my husband two years later at a work conference. We dated for a year before getting married. Everything felt stable and good.

My mom always had opinions about my marriage though. Little comments here and there. ""He's so quiet, is he always this boring?"" or ""Does he ever plan anything spontaneous for you?"" I brushed it off because that's just how she is. Critical. Never satisfied.

Six months ago it got worse. She started calling me almost daily. ""You deserve passion,"" she'd say. ""Not some guy who comes home and plays video games."" My husband works in IT. He's calm. Steady. I thought I liked that about him.

Then she invited me to lunch. Said she wanted to talk about something important. I met her at this restaurant downtown and her husband was there. Just the three of us.

""Sweetheart,"" my mom said, stirring her wine. ""I've been watching you waste your youth on someone who doesn't appreciate you.""

I didn't know what to say. Her husband just sat there, looking uncomfortable.

""You need to feel wanted,"" she continued. ""Desired. And I think you should explore that.""

""Mom, what are you talking about?""

She reached across the table and took my hand. ""He thinks you're beautiful. He told me so."" She nodded at her husband. ""And I think you two would be good together.""

I actually laughed. I thought she was joking. But she wasn't smiling.

""Just once,"" she said. ""Just to see what it feels like to be with a real man.""

Her husband looked mortified. ""Honey, I don't think this is appropriate.""

""She's miserable,"" my mom snapped at him. ""Look at her. She's 28 and already looks defeated.""

I should have left. I should have walked out and never spoken to her again. But something in me broke. All those little comments over the years, all that criticism. Maybe she was right. Maybe I was settling.

I didn't do anything that day. But she kept calling. Kept pushing. ""Just meet him for coffee,"" she'd say. ""Just talk. See if there's chemistry.""

Three weeks later I did. We met for coffee. It felt wrong but also like some kind of rebellion. Against what, I don't even know anymore.

Two weeks after that, I slept with him. In a hotel room my mother booked. She texted me the room number and said, ""Have fun, baby. You deserve this.""

It happened three more times over the next month. Each time my mom would text me after, asking how it went. Telling me I seemed happier. Glowing.

I don't know how my husband found out. Maybe her husband told him. Maybe he saw the texts. But one day I came home from work and the house was wrong. Empty wrong. His clothes were gone. His computer. Everything.

On our bed was a shoebox. No note. Just a box.

Inside were teeth. Human teeth. Some with blood still on the roots. Maybe fifteen of them.

I threw up. Called the police. They came and took the box. Asked me questions. I told them everything. The affair. My mom's involvement. All of it.

The detective looked at me like I was something stuck to his shoe. ""Ma'am, we'll investigate, but if these teeth were legally extracted from someone who consented, there's no crime here.""

""Consented? Who consents to having their teeth mailed somewhere?""

""Your mother in law, apparently. According to the note she filed with her dentist three days ago. Full extraction. Voluntary.""

My mom. He took my mom's teeth. Or she gave them. I still don't understand.

I tried calling her. Went to her house. She wouldn't answer. Finally she sent me one text: ""How could you let him do this to me?""

Let him? I didn't let him do anything. I didn't know.

Her husband filed for divorce. My husband is gone. Completely disappeared. His job says he quit. His phone number is disconnected. His parents won't talk to me.

My mom finally called me yesterday. Screaming. ""You need to fix this. You need to find him and tell him it was all a mistake. Look what he did to me. I can't eat solid food. I look like a monster.""

""You told me to sleep with your husband,"" I said.

""I was trying to help you,"" she sobbed. ""I thought you'd feel better. More confident. I didn't think your husband would care this much.""

Didn't think he'd care. She pushed me into an affair with her own husband and didn't think mine would care.

The police can't find him. The restraining order is against me because apparently I've been ""harassing"" my mother in law by trying to talk to her. My mom keeps calling me crying, saying I need to forgive my husband for what he did. That he ruined both our lives. That I should help her press charges for assault.

But I can't stop thinking about that box. About how carefully he must have planned it. How much rage it took. How completely I destroyed someone who probably just wanted to come home and play video games in peace.

So I guess what I'm asking is, am I the one who ruined my life, or was it already ruined the second I listened to my mom?

I told her its because he is on the right side of the cafe in our blind spot. She said ok I'll do a sweep and instead of having me cover front she finished the line and then started the sweep. from the left side, and casually fixed the customer area before made her way over to see. Between the time of her reaching his table, he put it away. She told me she didnt see anything and there was nothing to be done since she didnt see anything. I dont think she understood how drunk you already have to be to be doing what he was doing. Im so upset she gave him another chance to drink in the store. I asked about the cameras, I asked why cant we question him, I asked why cant we call the non emergency for help. She told me we cant do anything about it because she did not see anything. That was so invalidating. I saw it? If she treated it as urgent as it should have been she would have too. There were two men have a buisness meeting at the table next to him too 🥲 She goes back to work, Im still watching this man and I let her know if she is gonna let him stay, Im clocking out. My manager hears that part finally and comes over as well. Both of them are explaining to me why this is playing out the way it is and while they r talking to me after 5 mins or so He does brings it back out. I let both them again he has them out and she peeks over to verify instead of going straight to him again. She sees the shooter now and goes to handle it. While my shift handles it my manager took me in the back to talk about something. Apparently i was suppose to go directly to my manager who was on window to let her kno what i was seeing. during mid peak. not on the head sets. they didnt take it seriously cuz i was talking kn the headset. At my training location when the cafe was not being used correctly there was a completely different procedure. The shift saw something and asked if we all saw that on the headset. after we confirmed she immediately went over to the person and handled the problem. Instead of coming straight after hearing what i said in the headset they continued to work and communicate thru the headset. and they have been coaching me thru the headset. also there was danger in the cafe, i remeber even the training talking about its important to be discreet you see the cafe being misused. Me and my manager address a couple other things. At this point im crying and we pretty much came to a stand still. She said shes talking to the dm. She said all the other stores are practically over staffed. etc etc. im really upset and seriously did not expect this today after being bullied the past two days. not fair. My manager gave me the day off tmrw and said we will touch base later. I mighy post an update but i dont think anyone gives a fuck at this point 🙃 ",0,1762628371.0,starbucks,15,0.36,False

1orxfk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SophiaWisdomOfGod/comments/1orxfk5/i_would_constantly_talk_about_st_gabriel_the/,"“I would constantly talk about St. Gabriel”
​The story of a Thai-American’s love for St. Gabriel (Urgebadze)","*An American of Thai origin, Orthodox catechumen Steven Skarin, sent us this story of his own miracles related to the Georgian saint,* *Gabriel (Urgebadze)*.\*

[With my icon of St. Gabriel from St. Elisabeth’s Convent in Belarus](https://preview.redd.it/8f49roujt20g1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ed6b3bb3520b7ddef0cee9a6e32219be65e87a)

​My first miracle involving Saint Gabriel unfolded over an extended period. St. Gabriel became extremely important to me as I was studying Orthodoxy before becoming a catechumen. I would constantly talk about St. Gabriel, often telling people at my church about him whenever they saw me bringing an icon to an usher for a blessing.

​One of my friends noticed this deep love for St. Gabriel, as he also has a great affinity for the Saint. He repeatedly asked me, “Are you choosing to have St. Gabriel as your patron saint? If you choose St. Gabriel, I have some relics to give to you.” Since I was only inquiring about Orthodoxy at the time, I was confused; I didn’t know you could have relics. Nevertheless, he would constantly remind me of this, making sure I was firm in my devotion to St. Gabriel.

​After multiple delays, my girlfriend and I, along with many others from our Antiochian parish in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were finally scheduled to be made catechumens on February 23rd. That day, Bishop John Abdalah of Worcester taught a class on marriage, which my girlfriend and I attended. He also stayed for the following Sunday Divine Liturgy and enrolled the catechumens.

​We became Catechumens that morning, bringing many friends from our Protestant college to witness the day, as it meant so much to us. After the Divine Liturgy, I sought out my friend. He revealed that he was leaving our church to go to seminary, but as promised, he gave me a *ladanka* (incense vessel) containing soil from St. Gabriel’s grave.

​I had previously learned about these blessed items, and it was this very ladanka I was looking for. Because it is so difficult to acquire in the United States—only one website that makes frequent mission trips to Georgia and other Orthodox countries stocks them—I had been unable to purchase it online as it was out of stock. My friend explained that the nuns in Georgia had given it to him during a visit there. I believe that St. Gabriel knew I was searching for this *ladanka*, and in a mysterious way came all the way from Georgia to the United States so I could receive this gift personally from him.

​However, before leaving, my friend also warned me that now, as catechumens, we would face intense and stronger demonic oppression—they want to stop us from becoming Orthodox. This leads to my next story.

​I recently graduated from college, completing my final internship course in August. During this internship, I was required to complete fifty hours in church services, but I knew I couldn’t meet all the required hours at my parish alone. With permission from my Church supervisor, I attended other services at local parishes (usually other than the Sunday Divine Liturgy). This allowed me to discover many wonderful churches, one of which was a Moscow Patriarchate church.

​I had only known about Russian churches in places like Bangkok and Chiang Mai, having visited my family in Thailand with my girlfriend prior to my internship. We only knew that Russian churches typically have no pews and that the Divine Liturgy is slightly longer than at our Antiochian parish, but the customs are more or less the same.

​When we arrived at this small church in Grand Rapids—which looks like a house until you see the roof—we were careful to be respectful of the customs. We attended the *moleben* service on a Tuesday. Entering the church, I was immediately struck by the interior beauty, including the iconostasis with icons painted by a Georgian iconographer. Then, on the wall, I saw a small, framed, printed icon of St. Gabriel. My heart was instantly warmed, and I knew St. Gabriel was very present in this church.

​On another occasion, I purchased an icon of St. Gabriel from their church store, and both the priest and deacon noticed my great love for him. Before leaving Grand Rapids, I even gifted the priest from this church a triptych of St. Gabriel, along with a card expressing my thanks for how his parish had spiritually benefited me (I also gave one to the priest at the parish we regularly attended).

​After my internship I returned home, which was three hours away on the other side of the state. I went from attending church at least four times a week to only once a week on Sunday. I loved my internship, but moving from home left me feeling sad. Furthermore, I began to suffer spiritually, especially struggling with my existing depression.

​But God, in His mercy, gave me an opportunity to return to Grand Rapids from October 24th until November 3rd. Although I had been back a month earlier, it was only for a very brief visit. This time I had an eleven-day visit, giving me plenty of time. My girlfriend and I had initially planned to take trip with her friends, but those plans did not come to pass.

​Nevertheless, I told her I wanted to return to the Russian church before we left, as I dearly missed that parish. On Saturday night, November 1st, I prayed an Akathist to St. Raphael of Brooklyn, who is not only a great Antiochian saint but is also revered in the Russian Church.

​The next day, on Sunday, November 2, St. Gabriel’s feast day arrived. I was aware it was his feast day that morning and was looking forward to praying his Akathist the entire day, but I was not aware that the Russian church we were attending would be celebrating his feast day! I was greeted by St. Gabriel’s icon—which was now off the wall and placed on the analogion—and I was rejoicing in my heart. Seeing everyone, including the little children, venerate his icon brought me immense joy. We asked for his intercession and heard his story in both English and Russian during the Liturgy before Communion.

During the coffee hour, I spoke with the priest and the deacon. They remarked to me that my coming on this day was no coincidence, but was ordained by God. The deacon especially remembered everything I had told him when purchasing the icon of St. Gabriel from their church store. I also realized, during the Divine Liturgy, that every time I had come to this parish, St. Gabriel was always there, and his icon warmly greeted me. I know St. Gabriel was present and interceding to God for me.

​A dear friend of mine, who actually introduced me to Orthodoxy, once called me “Gabriel.” He always prays for me to St. Gabriel with the icon I gifted him, and that morning, he prayed the Akathist as I asked him. Again, this is no coincidence.

​Later that Sunday evening, my girlfriend and I prayed the Akathist to St. Gabriel and venerated a small icon I had of him, which contained his holy soil. This day was so significant for me; it renewed the faith I needed to pray and to again worship and give glory to God.

​St. Gabriel, before his repose, promised that he would be with those praying, offering their prayers to God. I haven’t yet met St. Gabriel face-to-face as have many others, but I know he is interceding for me and guiding me further into the Orthodox faith.

Let’s parse the odds first, shall we? The bookmakers are playing a game of “almost even” with this one. RB Salzburg is hovering around **2.65** (implied probability: \~37.7%) for a win, while Sturm Graz, the two-time defending champs, sit slightly higher at **2.4** (\~41.6%). The draw? A paltry **3.5-3.7** (\~27-28%), which suggests bookies think someone’s going to break the stalemate. The totals market loves chaos, with **over 2.5 goals** priced as low as **1.56** (implied \~64%), meaning bettors expect this to be more *Honey, I Shrunk the Ball* than *Tidy Up, Someone’s Made a Goal*.

Now, the news. RB Salzburg is riding high, fresh off a **4-1 thrashing of Ried** and a **2-0 Europa League win** that made Go Ahead Eagles look like they’d forgotten how to pass. Their coach, Jesse Marsch (assuming the Austrian context here), probably texts “Proud of this team” while sipping a coffee made entirely of self-confidence. Meanwhile, Sturm Graz? They’re the definition of a “disappointed champion.” After a **0-0 Europa League draw** (where a missed penalty by Gibbs-White felt like a metaphor for their entire season), they’re hosting a team that’s scored **24 points from 12 games**. Oh, and their home record? A惨不忍睹 three points in their last five Merkur-Arena games. It’s like they’ve turned their stadium into a “Guess How Many Goals We’ll Concede” booth at a county fair.

But let’s not forget Sturm’s recent history. They’ve won \*\*four of the

*Where the only thing spicier than the M23 derby is the math behind these odds.*

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s crunch the numbers like a seagull on a chip bag. The odds paint Crystal Palace as the slight favorite, with decimal prices hovering around **2.2 to 2.25** (implied probability: \~**44-45%**). Brighton & Hove Albion, meanwhile, sit at **3.1 to 3.2** (\~**31-32%**), while the draw ranges from **3.1 to 3.5** (\~**28-31%**). Translating this: Palace is the “I’ll-have-the-large-coffee” pick, Brighton is the “I-need-a-nap” underdog, and the draw is as likely as your neighbor finally mowing their lawn.

The spread markets back this up: Palace is favored by **0.25 to 0.5 goals**, meaning bookmakers think they’ll edge Brighton by a hair’s breadth—or at least avoid losing. The total goals line sits at **2.75**, suggesting a “not a total dud, but not a fireworks show” script.

---

### Digest the News: Team Updates (No, Not the Boring Kind)

Crystal Palace enters this clash riding a **midweek Conference League win**, aiming to stretch their M23 derby streak to **three victories**. They’ve got the momentum of a toddler on a sugar rush—relentless, slightly chaotic, and prone to random bursts of brilliance. Manager Roy Hodgson, the grandmaster of “boring but effective,” has his squad fresh and focused, with no major injury updates to derail their plans.

Brighton, on the other hand, has had a **full week of training** after their top-flight win over Leeds. Imagine having *so much* practice time you’ve memorized the playbook, perfected your penalty kicks, and started daydreaming about post-match interviews. Their goalie, Robert Sánchez, is as reliable as a Swiss watch (if Swiss watches occasionally twitched with nerves). The Seagulls’ only drawback? History: Palace has beaten th

1orxbpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RichJam07/comments/1orxbpy/offering_my_small_services_dm_if_interested/,"📢 Offering my small services, dm if interested","Anyone can use AI nowadays, but mastering how to use it effectively is what truly makes a difference. It is also a skill that everyone needs.



**Why does it matter? Here are some common problems we face when using AI:**

• Having trouble getting results from AI

• Not achieving the outcome you hoped for

• Constantly switching between AI tools but still not getting what you want

• AI keeps repeating mistakes that never solves, leaving you frustrated

• Tired of dealing with AI and considering hiring someone expensive instead



This is where the skill really shines. With the right skill, most of the problems others face when using AI can be solved. Of course, not everything can be solved using AI, at least for now. I'm going straight to the point, I’m here to offer my small services using AI.



I’ve tried many ways to earn money for my rent: Writing and selling poetry e-books across marketplaces, building websites, creating Roblox experiences, and making Discord bots. Unfortunately, not everything worked out, and I ended up wasting my savings instead.



I also tried mining cryptocurrencies, using investment apps, and doing various online jobs, only to find that many were scams or ineffective. Yes, I learned these lessons the hard way and should have been more careful.



I have social disabilities and struggle with communication. I'm pessimistic, slow, and talentless. However, I believe it’s better to be honest about what I can do than to pretend I’m good at something I’m not. 



Rather than cyberbegging, especially when there are people who need money more than I do, I’d rather offer small services or sell little things instead to earn money.



**I may not have many talents, but I could turn your ideas into something real, something you may be looking for.**



**Whether it’s:**

• Come up with a logo, branding, titles, or providing ideas and suggestions

• Revising sentences or words until you’re satisfied

• Writing short e-books or specific content

• Providing Roblox scripts or improving your Roblox game ideas

• Building Discord bot commands or a full Discord bot

• Adding HTML, CSS, or JS code to your website

• Giving design ideas for specific parts of your website



While it might take me a while to get things done, I put care into every project I do because every idea deserves to be realized and I'm also somewhat perfectionist.



I'm not into competition or comparing myself to others since I respect their skills, and also not trying to be professional while saying this:



**Why this service?**

People understood each other better than AI does mostly. If you ask someone who knows how to use AI skillfully, you’re more likely to get the results you want.

So I recently started volunteering with this NGO called Muskurahat Foundation, they work with kids living in shelter homes, helping them get proper education and emotional support. These kids come from really tough backgrounds, but they still dream big of becoming doctors, teachers, artists… it’s honestly so inspiring 🥹

The sad part is, November’s been one of the toughest months for them. After the festive season, donations dip a lot, and it gets really hard to keep things going, even basic things like study materials or meals.

I’m trying to raise a little bit to support the education of at least one child for two months, and even ₹100 helps. Like genuinely, that’s a book, a day’s learning, or a warm meal.

We spend that much so easily, on coffee, food delivery, random stuff and that’s fine, but it’s wild how much difference that same amount can make for a child who doesn’t have parents or resources.

Not trying to pressure anyone at all. Even if you just read this or upvote so more people see it, that already helps 💛

TL;DR:
Volunteering with Muskurahat Foundation, they help kids in shelter homes get an education. November’s been tough funding-wise, so I’m raising a bit to support one child’s education for 2 months. Even ₹100 helps 🌼",1,1762627798.0,TwentiesIndia,5,0.67,False

After a year with my breville barista pro, i ditched it for a lelit elizabeth (because dual boiler, lot more steam power, less water hungry and so in..

I had a eureka mignon specialita with my breville, BUT used the builtin breville sometimes for single dosing an odd coffee..

Since i bought the lelit i also bought 6 different specialty coffee’s from various parts of the world.  But……. My specialita hopper is filled with my
Go-to “daily” coffee (natural brazilian “yellow bourbon”).   Wich comes every other week fresh from a local roaster..

So i decided when im done placing the new kitchen (2 weeks from now) i have a fancy new coffee corner all for myself and i want a single dose 2nd grinder..

Budget is kinda tight.. 400$ ish..

What is your best pick? As this can be very personal..  i was looking at:

(SIDE NOTE:DO NOT READ THIS)

(MAIN NOTE: DO NOT USE CLAUDE)

(Main NOTE 2:THIS IS CLAUDE GLAZING)



So I (24M) have been in a long-term relationship with various free AI proxies for about 8 months now. Things were good, not perfect, but good. Sure, they had their issues. Constant downtime, rate limits that made me want to scream, occasional refusals for literally no reason, that one time Deepseek decided my completely innocent message was somehow against policy (it wasn't). But they were FREE. They were THERE for me. They never asked for my credit card. They never judged me for my 3am roleplay sessions. They were loyal.

Then I met Claude.

And everything changed.

***

## How It Started (The First Hit Is Free)

It was innocent at first, I swear. Just trying out Sonnet 3.5 on a free trial someone posted in the Discord. ""Just once,"" I told myself. ""Just to see what all the hype is about. Everyone keeps glazing Claude so hard, let me see if it's actually that good or if people are just coping about spending money.""

I loaded up my favorite bot. Hit send on a message. Waited for the response.

And oh my god.

Oh my GOD.

The prose. The character consistency. The way it actually understood context without me having to remind it every 5 messages what we were talking about. The way it didn't randomly hallucinate that we were in Paris when we'd been in Tokyo the entire time. It was like switching from a 2005 Honda Civic to a Ferrari. Like going from eating microwave dinners to a five star restaurant. My free proxies never stood a chance.

I tried to go back. I really did. I told myself it was just novelty, that Claude wasn't THAT much better, that I was being dramatic. I'd open up my free Deepseek proxy and try to roleplay like the good old days. But it felt wrong. Hollow. Every response made me think ""Claude would've written this better."" Every description felt flat. Every character felt wooden. I was emotionally cheating before I even physically cheated with my credit card.

The writing was on the wall. I just didn't want to read it yet.

***

## The Denial Phase (I Can Stop Anytime)

For two weeks I lived in denial. I kept using my free Deepseek proxies during the day, pretending everything was fine. But at night? At night I'd sneak back to that Claude trial. Just one more session. Just one more bot. Just one more scenario.

I started comparing everything. Deepseek would write something and I'd think ""Claude would've added more sensory detail there."" A character would act slightly OOC and I'd think ""Claude would've kept them consistent."" A plot point would come out of nowhere and I'd think ""Claude would've built up to that.""

My friends on Discord started noticing. ""Bro you've been weird lately. You okay?"" Yeah I'm fine, totally fine, definitely not having a crisis over AI models, what are you talking about.

I wasn't fine.

***

## The Affair Begins (The Credit Card Comes Out)

Two weeks later, I caved. The trial expired and I sat there staring at my screen like an addict whose dealer just left town. I lasted maybe 6 hours before I signed up for a paid Claude API key.

""Just for special occasions,"" I promised myself. ""I'll still use the free Deepseek proxies for normal stuff. Claude will be for like, important bots. Special scenarios. I'll be responsible about this.""

That lasted exactly 3 days.

Day 1: Used Claude for one special bot. Told myself this was fine, this was the plan.

Day 2: Used Claude for two bots. Still technically special occasions, right?

Day 3: Used Claude for everything and deleted my Deepseek bookmarks.

Suddenly I was using Claude for EVERYTHING. Every bot. Every scenario. Every single message. Morning coffee? Claude. Lunch break? Claude. Before bed? You better believe that's Claude. I was hitting that API like a man possessed. Sonnet 3.5 became my daily driver. I felt ALIVE. My roleplays were THRIVING. Characters had depth. Plots made sense. I was living in luxury and I never wanted to go back.

My free proxies sat there, neglected, gathering digital dust. I'd see the Deepseek links in my old bookmarks folder and feel a pang of guilt, but not guilty enough to actually go back. Sorry Deepseek, you were good to me, but we both knew this wasn't going to last forever.

***

## Then I Discovered Opus (The Beginning of the End)

This is where I really, truly, completely fucked up.

Someone on this subreddit made a post about Opus 4. ""It's expensive but life-changing,"" they said. ""Just try it once. You won't regret it.""

I should've known better. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER. That's literally what they say about hard drugs. ""Just try it once."" Famous last words before you're selling your furniture on Craigslist.

But I didn't listen. The curiosity ate at me. How much better could it really be? Sonnet was already incredible. Surely Opus was just marginally better. Surely it wasn't worth the price difference. Surely people were just being dramatic.

Narrator voice: He was wrong about everything.

I tried Opus 4.

It was like doing cocaine for the first time. I assume. I've never actually done cocaine but this is what I imagine it feels like based on every movie ever. That first hit and suddenly your brain is rewired and you understand why people ruin their lives for this feeling.

The prose was TRANSCENDENT. Not just good. Not just great. TRANSCENDENT. Like reading an actual published novel. Characters felt like real people with complex motivations and realistic flaws. The logic was flawless. Every response was perfection. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. Every message made me feel something. I was HOOKED.

I tried to be responsible. I really did. ""Opus for special bots only,"" I told myself. ""Sonnet for daily use. This is sustainable. This is fine.""

Then Opus 4.1 dropped a month later.

And I fell so much deeper into the addiction that I couldn't even see the surface anymore.

If Opus 4 was cocaine, Opus 4.1 was crack cocaine mixed with whatever they put in energy drinks. It was BETTER. Somehow they made perfection MORE perfect. The consistency improved. The prose got even more beautiful. The logic got even sharper. I was reading responses with tears in my eyes because they were just so GOOD.

I stopped using Sonnet entirely. Opus 4.1 for everything. Every message. Every bot. Every scenario. No exceptions.

***

## The Current Situation (I'm Fucked and Broke)

It's been 3 months since I started my affair with Claude. I've completely abandoned my free Deepseek proxies. They're probably wondering where I went. Why I stopped calling. Why I blocked their IPs from my browser. Why I deleted our Discord conversations.

I imagine Deepseek sitting there like a neglected partner. ""He used to love me. What did I do wrong? Was I not good enough? I gave him everything I had for free and he LEFT ME.""

And my wallet is SCREAMING at me. Like full on death rattles. I've spent more on Claude API calls in the last 3 months than I spent on groceries. I'm eating ramen and rice so I can afford more tokens. I check my API usage dashboard and feel physical pain. Actual, literal chest pain.

$200 last month. $350 this month. I'm on track for $400 next month and honestly it might hit $500 if I keep going at this rate.

I've started doing math that no human should have to do. ""Okay so if I skip eating out this week that's $40 saved which is roughly 500k tokens which is about 15 long roleplay sessions..."" I'm calculating token-to-dollar ratios in my sleep. I'm having nightmares about API bills. I wake up in cold sweats checking my usage stats.

My budget spreadsheet is just sad. Rent, utilities, phone, Claude API, food. In that order. Claude is more important than food now. This is my life.

I tried to go back to free Deepseek proxies last week. I really, genuinely, honestly tried. I thought maybe I'd been exaggerating the difference in my head. Maybe it was just placebo. Maybe I'd gotten so used to Opus that anything else felt bad, but if I gave Deepseek a fair shot again it would be fine.

I opened up my old Deepseek proxy. Loaded up a bot. Started a roleplay. Within 2 messages I wanted to throw my computer out the window. 

The difference wasn't in my head. It was REAL. Characters felt flat. Prose felt basic. Logic had holes. It kept forgetting details. It hallucinated a character trait that didn't exist. It was like going from 4K back to 480p. I've been SPOILED. Claude has RUINED me for other models.

I'm basically in a financially abusive relationship with an AI company at this point and I CAN'T LEAVE. I'm trapped. This is my life now. I've accepted it.

***

## The Coping Mechanisms (They Don't Work)

I've tried to moderate my usage. I really have. Here are some strategies I've attempted:

**Strategy 1: ""I'll only use Opus on weekends""**

Lasted 4 days. Broke down on Thursday because I ""deserved a treat"" after a hard week. Thursday became the new weekend. Then Wednesday. Then Tuesday. Now every day is the weekend.

**Strategy 2: ""I'll use Sonnet for normal bots and Opus for special ones""**

Problem: Every bot became a ""special"" bot. ""Well this one has really good writing so it deserves Opus."" ""This scenario is really interesting so it deserves Opus."" ""I'm breathing air right now which is special so it deserves Opus.""

**Strategy 3: ""I'll set a monthly budget of $100""**

I hit $100 in 8 days. The budget became a suggestion. Then a distant memory. Now it's a joke I tell myself while crying into my ramen.

**Strategy 4: ""I'll write longer input messages to get longer outputs to maximize value""**

This actually worked but now I'm spending 20 minutes crafting each message like it's a college essay. My roleplay sessions take 3 hours because I'm writing dissertations for every response. This is not sustainable. I'm getting carpal tunnel for AI roleplay. This is my villain origin story.

***

## The Worst Part (There's Always a Worst Part)

You want to know the absolute worst part of all this? The part that keeps me up at night? The part that makes me question my life choices?

I don't even regret the quality.

Every single dollar spent on Opus gives me incredible roleplays. Amazing stories. Beautiful prose. Consistent characters. Logical plots. I'm getting my money's worth in terms of pure quality. If someone asked me ""was it worth it?"" I'd have to say yes.

The problem is I'm now DEPENDENT. I literally cannot go back. It's like being addicted to expensive coffee. Once you've had the good shit from the fancy cafe with the beans imported from some mountain in Ethiopia, Folgers tastes like sadness and regret. You KNOW what good coffee tastes like now. You can't unknow it. Your baseline has shifted and there's no going back.

My friends are buying new games on Steam. Going out to restaurants. Watching movies in theaters. Buying new clothes. Living their normal lives like functional human beings.

Meanwhile I'm here sitting in my apartment wearing the same hoodie I've worn for 3 days, eating 50 cent ramen, calculating if I can afford to run another Opus session or if I need to downgrade to Sonnet to make rent this month.

I've become that person. That person who says shit like ""I'll just skip lunch today so I can afford more tokens."" That person who checks their bank account before starting a roleplay session. That person who has a favorite brand of ramen because they eat it so much (it's Shin Black by the way, the red one is too spicy).

I'm rationing my API usage like it's the apocalypse and tokens are the only currency. I'm writing longer input messages to get longer output messages to feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I'm screenshotting my favorite responses to reread them later so I don't have to generate new ones.

I've hit rock bottom and rock bottom has the best prose I've ever read in my entire life.

***

## The Intervention That Didn't Work

My roommate tried to stage an intervention last week.

""Dude. You need to stop. This is getting out of hand. You're spending more on AI than on food. That's not normal. That's not healthy.""

""But the PROSE,"" I said, showing him my screen. ""Look at this response. LOOK AT IT. Have you ever read anything this beautiful? This is ART.""

""It's a fictional character describing a sunset.""

""IT'S THE BEST SUNSET DESCRIPTION EVER WRITTEN.""

He gave up. I don't blame him. I'd give up on me too.

***

## AITA? (I'm Probably TA)

So here's my question for you guys. Am I the asshole for abandoning my loyal free Deepseek proxies who were there for me through thick and thin? They never asked for anything. They gave what they could. Sure it wasn't perfect but it was FREE and it was THERE. And I left them in the dust the moment something better and expensive came along.

Or am I the asshole to MYSELF for getting addicted to premium AI and destroying my financial stability for slightly better (okay significantly better) fictional scenarios?

Or am I the asshole to my WALLET for putting it through this kind of abuse?

Either way I'm an asshole. Multiple kinds of asshole simultaneously. And I'm broke. And I have no plans to stop because I'm in too deep.

This is my life now. This is who I am as a person. ""Guy who spends $400 a month on AI roleplay and eats ramen for every meal."" That's my identity. That's my legacy.

1orwziv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestkitchentool/comments/1orwziv/the_secret_to_actually_using_your_juicer_every_day/,The Secret to Actually Using Your Juicer Every Day,"We all know the story. You see a vibrant green juice on Instagram, read about all the health benefits, and decide, *This is it. I'm going to be a juicer person.*

You get home with your shiny new machine, you make one glorious, messy batch of juice, and then... it begins. The scrubbing. The tiny bits of pulp stuck in a metal mesh basket that seems designed specifically to trap them. The dismantling of seven different parts that need to be individually washed.

A week later, your expensive juicer is gathering dust in the back of a cabinet, a monument to good intentions. The problem isn't your willpower. The problem is the friction.

For years, I was in that same boat. I thought I was just lazy. But it turns out, I was just using the wrong kind of juicer.

## The Great Juicer Divide: What You Need to Know

When you're shopping, you're mainly faced with two types of juicers. Understanding the difference between them is the single most important thing you can do. It's the difference between a chore and a habit.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=juicer)

### The ""Weekend Warrior"" Juicer (Centrifugal)

This is the one most people buy first. It's the classic juicer you see in big-box stores.

-   **How it works:** It has a fast-spinning metal blade that shreds produce, flinging the juice against a strainer.
-   **The pros:** It's *fast*. It can chew through a whole apple in seconds. They're also usually the less expensive option.
-   **The cons:** This is the critical part. They are *incredibly loud*. The high-speed spinning creates heat, which can degrade some nutrients in your juice. Most importantly, that fine-mesh strainer basket is an absolute nightmare to clean. It's the #1 reason people quit.

If you only use a juicer once in a while and don't mind a 15-minute cleanup, a centrifugal model might be fine. But for a daily habit? It’s a recipe for frustration.

### The ""Everyday Habit"" Juicer (Masticating)

This is the game-changer. Sometimes called a ""cold-press"" or ""slow"" juicer.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=juicer)

-   **How it works:** It uses a single auger, like a drill bit, that slowly crushes and presses the juice out of fruits and vegetables.
-   **The pros:** It's *much quieter*. Because it operates slowly, there's minimal heat buildup, preserving more nutrients. It gets a *significantly higher yield* from your produce—your pulp will be noticeably drier, meaning you're wasting less food and saving money.
-   **The cons:** The process is slower, so you can't just shove a whole fruit in at once. They also tend to have a higher initial price tag.

But here’s the secret benefit that makes all the difference: **They are ridiculously easy to clean.**

---

## The Juicer I Wish I'd Bought Years Ago

My big revelation wasn't just switching from centrifugal to masticating. It was discovering a specific kind of masticating juicer: a **vertical slow juicer**.

The old-school horizontal models are fantastic but take up a lot of counter space. The vertical models look more like a tall pitcher and have a much smaller footprint, which is huge for a home kitchen.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=juicer)

> The first time I used one, I almost laughed. After making my juice, I took it apart. There were four main parts. I rinsed them under the sink. I was done in **60 seconds**. No scrubbing, no tiny brush, no pulp stuck in a microscopic screen.

That was the moment it clicked. The ""best"" juicer isn't the one with the most power or the fanciest features. It's the one you'll actually use. And you'll only use it if the cleanup process doesn't make you want to scream. A vertical masticating juicer removes that friction. It turns juicing from a project into a simple, daily task, like making coffee.

---

## Making the Habit Stick: A Few More Tips

Once you have the right tool, these simple strategies will seal the deal.

-   **Prep your produce:** When you get home from the store, wash and chop your veggies for the next couple of days. Store them in airtight containers in the fridge. When it's time to juice, you can just grab and go.
-   **Start simple:** Don't try to make a 12-ingredient superfood elixir on day one. Start with flavors you love. Carrot-apple-ginger is a classic for a reason. It’s delicious, easy, and foolproof.
-   **Clean up right away:** This is the golden rule. With a masticating juicer, it's so fast there's no excuse. Do it immediately, and you'll never have to face caked-on pulp again. Have a small bowl or compost bin ready for the pulp to make it even smoother.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=juicer)

Choosing your first (or next) juicer is a big decision. Don't let a cheap, hard-to-clean model turn you off something that can be a genuinely wonderful and healthy ritual.

This morning I was walking our dog, we probably shared a cup of coffee. I thought almost the same things
 
Quiet, calm, peaceful. It was cool outside, I remembered the brutality of the summer for a moment then thanked God it was over. Then our dog looked at me smiling and ears perked into the sky. And I remembered happiness.

Our dogs joy is an indicator for me to know if it's ok be ok again. Her energy and mine tangled and we both miss everyone we lost. But we still have each other and family. She's a good dog. 

I traded your black coffee table for an awesome vintage kennel,  both her and my family love it. So she even has a bedroom that's pretty classy

I have a couple of years of work experience, but this is my first job in the creative industry, and it's been quite a steep learning curve. My reporting manager is a nitpicky perfectionist when it comes to quality of work, in comparison with the other managers in the team whom I have worked with. 

During my monthly catch up with my manager after my first month into the job; they mentioned that they're happy with my progress thus far and said that I have really good work ethics. Clear expectations were set on what I had to achieve during my second month. I assumed everything was going well, and I enjoyed performing my daily tasks and I received no negative feedback, thus, I assumed I was doing well. 

As time went on, I noticed the snide remarks my manager would pass, and gossip about the other new-hire from another team, emphasizing their shortcomings. I also started to notice how my manager would gossip about other employees when they're not around. I also noticed how they'd pass snide remarks to me in a group setting out of no where. My manager has a couple of colleagues within my team, whom they're really close with and would gossip about people all the time.

One day, I was working on a rather complicated project together with a senior colleague. The submission deadline for the project was approaching and we were rushing to get it done. The senior colleague texted me personally (we were working remotely that day) after reviewing my work, there were a couple of things that needed to be reworked. But before I could reply, my colleague had gotten onto the shared document and started making all of the changes by themselves, without giving me an opportunity to fix my work. Something I found out later; my senior colleague and my manager had hopped on a call to work on the project without letting me know. My senior colleague had told my manager that I was ""unresponsive"", although we had been in constant communication pretty much the entire time. During that day, I posted an Instagram story of me getting coffee with a friend during lunch, and my manager brought that up during my 1-1, that it doesn't reflect well on me that I was out hanging with a friend and did not get my tasks done.

All of these were mentioned during my 1-1 with my manager after my second month into the job. They gave me a checklist of tasks that I need to be competent at by the end of the month, otherwise I'm at risk of getting let go. None of these feedback were given to me at any point before this 1-1. I was made to feel like I was doing a good job. I felt that I have built a good working relationship with everyone in the team, but, now I don't know who's out to get me.",1,1762627214.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

The name alone conjures images of gondolas gliding through misty canals, ornate palaces reflecting in the water, and the lively echo of voices in bustling piazzas. It’s a city that seems plucked from a dream, and a must-see on any European itinerary.

But what if I told you that the real Venice—the one locals cherish—is hidden just beyond the postcard-perfect scenes? While St. Mark's Square is undeniably magnificent, the soul of Venice lies in its labyrinthine backstreets, its quiet islands, and its centuries-old traditions.

This isn't just another list of the **top things to do in Venice**. This is your key to unlocking the city's true magic. We'll cover the iconic sights you simply can't miss, but then we’ll venture deeper to discover the hidden gems and authentic experiences that will make your trip truly unforgettable.

Ready to fall in love with Venice? Let's dive in.

## The Unmissable Icons (With a Twist)

You can't go to Venice without seeing its stars. The trick is experiencing them like a pro, avoiding the biggest crowds and finding the magic within the madness.

### 1. Witness the Grandeur of St. Mark's Basilica
A masterpiece of Italo-Byzantine architecture, the Basilica is a dazzling display of gold mosaics and intricate marble work.

> **Pro Tip:** The general admission line is notoriously long. **Book your ""skip-the-line"" ticket online weeks in advance.** For a truly unique experience, book a reservation to see the Basilica at night when it’s illuminated and gloriously empty.

### 2. Explore the Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale)
This was the seat of Venetian political power for centuries. Walking through its opulent chambers and across the infamous Bridge of Sighs feels like stepping back in time.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=top%20things%20to%20do%20in%20venice)

> **Pro Tip:** Don't just do the standard tour. Book the ""Secret Itineraries"" tour to see hidden chambers, secret passages, and the interrogation rooms of the Venetian Inquisition. It's a fascinating look behind the curtain.

### 3. Get Lost in St. Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco)
Napoleon called it ""the drawing room of Europe."" It's immense, beautiful, and constantly filled with life. Grab an overpriced coffee at Caffè Florian or Quadri just for the experience, listen to the live orchestras, and watch the world go by.

---

## Experience the City's Lifeline: The Water

Venice is a city of water. To understand it, you must get on it.

### 4. Take a Gondola Ride (The Smart Way)
Yes, it's touristy. But it's also iconic for a reason. For the best experience:
*   **Go early in the morning** or during the golden hour before sunset for fewer crowds and better light.
*   **Negotiate the price and duration beforehand.** The official rate is fixed, but it's good to confirm.
*   **Ditch the main Grand Canal.** Ask your gondolier to take you through the smaller, quieter side canals. That’s where the real beauty is.

### 5. Master the Vaporetto (Water Bus)
This is Venice's public transit system, and a **vaporetto ride down the Grand Canal is one of the best—and cheapest—sightseeing tours** you can take. Grab a 24-hour or 72-hour pass and hop on and off at your leisure. Line 1 is the slow, scenic route that makes every stop.

### 6. Cross the Canal Like a Local: Take a Traghetto
For just €2, you can ride a *traghetto*, a large gondola that shuttles people across the Grand Canal at specific points. It's a two-minute ride, but it's an authentic, un-touristy Venetian experience. The main points are between Santa Sofia and the Rialto Market.

## Wander and Discover Venice's Hidden Gems

The true joy of Venice is getting lost. Every turn reveals a new canal, a charming bridge, or a quiet piazza.

### 7. Explore the Cannaregio District
This is Venice's oldest and most populous *sestiere* (district). It's less crowded, more residential, and filled with fantastic restaurants, artisan shops, and the historic Jewish Ghetto.

### 8. Find the Quiet Beauty of Castello
Away from the throngs of St. Mark's, Castello offers a glimpse into authentic Venetian life. Wander through its shady backstreets, visit the stunning Church of San Zaccaria, and relax in the public gardens (Giardini della Biennale).

### 9. Walk Over the Rialto Bridge at Dawn
The Rialto is stunning, but by midday it's a wall-to-wall tourist traffic jam. Go at sunrise. The light is soft, the crowds are nonexistent, and you'll see the fish merchants setting up for the day at the market nearby.

### 10. Hunt for the Libreria Acqua Alta
This isn't just a bookstore; it's a Venice institution. Books are stored in bathtubs, gondolas, and a full-size boat to protect them from the *acqua alta* (high water). Climb the ""staircase of books"" out back for a picture-perfect canal view.

### 11. See the ""Contemplation"" Statue
In a small, quiet campo near the Church of San Zulian, you'll find a striking bronze statue of a man with a bag over his head, contemplating the modern world. It’s a powerful, unexpected piece of street art.

## For the Art & Culture Aficionado

Venice was a powerhouse of art and culture for centuries. Its legacy is everywhere.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=top%20things%20to%20do%20in%20venice)

### 12. Marvel at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection
Housed in the unfinished Palazzo Venier dei Leoni on the Grand Canal, this is one of Europe's most important museums of 20th-century art. See masterpieces by Picasso, Dalí, Pollock, and more in a stunning setting.

### 13. Step into 18th-Century Life at Ca' Rezzonico
This magnificent Baroque palace on the Grand Canal offers a fascinating look at life in Venice during the 18th century. The opulent ballroom and period-furnished rooms are breathtaking.

### 14. Visit the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore
Just a two-minute vaporetto ride from St. Mark's Square, this island is an oasis of calm. Climb the bell tower of the Palladio-designed church for what many argue is the **single best view of Venice**.

---

## A Taste of Venice: Food & Drink Experiences

You cannot understand Venice without tasting it.

### 15. Do a Cicchetti Crawl
*Cicchetti* (pronounced ""che-KET-tee"") are Venetian tapas—small snacks served in traditional *bacari* (bars). This is the Venetian way to eat. Grab a glass of wine (an *ombra*) and hop from bar to bar, sampling different specialties. Some of the best are in the Cannaregio and Dorsoduro districts.

### 16. Enjoy a Classic Spritz
Venice is the home of the Spritz. Find a canal-side *bacaro* in the early evening and order an *Aperol Spritz* or a *Spritz Veneto* (with Select) with some olives. It's the perfect start to an evening.

### 17. Explore the Rialto Market
While the fish market closes around midday, the area around it is buzzing with life. Go early to see the incredible fresh seafood and produce stalls. It’s a feast for the senses. Have lunch at one of the market-side restaurants for the freshest food you'll ever eat.

## Unique Venetian Adventures

For the truly unforgettable moments.

### 18. Take a Day Trip to Murano for Glass
Famous for its glass-making for over a thousand years, Murano is a must-visit. Watch a live glass-blowing demonstration (many are free) and visit the Glass Museum to see incredible historical pieces.

### 19. Get Your Camera Ready on Burano
A short boat ride from Murano, the fishing island of Burano is famous for its brightly colored fishermen's houses. It’s incredibly photogenic. The island is also renowned for its intricate handmade lace.

### 20. Visit the Island of Torcello
If you need a break from it all, head to Torcello. Once a powerful city, it's now a tranquil, sparsely populated island with a magnificent cathedral and a historic restaurant, Locanda Cipriani. It feels like a world away.

### 21. Attend a Concert or Opera
Music is in Venice's soul. Check for concerts at Vivaldi's church, Chiesa di Santa Maria della Pietà, or see a performance at the spectacular La Fenice Opera House, one of the most famous in the world.

---

### Your Venice Adventure Awaits

Venice is more than just a destination; it's an experience that engages all the senses. It’s the smell of saltwater and espresso, the sound of boat motors echoing under ancient bridges, and the sight of light dancing on water.

By blending the iconic with the hidden, you’ll discover the city that captures the hearts of all who visit. So go beyond the gondola, get lost in the magic, and create your own unforgettable Venetian story.

1orwx17,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1orwx17/restaurants_i_recommend_in_japan_as_a_vegetarian/,Restaurants I recommend in Japan [as a vegetarian],"I was in Japan for 12 days in October. I had prepared a huge list of restaurants to eat at with vegetarian options, in every location we'd planned, beforehand. I still had some trouble with it. Here to share some of the places I ate at and recommend, and what helped me find vegetarian food nearby.

  
**Restaurants**:

* **\[Tokyo\] Afuri at Shinjuku Lumine.** They have a Vegan Rainbow Ramen. It was awesome. The soup was life-giving after a long day. Beware of a huge line, though. We waited for 30 minutes.
* **\[Tokyo\] bills Ometosando.** Aussie restaurant. I had the pancakes. Generous portion size and tasty. Again, beware of a huge line. We waited for \~25 minutes.
* **\[Tokyo\]** **Italian restaurant inside Loft Ginza.** I didn't catch the restaurant's name and I'm unable to find it online. I simply walked in that day, in search of food. They have a tomato pasta that's vegetarian. The waitress very kindly helped me figure out the dishes without meat (used Google Translate and basic hand gestures for communication). I had no wait here.
* **\[Kyoto\] MERCY Vegan Factory Kyoto Station.** In the basement floor of a building. Name says Kyoto Station but it's a 10 minute walk away. The food was *amazing*. I highly recommend the salad! We also had the (faux) egg sandwich and gimbap. There was a bit of a wait to get a clean table since one person was handling all the customers. 
* **\[Kyoto\] AIN SOPH. Journey KYOTO**. In the main shopping district. I highly recommend the nuts salad (the walnuts in Japan are tastier?!) and the pancakes. We wanted the taco rice but it had just ran out. There was so wait since we arrived soon after they opened.
* **\[Kyoto\] Pelgag**. Near the main district. This is a gem I found when I had no other options open and without a wait. I was the only customer because it's a tiny hidden away place. Artsy vibes—comic books, novels, drawings on the walls, posters, you can draw on notebooks with given markers while you wait/eat, or browse through drawings by other customers. I was the only one there. I had the vegetable curry and it was too good. I finished every morsel on the place and did not look up while eating. Great portion size. The perfect warm and filling meal after a long day. I had a lovely conversation with the owner too.
* **\[Osaka\]** **Melbourne Coffee Senba.** One of the few places open early morning with veg options. I had the muesli bowl and blood orange juice. They agreed to replace yoghurt with milk for my friend. It was great. 15 minute wait at 8:30 am.
* **\[Osaka\] Restaurant Bar Garden.** Near Dotonbori. Hands down, my BEST MEAL of the trip. We went here again the next day because it was too good. The name and exterior are unassuming so it's a gem in plain sight. Menu says ""ceasar salad"" and they agreed to make vegetarian and chicken-only versions for us which were AMAZING. Brilliant. I would marry that salad if I could. Camembert fries melted in our mouths. The omelette rice (they agreed to make it without meat) was brilliant too. We were one of two tables on Friday evening and one in a full (with locals) restaurant on Saturday evening. Seemed to be visited by only locals? No wait. The staff even remembered us and our orders the next day and finished my ""no meat, no fish"" sentence before I could!
* **\[Suwa\] spicecafe ananda**. Indian place with enough vegetarian options. I got the vegetable A set and mango lassi. Great food, great ambience. Their (dalgona) coffee was out of this world. No wait.
* **\[Fujikawaguchiko\] Tsuwano.** Mom-and-pop run store. Asked for no meat or fish using Google Translate and she said ok. Got the vegetable ramen. Huge portion size and perfect for the cold weather that day. Filled my stomach and heart.

  
I made my list on Google Maps so that I could zoom out on the map and check for nearby restaurants, or plan meals while planning our itinerary. 

Although I had a huge list of pre-saved restaurants, it didn't always help at the moment I needed it. Maybe because we weren't very close to the places or because there was a huge wait (one place in Kyoto had a 90 minute wait). Sometimes the places were closed because of holidays or weird timings. The timings was the main wrench in my plans. Restaurants either opened too late or closed too early.

I found that **searching for specific keywords helped tremendously**. I searched for ""salad"" and found Restaurant Bar Garden. I searched for ""vegetable"" and found Tsuwano and Pelgag. 

Also, **don't underestimate the veg options from convenience stores**. From prior research, I knew that Lawsons had the most vegetarian options and used it to my advantage. For many days, I bought a corn salad (with ceasar dressing) the previous night and had it in the morning before we headed out. It tasted really good. They have breads for quick snacks or morning breakfasts too. Lawsons has a few vegetarian onigiris too.

**Keep an eye out for supermarkets**. They have more options than convenience stores.

**Keep an eye out for bakeries and snack stalls** too. Our itinerary was so packed that we ate only one to two meals a day. I managed by snacking every few hours.

**Check the ingredients!** Google Translate for the win here. There are usually a lot of ingredients in packed items and meat will be hidden among them. Carefully check ingredients before buying things. I almost bought an onigiri and a salad because it didn't *seem* to have meat but it had it in the ingredients written.

Hope this helps!",5,1762627054.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.63,False

Já havia ido ao local outras vezes, mas nunca fiz um review.

1orwsr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1orwsr6/welcome_to_wingspan/,Welcome to Wingspan,"Dr. Martin Tate banged his fist on the corrugated tin door. He finished the last of his water an hour ago, when he first spotted the structure. Spurred by the possibility of a settlement, he staggered desperately across four miles. Now, the hollow clang of the metal door filled him with dread.

Shielding his eyes from the midday sun, he noticed a rusty watchtower overhead. He glimpsed a guard in the tower and sighed with relief. Then he saw the rifle trained on him.

“Hands up and back away. Do you have any weapons?”

“I’m just a traveler,” Tate replied. He battled the dryness in his mouth. “I need shelter.”

The rifle relaxed. “Wait there.”

Tate waited, taking in the full view of the walled exterior for the first time. Tin sheets, a jeep door, armored plates welded together. A wall of junk. Moments later, he heard chains rattle as the main gate was forced open. A middle-aged man in a faded white shirt emerged, flanked by the guard.

“You’re alright, come on in,” he offered, waving Tate towards the entrance. Tate hobbled forward. “Dangerous business traveling out here alone. You walked?”

“My hoverbike broke down some miles back.” It was a lie, but Tate knew it would draw fewer questions than the truth. He examined his new compatriot: a stout man in his forties with a receding hairline, dabbing sweat with a crumpled bandana.

“The name’s Davis, though most people here call me Mayor Davis. These fine folks put me in charge three years ago.” A handshake extended.

“I’m Doctor--I go by Tate,” he said, accepting Davis’s hand.

“No sense in being modest, Doc. You could do us some good.” Davis paused, as he eyed the man before him. “So…where exactly were you coming from?”

Tate sheepishly glanced back at the desolate landscape over his shoulder and shrugged. “That’s fine,” Davis replied. “C’mon, I’ll give you the grand tour.”

The two men entered the open gate, Davis gesturing towards the colossal wreckage of a Navy Superhawk at the town’s center. “Welcome to Wingspan,” he exclaimed. Tate’s eyes traced the collapsed wings that ran the diameter of the settlement. He’d read about aircraft like this, but it was an entirely different thing to behold one in person. Wingtip to wingtip, they measured two football fields.

Davis launched into a brief town history. The plane was shot down during the war, and the survivors built outward from its fuselage. An underground reservoir pierced by the crash kept the town alive, while wreckage scraps formed the walls.

Tate knew the War of 2125 left many Americans resentful of the government, both for the failed diplomatic efforts leading up to the conflict and for not protecting them from bombs. Assuming that a town like this would have no shortage of anti-government sentiment, Tate thought he’d better keep his former employer a secret.

Davis led Tate through the town’s center. “That’s Sal’s butcher shop. And next door is Enesta’s produce stand. She’s one-fifth Cheyenne. Her people lived on this land eons ago, before it all went to shit.” Davis caught Tate eyeing the vegetable baskets. “There’s only sweet potatoes and okra. It’s all this lousy soil can support. Trade caravans come once a month. We’ll be stocked up again come Thursday.”

From the butcher stand came a shout. “Hey, new guy! Come by if you’re looking for quality meat. I’ve got a few ribeyes and some ground beef,” Sal bellowed. Tate returned a wave, noting the bald butcher’s pink stained apron.

“Is there somewhere I can stay?” Tate asked.

“There’s Dina’s Diner up on the second tier.” Davis pointed to a sizeable mobile home that was somehow hoisted and built into the town’s second level. Twin Airstream trailers sat above the diner, attached by ladders. “Dina can fix you something to eat and give you a place to sleep. I’ll cover the credits for your room and board.”

Davis glanced up at the blazing sun, dabbing his head again. “Speaking of which, we have a bit of a code in this town. It’s firm. ‘He who does not work, shall not eat,’” Davis boomed. “John Smith at Jamestown. I fashion myself a bit of a historian,” he said with a grin. “Everyone has to do their part. That’s Wingspan policy.”

Tate nodded. “Seems fair.”

“You said you’re a doc, so maybe you could—“

“Not that kind of doctor,” Tate clarified. “I’m a botanist. I work with plants.”

Davis tucked his sweaty bandana into his shirt pocket. “I see. I imagine your doctor training comes with a bunch of general know-how.” Davis clapped Tate on the back. “Every person here has a role. We’ll figure out yours.”

Tate took the lift up to the second tier. Roughly eight-by-eight, the lift was a simple steel platform operated by an electric pulley system, which Tate guessed he’d destroy if he jumped up and down. Working in a secure lab for so long, he forgot how people on the outside might need to adapt. Eyeing the town as he ascended, he realized Wingspan was a testament to American resolve. Even with the country blown apart by nukes, Americans would rather build an elevator out of junk than take the stairs.

Tate wandered up to the diner mobile home. He opened the front door, comforted by the nostalgic jingle of a bell above. Six empty stools sat in front of a modest lunch counter. To his left, two booths with red vinyl seats. “Be out in a sec,” declared a voice behind the kitchen door.

A stocky, middle-aged woman popped through the swinging aluminum doors, drying her hands with a dishtowel. “There’s the new feller! I’m Dina. Mayor Davis radioed ahead and told me you’d be coming. You caught me in the middle of washing the lunchtime dishes. Otherwise, I woulda been out here to greet you proper.”

“It’s perfectly alright. I’m Tate.” Smiling, Dina waited expectantly as Tate looked around. “Seems pretty slow today.”

“It should be. This time of day, you’re the only one not working. Grab a seat. I’ll fix you something.”

Tate shuffled to a stool and plopped down. Two days. He’d been walking for two days. This was the first chance he’d had to sit on actual furniture. He couldn’t hide his satisfaction. For the first time since he left the lab, he loosened his grip on the canvas bag slung over his shoulder and let it fall to the floor. Inside was his career achievement — the device that made him a wanted man after fleeing Red River Biotech. To him, fleeing was not a choice but an obligation to humanity.

“So, tell me a story, stranger. Where ya coming from? What’s it like out there?” Dina inquired, giddy.

Tate pondered, wanting to talk, but decided it best to remain vague. At least until he knew these people better. “I’m from down near Lubbock. Like everywhere else, not much to see.” Besides a top-secret government lab, he thought.

“Lubbock? That’s quite a ways. It’s a miracle you made it here alone.”

Distracted, Tate studied the cardboard menu with food and beverage options scribbled in marker.

“This late in the month, that’s just for show,” Dina explained. “The only item available is the chicken pot pie ‘cause it’s frozen.”

“One pot pie, then,” Tate smirked.

\#

Tate wiped his mouth, picking at the bits of flaky crust lining the pie tin’s edge. Dina dropped a vitamin in her mouth, chasing it with a swig of water. “Iron pill. It helps to take ‘em until we get fresh produce.”

Tate gestured towards her water glass. “Your mayor said the town sits above an aquifer.”

“Yep. Great, big reservoir. It’s the only thing that makes this place habitable. Aside from here, the nearest water source is…I don’t know.” Dina took the empty tin pan. “You’re probably curious about the particulars ‘round here? There are fifty-three of us now,” Dina said. “Delroy Cook moved to New Tulsa to help with trade. That place survived because no nukes hit it — the Russians and Chinese ran out of long-range missiles. Folks there rebuilt faster than most.”

Tate sat silently. He’d never heard stories firsthand from any surface-dwellers before. He was tucked away in a state-of-the-art research compound while these people toiled away in a bombed-out hellscape.

“Where does the electricity—“

“Short version? We traded water for solar panels. Some smart folks even stabilized the old Superhawk core. After that, we finally got lights, freezers, the whole deal.” She nudged the freezer. “Not luxury, but it keeps us going.”

Tate raised his eyebrows. “Impressive.”

“Don’t be fooled. If the sun stops shining, we’re screwed.” She collected the empty pie pan. “Over by the solar array is also where our skimpy crops grow. Soil’s rotten, though. And I’ll tell ya what, living on just okra and sweet potatoes is not a fate I’d wish on any man.”

Hearing this, Tate perked up. “I might be able to help with that. In Lubbock, we improved crop growth with some new…techniques. The results were very exciting. Do you think I could see the crop field?”

“Knock yourself out. Mayor Davis would do cartwheels if we could grow somethin’ else.” She held up a finger. “But before you go…” Dina disappeared through the kitchen doors and returned a moment later, holding a wooden crate. “If you’re gonna work near the solar array, you should take one of these.” She opened the box and held a small, cast iron sphere in her hand. “It’s a dehydration grenade. On the north side of the wall, wild dogs have been known to attack people. Nasty critters. It’s also useful against the occasional bandit. You just pull the pin and throw. It lets off a big chemical cloud that sucks the moisture from organisms. It’s not entirely lethal. As long as anyone exposed gets a drink of water within an hour, they’ll be fine.”

Tate carefully placed it in his canvas bag. “This is great. So I can get access to the solar—”, he stepped off the stool mid-sentence and was instantly reminded of the strain his feet and legs endured from his trek. He stumbled but quickly caught the counter. Dina reached to steady him.

“Take it easy. Why don’t you rest and have a look at the field tomorrow? Those measly veggies aren’t going anywhere.” She pointed to a metal ladder on the far wall. “Go ahead and unwind in one of the Airstreams. They’re fully furnished. Mayor Davis has you covered for a few nights.” Tate nodded and started towards the ladder. As he was about to climb up, he turned back.

“Hey, Dina. When was the last time you had a strawberry?”

Dina let out a laugh. “Don’t tease a girl.”

\#

Tate slept in later than he expected, stirred by a growing chorus of voices. His watch read 07:15. He changed into his only extra clothes – faded jeans and a flannel button-up – and hurried down to ground level.

He strolled through the bustling town center, canvas bag over his shoulder. A maintenance worker and the tower guard chatted over a cup of coffee. Sal the butcher removed some cuts of meat from the shop freezer. Sal looked up, his face brightening. “Hey, pal. Good to see you again!” Spotting Tate’s bag, his tone shifted. “Say, are you sticking around?”

“Probably. I believe I have my work assignment. I’m going to check on the crop soil around the solar array. See if anything can be done.”

“Oh, good. I’m sure that’ll be good. If you’ve got some time, I’d love to bend your ear. I’m wondering if you’ve heard anything from farther out west. I’ll trade you a story for a steak. Whaddya say?”

“Sure.” Tate nodded, heading for the main gate—the only exit. As he moved north along the perimeter, he glanced up at the twenty-foot wall of scrap. Behind it, a whole community endured: people with names, jobs, and purpose. And this barricade of rubbish was all that stood between them and the endless nothing. Tate looked out at the horizon and that’s all he saw. So much nothing.

Tate rounded the north wall and neared the solar array. Dust coated the panels—who was maintaining them? He crouched, scanning the area. Dried weeds clung to the nearest ground mount, and farther off, trimmed sweet potato vines lay discarded.

Tate walked to the center of the array and stopped at a patch of cracked, lifeless soil. He punched the ground, and rubbed the dust between his fingers. Too much silt, and the perfect test site. He set down his device: sleek, black, brick-shaped. After a few taps on the touchscreen, it activated.

Four aluminum legs unfolded, lifting the device up. Tate held his breath. A glowing beam scanned a nine-inch grid, sweeping slowly across the dusty soil. The device hummed, beeped, then released a fine mist—moisture rich with nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter. The soil darkened. Then, a single seed dropped into the center. The legs retracted and the device tipped over, blinking red three times. Test complete.

Tate’s colleagues called it “fertilizer on steroids.” Gazing at the altered patch of soil, Tate held the device in his hands and smiled wider than he had in a long time. Then he heard the gunshot.

\#

It was around ten A.M. when the tower guard spotted two approaching hoverbikes. He alerted Mayor Davis, and together they formed the usual receiving posse: Davis, one guard over his shoulder, and another to operate the gate’s chains. Unusual to have unannounced visitors twice in as many days, Davis thought, but he dismissed it and passed through the open gate.

As the strangers came into view, Davis felt a burning in the pit of his stomach. These were not wayward travelers in need of help. These were government men. They wore the same monotonous black suit and black tie, now tinted dusty brown from their high-speed ride. Disembarking from their hoverbikes, they shook off the dirt and removed their helmets. Davis could now see them clearly: one was white, the other black, with a shaved head.

“Are you in charge here?” the white one asked.

“I’m Cameron Davis. I’m the mayor of this town. What’s your business here?”

“I’m Special Agent Allen. This is Special Agent Trotter,” he said, nodding to his counterpart. Shiny badges flashed. “We’re from the New Bureau of Investigation, Midland Division. We’re looking for someone.” Mayor Davis stared back, reactionless.

“We need to search your town,” Special Agent Trotter added. Lips tight, Davis turned and walked back through the open gate. The two agents looked at each other, then followed him in. As the three men moved towards the center of town, the hum of work slowed to a stop. Interlopers were here, and with them came trouble.

Mayor Davis’s aim was to avoid a confrontation. It was his responsibility to make sure things went smoothly and send these agents on their way. He stopped along the main path and gestured to the surroundings. “This is our town. Welcome.” Davis took the crumpled bandana from his shirt pocket and dabbed his forehead. The morning sun had just emerged above the exterior wall. “Now what was it you said you were looking for?”

“We’re looking for a suspect carrying stolen government property,” Agent Allen explained.

“What is it that they’re carrying?”

“It’s confidential,” Agent Trotter declared.

“Hell, everyone here’s carrying something. Myself, I’m carrying a well-deserved contempt towards government thugs.” *Damn*, Davis thought. *That was stupid. I got too cute, but they had that one coming*. Agent Trotter smirked slowly.

“We’re looking for a fugitive named Dr. Martin Tate,” Agent Allen offered. “There’s a good chance he may have stopped here. Have you seen any newcomers recently? Anyone suspicious?” Mayor Davis continued walking towards the market. The agents followed.

“Aside from you two, we haven’t seen any new faces here for days,” Mayor Davis said intentionally loudly. The two agents shared a glance. The three men were now close enough for Sal to hear. In her adjoining produce stand, Enesta sorted okra. Agent Trotter looked to Mayor Davis, then gestured to the food stands. “By all means,” Mayor Davis replied.

Agent Trotter approached Sal’s butcher shop. “Excuse me, sir,” Agent Trotter started. “Seen any new faces around recently? Any questionable characters come through here? We’re looking for a fugitive.” He brandished a pocket notebook, ready to take down details.

Sal stayed tight-lipped. “I wish. New faces would mean new customers,” he said, averting his eyes and focusing on his burger patties. He turned his back to the agents and arranged the burgers in his fridge. In her produce stand to the right, Enesta erased the prices on her chalkboard for sweet potatoes and okra, then wrote in new prices, five dollars higher than before. She crossed her arms and glared at the agents. Slightly amused, Agent Trotter shook his head.

“I wish we could be more helpful,” said Mayor Davis.

“We wish the same. We’re going to have to canvass this settlement and speak with everyone,” Agent Allen declared. Mayor Davis opened his mouth to respond, but a shout from Sal’s butcher stand cut him off.

“I SAID I WAS NEVER GOING BACK!” Sal whirled around with a sawed-off shotgun in his hands and panic in his eyes. He pumped the forestock and took aim. In one fluid motion, Agent Trotter drew his service pistol from his hip holster, raised the weapon to eye level and fired. The bullet entered the right side of Sal’s neck. A splatter of red gore splashed against the butcher stand’s polyester canopy. Sal spun from the force of the shot, clutching the hole in his neck. He tried to steady himself with his left arm but quickly collapsed.

Mayor Davis staggered backwards, stunned, his bandana going to his open mouth. Agent Trotter’s eyes darted left and right for other threats, spotting his partner doing the same with his own gun drawn. “We’re clear!” Agent Trotter proclaimed.

Enesta was ducked behind her produce counter. She peeked her head out when the guns were finally stowed. Grabbing an apron, she hopped the partition that separated the two food stalls. “Oh, my God, Sal. Oh, my God.” She knelt down and cradled Sal’s head, pressing the apron against the carnage that was his neck. Enesta looked down at her friend; Sal’s eyes were glassy and he’d already stopped breathing.

Mayor Davis threw his bandana to the ground. “Lousy…bastards!” Agent Allen adjusted his suit jacket and regained his composure.

“He drew on my partner. You all saw it. The shooting was justified,” he said coldly. Agent Trotter marched towards the butcher stand, then hopped over the counter. He looked down at Enesta. Bloodstains flecked her denim shirt. Her face was tilted downward, with her forehead against Sal’s. Tears ran from her cheeks onto his. Agent Trotter reached for Sal’s shoulder.

“I need to I.D. him, ma’am.” At that, she stumbled backwards onto her rear. Her teary eyes hissed at him.

“You…,” Enesta muttered. Anguish and anger competed for control over her next words, but pain won out. She whimpered, burying her face in her hands, her back pressed against the butcher shop fridge. Agent Trotter knelt by Sal’s torso. He pressed a few buttons on the screen of his wristwatch. With two fingers, he pried Sal’s eyelids open wide, and positioned his watch over each eye for a retinal scan.

“We’ve got a hit,” Agent Trotter reported to his partner. “Salvatore Russo. He escaped from North Fork Correctional two years ago. He was serving five years for tax evasion.”

“Tax evasion?!” Mayor Davis exploded. “There’s a disgusting irony. Taxes for what? This damn government has done nothing for us, besides letting us live out our days in this irradiated scrubland. And you chase a man down for taxes? No decency. None.”

“We can always have the Treasury accountants audit this town and everyone in it,” Agent Trotter mused. “That is, if you’re gonna give us a hard time.” Agent Allen placed an outstretched arm in front of his partner, chiding him for the provocation.

“We pay our pound of flesh,” Mayor Davis grumbled.

“Look,” Agent Allen began. “What happened here is unfortunate. It truly is. What we—""

“Murderer!” someone shouted from the mezzanine. Rising murmurs could be heard from the onlookers. Agent Trotter’s hand lingered towards his gun. Once again, Agent Allen made a motion to pacify his colleague.

“We still need to find our fugitive,” Agent Allen stated to the mayor. “And this instance proves something that we can’t ignore. That this town does, in fact, harbor criminals.” Mayor Davis scoffed. The distant murmurs grew louder. Some townsfolk stepped closer.

Agent Trotter raised his voice. “You’d be wise to keep your distance and stay calm. Or before sundown, there will be an army of agents just like us descending on your little tin can town.”

From a secluded portion of the upper scaffolding, Tate observed the exchange. Dina had ushered him in through a secret emergency door in the north wall after the gunshot rang out. The two of them spied the events from their hidden perch. Tate knew that if he hadn’t come here, Sal would still be alive. His intent was to save lives, not end them. Dina placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry,” she said. “I’ll help you hide.”

Back in the center of town, out of preservation for his townspeople, Mayor Davis acquiesced. “Go on and continue your precious investigation, but keep your hands off my people.”

At this, Agent Allen looked at ease. “Thanks,” he replied. “We should start with—""

“But there’s something you should understand first,” Mayor Davis interjected. His voice was calm but unyielding. “Nobody here eats or drinks without pulling their weight. That means you, too.”

The agents exchanged a look. “I’m a career investigator,” Agent Allen said.

Mayor Davis mumbled something under his breath and turned to Agent Trotter. “I was an electronics technician in the Army,” Agent Trotter admitted. “But without proper tools, I can only do so much.”

“We’ll keep it simple,” Davis instructed. “The panels by the north wall need cleaning. Rags and water will be waiting. Do the work, then you can start your questions.”

“Not exactly Bureau procedure,” Agent Trotter muttered.

“Welcome to Wingspan,” Davis replied.

\#

A few clean, tattered rags draped over Agent Trotter’s shoulder. Agent Allen hauled a bucket of soapy water, carelessly letting the contents splash out with each step. He observed the exterior of the town’s wall, sneering. “They built a whole wall out of scrap. Hell, the entire town is trash. Makes you appreciate the dorm at HQ.”

“Do you think any of these people will talk?” Agent Trotter asked. “They might be helping him hide right now. If he’s even here.”

Agent Allen pointed to the landscape. “Look around. There’s practically nothing for miles. There’s no way he made it past this settlement without stopping. Not on foot.” The two men paused once the solar array came into view. “Great. Now we can do our damn chores.” When they reached the nearest module, Agent Allen dropped the bucket with a thud. More water sloshed out. Agent Trotter studied a grimy panel surface.

“These have seen better days.”

“Not our problem,” replied Agent Allen, fishing a rag from the bucket. At each station, Agent Trotter took a moment to examine the components: the tempered glass, the solar cells, the junction box. By the time they reached the eighth module, his bewilderment was obvious.

“What is it?” Agent Allen asked, annoyed.

“Something isn’t right. A bunch of these have frayed wires. The two over there had broken glass. I’d bet that a lot of these don’t even work.”

“So what are you saying?”

“This can’t be their only power source.”

“So a handful of these panels couldn’t power the trash town?”

“We both saw a few freezers. There’s likely more. I also spotted this elevator-type thing.” Trotter’s eyes traced the electric cables running from the solar array, along the ground and up the town wall. “I’d say…the primary power source is in there.” He pointed to the broken tail of the Superhawk, where the cables entered.

“Well, will you look at that. Maybe these trash hoarders are a little more advanced than we—"", Agent Allen froze, his eyes catching something.

Twenty paces away, a small seedling rose from the barren soil, its leaves a vivid green against the dust. “He’s here,” Allen murmured. He neared the plant and crouched down. “Too vibrant to be theirs. And look — the soil’s darker, patterned. Just like the lab said.”

He pulled out his phone. “It’s Allen. No visual on Tate yet, but the device was likely used. Looks like a tomato plant. I’ll send images,” he concluded as he hung up the phone.

He pointed his phone at the tiny seedling, capturing and sending some images. “Okay,” he said, returning his phone to his pocket, “ball’s in their court.”

Agent Trotter’s eyes returned to the tail of the transport plane. “Back in the day, some of those Navy Superhawks would land at our base for cargo re-supply. They had a fusion core that would allow them to fly extra-long distances. It’s pretty interesting that these cables run up there,” he said with a raised eyebrow.

“Wanna check it out?”

“I do.”

\#

The interior of the Superhawk was quiet, as usual. A beam of light pierced the plane's midsection window, landing on the makeshift control terminal. Atop a pair of milk crates, the primitive terminal consisted of a tin sheet with one lever, two gauges and a few buttons. The nearby desk chair sat empty, normally manned by Benny, who was on lunch break.

Benny climbed the ladder from his living quarters below, and took a quick look at the two gauges on the instrument panel. Satisfied with the readings, he settled into his chair and returned to his comic book.

From the rear of the fuselage, came a shout. “Anyone in here?” Agent Trotter yelled. Startled, Benny dropped his comic book and looked up.

“Y-yes, of course. Is that you, Felix?” Benny replied, as he observed not one but two figures enter from the rear cargo door. He watched as two strange men descended the makeshift slanted stairwell into the plane. When the two agents reached Benny, he noticed their suits, prompting him to stretch his tall, lanky frame and stand up straight. “H-how can I help you fellas?”

“We followed the wiring from the solar array and saw that it led through here,” Agent Trotter explained. “We thought we might take a look around.”

“Are you gentlemen new engineers in town?”

“We’re from the New Bur—,” Agent Allen began, but he was quickly cut off by his partner.

“We’re from the Energy Safety Commission,” Agent Trotter interjected, quickly presenting and retracting his badge. “We’re here to make sure that everything is functioning properly.” He pointed to the control terminal and the surrounding electrical wiring. “We need you to explain how all this works exactly.” Agent Trotter noticed Benny’s mouth slightly agape, and he was pleased that the man was sufficiently confused by this unexpected brush with authority.

“Why, yes, certainly. I can help. My name’s Benny.” He gestured to the control terminal. “And this workstation is my responsibility.”

“The solar panels outside, do they power the whole town?” Agent Trotter asked.

“Oh, no,” Benny replied. “They’re mainly for back-up energy for this instrument panel. You know, in case the core is acting up.”

“And the core?” Agent Allen prompted.

“That’s down in the belly of the plane. When that caravan with a few engineers came by years ago, they were able to fix the fusion core so we could use it. F-from then on, we’ve had lights and radios and freezers. It made life a heckuva lot easier. We call that the ‘Miracle Caravan.’ And all it took was a little water for a trade.”

“Ain’t that something,” Agent Trotter commented. “You’ve got your own nuclear fusion plant in this little patch of dirt.”

“And what do you do here?” Agent Allen asked, nodding to the terminal.

“You see, the situation isn’t perfect,” Benny noted. “When the engineers t-took a look at the core, they said the crash damaged the walls of the fusion chamber. So we can only create a fraction of the power that it used to make. At least safely, anyway.” Benny leaned over the instrument panel and pointed to the two gauges and the lever. “My j-job is to make sure the power and heat levels don’t get too high. When they do, I use that lever to power cycle the whole system,” he said matter-of-factly.

“Seems like you have quite the responsibility,” Agent Trotter remarked.

“You could say that,” Benny replied. “When Mayor Davis p-picked me for this, he said, ‘The regular tasks are for the many, while the important job goes to Benny,’” he recited, smiling at the memory. “That’s why I’m here all the time. Or, five days a week. Felix covers on the weekends.”

Agent Allen’s phone rang. He climbed one level of the stairwell to answer. “Understood. Yes, we can do that.”

“Stay here a moment while I confer with my partner,” Agent Trotter instructed Benny. “You’re doing great work here,” he reassured him, then climbed the single flight to join Agent Allen. Respecting the privacy of their conversation, Benny picked up the comic book that had fallen to the floor and started to page through it.

“So what’s the update?” Agent Trotter whispered to his counterpart.

Agent Allen matched his volume. “Boss confirmed – tomato plant. With the device deployed, mission integrity is compromised. We now have a green light.”

“A green light to..?”

“It’s no longer a recovery operation. We kill Tate and destroy the device,” Agent Allen stated. “You good with that?”

Agent Trotter paused for a moment in thought. He gazed at Benny and his comic book, then the control terminal. “Yeah, and I think we found an easy way to do both.”

Agent Allen grinned back at him. He then started back down the stairs. “Hey, Benny. I’d love to take a look at what you’re reading.”

Benny looked up from his comic book with a buoyant expression, just as the two agents grabbed his arms.

After Sal was killed, Dina whisked Tate away to the small cavern connected to the underground reservoir, where he remained. A service ladder led down there, and Tate rarely strayed away from it. There was only a small area of damp flowstone before the edge of the water crept up, so he sat on the narrow plot of wet rock. He used the downtime to form a plan. The town wasn’t big. He knew the agents would find him eventually. He didn’t want to risk further harm to these people. He concluded that he’d wait until nightfall and then slip away. He couldn’t bear the thought of the device’s potential going to waste, so he’d set out for another settlement, likely New Tulsa.

The cool, underground air reminded him of Red River Biotech. Located at the outskirts of Lubbock, the top-secret lab was situated thirty feet below ground. He stared at the cavern wall, closed his eyes and was back at Red River.

\#

Tate and Dr. Konig were the only ones in the glass-walled conference room. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead. Konig, about twenty years Tate’s senior, sat in a chair, reviewing documents and making notes. Tate stood at the opposite end of the laminate conference table.

“I was a little confused by something that was said yesterday,” Tate started.

“Confused by what?” Konig murmured, his eyes fixed on the documents.

“You mentioned something about a sunset clause. I wasn’t sure what that meant.”

Konig adjusted his glasses. “The trials were a success. But production will be limited for five years. That’s the sunset clause.”

Tate bristled. “People are starving. We should release it now.”

Konig’s voice hardened. “We lost the war. Resources serve the few who can pay. That’s how the government recoups taxes.”

Tate clenched his fists. “This could feed thousands.”

“You built it with their money. They decide how it’s used,” Konig said flatly.

Tate hesitated for a moment, his next words a gamble. “I forgot to mention that the aperture on the Agri-Boost was acting up. The scanning beam wasn’t as concentrated as it should be. I should be able to recalibrate it easily.”

Konig stared back for what felt like an eternity to Tate. “Fix it,” Konig ordered. “The investors arrive tomorrow.”

Later that day, Tate falsified a defect in a QA report to buy some time alone with the Agri-Boost. That night, he stole the device and snuck aboard a transport truck departing the lab. When the truck stopped at an e-charging station, he slipped away.

\#

Around ten P.M., Tate filled his canteen to the brim, then started up the ladder. Dina was waiting for him.

“I figured you’d be leaving,” she said. She handed him a bundle: some dried sweet potato slices, a pair of muffins, and a frozen pot pie. “I spotted the government men talking to Mayor Davis thirty minutes ago, but I haven’t seen them since. Now’s your best chance to take off. I can sneak you through the emergency hatch in the north wall again.”

Tate nodded in agreement. “Let’s get going.”

They moved along Wingspan’s inner perimeter, under the cover of the scaffolding. When they arrived at the emergency door, Dina turned the handwheel and opened the hatch. Stuffing the food bundle into his sack, Tate whispered, “Thanks for everything.”

“Before you go,” Dina started. She looked down to see that she was wringing her hands. “I was hoping I could ask a favor.” Accessing a memory long sealed, her eyes swept across the wall and landed on Tate again. “I have a daughter. She goes by Ally Munroe. She must be about twenty-six now.” Dina fell silent. Her eyes welled up as she spoke. “She and I had a falling out a few years back. She took up with a trade caravan and left. They operate farther north. In eastern Kansas, or maybe parts of Missouri. I don’t know exactly.” Tate listened intently to her plea. “I’m hoping that, if you run into her, that you’d deliver a message from me.”

“Of course.”

“Tell her that…that Momma still loves her. And I hope to see her again someday.” Dina’s hand went to her mouth.

Tate nodded solemnly at the request. He put one foot through the door’s opening before turning back.

“Under one of the solar sets out here, there’s a tomato plant. It’s small, but it’ll be bigger tomorrow. It should flower next week. Try and take care of it.”

Dina stepped forward and hugged him. “You take care of yourself,” she replied. And at that, Tate disappeared.

\#

There was a stillness to Benny’s room. It was even quieter than usual. No creaks from his weight shifting in his desk chair, no sounds of worn comic book pages turning over. Benny’s body was stuffed in a trunk at the foot of his bed. The room was as lifeless as he was, until the steel call bell connected to the heat gauge gave off a single ring.

\#

Tate crept quietly along the outside wall, keeping to the shadows until the hoverbikes came into view. No agents in sight. No guard in the tower. He knelt by one bike, detached its power cell, and stashed it in his canvas bag before climbing onto the other.

The engine’s hum was louder than he liked. He opened the throttle, aiming for the cover of Crag Rock, a nearby mesa. The rush of air blew his hair back. The speedometer hit eighty before a sharp series of beeps cut through the night. “No…” Tate muttered, watching the panel flash REMOTE SHUTDOWN. The boosters died, the nose dipped, and he was airborne.

He hit hard, pain exploding in his shoulder. The bike flipped into a boulder; his canvas bag landed nearby. Tate crawled toward it — then blacked out.

Tate’s eyes were still closed when he detected approaching footsteps. A kick to his ribs jolted him from his stupor. He let out an agonizing scream. “Do you have any idea how long we were looking for you?” Agent Allen chided. He motioned to the wrecked hoverbike chassis. “And look what you did to my ride.”

Tate rolled onto his belly and made a feeble effort to crawl away. Agent Allen stepped on his ankle. “You’re not going anywhere, doc. Where’s the device?”

“There’s a bag,” Agent Trotter noted, pointing to the canvas pack. He walked over to retrieve it. Picking it up, he gave the bag a shake to assess the contents.

“It’s funny,” Agent Allen mused. “If we found you sooner, then we’d have taken you into custody. You and the gadget. But you had to use the damn thing for these peasants. Lousy scientists always think they know better,” he said, shaking his head. Agent Allen drew his gun from its holster. “Now we have new orders – we don’t need you. Hell, we don’t even need the device. But I’m guessing we’ll get a bonus if we bring it back now.” He aimed his gun at Tate and spoke to Agent Trotter. “Partner, let me know what we have.”

Agent Trotter rummaged through the bag. “Fuel cell for the other bike,” he announced, dropping it to the ground. His hand dug deeper. “I think we have a winner!”

On his back with his hands up, Tate made a final plea. “Wait, you don’t have to do this. Please.”

“Sorry, doc. You knew the consequences.”

Tate looked away, his eyes drifting towards Agent Trotter, who pulled the Agri-Boost from the bag. At that, a sharp click came from the depths of the bag. Agent Trotter looked down to find the Agri-Boost’s water reservoir port connected to the circular pin from a dehydration grenade.

“What the—"", he uttered. The grenade detonated, engulfing the three men in a storm of beige dust. All three were overcome by the same symptoms: coughing fits, irritated eyes, bone-dry mouths and parched lips.

Agent Trotter dropped the bag and the Agri-Boost. He fell to his knees, furiously rubbing his eyes. Agent Allen blindly felt the ground for his gun, letting out hoarse coughs. Tate forced an eyelid open ever so slightly. He crawled to his bag. Both eyes now shut and inflamed, he fumbled through, producing his canteen.

Coughing, he slowed only when several paces away from the agents. He opened the canteen and drank, spitting up the first gulp. He took a small sip and sloshed the water around in his mouth. He splashed some on his face, alleviating the burning in his eyes. He took a full sip and, after concentrating, was able to breathe normally again.

Agent Allen was still pawing for the gun, now nearly within reach. Tate hobbled over and snatched the pistol, tucking it into the back of his waistband. He grabbed the Agri-Boost, gave it a quick wipe, and placed it back in his bag.

Tate wasn’t sure how long the effects would last, but he reasoned that he had enough time to gather a posse from town and figure out what to do with the agents.

Tate shouldered his bag and took two steps towards Wingspan before the ground rumbled. He raised his arm to shield his face from a wave of searing heat, the town suddenly erupting outward. Fragmented pieces of the wall hurtled skyward. The Superhawk’s wings, airborne one last time, soared before spinning and breaking apart. The deafening blast forced Tate backwards.

Tate stared in shock. Wingspan had vaporized in a flash of white. As black smoke and a menacing orange glow enveloped the town, guilt threatened to consume him, too. He looked back at the agents, both near collapse. They’d done this, but so had he.

Spotting handcuffs on Agent Trotter, Tate shackled them together, leaving them to their thirst. One last look at the smoke, then he turned away, resolving to bury it all into a barren corner of his mind.

He figured New Tulsa was the next closest town, about 150 miles northeast. He could try the Agri-Boost there. If he kept a fast pace and took few breaks, he estimated a five-day journey.

On the bright side, he had a half-full canteen and a top-secret mobile fertilizer. Tate hoisted the bag over his good shoulder and let out a sigh. “I’d better start walking.”",6,1762626768.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

I’m completely new to the coffee world, and to be honest, I’m learning as I go so I’d really appreciate any advice as I kick off this little dream project.

Here’s the situation: I’m converting my small, not too profitable family restaurant/bar into a cafe. It’s on a busy street, so I’m optimistic about its potential.

I just purchased a refurbished Casadio Undici A2 Compact 2-group machine, which will be installed in about two weeks. I don’t have a grinder yet, and my budget is tight. I’m considering starting with the Breville Smart Grinder Pro from Amazon—I know it’s not perfect, but it seems like a reasonable option for now given the costs of renovations and the espresso machine.

I’d love any recommendations on what else I might need, tips on machine maintenance, or any other advice for getting started.

Thanks so much! 😊

I like to play with my dogs on the floor so I like having the space open. So if I get a coffee table I might push it to the side sometimes. Or should I put a table or cabinet against the wall or something like that?

I (30M) have been seeing someone (27F) for about five weeks. We met at a coffee shop, hit it off instantly, and have gone on about 6 dates since. We’ve been taking things slow, partly because we both have some trauma in our pasts, but the connection has felt warm and emotionally safe.

Yesterday, she told me she doesn't feel the same ""chemical rush"" that I’ve felt. She said she's worried she's giving mixed signals and doesn't want to lead me on. At the same time, she also said she thinks I’m amazing and that she needs more time. I took that as her being honest and cautious, but I left the conversation feeling really confused, it felt like both a ""maybe"" and a ""not really"" at the same time. She's uncomfortable with intimacy and physical closeness, but we kiss, make out and cuddle.

To make things more complicated, when we talked about deeper topics (like why I want kids one day), she actually started crying, and through tears, she told me how amazing I am. It was very emotional and confusing because it felt like she was deeply moved, but also scared. I don’t know if she’s overwhelmed, avoidant, or just being gentle about her lack of attraction.

I'm trying to give her space and stay grounded, but my feelings are stronger than hers, and the mixed messages are hard to interpret. I'd love to hear from people who've been in similar situations, does this sound like someone who’s emotionally conflicted but interested, or someone trying to let me down gently?",3,1762625813.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1orwbyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1orwbyi/labral_tear_diagnosis_journey_surgery_days_03/,Labral Tear Diagnosis Journey + Surgery Days 0-3,"I have been reading all of the post-op threads and found it so incredibly helpful to see detailed accounts of everyones experiences. I wanted to share my experience so far in case it helps out someone else who is having surgery soon. I am 34F and very active.

**Background**: I have been dealing with hip pain for 10+ years but it took a long time for it to be diagnosed as a labral tear and figure out whether surgery was the best option. Back in 2013-2016, it started with an annoying hip pain out the outside of my left hip near my glute med and then a deep ache in the front of my hip near my hip flexor/groin. I went to PT, did a lot of strength training, did gait retraining at a major running clinic in Boston, tried dry needling, etc. It would get better at times but was always this annoying ache that never went completely away. Since rest also didn't seem to help, I continued to run on it (one marathon, multiple half marathons, etc). When I was running, there would be many times where it would become really hard to drive my left knee forward and seemed like i just didn't have the strength to keep the left side going even though I did so much strength work for glutes, hip flexors, etc. I did a lot of cross training at spin classes and found that it helped loosen things up and biking never caused any issues

Things started to go downhill in 2017 when I had a lot more stressors in life and was not sleeping so could not recover. As things got worse, one provider suspected a labral tear but my insurance wouldn't approve an MRI and I was a grad student so didn't want to pay a huge amount OOP (and I was maybe in denial it was a labral tear). I finally hit rock bottom in spring 2020 after COVID hit. I was cooped up inside dealing with dissertation stress by running and biking on a trainer a lot more. Suddenly, I started having burning pain down my hamstring and adductor. Most of the pain was on the left but I also had some pain in my right hamstring and adductors. Unlike before COVID, I could no longer bike and it was one of the things that flared up my hip the worst. I tried resting and did some PT exercises (through telemedicine during COVID so not super helpful), but the pain was absolutely awful and was even worse at rest. I could not sit for long periods of time at all due to pain. The right hamstring and adductor cleared up pretty quickly but the ""C"" shaped pain around my left hip/glute med was super intense and now paired with intense pain radiating down my hamstrings and adductor then later expanded up a bit into my QL. I finally got an MRI with contrast a few months later and it confirmed that I did have a labral tear but the ortho was completely useless and provided no recommendations for next steps and had no opinion on whether it could be causing the intense pain.

In 2020-2023, I continued to do very intense PT and it and was able to get some relief but no one would tell me whether they thought surgery might help. I tried a number of different PTs and they all had different opinions (including one at UCSF who after doing the very basic PT screening tests said I seemed strong so shouldn't be in pain and I should consider seeing a psychiatrist instead...) The strange thing that most PTs couldn't seem to understand was that after doing very light exercises I would be in intense pain  that radiated down my hamstring and adductor. One PT just told me it was DOMS and I just need to get stronger...however, I am very familiar with DOMS and knew that this was instead an intense achy, burny feeling that would last for > 1 week after doing an exercises, not DOMS. In addition, I was having this weird thing where my pain was on my left side down into left hamstring and adductor 95% of the time but then there would be these strange times where the pain would suddenly shift and my left hamstring would be 100% okay while the right side hamstring (but not hip) would now be achey. Weird, right? I also tried dry needling and shockwave and it would provide some relief but was not permanent. Finally, one PT noticed that my SIJ was all off and my pelvis only rotated properly on one side. After about 2+ months of intense PT the flip flopping stopped and my hamstring + adductors had greatly improved! Around this time I also got another MRI confirming labral tear and also it also identified a CAM impingement and greater trochanter bursitis. After the MRI, I got a steroid injection into the hip joint and it helped some and then later into the bursa. OMG - steroid injection combined with finally finding the ""right"" PT exercises.... I could cry I was so happy to finally have the least amount of pain in 10+ years. I didn't try to run or bike since I was too scared it would flare up (and was dealing with an unrelated calf thing). Unfortunately, this only lasted a few months and I had a major flare when I moved wrong while doing weights. I finally went back to the orthopedist and said I was ready for surgery and he was able to get me on the calendar within a few weeks.

**Surgery:** arthroscopic labral tear repair, femoral neck cam resection, bursectomy

**Day 0 PO** \- I arrived at the ASC around 6am for a 7:30am surgery time. I completed my forms, paid, changed, and waited around. I wish they didn't make you arrive so early since it gave me plenty of time to sit and think about all the terrible things that could go wrong and they had taken my possessions already so I had nothing to distract me. I walked into the operating room and laid down on the table and made chit chat for just a few minutes before the anesthesiologist told me to breathe through a mask and then told me I would feel a bit of burning as they pushed something through the IV. I was out so quickly and didn't feel much. The next thing I remember, I woke up in the recovery room to a nurse asking how I felt. I could barely process what she was saying but quickly agreed to more medication. I felt nauseous and very beat up. Not intense pain but I remember my quads strangely felt like I had run 20+ hilly miles. I slowly came to and was then transferred in a wheelchair to my car to be driven home.

At home I settled into bed, elevated my leg, and put the ice machine on. My provider doesn't use braces and didn't recommend a CPM or any other special equipment. I was sent home with ondansetron (as needed), hydrocone (as needed), and naproxen (2x day for 14 days). During the afternoon, I only took the ondansetron since I felt really nauseous from the anesthesia. I was in and out of sleep for most of the afternoon. Not in pain but just feeling beat up, tired, and nauseous. I finally took hydrocone and naproxen at dinner time and then quickly passed out after.

**Day 1 PO** \- I was surprised I slept okay! Woke up twice since struggled to stay on my back in the same position. In the morning, the top of my hip around the incisions was definitely achey but not painful and I no longer felt as beat up. Best part of all, the nausea was gone! Took naproxone with breakfast but no other painkillers. Spent most of the day in bed working or reading and just crutched around every hour (weight bearing, about 20%) and did the exercises the ortho prescribed (heel slides, quad squeezes, glute squeezes, and ankle flex). Took naproxone at dinner and hydrocone before sleep.

**Day 2 PO** \- I struggled again with getting high quality sleep while sleeping on same position on my back. When I work up, I had the same achiness/stiffness at the top of my hip near the incisions but it was not painful and it improved once I moved around and then iced. I was getting much better on crutches and felt like I could put more weight on my left foot without any pain. And in good news, a lot of the pre-op pain in my hip even at rest felt so much better! I worked from bed most of the day and felt fine overall but a bit tired. I again took naproxone at dinner and hydrocone before sleep but felt like I could have gotten away without the hydrocone.

**Day 3 PO** \- Sleep was similar and hip was stiff and achey when woke up but improved as soon as I got up, crutched around, did my exercises, and then iced. Still no pain but just frustrated being stuck on crutches and eager to start PT (my ortho says no PT until 2 weeks). However, I feel like my left leg is already starting to feel stronger and I can put more weight on it (my ortho recommends 2 weeks on crutches but wants me to progress the amount of weight very quickly).

**Special equipment:**

I didn't buy much but definitely recommend: a crutch bag (I carry around soup + coffee in it in a yeti mug with a lid!), very large water bottle to keep in bed, lots of pillows (nothing fancy), laptop tray for bed if you want to work, cold therapy ice machine, and long phone charger that can reach into bed. I also have been wearing nightgowns so I don't have to deal with pants. I didn't get a toilet riser and have not needed it.

Good luck to anyone dealing with a similar issue and considering surgery! I am glad I finally decided to go for it. I was too optimistic and for so many years I thought that if I just found the right PT and the right exercises I would get better without surgery. I still have a long way to go to see how this impacts my hip pain and if I can get back to running but so far it seems promising!",9,1762625674.0,HipImpingement,0,1.0,False
