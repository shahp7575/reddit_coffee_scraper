**A Future Written in Sunsets and Porch Swing Stories**

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**

🎵 **Music as a Muse:** Vinyl collections, road trip playlists, and songs that feel like home. Music has a way of connecting moments, and I love finding the soundtrack to life’s best memories. Got a favorite tune? Share it—I’m always ready to discover the melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",1,1732409423.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

So I always tell my husband to let me know if I ever smell. 
Well the other day he said “have you been drinking coffee all day?” I had, and he said I have a funky smell, must be that. I went and brushed, scraped my tongue and did mouthwash. After that I hadn’t had coffee. Today I mentioned something about not missing coffee and he said he smelled it again this morning (I hadn’t showered yet) so it must not be the coffee. I asked him if it’s BO, and he says he doesn’t know. He said I don’t smell like that but these two incidents have happened within a few days of each other so now I’m just really self-conscious about it and not knowing what it is, is the most frustrating part. Husband is being of no help because he says he can’t tell which one it is, bad breath, BO or what, but I need to figure it out because I myself can’t stand people who smell and I don’t want to be that person. 

What even could it be? I brush twice a day, floss daily, and shower daily. Wax/shave regularly. My shower times are iffy because if I’m planning to go to the gym that day I don’t shower in the morning.

In fact, I bet it would happen all the time IF more customers brought in their reusable cups.

The issue is that when I order a drip coffee in my personal cup, many of the baristas do not pull the sticker, and what happens is that another partner will make the coffee, and some time later I'll notice a short cup in the pickup area and immediately realise what happened (because I'm one of the few customers who orders a short coffee). This of course wastes not only coffee but a paper cup which defeats the purpose of my reusable cup.

Since I haven't been a partner recently (not since 1997), I don't know what current barista training is like, but I'm genuinely curious why a relatively simple thing like pulling the sticker seems to be omitted so consistently across hundreds of stores around the country.

1gyehw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1gyehw6/coffee_market_at_the_mercy_of_funds/,Coffee Market: At the Mercy of Funds,"The coffee market has become increasingly influenced by institutional money, with fundamentals often taking a back seat to speculative activities.

* **Brazil's Coffee Production:** Projections for the 2025/26 harvest estimate 65.6 million 60-kg bags, a slight 0.4% decline from the previous cycle. Despite reports of significant flowering, concerns linger about the crop's resilience to ongoing drought and high temperatures. On the ground, coffee prices have given producers profitability, and there are many new farms in development.
* **Geopolitical Factors:** Escalating global conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, continue to shape market sentiment. In February 2022, coffee prices dropped sharply after media speculation suggested demand would weaken due to the conflict. Despite this, both Russians and Ukrainians ensured they got their caffeine fix, underscoring that demand persisted regardless of the headlines.
* **European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR):** The EU’s new regulation aims to ban imports of commodities linked to deforestation, including coffee. Originally set for December 2024, its implementation might be delayed by 12 months to give producers and importers time to adapt. However, this regulation is likely to reshape global coffee trade flows significantly.A critical perspective is that large businesses appear to be leveraging these regulations to stifle medium and small European roasters, leaving consumers with fewer choices. Instead of letting the market decide who stays in business, these policies risk asphyxiating smaller players under the weight of compliance requirements.
* **Market Dynamics:** The coffee market is now at the mercy of institutional funds. Fundamentals like supply and demand are often secondary to hedge funds and speculative players, whose primary role is to bring liquidity.

The world isn’t running out of coffee—supply will persist. However, navigating this market means understanding that pricing and dynamics are now dictated by institutional money flows. For those in the coffee industry, this requires playing the hand smartly, as demand is the one element still under our control.",1,1732408843.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

I have never really felt like I should be. I understand that being white had come with some privileges and some shitty historic moments. I have studied hard and done alright for myself out in the world and am on track to becoming a lawyer in a few years. I went to elementary school in the ghetto and was one of only a few white kids at the school I went too. I guess few isn't fair, but we definitely were not majority at this school. I experienced racism towards me, but I was not ashamed of who I was. 

I have never been ashamed of who I am, even when someone discounted my opinion on racial affairs because I'm white. I've never been ashamed when I was accused of being racist because I didn't understand some aspect of life in America as a minority. I have proudly been white in the face of everything. My identity was sound. 

And now MAGA, and I am, for the first time, ashamed of being white. It has become stark to me that because of maga and it's white nationalist way that in public, when people look at me, the first thing they think is that I am hateful, because I am white. And I know this because when I think of white men besides myself I assume they are hateful. I started a new job recently and politics came up because of the election, and I noticed that people dodged asking me about things, and I can't help but feel like it's because they didn't feel safe asking due to my skin tone. They assumed what I assume about white men, and that is that I secretly hate them.

I am ashamed because white men are associated with MAGA, and because of that I am associated by default of being racist, homophobic, anti lgbt, anti woke, anti everything that I have supported since I was cognizant enough to think about these things. And I am ashamed.

MAGA has ruined my sense of self and made me feel isolated among people who would otherwise be my peers, and the worst part is that in those rooms they expect me to back them up. Disgusting humans full of hate just think that I'm one of them and try to meet me as a comrade. So many times have I been in rooms alone with other white men just for them to unleash their filth and I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of my skin being a signal that it's okay for racist pieces of crap to cheer MAGA at me. 

Omfg, the other day at work I was at a coffee shop with a client and they had 2 tip jars. Something about 12 million dollars in one jar or some country singer in the other. Idk what it was about, but this business client whom I had just met for the first time turned to me with confidence and said ""well if it had said ""Trump or Harris I'd have put $20 in the Trump jar"" and turned to me to laugh and just assumed I was on her side and I was so caught off guard and disgusted I didn't know what to do.

Maga, you make us all look fucking terrible and you have embarrassed me beyond comprehension, and I don't know what to do about it.

I can do chill activities or more physical activities, as long as it is fun to me. Most people are introverts so when you’re a true extrovert, you just have to adapt lol. 

Since the semester has started, it has been hard for me 💀. We’re in Poland now and we did some travelling to other cities and while travelling I like to go places and visit and I swear the vibe is always walk a bit around and maybe go to a coffee. It’s nice, but not EVERYTIME. During the little trips we did, I suggested plenty and diverse activities, not even expensive. Let’s just do something interesting in a city we don’t know  (since we’re all foreigners), they never seem to be too interested. 

And what baffle me is that I always hear, “we need to do that”, “oh we should go there”, “it could be nice to do that”. But why nothing ever happens 😭

Even in the city we’re a studying in, it’s the same vibe. I tried to suggest things and today might be the last stray.   

So, I asked if anyone wanted to go see gladiator today (some people weren’t available and that’s okay, they told so) but nobody answered on the group chat. Whatever, I get dressed because I leave soon. My roommate comes back and she says “oh where you going” “to the cinema” “alone🥺?”. Girl nobody answered lmao and then she said that someone asked her if I was still going. Then when I left the room, I met with the said someone (we all live in the same building and corridor) and we chatted a bit. 

Not him telling me that my roommate told her that I was “sad” nobody is coming with me. Now why she is lying 💀💀💀💀 and told him her ass was lying and this man had the audacity of looking at me with sad puppy eyes. Then my roommate and I asked her why she told him that 💀💀, she said “you’re going alone 🥺” WELL DUH. Then, the guy told me “just tell us how the film was and make us regret we didn’t come with you”. I told him I wasn’t going to say shit and I should’ve added f*ck you by the way.  Cause now, I really feel like you’re playing in my face 💀💀. 

That’s not necessarily only him but most introverts will act like that, why are you asking me about how was something you deliberately missed for the 1000th times. Don’t ask me shit! 😂, you will not come next time AGAIN anyway. 

Like I said, I have been friends with a lot of introverts and I have always managed to always adapt but pwffffff this is an another level and too high for my abilities 😭.

We are together for 1.5 year for this master’s degree and I shared I was bit worried for the next semester in Germany and the whole vibe, people were like “oh no worry we will go there and there” “the weather will be better, we will go out more”…well, I think I need a plan B because I will NOT be bored during the summertime. 

Unfortunately, there’s not too much opportunities to meet other people in the university I am currently  at so I’m kinda stuck with what I have. I hope my luck will change next semester. 

When I returned to my room I just realised I have to do hangout by myself (more) because I like going out and do stuff. I mean like going shopping by myself, going to concerts all alone and other things but I don’t know going to the cinemas, museums or even restaurants always been group activities to me and I enjoy people company too. 

I miss my extroverts and  introverts (the ones I am used to) friends back home 🥲. 

By the way, the film was good y’all, Denzel getting that 3rd Oscar easy. I want to see Wicked too and I will probably end up going to see it alone even though some expressed they wanted to go to lol.

1gyeasj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBear/comments/1gyeasj/ive_been_managing_a_new_restaurant_for_a_month/,I’ve been managing a new restaurant for a month and now I’m re-watching the show. I love it even more now.,"I don’t come from food service so this is all new to me. I manage a bagel shop in the southeast, only artisan NY style bagel shop within 200 miles of the city. We are a bagel shop first but most of the day we more so function as a sandwich and coffee shop with bagels as the base. So it’s way more a restaurant than a bakery. 

Anyway, because of our rarity in the area, the wide number of northern transplants that live in my city, and the amazing job the shop owner’s wife did on giving us a solid social media presence and building up the hype prior to opening, we have been balls-to-the-wall busy from the moment our doors opened. Talking line wrapped around the building almost every day.

We’ve been up and running for about a month now and I’m just now going back to watch the show and I have a much more profound appreciation of it now. I’m finding myself laughing more at moments that aren’t funny but are just relatable, cringing at things that would warrant cringing, and being able to actually feel the stress the show induces. This show does such an insanely good job of portraying quick service restaurant life (in the first season when it’s still The Beef of course) and it’s really incredible. Down to the quick shots of random messes and food remains being left around, it’s really incredible and it’s very evident they had a lot of consultants from the food service world to help produce the show. 

I realize none of this is new, one of the main reasons the show is praised is because of its accurate portrayal of restaurant-life. But personally, I am really happy to be getting a deeper look into that myself. 

I will note, I’m super happy that our work environment is not nearly as toxic or angry. I got an AMAZING staff and the vibes are incredible both BOH and FOH, but that doesn’t mean the intensity isn’t still there. And I also fully understand why people get almost addicted to this kind of work. People watch the show and wonder why someone would want to work in that stressful of an environment. But after we have had a few “slower” days, I fully understand how people get hooked on the adrenaline rush of high-volume food service work. And also why Carmy was cooking in his sleep and almost set his apartment on fire. In fact, literally today the lead barista and I were talking about systems, and then I go back to season one to start this show over and first episode is titled “systems”. 

It’s seriously the Wild West but I absolutely love it. And this show has just gotten better for me as a result. Also it’s fun to call everyone chef lol (and weirdly helpful sometimes).",4,1732408274.0,TheBear,0,1.0,False

1gye9g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1gye9g0/hard_eight_how_pta_used_the_same_scene_three/,Hard Eight: How PTA used the same scene three different ways,"I’ve seen this movie upwards of ten times now, as I am completely fascinated by PTA’s work. This time, I noticed a repeating scene which was used to highlight the different relationships Sydney has with the other three main characters: John, Clementine, and the antagonistic Jimmy.

Before outlining the scenes, it’s important to note Sydney’s want and need as a character.

Want: to help nurture John and Clementine

Need: to find peace and earn forgiveness for his past behavior.

Sydney wants to be a father figure to these two adrift youths, for he seemingly abandoned his own children and directly made John an orphan.

Now, to get into the scenes. 

The first of which is the opener of the film and is set in a diner at a truck stop, pulled directly from the short film that inspired the feature. Over coffee and cigarettes , Sydney interrogates John, breaking down his defenses to get to his core. He discovers a helpless kid who he begins to mentor. In this scene, he slows everything down and gets John on his wavelength. 

In the next scene, Sydney takes Clementine out for cigarettes and coffee at a diner; he’s even sitting on the same side of the booth as before. This scene is set at night, however, due to Clementine’s central struggle being her after-work sex work. Sydney gets to know Clementine more, and discovers some of the difficulties of her work life. He begins a plan, much like he did before with John, to mend Clementine’s troublesome life and create a better future.

 In the last scene, Sydney brings Jimmy back to his hotel room. This scene is not on Sydney’s terms, so there is no coffee and they are not in a diner. Now, interestingly, Jimmy is on camera right while Sydney is on camera left—a flip of the aforementioned blocking in the previous scenes. Sydney is not in power, and is therefore on the left. It is more frantic, with one man standing and one sitting, one yelling and one calm. 

I found it very interesting how PTA used the structure of one scene in three different ways to highlight the different relationships between the characters. It gave the film a sense of pattern while also introducing new principles to the audience with each subsequent scene. 

For his first film, PTA showed his mastery of story structure and the future brilliance that was to come.",3,1732408166.0,TrueFilm,3,0.8,False

I've never had this problem before but in the last few days I've been getting a significant amount of coffee grounds in my coffees. For reference, the attached image is a significant improvement (at its worst, it looked like loose leaf tea the whole way through the coffee) after cleaning out the machine and running a couple of tanks of water through to try to clear it. The problem seems to get worse when I use the new Christmas 'almond croissant' pods. I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence or whether it's possible that there's some fault with those pods that's causing this. eg. finer grains that slip through more easily. Is something like this possible or am I just imagining that it's worse with these pods? I bought the machine second hand 4 years ago so is it just reaching the end of its life cycle? Not sure if this is relevant, but my use of the machine hasn't changed (2-3 pods daily). I only use Nespresso pods, use them once, release the pods immediately. I don't know how long to expect them to last. Haven't ever had this problem before and it's taking significant ongoing cleaning to fix it so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

I mainly try James Hoffmann's method or the 4:6 method, brewing 30 or 33.3g coffee to 500ml. I've tried different techniques, grind sizes, etc., to no avail. No matter how coarse I ground, the coffee would always draw down slowly, and I couldn't find the sweet spot for taste. Grind size presets on different grinders were never accurate and still never tasted right, and lower temps made it draw down even slower. I since ordered a bag of coffee from one of my local roasters and accidentally ordered preground for drip coffeemakers. Since it was a limited edition, I tried a pour-over with it anyway, and a similar thing happened. I was still left with water pooling, not wanting to drain through the coffee, no matter how much I agitated it. For the coarser preground coffee, it still took a long time to draw down (5+ minutes total brew time) and tasted bitter. I wonder if it is less about what I am doing and more about what I am using to brew. I use just a typical plastic V60 02 with Hario brand V02 filters that I always rinse and preheat before I brew. I'm unsure if that has anything to do with it, but I'm lost on what to do or try. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",2,1732407850.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I’m Kathleen (or Kitty, or Kat—your pick), a 32-year-old human currently seeking someone to share my stream-of-consciousness thoughts with. Let’s be real: I’m sick today and completely bored out of my mind. I’ve exhausted Netflix, stared at the ceiling for longer than I’d like to admit, and now I’m here, ready to dive into whatever random topic you’d like to throw my way. Bonus points if it’s weird, hilarious, or just plain random.  

When I’m not coughing dramatically and googling “symptoms of boredom,” you’ll usually find me indulging in my many hobbies. I’m a sucker for photography—chasing sunsets, capturing candid moments, or taking artsy pictures of my coffee because, you know, *aesthetic*. I also dabble in painting, where my creativity meets chaos. Think Picasso, but with more paint splatters and questionable proportions. Horror movies are my love language, so if you enjoy screaming at the screen or laughing at cheesy jump scares, we’ll get along just fine.  

Writing is another passion of mine, especially through email. There’s something satisfying about crafting a well-thought-out message that doesn’t disappear into the void like a text. If you’re into storytelling, sharing your day, or swapping random anecdotes, I’m all ears. I’m a conversationalist at heart, which means I’m the perfect person to dive deep into topics like the meaning of life or debate why cereal is just cold soup.  

Music? Oh, I’ve got that covered. My playlist is a chaotic mix of System of a Down, Pantera, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana. It’s the perfect soundtrack for pondering existential questions or headbanging in the kitchen while cooking dinner (poorly). I also appreciate random suggestions, so if you’ve got a favorite band or weirdly specific genre, send it my way—I’m always open to expanding my sonic horizons.  

As for what I want to talk about? Literally *anything*. Want to tell me about your weird coworker? Let’s hear it. Need to vent about how pineapple on pizza is controversial for no reason? I’m your person. I’ve got stories, puns, and memes to share, and I’m fully prepared to entertain—or at least distract—you.  

I’m looking for someone who doesn’t mind my sarcasm, occasional overthinking, and penchant for getting too excited about random facts. Let’s exchange tales of the mundane, the extraordinary, or the downright bizarre. Whether it’s a quick chat or a deep dive into the complexities of life, I’m here for it.

This is the last night I’ll hold the bracelet you gave me close and cry, letting my tears drop onto it as I think of all that could’ve been.

I wanted it too bad, I jinxed us. 
I craved a deep emotional connection with you and the safety I felt around you was unparalleled at such a pivotal moment in my life.

You reminded me of home, you reminded me of everything I had ever looked for in a man.

I never thought it would end this badly or at least that I’d have my dreams ripped away so effortlessly.
I tried so hard, you see that, don’t you? 
I wanted to make you happy, I wanted to cure you of what ails you…

Even though you may have not got my pronouns right, I knew you cared irregardless. 
You protected me before I even knew it.
You saw me for who I was not who I showed to the world.

You’re a good man, you always have been.

I’ll always love you but I think finally, it’s time for me to close the door and say goodbye.
I’m sorry if I messed up everything…
I’m sorry if I ever hurt you or damaged your life.

I think they just couldn't process that I might have different tastes from them. Not drinking coffee was seen as preferable to drinking it with cream or sugar, though -- it was literally black or nothing. Eventually I had to tell them to knock it off, their endlessly offering it full in the knowledge that I was not going to suddenly say ""yes.""

I’m Kathleen (or Kitty, or Kat—your pick), a 32-year-old human currently seeking someone to share my stream-of-consciousness thoughts with. Let’s be real: I’m sick today and completely bored out of my mind. I’ve exhausted Netflix, stared at the ceiling for longer than I’d like to admit, and now I’m here, ready to dive into whatever random topic you’d like to throw my way. Bonus points if it’s weird, hilarious, or just plain random.  

When I’m not coughing dramatically and googling “symptoms of boredom,” you’ll usually find me indulging in my many hobbies. I’m a sucker for photography—chasing sunsets, capturing candid moments, or taking artsy pictures of my coffee because, you know, *aesthetic*. I also dabble in painting, where my creativity meets chaos. Think Picasso, but with more paint splatters and questionable proportions. Horror movies are my love language, so if you enjoy screaming at the screen or laughing at cheesy jump scares, we’ll get along just fine.  

Writing is another passion of mine, especially through email. There’s something satisfying about crafting a well-thought-out message that doesn’t disappear into the void like a text. If you’re into storytelling, sharing your day, or swapping random anecdotes, I’m all ears. I’m a conversationalist at heart, which means I’m the perfect person to dive deep into topics like the meaning of life or debate why cereal is just cold soup.  

Music? Oh, I’ve got that covered. My playlist is a chaotic mix of System of a Down, Pantera, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana. It’s the perfect soundtrack for pondering existential questions or headbanging in the kitchen while cooking dinner (poorly). I also appreciate random suggestions, so if you’ve got a favorite band or weirdly specific genre, send it my way—I’m always open to expanding my sonic horizons.  

As for what I want to talk about? Literally *anything*. Want to tell me about your weird coworker? Let’s hear it. Need to vent about how pineapple on pizza is controversial for no reason? I’m your person. I’ve got stories, puns, and memes to share, and I’m fully prepared to entertain—or at least distract—you.  

I’m looking for someone who doesn’t mind my sarcasm, occasional overthinking, and penchant for getting too excited about random facts. Let’s exchange tales of the mundane, the extraordinary, or the downright bizarre. Whether it’s a quick chat or a deep dive into the complexities of life, I’m here for it.

1gye08p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gye08p/why_is_my_ex_gf21f_who_say_she_wants_to_be/,"Why is my ex gf(21F), who say she wants to be friends, so hot and cold about our friendship(23M)?
","Oh boy, this going to be long one, but I'll try to keep it short.

My ex and I broke up about a year and a half ago. She dumped me, but I understood her reasons and agreed with the decision. We still wanted to stay in touch and be friends, so we went no contact until we felt ready to be friends again. Fast forward a couple of months, and we were friends again. We were both starting to go on first dates with other people, and our friendship was back to normal. She even suggested visiting the city where I was interning. And then, out of nowhere, she stopped responding to my texts and just kept talking less and less. I just assumed that life got busy, so I went about my life and didn't worry about it.

Two weeks later, we met up for coffee in our hometown before school started to catch up before the school year started again. At this point, I assumed things were totally fine between us. We both returned to our respective schools and still texted now and then about how our semesters were going and catching up in general until she just stopped responding to me about a month and a half into the semester.

I was confused because I thought we were friends again and things were back to normal, but in hindsight, that was optimistic of me. I let it go because as much as I valued our friendship, I wouldn't chase someone who didn't want to be friends with me.

After this, I honestly forgot about her. Before I knew it, it was March of my senior year of college, and it was shaping up to be the best year of my life.

Out of nowhere, I received a text from my ex saying, ""Hey, how've you been?"" At first, I wasn't going to respond, but I did anyway, and we caught up. She just asked how my family was and how my year was going. It was just a short catch-up conversation, and as soon as the conversation felt like it was becoming dry, I just stopped talking. Over the next couple of weeks, she started texting more, checking in on me, and asking me what I was doing. I wasn't sure what changed after she ghosted me, but I went with it anyway. She even let my friends and I stay at her place while visiting for a football game. I assumed things were back to normal. After the school year ended, she offered to meet up before she went off to her internship in a different city. I went and asked her why she had ghosted me before and what her sudden new interest in being friends was after 8 months of basically not talking at all. She said that she actually started dating this new guy and didn't want to be disrespectful to him by talking to her ex, that they had broken up recently, and that she would be a better friend moving forward. It still didn't make sense because we were just friends, but I knew how some people could be. I told her I valued our friendship and didn't want to feel like I was someone she talked to because she was bored. I said I would love it if we stayed in touch more and would appreciate honesty if she felt some way instead of ghosting me. She reassured me that she cared about our friendship and that she would be a better friend.

That was until she went back to the same old thing. If I texted her about something, I'd probably get a response in two weeks or wait until she wanted to speak to me. At some point, again, I just decided that I was wasting my time and stopped texting. Now, she is starting to text me whenever she is back in our hometown, saying that we should meet up for coffee or something, and texting me now and then starting conversations. I'll respond and text her back, but I'm no longer continuing the conversation or starting new ones.

I'm honestly confused about what she wants right now. One minute, she couldn't care less, and the next, she made every effort to see me in person and catch up, texting and trying to talk to me. I don't exactly feel valued as a friend. I feel like she texts me when she is bored and/or wants to meet up when she is back in town because none of her other friends live here.

I'm honestly tired of half-assed friendships like this, where I care deeply about someone and don't get the same effort back. Personally, I believe I've communicated in every way possible, given enough grace, and let things go when I shouldn't have.

Within 2 weeks I had developed AFIB - not saying conclusively it's causal but it's been known to cause it in some cases. Doctor initially told me to moderate my lifestyle and put me on Xarelto blood thinners.

At first I only got it when I had a big night of drinking - like more than 3-4 drinks.  Then I got it from eating licorice allsorts. Then I got it from eating halloumi cheese (salty).  Then I got it from caffeine.  Pretty soon I was avoiding foods and dropping my coffee intake.

Doc changed my BP meds to Diltiazem (had been on that before though) and introduced Flecainide 2x a day, this seemed to make it much worse.  At that point I was triggered by anything - eating a steak, having one drink, etc.  When an event was triggered, I go into AFIB for two days of constant AFIB.

I do need to go back to the doc as I've stopped Flecainide on my own - but I'm still on a hair trigger for episodes.  I stopped alcohol, coffee, halloumi, licorice completely (well, licorice was a one off, halloumi was something i maybe had twice a year).  I'm trying avoidance to manage it. I also have a lot of allergies - cats, dust mites, pollen, salicylates, yeast - so I'm being treated for that and also avoiding those things, which makes eating very restrictive (there are like 2 fruits I can eat, about 20 vegetables, lean meat and grains, and things like steak cause afib so I'm avoiding that).

I'm also trying a TENS machine for ear/tragus stimulation, just got it and have used it twice.

I'd love to get back to a normal life where I can enjoy a normal meal out, have a few drinks, have coffee in the morning.

I’ve never been more wrong, I feel like I moved out of one hell into another, my dad is the biggest narcissist ever and so so hard to get along with because of it because I’m not the type of person to just let anyone walk all over me and I do not have the slightest patience when it comes to narcissistic slow minded immature heartless morons. Us not getting along isn’t the issue, him being the dumbest person to ever exist is. I am TWENTY THREE and I have NOTHING, no house or apartment no car no SAVINGS AT ALL no education I have no boyfriend no friends no person I can just talk to when I’m feeling lonely or just to make me feel heard or keep me company and for the past few months I’ve been desperately trying to find ways to make new money. 

I tried starting a wax melt/candle business but unfortunately making enough product to sell is taking me forever as I’m still mostly in the practicing stage, I started learning about stocks and how to invest but obviously that’s going to be years before it pays off. I’m just trying my best to learn the best ways to make money so I can finally start my life, I’m so behind in every aspect. I’m the oldest from my siblings and they’re all so much more accomplished than me!!(thanks to my dad isolating me from eeeeeeverything growing up because he was an abusive pos to me for no reason, but as my siblings grew up they got everything they wanted)
My siblings have amazing jobs that pay super well, they all own at least 2 cars!!! This is a story for another time but they have everything they do because of me, (TLDR) because when I was 16 living in a shelter because my useless deadbeat wanna be father kicked me out for no reason I told him that if he didn’t want the rest of his kids to end up like me he needs to stop being such a strict heartless ahole and let them be kids!! 
Now I’m really happy for them but I’m jealous, I was never jealous of them up until now. Up until now I was always proud and happy for them but now I hate them. I’m envious, I want want they have because they don’t deserve it. I moved into this house to reconcile but thanks to my dad my siblings hate me more than ever before, I hate hate hate feeling this way towards them they’re my own family my own blood, but fuck them. 

Moving in here was supposed to be the best thing to happen to me in a while, I was going to move in and figure out my life and start my journey. I was going to heal myself and become the person I’ve always wanted to become but I can just forget all that. 
Because ever since I moved in here I’ve been nothing but a maid slave, a literal MAID SLAVE. 
Every single morning I have to wake up at 7 and get my little brother on the bus for school, usually I sleep like crap the previous night so I try to go back to sleep and take a nap then I always end up over sleeping and as soon as I wake up I have to start cleaning the kitchen which is always DISGUSTING. The floors are so FILTHY it’s as if someone used a leaf blower to blow grass and leaves and twigs and dirt and rocks INTO the house and I clean the floor almost every day, I always fill the dishwasher before bed but when I get up both kitchen sinks are full of dirty dishes again, garbage cans aren’t emptied when full they just place their garbage next to it on the counter, old takeaway boxes and drinks are always left on the counter or table for days, pots with food burnt on the bottom are always left on the counter for days, empty coffee cream containers are put back in the fridge, bathroom sink is always covered in black oil and dirt from work, shoes are always left scattered all around the front door, laundry piles up for weeks before it’s cleaned and I’m the only one that’s expected to deal with this!!! And on top of that I’m responsible for figuring out what to cook for these ungrateful ass kids that come home and take one glance at the food and walk away from it or start cooking their own food right in front of me!!! 
When I don’t do it for a few days (2 max) because I’m EXHAUSTED mentally and physically and want to take some time to myself to recharge or because my back is KILLING ME to the point where I can barely twist my body to wipe my own ass because of everything I’m always doing for EVERYONE else, I get yelled at and bitched out by my ENTIRE FAMILY. I AM THE UGLIEST AND SKINNIEST AND UNHEALTHIEST I HAVE EVER BEEN. I don’t have time to wash my face in the morning or brush my teeth, I have absolutely no fucking skincare routine I barely even get to shower every 4 days because I’m always busy and when I have time to shower every other fucker is in it or I’m simply just too exhausted that day. I had curly hair but since I moved here 8 months ago it’s gone FLATTTT because I’ve had it up in a greasy bun for so long, I never ever have the chance to just sit down and eat without stress if even I get the chance to eat at all and I’ve been recovering from an ED, for TWO YEARS, I’m never ever ever ever going to get better and get healthy because I’m back at 99 pounds again. I can barely put time into my business and there’s a million things to do, I can’t learn about investing the way I’d like to because I have a million other things to do. I’ve tried talking to my siblings and my dad so many times about letting me have more freedom and more time to myself but my disgusting selfish siblings just walk all over me and bring up the fact that I don’t have a job so this is my job and they bring up the fact that they actually go to work all day and don’t have energy to clean up after themselves afterwards. Yet they claim to be smart “independent adults”, like sorry but you’re obviously the dumbest person to exist if you think that of yourself but meanwhile you can’t even work a 7 hour shift and put a paper bag into a trash can or put a single dish into the dishwasher, independent adults work all day then come home to clean their house, cook their own meal and remake their own work lunch. 
I feel so stuck and lost and I have nothing and no one my two cats that I absolutely love to death and who are my absolute world can’t stand me even though all I do when I’m around is feed them give them treats change their litter and sleep or learn about stocks on my phone. I gave up all my friends because they’re all just a bunch of broke bums that would rather waste their life away getting drunk and being wh*res on the internet for nothing but validation they don’t care about goals or wealth or their future so I have no one to talk to ever about anything. I live in the clown ass country so I can’t ever do a single thing to get away from my dads house for a bit or just to get my mind off things. I feel so hopeless, I know if I keep at it with investing maybe someday I’ll be in a better place but what about now. What about now when I’m 23 and already so much of my life has been wasted, that’s a whole quarter of my life and I’m still broke still have no apartment or house or car. I’ll never have friends or a boyfriend again because I can’t even put time into myself or my appearance and I’m the most insecure I’ve ever been. I don’t want to just be broke and ugly living in my dads basement forever. It’s starting to look like it’s the only option for me and everyday I’m contemplating su*c*de more and more … because what is the point. I am a literal maid slave to my own flesh and blood who doesn’t even see me or let alone treat me as a human being … at first I told myself in my head when I got rich we’d all get rich, I’d take care of them and buy them each a house and give them each a position in my business(es), ever since moving in here I’ve realized they’d never ever do the same for me not even close, they wouldn’t even piss on me if I was on fire, I am a human being and I do have feelings and I don’t deserve to feel like this let alone live like this.

I was wondering if getting her a quality stethoscope would be a good idea, or is that not recommended if she's not yet going to use it. I didn't actually ask her outright what stuff she'd like me to give her, but I was really hoping to give her something that she could use everyday at the university.

What I've Tried: I know she's got a iPad 9th gen and a 3rd party pencil for her acads, so I'm going to give her a Apple Pencil Gen 1. I'm also planning to buy her flowers although I'm not sure if she'll appreciate that, she suggested for us to go meet over coffee given her busy schedule but she is also open to having dinner with me after coffee. I'm also paying for the date, which she doesn't mind.

Advice I Need: Is there something more substantial that I can give her on a first date? Like a stethoscope, maybe? She's extremely busy with her acads so I was really happy that she agreed to go out with me on a date, and if maybe there was just one more surprise I could give her then perhaps I just might have a better chance at giving her an impression that I am serious about pursuing her.

1gydmm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gydmm0/im_so_bad_at_making_friends_that_ive_let_myself/,I’m so bad at making friends that I’ve let myself be harshly put down by the one friend I managed to keep around because I probably can’t do better ,"I’m an early twenties female. I’ve struggled with my mental health from a very young age, a lot of it stems from bullying and unhealthy family dynamic. 

I’ve always had a hard time making friends since I have anxiety and am a little on the spectrum. 

A few years ago, I became friends with this girl online and we started chatting regularly since we couldn’t meet up all the time due to us living 2+ hours away and me being busy with college.

She could be really nice to me when I showed her my art and told her how school was going. I even used to confide to her about how hard it is for having to live at home with my emotionally immature and controlling parents

I started noticing problems whenever I would post anything on my social media, she would text me right after seeing it and tell me things she found wrong with what I posted. I’ve told her I have no interest in becoming an influencer like she does, and I know college isn’t always for everyone, but she’s always telling me “don’t you want to get so good at social media that you won’t even need school anymore?” I’m pretty low key on social media like I’ll post a picture of my coffee even if the background is just the coffee shop parking lot, but she keeps telling me not to post anything unless I run it by her. 

Things started really bothering me when I would reach out to her to seek support about stress from college or my home life, and she starting telling me that she can’t entertain any negativity at all because it doesn’t align with her goals of making it big as an influencer. She told me that me choosing to get a degree in order to later build a career is a much smaller destiny than hers. When I expressed frustration about my mother refusing to communicate with me, my friend said I should acknowledge that I’m the problem for being upset and childish all the time and nobody wants to put up with that 


Yes, I do have depression and anxiety that affects my mood and outlook, but I still found her comments to be really hurtful. At the same time, I’m aware that I have difficulty making friends so maybe her harshness is just something I’ll have to deal with if I want to keep a friend around. It’s not like I can probably do any better, believe me I’ve tried. Yeah I see other young people who have friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I’m just incapable of finding that. I remember around last week I was so close to just breaking down and crying and when I texted my friend that I was in a bad place needing someone to talk to she just sent me a screenshot of her notifications saying she had more important things to look at. 


Everyone says to reach out to others for help, but when I do I’m pushed away and told I’m the problem. Yeah I see other young people who have good friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I’m just incapable of finding that and should take what I can get

Gang Gang

Restaurant list
- Ajisai: didn’t like the tuna rolls, or the edemame, gyoza was okay 2/5

- Stanbury: While sometimes difficult to work around the longer than average wait times this restaurant is really good. I liked everything. The casual bar/cafe vibe is fun. The service wasn’t exceptionally attentive though, no fault of the server. 4/5

- Perri brothers pizza: a choice pizza spot as far as the south goes. One of the better buffalo chicken pizzas I’ve had. 3/5

- Rosewater: an all around exceptional dinner place. Providing classic neo-American cuisine that can’t be over done 4/5 $

- La Vita Dolce: Never again. Absolutely hated it. Bad service, mediocre food, horrible coffee. 1/5

- Barcelona: hit or miss. Great tapas and the obvious choice for quality charcuterie. Bonus points, they are open fairly late almost every day. The price per serving is a bit high. Service could probably be better. 3/5

- Duckworth grill & taproom: Just okay, mixed veggies and chips were good. Chicken was over cooked and dry 2/5

- La Buena Vida: A fun Mexican restaurant/club establishment. It is a little pricey but the drinks are cute (although seemingly lacking in liquor(?)). The food is solid and portions are great. It is veryyyyy loud sometimes however I like that they play the music videos on the screen. Probably a great place for a birthday party or celebration. 3/5

- Press Coffee & Crêpes: (Durham)  Fresh, clean, and expertly crafted food. Tied for favorite breakfast/brunch. The chocolate cherry latte was amazing. I recommend going on the weekend where they are full service. 4.5/5

- Bibibop: Decent, but did not meet the expectations of pick-n-mix (what a surprise) over all not bad. A little overpriced imo as well 2/5

- Bella Monica: It’s Italian food for sure. Lacks pizzazz and overpriced 2/5

- Salt & Lime Cabo Grille: pretty swell tacos. Quick, and pocket friendly. The atmosphere is cute. 3/5

- Second Empire: ⭐️An extraordinary establishment; the service, the food, the ambiance. A refreshing example of what fine dining should be. I find that “fine dining” is more so a reflection of an ecosystem rather than a perception of an experience. Second empire has cultivated an experience which delivers results over constitution. Nowhere else in Raleigh will you find a white cloth table being diligently waited on by a blue collar server. Likely one of the best restaurants I’ve ever eaten at. 5/5 $

- Mozelle’s: The food is just alright. Great presentation but I wasn’t blown away by the flavors. Green beans are unseasoned. Looks a LOT nicer than it actually is. 3/5 $

- Luna Ristorante: Just okay; it wasn’t quite what I expected but enjoyed it for the most part. As far as empanadas go they were really good but I’ve had better. 3/5

- Little Barb’s: very cute and very yummy treats. The woman behind the counter said I was a keeper 4/5

- Bonchon: A lot better than I expected. Quick, affordable and flavorful. 4/5 

- Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar:   I really really want to like this place a lot more than I do. It’s all just so shy of something special. It’s a southern style brunch place. 3/5

- Cru wine bar: Overpriced, shit service, underwhelming food 1.75/5

- Iyla’s Southern Kitchen: The Wolfpack sandwich may just be the best fried chicken sandwich I’ve ever had. A very accurate rendition of some viral hot honey chicken sandwich you may have seen on a tik tok or an IG reel. The tater tots are very very good. The owner is such a pal. 4/5

- Death & Taxes: Everything was very well done. Quality food and drinks. I appreciate their “fiery” twist to the culinary experience. Some dishes are just a bit underwhelming but the creativity really holds it together. The service was just ever so slightly lacking in respect to the more upscale setting.  Still very hospitable and enjoyable. 4/5 $

- Firebirds: Steak was steak. The pasta was good. Service was whack Overpriced imo 2/5

- Il Falò: It’s okay. Homemade pasta is a bonus and calamari was good. Pizza is pizza. 3/5

- Cape Fear seafood Company: The food was really good. I got haddock and Flounder and was pleasantly surprised. Considerably more affordable than a lot of seafood restaurants I’ve been too. 4/5

- Smokestack Cafe: Dutch Baby made me c*m. Absolutely delightful. The type of place you would see on that Guy Fiery show. Some of the portions are a bit strange. (THEY NEED TO SERVE THEIR DEVILED EGGS IN SERVINGS OF FOUR HALVES). My go to Sunday brunch spot. Truly one of Raleigh’s Gems. Overall a wonderful experience. 4.2/5

- Hawthorne & Wood: ⭐️A brilliant experience. Superb service. Chef Brandon Sharp and his team really deliver something special. The food was flavorful and perfectly portioned. The strawberry ice cream dessert is undefeated. 5/5 $

- J Alexander’s: Thoroughly unimpressive. Steak was way undercooked and service was sub par. Overpriced for the quality. Atmosphere is decent. 2/5

- Madre: Plates were a bit small even for tapas, good flavors though. Also drinks took a bit longer than they really should have. Kinda just Barcelona in Durham. Over all a decent experience 3/5

- Brodeto: No complaints. Food was good, service was attentive and consistent although the atmosphere leaves a tad to be desired. Getting that elevated dining experience often comes in small fragile details. I found the seating to be only shy of perfect, the smell, the constituent, the pace and the arrangements all just a silver hair away from something truly special. 4/5 $

- Cucciolo Terrazza: Just alright. I think the intention is more of a family style thing but that wasn’t made clear by our server, nor the small menu. Also, I was dumb and ordered the “butter chicken” thinking I was getting the Indian dish and it kinda stung when it was just two fried chicken breast in butter.” Decent. 3/5

- O-Ku: A wonderful and classic Asian fusion experience. The seaweed salad and sushi were both quite exceptional. Service was very pleasant and knowledgeable. 4/5

- Village Tavern: A pretentious atmosphere, though no fault of the establishment. I quite appreciate indoor flora and the long wrap around bar. The room is filled with financiers and doctors, perhaps the odd couple celebrating a special occasion. The food is well prepared, arrived quickly and tasted good, but it didn’t blow me away. The staff was hard at work and checked in frequently. I would probably only dine here again purely to be surrounded by the bourgeoisie stench of the upper class and their cold, performative prattle. 3/5

- Eggs Up Grill: This quaint and casual breakfast spot is unfortunately far from a pleasant morning experience. The atmosphere is bright and plain without much character. My server was attentive but rather awkward. The coffee is coffee, which is fine I suppose. The food is remarkably underwhelming. Relying far too heavily on the traditional southern flavors without any meaningful execution. Which is a shame because I waited nearly an hour for my food. Edible. 1/5

- Bongiornos & Sons: Easily the best sandwich and deli in Raleigh. I could do a number 3 everyday for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. It’s unfortunate they stop making sandwiches at 1 or 2 but I get it. 4/5

“Do you want to play a game” - WOPR  
“Why are we in the mess hall? Are you sour from last week's game?” Gary asked, as he finished the last of his desert.

“No, it was great to get owned, totally wrecked by you in a game. I will never ask you to do your worst ever again. It was like you summoned the damn devil and turned my dice into red hot coals.” Paul shook his hand, mimicking the action of dropping hot coals.

“It wasn’t that bad, surely” Gary said

“Nah it was actually cool to see your tactics pay off. Looking forward to seeing if I can find a counter. Next time” Paul replied. Thinking to himself “How much fun it's going to be when he finds the perfect counter play”

Paul got up, “I need to kill some time in HERE, wait ok.”

“What, you're on your free time! It's the next shift's turn, to clean up.” Gary replied in a voice louder than necessary.

“Just chill for a sec, I’ll grab some trays.” Paul said as he walked off.

Pall arrived with clean trays and cups, spoons, knives and forks. They hit the table with a clatter. Gary and Pauls used meal trays were pushed as far as possible out of the way.

Then it started.

Gary and Paul both purposefully and skilfully started to build their fabled “perfect fort”. They had stacked meal trays, making 2 towers. They were made by stacking trays on top of glasses with knives and forks sticking out the sides. The Towers, interlinked in the middle with balancing knives. Gary’s tower looked like a crazy party trick with knives and forks balanced all around. Gary could barely see over the top.

Gary argued “it has to be buried. It has to be low. It has to be made into the stone. If they've got the guns to make the plasma, they can melt the stone and “they” can make it underground.”

Paul refuted “Yeah they were fucked from the moment they've got behind the walls. They built a fort when they should have built  catacombs. They should have been embedded strongly with firing positions even like they were built in World War 1 or World War Two. Or any of the many wars that we had”

Gary replied ”What, is this a history lesson? I thought we were talking about Star ship Troopers.”  
Gary looked at Paul's tower confused. “Ok, how does yours work?” Looking at the knife balanced on the end of a fork.

Paul said ""it's a trench”

“Ah forks are inter connected halls? Buried?” Gary questioned in a more hushed tone.

“Yeah” - Paul grabbed a leftover Pea from a meal tray, “Peas for scale. A man” - Paul replied

Gary finally worked out what each knife and forks were and the orientation was and how Paul intended it to work.

Gary pointed -  “The Inverted forks are the heavy weapons in a trench in front of the walls? That's stupid! What's your crazy reason for that?” Gary replied.  
He thought, ""What silliness it was, having heavy guns in front of the walls?""

Paul pointed to the forks in his tower “No they are protected by the walls above like hardened machine gun positions, shooting out through a slot like a pill box, it hard to hit something from on top, if its buried ”

Gary groaned, “Fuck, History again, don’t you ever have any original ideas?

Paul used his, “calm” it’s not a fight voice “Dude slow down, this is not a history lesson we're talking about Star ship Troopers. Those guys. We already have a scenario. We know they had insect-like things to fight. We already have their weapons. We already have their planet, we already have their fortifications”. Paul took a breath and continued

“We were just talking about how WE could change their fortifications so they could survive and we've got to go back to history. History has got it all worked out. We don't have to make something from scratch. We can use what we already know, that way, when they get flushed by a massive swarm of movie insects they've got at least a chance. So my heavy guns are in a pill box that is protected. “ Paul finished his statement. He adjusted a fork to make the design clearer.

Paul pointed to the heavy gun fork he just moved. And continued “It's low to the ground. All they have to do is pull the trigger, Let it loose, shells skimming along the ground and take anything with them. They don't have to aim up and down. Don't have to think, just do it in a burst to keep the barrels cool.”

At that moment someone from the executive passed.

“How are you going to pull that apart, without crashing all over the floor” the stranger spoke.

“Oh sorry sir”  PAUL quickly looked up and spotted the insignia on his sleeve. “Oh pips on the collar too” Paul noticed holding his breath. He's still in uniform.

Gary had his back to the stranger.  
The stranger spoke again. “I thought I heard someone talk about history”

Gary said  “We were talking about Star ship Troopers”

The stranger replied “Oh that's a great movie. They were fucked the moment they got over the walls”

Gary spoke quickly without looking around, “Do we already know if we have these insects on our planet? If there is, the planetfall will fail! We'll be fucked! We cannot build any fortifications quick enough to defend any hostile creatures!”

Gary slowly turned to face the stranger. “Oh fuck” he thought as the spotted the pip. His tower was up to eye level and he did not think about how to take it down when he excitedly built it.

“What's with the towers of food trays? Is that a prank for the Mess Staff?” The stranger asked. He spoke with an even tone. And waited politely for the reply

Gary shuffled over to clear a part of the table, he started taking his Tower apart.

Paul said “ We were gaming the ways to survive if we were Star ship Troopers. These are our ideas.” Paul replied faster than Gary could respond.  “I used this Pea for scale. The inverted forks are the heavy cannons in pill boxes sir”

Gary reached out, Excitedly building another battle field. “these forks, knives and spoons are bad guys they're all swarming from in front of a fortification, it's okay if we've got enough weapons and we know we can kill them but think of it it's not one round one kill, Each kills takes a few shots, wouldn't take long before they we ran out of ammo” Moving the knives and forks around.” He said in a burst, without taking a breath.

Paul said “We don't have any idea of what We're carrying. But it's not gonna be enough if we get swarmed like in Star ship Troopers on Day One”.

“How often do you run war games?” The stranger asked

“ Oh 1 or 2 times a week when rec time breaks overlap sir. Warhammer 40k is our go to.” Paul replied

The stranger opened his smart pad, and casually spoke, “Make sure this gets to the kitchen window in a neat pile.” He looked up from his smart pad. “I am Raptor. I have just arranged a shift for you both in a map room. Check your pads for details. Ask for me when you arrive. Please be prompt and presentable in your casual uniform”

Paul and Gary stood up, a little too fast, Paul's tower collapsing across the table.

Raptor smiled and walked off as Garry and Paul tried to contain the cascade of food trays, mugs, knives and forks. At least Paul was quick enough to catch the dirty trays.

“YES Sir” They both said juggling the trays, clatter echoing through the almost empty mess hall.

Paul looked at Gary and had a wild look “What the hell just happened. Are we getting a notice, oh more crappy jobs coming up!”

Gary smiled. “We were invited to the map room before we crashed my tower”

“No No no. You crashed YOUR tower” Paul said.

Gary slowly smiled, clearly excited about  what just happened -“Hear me out. He asked about war gaming. AND we are going to the map room! It's game theory! We have been rostered to PLAY Games? Oh my head spins” Gary smiled “So much fun”

They checked the Data Pads, and looked at each other.  
“Hey meet up in the Mess hall and I can show you the way” Paul said  
“I know where it is! Did you forget I am a courier” Gary said, almost offended by the offer of directions.  
“Mess hall?”  
“Oh yeah!”  
Paul whispered under his breath leaning in very close to Gary. “But why? Surely they have worked it all out, what's wrong with the landing zone, what's wrong with our planet”

Paul turned to notice the display above the Serving bench. The ship's progress line has just changed from star approach, to in “System”, the tendril of progress only just starting to bend around our new home Igigi. But the track, it was RED!

Chapter 2 - The pinecone

Gary was bored and sick with the tedium of his work as one of the courier team. Collecting orders, prepping them in the reusable crates and delivering to whatever location needed the order. Collecting and collapsing the crates to bring back.  
The freezer was crazy to fetch from. Not only could the cold kill you. The crap was often stuck together and as the mission clock ticked along, the scan codes were slowly getting covered with frost. If you didn’t know where something was stored, it was just luck if you got a good scan.  
Gary learned long ago that the bay, row and segment codes you get on the scanner are more like “Try here first” kinda thing.  So his mind was always wandering into the theoretical.

Our ship was called the “Fata Morgana V”.  On earth the Fata Morgana is an optical illusion, where ocean ships float above the horizon.  
The star ships were commonly called the “pinecone” class colony hives. The huge star ship was built in the zero G shipyards. They are built as a single-use ship. The sole purpose was to get itself, all its cargo and all passengers onto a planet surface as fast as possible, as cheaply as possible.  
They were made just good enough to survive the G - forces during wormhole insertion and the rigours of the many months of deceleration the ships needed in order to eventually complete their delivery into the target planet.

Pall often used the name “like a Dorothy” to explain how planetfall was staged. The habitation modules would be loaded with cargo and supplies with the goal of making the core ship lighter. And each would be its own safe haven with rations, water and basic pioneer equipment, axes, spades, rope, first aid supplies and survival clothing. They would each individually complete an atmospheric descent.

Finishing under the canopy of parachutes. They were equipped with 3 main parachutes. The parachutes matched the ethos of the pinecone ships. They are cheap. They are packed tightly making them small. They are easy to make. Most of all they are reliable. They could easily be stored over long periods. Allowing the Habs to be mass produced. The only drawback: - is the lack of accuracy. Any accuracy. Landing anywhere in a football field was like winning a huge stakes lottery. And you just have to do that about 200 times to clear the whole core ship

The way they built the habs hovers on the edge of disaster. They have Just enough quality to survive the erosion of the single use heat shield. The quality of “Steerable”  one-use parachutes in the series V has now been upgraded now but they are not failproof. The habs are built like a tin box. The best comparison is an old earth caravan or relocatable home with a stronger frame along all the edges with connecting holes like old earth shipping containers.

Gary's favourite shorthand to use “It's going be like a crazy trailer park with no address or layout. I hope the computers can track all the new loading zone locations of the habs. We will need GPS coordinates when we track the cargo, planet side.

Paul theorised what the planet side courier tasks could be like.

“Oh I need a high speed manifold. OH, I will just walk over to Hab 52. And rummage through the containers until I finally scan the right one and walk back. There are hundreds of Habs, and they will be scattered all over for weeks! I bet that will take over an hour, even if we plot all their locations.” Paul thought to himself.

The large and heavy machinery to Gary, would be absolute nightmares. The planetfall goal is to break the heavy machinery down into parcels of about 100t each. And released in the same manner. The giant parachutes will only slow them enough to not destroy the contents like mad high school  “Egg drop” experiments.  
The fiery hot meteors raining from the sky.  
Gary did not linger on these disasters waiting to happen.

He knew it was a biased thought for a “Nice” outcome. Gary's simple wish was that he and the loader make it down.

The hail Mary as Gary called it. Is core landing.  
Gary often contemplated it with his simplified game theory.  
“It will never happen on our ship.” Gary complained  
“Here's my list of all the things that have work or we are back to the stone age. It's going to axe and spade, before you even get your helmet off”.  
Gary’s list changed from time to time but it mostly highlighted the same issue.  
Gary’s argument was something like “Everyone thinks about, is when it ALL works, with the positive bias because they want to live. What if something does not work, even something trivial. We are an outpost, until we are self-sufficient on the Planet. Only then I will call us a colony”  
Gary's core landing theory list goes something like this.

* Who keeps track of what goes where? Moving that much cargo, People are going to make mistakes, they always will, when under pressure. It's going to be chaos on the surface trying to find each other, let alone some piece of cargo.
* When we move the cargo out, is it balanced enough that the ship can correct for it?
* Did we get enough cargo out? Into the habs? Is the Core light enough?
* Did we overload any hab units?
* Can AI and computers work out a good trajectory? Given all the changes our new planet has. For one, does the heat shielding work in the gas mix in the new Atmosphere?
* Are the engines going to be able to light for the landing?
* Do they have enough thrust?
* How much is landing going to scour the ground? Send rocks blasting into the habs?
* Will the legs support it?
* Will everything left on board still work? Glass? tanks? The reactor? Computers? Pipes? Cooling?
* Is it simply going to start fires, it's only an improvised theoretical landing site ?
* Or simply who survives if there is a KA-Boom!?

Chapter 3 - The finger

“It is time to go!” Gary excitedly thought to himself. Gary was first to the mess hall. He had a handful of snacks and a fresh mug of coffee. He sat on the closest seat to the main doors eagerly waiting for Paul.

Paul arrived, His hair was neatly swept back, his uniform pressed.  
Gary looked down to see if Paul had polished his shoes. He was wearing dark coloured sports shoes.

“An all ""nighter""? Raptors going to have some words I am sure” Paul said in an off hand voice.  
“Are you ready?” Paul continued?

Gary swept the snacks into his courier bag and slung it over this shoulder. He leaned down to grab his mug and took a big mouthful to finish his now lukewarm coffee .

The trip to the map room was uneventful. Paul and Gary chatted. It was just their usual “what if” theories, back and forth along the way.

Paul reached out and placed a finger on the reader and the door to compartment “Con E M 1 door” slid open.

Gary was very confused. “You just opened the Confidential Executive Map room 1, with your finger?”

Gary had no time to guess why Paul's biometrics were configured for this door. He was quickly distracted by the Holographic globe that slowly rotated, covered in pins of all lengths and colours.  
A guard reached out to take Paul's bag. Paul barely noticed as the guard slid Paul's courier side bag from his shoulder. With quick efficiency the guard sorted its contents onto a trolley.  
Gary reached out to grab a snack off the trolley. The guard stepped in the way and gave a nod towards Raptor. He was quietly watching from a corner closest to the door.

Raptor started with a simple question that in hindsight, was not a good opening given that Gary clearly had been up all night.  
“Gary, what kept you up last night?”  Raptor said not ready for what was about to be hours of a Gary style Game theory session.

Chapter 4 - Raptors Ruse -

The game session was planned a week ago. When Paul met with Raptor  
Paul was sometimes asked to clean compartment “Con E M 1” ; he was one of the few janitorial staff with Executive clearance.  
By chance Raptor was in the room as Paul was cleaning up. Raptor did not blank the screens or clear the Holo.

“Oh you're one of the guys playing Warhammer?” Raptor asked

Paul was shocked twice. Paul turned his head gathering his thoughts. “He spoke to me? About Warhammer? Why? How did he know?” He thought to himself.

“Yes with Gary” Paul said, making sure if he’s in trouble, Gary is too.

Raptors voice was even, nonchalant, “Do you change the rules?”

“Yes, we make other armies, invent our own theoretical battle zones. Gary is the Game Theory master. Always, always, with, ""What if this”, oh when that, some are crazy good!” Paul said.  
Quickly Paul added - “His Planetfall theory is brutal. Everyone wants to live so the outcomes  are always nice. Not for Gary he kills everybody.”

“Ok we need to arrange a meeting, Not in the executive office.” Raptor said.

“What about the mess hall?” - Paul said, with a smile slowly growing

“Yes, ok, send me the details when you're ready. Just do it on your normal schedule” Raptor replied. He waved his hand and the displays in the room went to ship logo mode. Raptor walked out leaving Paul to finish cleaning the room.

Today's events in the Mess hall were not by chance. Raptor’s entrance into the Mess hall as planned a week ago. Building meal tray towers was Paul's way to kill time until raptor showed.

Chapter 4 - The trolley

“Gary, what kept you up last night?”  Raptor said. Not ready for what was about to be hours of Game theory session.

“Raptor Sir, I spent all night, doing renders, printing tokens, making maps and prepping some dice trays for today” Gary said with a confident tone. Knowing he was probably right about what they were going to do.

“Just call me Raptor, Gary do you know where we are?” Raptor asked.

“Yeah!  Confidential Executive Map room 1! The hologram gives it away” Gary almost shouted. The question broke his thoughts. Adding more excitement on top of all the other thoughts running through his head.  
“Raptor Sir” Gary finished.

“Just Raptor” Paul corrected.

“Ok. Raptor” Gary looked up.

Paul knew Garry was going to explode. As long as the trolley was in the corner, Raptor might be able to keep Gary on topic.

“Paul mentioned that you had a planetfall theory?” Raptor asked, without knowing what he had done, he stepped right into the tripwire.

The full Gary was released!

“Gary. Show me here, how it will affect Landing zone Alpha.” Raptor said using gestures to display the highly detailed map of the landing zone Alpha on the war table.

“No. No. No. Here it is. Straight away. Less than 5 minutes in. The BIAS. Paul, you, me, we all want to see a successful Planetfall!. We will always give a good, nice, perfect outcome. It's going to be chaos” Gary said, slowing his words dropping the excitement

“That's why I was up all night.” - Gary suddenly slowed, giving a serious reply. It was clear Gary had a lot of passion for his Theory.

“Ok Gary, show us how it's done” Raptor said, not exactly sure of what he agreed to do.

“Raptor, how do I get my personal renders, and maps onto the table?” Gary asked.  
The war table showed his landing zone map.

“The AI for voice recording and translating is very good. Just explain what you want and the table should make something for you.” Raptor said, moving up to the table keen to see what was displayed.

It was a simple map. Few details. On its boundaries it had a lake, a canyon, cliffs and mountains. The landing area was a mix of flat stone and grass.

“Ok” - Raptor thought to himself.

“Can I display the rules on the other displays around the room?” Gary asked  
A display showed the word “rules”

“It's day zero” Gary started - taking his serious Game Master voice.  
“The cargo shift has finished with perfection” Gary continued.  
The displays showed the rules as Gary spoke. Gary gained his confidence.  
“I am going to do a logistics play.”  
“Assumptions, all Habs, all staff, all life support is in good order”  
This the last of our biased perfect world ”

Paul reached for the trolley. Pushing up to Gary bumping him in the leg.

“Oh - here one of these each.” Gary reached down to the lidded dice trays.  
“Raptor when we play, shake the box then take the lid off. You have 10, 6 sided dice, and one D20” Gary said directed to Raptor.

“I will let that one slide. I am on the executive and we will use some respect. – I do play Warhammer too” - Raptor responded with a little rise in his voice more to startle Gary out of his hyper focused fixation of the things on the trolley. It was more to distract Gary while he was getting items off the trolley. Raptor did not imply any malice.

“Sorry, yeah we're all table top gamers. Here take these tokens, they are habs” Gary put one the war table.

“Table - please set a grid. Token reference for scale is 4m x 8m, set 0,0 as core landing zone, show 10m grid increments, bold grid every 50m, use light blue please” Gary said with a firm voice not sure how to talk to the AI.

The table grid displayed was so accurate the token was neatly surrounded by a grid.  
“Shit, ah that's awesome.” Gary exclaimed.  
“Yeah I am definitely the human in this room” Gary directed his comments to Raptor and Paul.

“Gary, that looks great. What are we overlooking? What’s missing?” Raptor said.

“North, where are we going to put North?” Gary smiled as he looked back to the table.

Paul looked down, “That lake would make a nice north. It puts the canyon to the west, the Cliffs to the south and the mountains to the East. Yeah I vote for the lake.”

Gary prompted Raptor “ You're the veto? For today, you can flip any decisions if you need to.”

“Yeah the Lake for North” Raptor replied.

The table rotated the grid and lined up to the now lakeside north.

“Any ideas for names?” Gary prompted the others.

Raptor replied “If you have any names worked out we will go with yours.”

Gary got a massive grin and gave a cackle, “The landing zone is called Purgatory, we are Demons  playing for the souls of the damned. I will play Hades”

“That's dark, really dark.” Paul said. “ At least it flips the planetfall theory to us wanting to kill everything”

Raptor just smiled “You're the GM and we are just along for the ride. Show us how it's done!”

Chapter 6 - parachutes

Gary started again “Table, the token represents a Hab, add a parachute, accurate to scale, simulate landing collapse, using a very light NE breeze, assume earth like conditions.”

A hologram of an fully open parachute appeared centred on the token, it lofted to the North East, as it slowly collapsed.

“What! Is that to scale?” Paul exclaimed. Paul was mesmerised, watching the animation.  
“Is that to scale?”  Raptor asked as well.

Given how small the token now looked on its own on the table in front of Gary. It was hard to imagine a 4mX 8m, hab drop size. The token was a speck to the 3, 80m long 35 m wide parachutes now Resting on the map Table.

\*\*Authors note: The Parachute size is in rounded numbers, based on IRL space programs to land a 10t capsule. A USA football field is about 110 m long by 49 m wide.

“Each one of those parachutes also weighs 100kg. It’s not a trivial task of clearing them up” Gary commented. Finally seeing for the first time how one of his game theory ideas finally looked. He thought to himself. “This is going to be hell for sure. I am Hades, and this is just a game.”

Gary handed rulers out to Paul and Raptor. “We will use these. There are only 6 numbers. They will represent where you will place your tokens, each is like the error in landing accuracy, bigger the number the further space you need to land your tokens.”

Paul handed out a pack of 10 tokens to Paul and Raptor. “Just roll your dice and place at your own pace, We will not take turns.” Gary said simply. Shaking his dice tray, lifting the lid, sorting the rolls.

Gary reached out with his ruler and placed a token.

“Oh I forgot, if you place a 6 flip it over, when we run the simulation they will have different rules” Gary said as he placed another token,

After everyone had a few tokens down Gary pointed “Don’t line them up with the grid, that's not going to happen when using Parachutes.”

Paul and Raptor used their rulers to poke and rotate some of the tokens, which were already on the table.

Raptor finished first. Gary looked up. He had 2 tokens left. Paul had 3.

Raptor made comments. “Nice exercise. No Bias with this, doing it using cardboard tokens highlights the limits of computer simulations, using more people gives a nice randomness.”

The final tokens were on the table.  
Gary spoke. “Table please add, collapsed parachutes, to the tokens, within 45 degrees of random wind shift, in token placement order, one at a time with 2 second delays”

The table started adding parachutes.  
After the first 5 simulated parachutes were displayed.

Gay spoke again. “Display can you a show a count and he total mass of Parachutes”  
The display showed “10  - 3000Kg” as there were 10 habs simulated.

Raptor turned to the display and back to the table. The parachutes started to overlap the previous Habs.  
Habs started to land on the parachutes.

The table finally finished adding all parachutes. The display stopped on “9300 Kg” \* - it was 31 Habs X 300kgs worth of parachutes per hab. Including Garys sample.

Gary handed out another batch of 10 Habs. “Let's go. You are now trying to land in the clear areas.” Shaking his dice tray.

Raptor Looks at what 30 habs trying to land in the same place looked like, a whole ship load of habs is not going to work like this.

It was now much harder to find gaps that met the game rules. The new Habs were getting further and further from the landing zone. The 0,0 mark was looking crowded.

“Add the parachutes” Gary said as Paul  lifted his hand from his last token.

The display showed “61 habs 18,300kg”

Gary pointed at the display - “Moving 18 tones. that is a huge effort to coordinate with Civilians”

Chapter  - The demon’s run

Gary smiled darkly “Now we play as demons! What hazard is going to be your home line?”

Raptor and Paul looked at Gary confused.

Gary clarified “You can choose to be at the Lake, the Canon, the cliffs or the mountains. That's where you will stand. 1 on the die, in this next round will put your hab in your hazard. We will place the 1’s last” Gary looked at Paul and Raptor they nodded with understanding.

“We will role play how your Hab is affected by your hazard. If you roll a 1. “  
Again Paul and Raptor nodded.

“Raptor you pick first.” Gary continued

“The lake, I will take the lake, it's the closest to the landing zone.” Raptor replied, moving around the table. His gaze now showed, fully how he must have earnt his call sign. Raptor’s gaze was glassy, calm and full of intent. He was clearly trying to work out how each roll would need to be placed.

Paul looked at his dice. “The last round was great.” He thought as he looked down, the dice tray had 3 ones.  
Paul tried to work out the best of the hazards “The mountains” he thought, “that's a safe play. I won’t be drowning in a lake, or smashing into cliffs or canyon walls falling to their deaths.”

Paul stammered as said “The Mountains”

Gary was quick to reply. “Ok I will take the Canyon. Keep your lids on and wait. Shake”

Paul recalled the conversation with Gary in the Mess hall. “Do your worst” he recalled the game that he got thrashed in.

“Here it comes,” Paul thought to himself. He was filled with dread. “What’s in my tray? I need to become a demon and use these hot coals, to dam the souls in Purgatory. It's just a game and it's just a cardboard token.”  
Paul struggled to shake the “it could be us” from his thoughts.

Gary continued making sure he still had Paul’s and Raptor’s attention. “Before we open our trays, 1’s mean your hab is in your hazard. We need to role play demons. These are the souls we are fighting over. Be brutal. We are just talking about the Habs. We are not Killing the occupants. They may be in peril, but they are alive. But you can give them a scare. If that's to your liking”

Two Nods.

“We will take turns. So keep your lids on.” Gary reinforced. “So who wants to go first”  
Raptor had the lid off his dice tray in an instant. “Me, I will go first” He called out, surprising Paul.

Raptor’s tray had a good mix of faces, But he had a 1 on the D6, and a 1 on the D20.

“Where are the tokens? “ Raptor asked

Gary dropped 11 gold looking coins in Raptors Hand “They need to pay the ferryman. Don’t play your 1’s yet.”  
The coins had a pictogram of a hand holding and orb.

Gary finished with “Demon Raptor! Place your 2, and give them a torment”

Paul jumped in with a quick “ah, Gary you go next, I'll wait for you”

Raptor thought about his torment. What would he give this hab? How will they live in purgatory?  “oh, what if the air conditioning was broken”

Raptor placed his token “The air conditioning, it is broken” He Said in a booming Voice

Gary replied “Hades approves that torment!”  
Gary lifted the lid from his dice tray. He was disappointed. ”Well that's boring!” Gary had 1 on a d6, no 6s and 19 on the d20”

Raptor pointed at Gary's dice tray. “You better get some good torments ready”

Gary Placed one of his coins, “They hit a tree, they have a hole in the wall”

Chapter 7  - The prince

Gary pointed  “Paul, are you ready? What's your demon callsign name?

“Oh What?” Paul was lost in his thoughts of how much he was dreading opening his tray.

Hades (Gary) commanded! “What is your demon name!?”

“Be'lakor the demon prince” Paul replied with confidence at last.

“Nice, Hades Approves. Going big Hey?”

Raptor gave a few hand claps from his side of the table. “Ha. Oh it's the big guy. Himself, Hail Be'lakor!”

\*Note: Be'lakor is a demon prince. One of the most powerful demons in Warhammer 40k.

Now! Paul mustered the courage to open the lid on his dice box. He was Be'lakor after all.  
2x1’s on D6, general mix of faces, and a 1 on the d20.

Paul placed his first coin. “Rough landing, they have a bent corner and locking holes are unusable”  
Everyone placed the round of coins quickly as they were well practised with role playing and table top games.

“Parachute is covering the door”  
“They have a leaking tap”  
“They have a spill on the floor”  
“Their water tank is leaking”  
“They are on a slope”  
“The doors is stuck, they will need tools”

“Their door is against another Hab”  
Hades questioned Raptor? “Is that in the rules? We were giving them space to land”

“Oh yes it is, I have granted them a high precision landing, they are simply facing the way a demon would place them.” Raptor replied, enjoying the gaming experience that was so far removed from his normal day to day.

Hades was next in turn he placed his token. “The cargo shifted its blocking the door”

“Their table is broken,” Be'lakor said when it was his turn

“Oh how evil! - Raptor replied - “Living without a table would be great punishment in  purgatory”

Be'lakor smiled, he was now in his stride. “What simple broken household items make it annoying to live without.” As he thought about waiting for his next turn.

“A broken chair”  
“The hab has a twist in the wall”  
“Blown fuse no lights” Be'lakor replied on his turn.

“Oh shit, I can imagine that. Bump, poof! no lights”. Gary said.

The other coins were placed with quick efficiency.

Be'lakor had some great torments when it was his turn.  
“They forgot to lock the over head cupboards - stuff all over the floor”  
“What about a “Final Destination” \*(movie) scene. The tool locker bust open”  
“A Parachute has not released and has not collapsed”  
“Oh the dreaded creaking door.”

Chapter 5 - Hazards

They were finally up to the 1’s. Raptor had 1 on d6, 1 on d20, Hades had 1 on d6. Be'lakor had 2 x 1’s d6 and the final 1 on his D20.

Raptor started, “How should I use the lake.”

Hades had a simple reply “Put them in peril”  
Raptor said “I have an Idea - They are floating on the lake. Bobbing. door up. Slowly filling with water”

Be'lakor smiled - “In the hazard in, peril - I approve!”

Raptor smiled ” I like that one too. Can I leave my D20 to last?”  
Hades replied “You have veto. Done”

Hades was ready with his “They jammed in the canyon, On a steep angle, door down, out of sight of the other habs”

Be'lakor smiled - “Approved - In the hazard, in peril. That would be a torment in Purgatory for sure!”

Delakor said “3 for me.”  He kissed the coin and placed it confidently in his mountains.  
“In deep snow”  
A kiss for the next. “on a steep slope”

“Now my D20. Rule of cool?” Be'lakor Asked - Checking with Raptor and Hades.

Raptor and Hades smiled. And replied together.  “Yes Of course”

“I have given them a flat, soft landing. I would like them to be in high spirits and eager to open their door.” Be'lakor smiled as he kissed his token and placed it on the Map table.

“Now for my demon surprise! - They open the door to the hissing of the heat shield as it melts the snow, creating tendrils of steam clouds. They enjoy the fantastic view I have given them. Their door opens over a clift. They see the chaos of the landing zone and weep. Because it is so very far away! An rescue will take a lot of effort”

Chapter  - The lake

Raptor started with. “Table! Draw my parachute in real time. I wish to move my token to find the best location. Direct it to the lake.”

Raptor put the coin on the table and started to move its position around the map.  
It slowly dawned on Be'lakor, he's going to put the parachute in peril. A waterlogged parachute would have to be cut away. Even just a small section would hold 100’s of kg of water.

He slid the token closer and closer to the 0,0 landing zone. I would not reach the centre but it was close is enough.

He lifted his finger.

Raptor simply replied “This is the last hab to land. The chutes are in the lake, doors facing west toward the canyon.”

Paul lifted his hand to his mouth - “even Be'lakor is not that evil!”

Gary was surprised  “What did I miss?”

Paul in a low voice - “Table show core ship landed.”

It was clear that Raptors token would be caught in the outer edges of the core ship.

“Would that destroy the ship?” Gary asked.

Paul was quick - “Unlikely, the ship is huge, it has a lot of mass, so it would be more like punching the hab up into the ship, if the thrust did not push it out of the way. “

Gary thought long and hard. “Ok, at the bottom of the ship's core is the reactor. But as you move out from the centre, You have electrical systems, mechanical areas with pumps. tanks and the like. But on the outermost areas are all the things you would only need ON Planet, in the unpressurised storage. You don't need it for the voyage. It has all kinds of things to the the colony started, Coils of wire, all the interconnects to join the habs back to the core when habs are rearranged into their block formats with 10 Habs together. Spare rations, farming equipment, all day 7 And beyond gear. They only drop the in-use heavy equipment with shutes”

Paul tried to take some of the melancholy away “We have to keep this to, just a game. There is time to improve our odds. Maybe we can improve our Planetfall”

Most Saturday mornings I try to get out of the house for a few hours, and I usually go to a few shops in a nearby strip mall, which happens to include a dog groomer.  So I was able to get her the nail trim and brush-out she badly needed.  She's mostly husky, so she's been shedding her summer coat.  On the trip there she was very freaked out by the wheelchair lift and didn't want to go,but some helpful people got her situated and she did fine.  She likes car rides, especially the rare ones which don't end at the v-e-t.  After her spa treatment, she got her first-ever pup cup from the coffee shop and a few nibbles of brisket from the nachos I had for lunch.  And it's true that puppies really are chick magnets, which I'm not upset with!  She got to meet a bunch of new people and smell new smells.

I’m currently using a Bodum pour over coffee carafe & filter, which I also use paper filters in, but clearly this is not an ideal solution.
 

Most mornings I grind a minimum of 30g of beans, and use a 1:16-1:17 ratio. Looking at reviews, most people rave about the V60 Switch. The recipes I’ve seen all call for 15g of beans, and although I could simply double it, it looks like the 03 size only holds 360ml of water, whereas for my 30g I’d need at least 480ml of water. 


Yes, there are multiple recipes in which the switch is opened for sections, and then closed. But given my daily requirements, is there really any point in me investing in the V60 switch (size 03), or should I just get a classic V60 and a new flask. 


Or are there other dripper out there that would work for me.

7pm: Immediately after injected I flushed and turned red from my face to chest.

8pm: within an hour I was so nauseous I had to lay down, and I couldn’t breathe through my nose. I was still flushed everywhere.

9pm: by hour two, the bottoms of my feet were tingly. Seriously, the only comparison I can make is to ecstasy. I just felt like I needed to rub my feet together. I think my groin was lit up at this point, but it wasn’t strong. 

10pm: by hour 3 I was vomiting. I vomited 6 times between 10pm and 12am. Strangely… I also feel like I have to poop. I start to think I have food poisoning.

11pm: nausea is still full throttle, and now I have hot flashes. I’m going from hot to cold and shivering and back. I can no longer lay down, the only way I’m coping is by sitting up on the couch and running to the bathroom when necessary.

12am: I have to poop again, and the involuntary spasms have me clenching my abdominal muscles so tightly, I puke again, in the trash can.

1am: still flushed, still having hot flashes, still can’t breathe through my nose, and still nauseous, but am able to lay down. I sleep in 10-20 min intervals until morning. 

8am: I give up on trying to sleep anymore. I’m still nauseous but I can sip water. The bottoms of my feet are still sensitive so standing sucks. I don’t even try to drink coffee. 

I couldn’t eat the following day. I took a nap around 1pm and was able to sleep for a solid 1.5 hours. I felt better afterwards and by 7pm, did finally feel like the medicine had worn off.

Here’s what I did:

I bought glass medicine vials and a box of insulin syringes. I injected the whole pen into a vial. It came out to about 22cc’s. Today, a week later, I injected 4cc’s. 

Immediately I flushed, and the red face and chest lasted a couple of hours. I was immediately nauseous but it subsided after a minute or two and so far hasn’t come back. It’s now been about 2.5 hours and I don’t have any other side effects yet, except maybe PTSD nausea. I think I’m freaked out that I might vomit again like last time. Definitely no tingles or sensitive skin.

[$500 - $1000]","I’ve been casually making coffee at home for about 6 years. I started with a Nespresso machine and eventually moved to a De'Longhi EC680M with a 1Zpresso JX-PRO manual grinder. My partner, on the other hand, uses a Lavazza Expert Coffee Bundle Classy Plus All-In-One Machine (LB 400) every day.

Here is the thing, I’m getting tired of having to grind coffee beans for both of us, and especially when friends come over. Since I drink light or medium roast coffee, it’s even harder to grind, and it’s starting to feel like a chore. My daily routine is grinding San Alberto medium roast beans (my favorite) and making espresso, americano or iced espresso. But honestly, I’m tired of manually grinding every day. It’s a hassle, and my partner can’t even use the grinder because it takes too much effort. She doesn’t care about the taste of espresso anyway, so this upgrade is just for me.

At first, I was looking at the Jura E4 because it’s super convenient, but I’ve heard the espresso quality might actually be worse than my current setup? Then I saw the Ninja Deluxe Cafe, but it has way more features than I’d ever use. I don’t drink milk (or plant milk), so I’m all about straight espresso. Now I’m eyeing the Breville Bambino paired with the Baratza Encore ESP.

Is this really the best choice for a solid balance of quality and convenience at this price range? Or is there a better, easier way to get great espresso? Would love some recommendations, thanks!",1,1732404956.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

On top of that I try to go to the gym a few times a week and am very frustrated that I have almost zero time for myself and my hobbies. 

My problem is that I am always stuck in my head thinking and stressing about things like work, money, stressed about buying a house because I feel like it is time, stressing about buying a new car or second hand one because the one we have is very old and unreliable. And because of all this overthinking i can't be present and disconnect from the stressful things.

Girlfriend is also working from home and we mostly work from the same room, except when we have meetings, we talk during the day if we can and mostly eat at the same time. After work we watch a movie or go for a walk. So I feel like we do stuff together but she always wants more. 

For example this Saturday we stayed in bed until 2 pm. Had our coffee, had sex, stayed in bed and talked but then I felt like the day is passing and I wanted to do something for myself too. So I went to my computer and wanted to play a game for a little while and then chill, watch some anime or YouTube. But I couldn't really because she kept interrupting me during this time and wanted to put up the Christmas tree which I order a few days ago. So we went to the store and bought Christmas ornaments. After we got back i cooked dinner and then told her that I wanted to stay at my desk for a while and then later do the tree. She said ok and got on the phone with a friend. I got bored at my desk and went for a shower and also had to shave and so on, so I stayed for like an hour and when I got out she was mad. Couldn't figure out why, and after a while it was because I'm not happy enough about spending time together.

I wanted to do the tree but she said no because my mood is not great. And it's true because like I said, I am stressed, but still...

I know my issue is with overthinking and being present. But I keep asking if this is ok or she has some fear or something that she always wants to stay glued to me and I feel like I can't breathe sometimes.

1gyd1nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gyd1nt/a_god_in_the_woods_part_1/,A god in the woods [part 1],"Lately I have been revisiting an old playground horror story that’s been passing around the area where in I grew up. When I was young the older children would tell me and my friends that there was a god living in the forest.

They told us all those usual things you would think fit that description; All powerful, omniscient and so on. But they emphasized one thing that always struck me as sinister. This deity did not seek worship. That specific fact always creeped me out. That something so alien that it didn’t desire or seek a single thing, not even dominion over its subjects, existed somewhere right behind our town’s flimsy treeline.

It just rubbed me as truly foreboding. Like seeing a billboard proclaiming the military suddenly needs more troops or having a guy with no friends in sight hand you a drink at a bar. It was as if, there was some unspoken motive too horrible to flaunt out in the open lurking behind a false facade.

And what god could possibly have a secret motive darker than requiring eternal servitude?

I revisited this story because through my son, I’ve found out that the children of this town still tell each other this story. Not a single thing has changed about it either. Not a single thing. The story goes, that if you find your soul heavy with a longing, you never shared, go into the forest. And when you have gone further than you’ve ever been before, a being will have known your wish eons in advance and grant it if your souls the only one whom knows you went seeking.

Even back then I thought that it must have been made up by the older kids to get us into the forest alone. A very clever idea surely coned up by some imaginative little twerp tired of getting caught giving swirlies to us younger kids; simply wanting to get those younger kids a little further away from the prying eyes of teachers.

And of cause I’ve told my kid as much, and to obviously never go into the forest alone.

But the more I think about it though, the more it bothers me that this story is still going around. I can only remember two kids from my school ever going looking for the magic place in the woods, and none of them where ambushed by the school bullies. And you would think that a failed middle schoolers plan, to isolate some smaller kids, from over twenty years ago would, by now, have been forgotten.

So because I wanted to know more, I tried to reach out and connect with those I heard went looking in the forest back then. And one replied back to me, the short of it being that apparently one of my then friends told them about the deity in the forest. They were adamant that they told everyone that it was all bogus and that they were going in the forest to prove it. So clearly they hadn’t been the one to spread the rumor further.

I did ask what if anything happened in the forest, and they let me know in a very condescending tone that everything about their childhood walk in the forest was normal.

But having received a reason to catch up with the old mate who evidently told them the scary story, I chose to message Josh.

I do remember that he was the one in our friend group that believed the story the most, so it isn’t all that strange if he helped spread that weird story.

He was very keen to see me and talk over coffee. So I guess that’s what I’m waiting for now, I hope Josh still remembers how and to whom he told that story…",2,1732404676.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I miss her, more than life itself, material possessions, what I miss is both my best friend and my fiance in one. Someone I valued deeply. The way she smiled when she was enjoying herself. The way she wept when she was down on herself (know i know why). The way she hurt herself i didn't love, but i would always pull her out of that dark place and tell her it's ok. She was worth more than self-harm. The dorky laughs, the nerdy shit she loved. Her passions (hair and makeup), her drive, even the parts of herself she didn't really understand or want to. Her impulsiveness and sexual proclivity. Her rashness, she lacks accountability at times. Her love of all things nightmare before Christmas, her love of studio ghibli, her love of lego, her Godzilla obsession, her pops. The stupid sippy cup selection she kept from me till we moved in together, her love of mtg, supernatural, her love of the occult, even when I didn't quite understand it. The way she always smelt of snow fairy, a gothic godess that loved platforms and tulle, a sucker for grape drinks. 

I miss moments we shared, at the height of that mountain in japan, the problems we always overcame, together. 

The hands that guided us. I sit here in an emotional wreck knowing I can't see or talk to her. Fuck. 

I miss our friends. Most of which I unknowingly lost. Because she managed to turn them against me. 

I miss my job. I lost after she shat talked me to my boss. Major relationships I'd both worked on and maintained over a long time. 

I miss the life we build together, I miss sharing our successes together. That one hits me in the gut the most. 

I miss how she liked her sauce and spaghetti seperated, her spaghetti strands cut into smaller pieces. 

Her coffee in the morning two sugars, not overdone with milk. Or tea with 2 teabags and one sugar. 

Her love of ramen, doctor who, her rainbow paddle pops, even though I told her it was just caramel and she said it wrecked it. So we pretended they were different flavours regardless.

Her love of all Adam Sandler movies. 
Her love of Guren Lagen. 

I love everything she valued, some things I can't mention I loved. But all the same. 

I love her, as a person. Strip back the aesthetics. Tattoos, piercings, scars, damage, trauma and all the other shit, above all else. 

I love that she was so career driven she forgot to take a break. I had to remind her to slow down due to her dexies making her go a million miles an hour. 

I don't even know if she'd remembered a damn thing about me. 

That doesn't matter though. Because even above myself. She was the light of my life. My confidant, my person in my corner. 

When she had my back, I had hers, even now she doesn't have my back I still have hers. 

I know it's one sided and unrecipricated.
I hate myself for what I became out of fear of rejection.

I hate myself for becoming less lovable because of the signs of infidelity I kept finding around my home. 

I hate the moments I got angry, and yet when I think of her all I can get right now is good memories. 

But some bad thorns stick in my side because I learnt to love and grow with her as both friends. Then my girlfriend, then to my fiance.

Her impulsiveness and spiteful behaviour was sometimes a drag because I didn't really have a spiteful bone in me. I just moved on from people if I knew they weren't challenging me in life of being an additive rather than a negative.

This was different. Even challenged me to be better. I could never move past the conversations we had. Because she would deny, deny, deny. Even though we were both there. Both experienced the same things. 

I knew she was playing games when she would just say and stop with the sentence it's just your insecurities. 

Like the footprints on our tatami mat in the loungroom from some stranger, according to her ""I could explain"", then she smudged them. first I was seeing things, then it was ghosts, then it was someone was breaking in. 

Then they didn't exist. Then they did. I knew she was scrambling. I understood her fear. Because I'd been there and didn't want to lose everything. 
I reassured her to continue. 

The cologne walking through the door of my own home, kept telling me so one had been there. 

While there was a dark side to her. There was still love in her heart somewhere, i loved that too, because id been there and done those things years earlier and knew exactly what it was like. But I knew it wasn't for me anymore was it.

The one thing I hated. During arguements, she'd slap. Or if I stuck to my main points. She would try and get me angry or upset about other things I'd done. Then name call, belittle and slap me. 

I only say all this because I talk to my lawyer about it.

I miss ther person I fell in love with. Before she started fucking around with my friends. 
I miss the woman that said yes. Who didn't ruin my professional life. I miss the people I had in my life that I had built bonds with. 

I lost long term friends, mentorships, and associations, all my worldly possessions.
Above all else 

None of that matters over the bond with her. 

Even these restrictions and curfew I have on myself now, are going to restrict my new job. 
I've put in applications for changed restriction. 
But I'm afraid it will now cost me work too.

Her emotional manipulation by saying she doesn't want to talk about it as a boundary, is the worst misuse and manipulation of modern pshycology I have ever seen. 

It has cost me my job,
My livelihood,
My integrity, 
My things, sentimental or not,
My freedom,
Maybe my life I dunno,

The impact on these charges may change my life, even though I'm being painted as a perpetrator, She has stripped me of everything I had, including my safety. 

It's cost me everything that I paved with blood sweat and tears. Fuck money.
The transferred effort, that I don't think I've seen others put in half as much sometimes.

I'm exhausted, I'm fucking wired, the nightmares and sleep loss are draining, I wish anyone would have my back, or the legal system would listen. 

I wish the fucking world for her, she is studying psychology too. I hope it goes well for her. 
I hope she finds someone who brings her joy, kids, stability, financial freedoms. 

All the things I couldn't. There is a lot of pain. 
I feel fucking wrecked. Even my dog I can't see. 

I can't cheer up. I try and have fleeting moments.
I just wish her well. 
Even though she wishes hell upon me.

This is the feminist agenda. 
This is what playing the victim looks like.
She played me harder than I played myself.
Thinking I could really break through to the person I thought I knew.

It feels like a nightmare.

I miss her, more than life itself, material possessions, what I miss is both my best friend and my fiance in one. Someone I valued deeply. The way she smiled when she was enjoying herself. The way she wept when she was down on herself (know i know why). The way she hurt herself i didn't love, but i would always pull her out of that dark place and tell her it's ok. She was worth more than self-harm. The dorky laughs, the nerdy shit she loved. Her passions (hair and makeup), her drive, even the parts of herself she didn't really understand or want to. Her impulsiveness and sexual proclivity. Her rashness, she lacks accountability at times. Her love of all things nightmare before Christmas, her love of studio ghibli, her love of lego, her Godzilla obsession, her pops. The stupid sippy cup selection she kept from me till we moved in together, her love of mtg, supernatural, her love of the occult, even when I didn't quite understand it. The way she always smelt of snow fairy, a gothic godess that loved platforms and tulle, a sucker for grape drinks. 

I miss moments we shared, at the height of that mountain in japan, the problems we always overcame, together. 

The hands that guided us. I sit here in an emotional wreck knowing I can't see or talk to her. Fuck. 

I miss our friends. Most of which I unknowingly lost. Because she managed to turn them against me. 

I miss my job. I lost after she shat talked me to my boss. Major relationships I'd both worked on and maintained over a long time. 

I miss the life we build together, I miss sharing our successes together. That one hits me in the gut the most. 

I miss how she liked her sauce and spaghetti seperated, her spaghetti strands cut into smaller pieces. 

Her coffee in the morning two sugars, not overdone with milk. Or tea with 2 teabags and one sugar. 

Her love of ramen, doctor who, her rainbow paddle pops, even though I told her it was just caramel and she said it wrecked it. So we pretended they were different flavours regardless.

Her love of all Adam Sandler movies. 
Her love of Guren Lagen. 

I love everything she valued, some things I can't mention I loved. But all the same. 

I love her, as a person. Strip back the aesthetics. Tattoos, piercings, scars, damage, trauma and all the other shit, above all else. 

I love that she was so career driven she forgot to take a break. I had to remind her to slow down due to her dexies making her go a million miles an hour. 

I don't even know if she'd remembered a damn thing about me. 

That doesn't matter though. Because even above myself. She was the light of my life. My confidant, my person in my corner. 

When she had my back, I had hers, even now she doesn't have my back I still have hers. 

I know it's one sided and unrecipricated.
I hate myself for what I became out of fear of rejection.

I hate myself for becoming less lovable because of the signs of infidelity I kept finding around my home. 

I hate the moments I got angry, and yet when I think of her all I can get right now is good memories. 

But some bad thorns stick in my side because I learnt to love and grow with her as both friends. Then my girlfriend, then to my fiance.

Her impulsiveness and spiteful behaviour was sometimes a drag because I didn't really have a spiteful bone in me. I just moved on from people if I knew they weren't challenging me in life of being an additive rather than a negative.

This was different. Even challenged me to be better. I could never move past the conversations we had. Because she would deny, deny, deny. Even though we were both there. Both experienced the same things. 

I knew she was playing games when she would just say and stop with the sentence it's just your insecurities. 

Like the footprints on our tatami mat in the loungroom from some stranger, according to her ""I could explain"", then she smudged them. first I was seeing things, then it was ghosts, then it was someone was breaking in. 

Then they didn't exist. Then they did. I knew she was scrambling. I understood her fear. Because I'd been there and didn't want to lose everything. 
I reassured her to continue. 

The cologne walking through the door of my own home, kept telling me so one had been there. 

While there was a dark side to her. There was still love in her heart somewhere, i loved that too, because id been there and done those things years earlier and knew exactly what it was like. But I knew it wasn't for me anymore was it.

The one thing I hated. During arguements, she'd slap. Or if I stuck to my main points. She would try and get me angry or upset about other things I'd done. Then name call, belittle and slap me. 

I only say all this because I talk to my lawyer about it.

I was hired to decode equations left behind at a string of crime scenes. And I'm terrified by what they might mean.,"I was sitting back at my desk with my feet up, reading one of my students' three hundred page dissertations, entitled ""Ruminations in String Theory"", when I heard a knock on my office door.

But before I could even answer, a middle-aged chap donning a baseball cap and a five o'clock shadow, casually let himself in.

""Professor Windsor?"" He asked, in a fairly heavy Boston accent, as he closed the door behind him.

""Last time I checked."" I replied, in an even heavier British accent, my regal accent contrasting with his… well… less regal accent.

I smiled…

...But he didn't smile back.

That’s when I noticed the golden badge that was dangling from around his neck.

""Detective John O'Brien."" He introduced himself with a gruff voice, before continuing, ""Hear they flew you all the way out from England, to head the physics program?""

""That they did."" I replied.

""Well, Professor… We have reason to believe that there's a serial killer stalking the city... and we need your help.""

“My help?” I laughed. “That’s rubbish. I haven’t heard any reports of a serial killer.”

“That’s because for all intents and purposes… there’s nothing to report. The people he kills… are from the outskirts of society. No IDs. No family. And based on how he’s killing them… the department’s decided to… keep it under wraps.”

""How’s he killing them?"" I asked, confused by where he was going with it.

That's when he reached into his pocket, removed something, and tossed it onto my desk. ""Found this on his last victim.""

I put on my spectacles and took a closer look.

It was a photograph of a blood-spattered body, atop of which was placed a handwritten note containing a series of equations…

...Equations that I was all too familiar with.

""Physics."" I said, ""I see your killer fancies himself something of a science enthusiast.""

""We’re fairly confident that these are clues to his next murder. And we were hoping that you might be able to help us... decode them.""

“How many have there been?”

“Ten so far. And we think there are only two left.”

“What makes you think that?”

“He wrote us a letter. Apparently each death represents one of the 12 laws of physics. And after the 12th, he plans to disappear.”

“Which laws are left?”

“Well, there were 3. The 3 laws of motion. But your buddy here,” He said, pointing to the photograph. “He was the first of the 3… Inertia. The last 2 are-”

“Acceleration and Action-Reaction.” I interrupted, finishing his sentence.

“And that’s exactly why we need your help, professor.”

I laughed. ""Despite the stereotype, Detective O’ Brien, I'm afraid this British chap is far from a sleuth. And I really must be getting home. I wish you the best with your investigation-”

""Listen, professor,"" He interrupted, ""I'm just gonna be straight up with you. This wasn't my idea, getting you involved. But the chief's got it in his head that someone like yourself... an expert in your field… could help us find this guy. So do it or don't do it… either's fine by me. It's my job to find this sicko either way. Just let me know, so I can get back to work.""

He had given me an out. An out, which I happily accepted.

""Well then, if it's no skin off your back, Detective. I'll have to regretfully decline."" I said decidedly, before throwing on my overcoat, and gesturing to the desk. “As you can see, I have far too many papers to catch up on.”

He started to open his mouth, as if he was about to argue, but stopped himself, before tossing his business card onto my desk and saying, “Call me if you change your mind.”

And with that, he simply shrugged his shoulders and walked out of my office, the door slamming behind him.

—

I honestly didn't think much of the encounter at the time, and, by the next day, I had already forgotten about it, much too preoccupied with what was now a heaping pile of dissertations on my desk.

“Ryan Murphy.” I said aloud rather unapologetically, as I picked up the report at the top of the stack, trying to recall which of my students he was. After all, there were countless students in my classes that year, let alone over the years. How was I ever supposed to remember them all?

After reviewing Ryan’s paper, I marked it with an ‘F,’ before muttering a single word under my breath, “Rubbish.”

I took a deep breath and reached for the next report, but before I could, something caught my eye on my bookshelf.

It was a copy of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, and containing his 3 laws of motion.

The book immediately brought me back to my conversation with the detective. For a moment, I sat there, wrestling with the decision to entertain O’Brien’s invitation, or forget it altogether.

Well fuck me. I thought to myself, as I leaned back in my chair, and let out a conflicted sigh, eventually caving in, and picking up my mobile phone. Fuck it.

RING. RING. RING.

“O’Brien.” He answered, in his thick Boston accent.

“Evening, Detective. It’s Professor Windsor.”

""What happened to regretfully declining?"" He replied, with a smug smile on his face, that I couldn't see… but knew was there.

I simply replied, ""Send me the equations.""

—

Later that night, whilst treating myself to a cheeky drink at the Irish pub that was conveniently located below my flat, I stared down at my mobile phone, desperately trying to make some sense of the killer's puzzle.

They were physics equations for sure. But they didn’t make any sense. The killer was surely familiar with science, but had purposely arranged the symbols in a haphazard way, as if spelling something out with them.

What the fuck could these equations, in combination with one another, possibly mean? I wondered, as I took a sip of my stout. At the time, pubs in the states weren't necessarily known for the quality of their stouts, but this one was a special kind of foul. Nevertheless, I drank it anyway, the closest thing to a taste of home that I was going to find.

""What's that symbol for?"" The patron sitting next me interjected, in yet another heavy Boston accent.

Instinctively, I moved to cover my mobile phone, assuming that he saw the clue, but I quickly realised that he was actually pointing to the patch on my sweater.

""Oh this?"" I replied, ""It's for Tottenham... Where I'm from. Or its team I should say.""

""What kind of team?”

“Football.”

“You a Pats fan?” He asked.

“Oh, not that football...” I began, before realising that it wasn’t worth attempting to explain to him that, to the rest of the world, football was actually played with your feet.

""Tottenham’s in England?""

“Yes, sir.”

“Your English accent. It’s pretty subtle.”

“Well, I spent some time in the states as a kid.”

""They got snow like this over there?"" He asked, pointing out the window to the falling snow,  which had now amounted to about an inch. The first inch… of what was predicted to be one of the worst blizzards on record.

""Not like this."" I replied with a smile.

""How long you been here?""

""Just a year now.""

""Well fuck… welcome to Boston."" He said, before turning to the bartender. ""Hey, Danny, get my friend over here a beer on me.""

""Cheers, mate.""

But despite the friendly gesture, I couldn't help but still feel melancholy, empty, alone. It had been a year since my fateful voyage across the pond, but I still couldn’t help but feel haunted by the life I left behind.

I spent the rest of the night frantically attempting to solve the killer's riddle, eventually passing out on the floor with my mobile phone on my chest, my body unintentionally resembling the photo of his last victim.

—

When I woke up the next morning, it suddenly hit me. Somehow, after a night of banging my head against the wall, the clue suddenly made sense.

“Acceleration.” I said aloud, remembering the theme of the next murder. “And an equation for gas, PV = nRT. That's it! He's gonna strike someone with a vehicle!”

I reached for my mobile phone, which had fallen to the floor beside me over the course of the night, and picked it up, excited to inform Detective O’Brien of my findings. But before I could dial his number, I heard a knock on my apartment door.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

CLICK.

I opened it, to find the detective himself simply standing there, with a disapproving look on his face.

""I did it!"" I cried out, excitedly.

""Did what?"" He asked, with a foul expression on his face.

""I solved it! He's gonna hit his next victim with a car!”

But O’Brien couldn't have been less impressed. Instead, he simply chided me.

""Hit his next victim with a car? Too little, too late, professor.""

My jaw dropped.

""Already?""

""He moves fast.""

""But you must admit. I was right.""

""You were late.""

""But the victim. He was hit by a car?”

""Yes.""

""So what you're saying is, late or not, I was right.""

""Nope.""

""Why not?”

""Cause I'm never gonna give you that satisfaction.""

""Fair enough. So now what?""

""Let's take a ride.""

—

Fifteen minutes later, we were driving through the city on I-93, on our way to Southie, where, from what Detective O’Brien had told me, the killer’s 11th victim had, sure enough, been crushed to death by a vehicle.

For most of the ride, we sat in silence, the only sound to be heard being that of the windscreen wipers swishing back and forth, as they cleared the rapidly falling snow from the windscreen.

Detective O'Brien occasionally sipped away at a styrofoam coffee cup that he'd bought from what I'd deduced… must have been the only coffee chain in the Commonwealth.

""Ever see a dead body?"" He asked me at one point, breaking the silence.

""Besides at a wake..."" I replied, ""...No.""

""Just do me a favour. If you gotta puke, just step away. Don't get that shit on me."" He joked. But his face betrayed no emotion.

""On your shoes. Got it."" I replied with a deadpan look, playing along.

By the time we arrived at the scene of the crime, an abandoned alley in Southie, almost a foot of snow had accumulated on the ground.

As I stepped out of the car, I looked at the cobblestone street that led to the accident, which was littered with icy footprints and roped off by yellow caution tape.

""You'd think he would have waited ‘til summer."" I pointed out, gesturing to the footprints, ""Seems risky, leaving tracks and all.""

""It's part of the thrill for him. He clearly gets off on leaving bread crumbs."" The detective explained, before leading me down the alleyway and to a deadend, where, sure enough, was…

....A mangled body, face down in the snow, crushed into a dumpster by what must have been the killer’s vehicle. It was a disgusting, horrible, and terrifying sight, and I immediately began to gag. O’Brien simply looked at me and shook his head.

After I had recovered, the detective brought me up to the roof of a nearby building to get an overhead vantage point of the site. He then handed me the newest clue, which had being pulled from the victim. Once again, it contained a new series of physics equations.

""Third time's a charm, Professor."" O'Brien said, ""This will be the 3rd and last law of motion. And our last chance to catch this guy.”

Rather than look down at the crime scene below, I instead chose to look out into the distance, at the expanse of Boston, its purple-lit bridge and tall downtown buildings dominating its skyline. I knew that out there, somewhere, a killer was lurking, waiting to strike… his last strike. And I needed to work fast.

—

Later that night, when I finally got home, completely knackered, I decided to skip my usual cheeky nightcap at the pub, instead opting to stay in and study the equation.

And after hours of staring at the latest clue, and nearly giving up, my mobile phone started ringing.

RING. RING. RING.

What does he want now? I wondered, assuming it was Detective O'Brien. But when I looked at my mobile phone, I saw that it wasn't him. But rather, an unknown number.

I don't know why, but I answered.

""Hello?""

For a moment, I heard nothing but silence, and was about to hang up, until suddenly…

...The killer spoke… in a hauntingly calm nondescript voice.

""I'm watching you, Professor. Please, by all means, continue your investigation. Remember… ‘No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess.’” He taunted, ending with a quote from Sir Isaac Newton himself.

And then...

CLICK.

…He hung up.

The very thought of such a cryptic encounter caused my stomach to drop, and my mind to begin racing. How did he know about me? I wondered.

I was so terrified by his call, and the thought of ending up like the two victims that I’d seen, in the photograph and the alley respectively, that I nearly decided to give up on decoding the clue until...

...It hit me.

“Action-Reaction.” I said aloud, remembering the theme of the next murder. “The trajectory of a projectile, expressed as \\((x(t)=vcos(\\theta )t,y(t)=vsin(\\theta )t-(1/2)gt)\\), and “The Wright Brothers equation, expressed as L = k \* V\^2 \* A \* Cl. Airport? The trajectory of a bullet. He's going to... shoot someone… at the airport!?”

After double-checking my work, it almost seemed too obvious.

I gathered just enough strength to hobble up to my feet, picked up my mobile phone, and immediately called the detective.

But I found myself hyperventilating so hard… that I could barely get out a word.

""Windsor? You okay?"" O’Brien asked, on the other end of the line.

Eventually, I managed to get a few words out. ""Airport! We’ve gotta get to the airport!""

—

To his credit, Detective O'Brien didn't ask many questions, and within thirty minutes, we were back in his car, once again racing down the motorway to the airport, red and blue sirens illuminating the falling snow outside.

On the way there, he broke the silence again.

""You got a wife?"" He asked.

""Used to."" I replied.

""Where's she now?""

""Back home… in England.""

""She didn't want to make the trip to exotic Boston?"" He joked, gesturing to the blizzard on the other side of the windscreen, his face once again betraying no emotion.

""Something like that."" I replied.

""Well, I'm sorry to hear that.""

""What about you?"" I asked, turning the question on him.

""Used to."" He replied.

""Where's she now?""

""Moved to the west coast.""

""She didn't want to stay in exotic Boston?"" I asked, calling back to his joke, as I attempted not to crack a smile.

""Somethin’ like that."" He replied, with a solemn look, as the blizzard continued to pound away at the windscreen.

—

It was almost 10pm when we finally arrived at the snowswept airport, and I feared that we may be too late. But I resolved to stay hopeful.

The place was desolate. With every flight in and out of Boston cancelled, what looked like a legion of planes sat grounded on the tarmac, quietly parked, until the imminent weather cleared.

The detective and I decided to take a walk around the outside of the airport, circling its perimeter with the hoods of our jackets up, in an effort to shield our faces from the wind.

But with the blizzard at its peak, there wasn't a soul in sight.

We had almost given up our search, when suddenly, something in the distance caught my eye...

...What I assumed was an airport worker, frantically running over to us, and fast.

Detective O’Brien drew his gun.

""Help! Help!"" The panicked chap called out, his face obscured by both the snow, and the hood of his heavy jacket. ""Officer, that vehicle over there. I saw a man inside with a gun.""

He pointed to an empty car park, about a good distance away, where, sure enough, was a vehicle, its engine idling, its exhaust pouring from its tailpipe, and the silhouette of another chap sitting in its driver's seat.

O'Brien simply turned to me and said, ""Stay here.""

...Before immediately darting off in the direction of the car.

From a distance, I saw him approach the driver's side window slowly, gun raised. He then stopped at the car and reached inside, before suddenly stumbling back and collapsing into the snow.

Fearing the worst, I gathered all of my courage and ran over to help him, expecting the car to peel off...

...But it never did.

When I finally reached Detective O’Brien, I found him alive and well, sitting in the snow, as flakes fell all around him, a look of shock on his face.

Suddenly, as if realising something, he hopped to his feet.

""Don't look inside."" He insisted...

...Before darting off, back in the direction we came from, back towards the chap, who was long gone.

But despite Detective O'Brien's instruction, I couldn't contain my curiosity, and took a few steps closer to the car.

There, before me, still sitting upright in the driver's seat, was the body of the driver, bullet through his head, his blood and brains splattered across its interior like a red Jackson Pollock. 

I looked around inside the vehicle to see if there was another clue… another string of equations. But just as O’Brien had warned, I found nothing, proving that this truly was the 12th and last of the killer’s victims.

I took a few steps back and tumbled over into the snow drift, still processing what I had just seen.

Sitting there in silence, flakes falling all around me, I suddenly realised that the chap who had tipped us off to the car, was likely the culprit himself.

I looked down at the snowy ground, straining my eyes to spot the footprints he might have left when ran away.

But when I finally found them, to my horror, I discovered that they went off in a different direction than where Detective O’Brien had run, circling back towards the car.

Before I could dwell on the thought for too long, I suddenly heard the CLICK of a gun behind me.

“Professor Windsor, funny to see you here.” I heard the killer say, in the same voice that I’d heard on the other end of my mobile phone the night before.

I slowly turned around, to see the same chap who had warned us about the car, his face still shrouded by the hood of his heavy jacket.

“Tell me, Professor.” The killer began, “Does my work look familiar?""

""Sorry?""

""Familiar. Like you've seen it somewhere before?""

""I'm not following you.""

""How about my name? Tom Shibley ring a bell?""

I racked my brain for where I might have heard that name before, but no matter how hard I tried, I came up empty handed.

""I'm afraid not.""

""You don't remember me?""

""I'm sorry, I... wish I could say I did.""

""Fitting, for someone who so recklessly ruins peoples lives. I was your student, Professor. Many years ago.""

It didn't make sense. Of all the people who could have committed these crimes, what were the chances it would be my own student? I wondered, before asking, ""How is that possible?""

""Oh, Detective O'Brien didn't tell you? In the letter I wrote to him, I specifically requested that he reach out to you for help. Knowing that he'd rope you in, and bring you right to me.""

""Right to you? Why?""

""To finish the 12 laws.""

I looked over at the dead man in the car, who I had thought was the 12th.

""Oh, you thought it was him? No, he was just collateral damage, to lead you to me.""

""Lead me to you?""

""You, Professor, are the 12th law.""

""But why?""

""'Cause of what you did to me.""

""Did to you?""

""A forgettable moment for you, but an unforgettable one to me. I was supposed to be a scientist. An astrophysicist. But you flunked me. Called my dissertation rubbish.""

""Then it probably was. You know, The equations… there were some… problems with them. If you’ll just kindly put the gun down… I’d be happy to sit with you and go over them.” I mumbled, attempting to buy myself time, until O'Brien would hopefully return.

“What did you just say?” He asked, before slugging me in the face with the butt of his gun, sending blood spraying from my mouth and nearly knocking me unconscious, as I fell backwards into the snow drift.

""You ruined my life. Now I ruin yours. 'To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.'"" He said, once again quoting Sir Isaac Newton, before standing over me and pointing his gun in my face, a million flakes of snow whirling against the night sky above him.

In that moment, as I lay there, shaking from both terror, and the bitter cold, I resolved to die right then and there.

But then suddenly... I heard a loud…

…BOOM!...

…As the killer’s gun went off, striking me in the shoulder and causing my red blood to spray all over the white snow, the result of Detective O’Brien tackling him to the ground.

They began grappling in the snowdrift, as O’Brien attempted to disarm the killer.

That’s when I realised… that O’Brien’s own gun had somehow been knocked out of his grip… and was lying in the snow beside me.

In the midst of the struggle, O’Brien noticed, and muttered, “Windsor. Shoot. Him.”

Unsure of what to do, but feeling compelled to save the detective who had become a friend of sorts, I picked up the gun, walked over to where they were standing, and cocked it, my shoulder still throbbing from the wound.

But having never used one… let alone on a person… and shaking from fear… I hesitated.

“Windsor. Do. It.” O’Brien muttered again, a look of frustration in his eyes, before the killer struck him hard, nearly knocking him out, and sending him flying into the snowy drift.

Suddenly, the killer turned around, holding a gun of his own.

But before he could point it at me…

…BOOM!...

…I fired, the gun’s recoil causing my shoulder to jerk back in pain, the impact of its bullet in his chest, causing his hood to fly back.

That’s when I saw his face… just a regular looking chap, with features as nondescript as his voice. Sadly, I still didn't recall teaching him, or giving him that 'F' so long ago.

Suddenly, blood began to pour from the killer’s mouth, as he tried to will himself to say something, but before he could do so, his eyes rolled back in his head, and he fell back into the snow drift, directly beside O’Brien.

I looked down at the detective with wide eyes, unable to comprehend what I had just done, and tried to bring myself to say something… anything… but in the end, the only words I could muster were, “Action-Reaction.”

Detective O’Brien simply looked at me with wide eyes of his own, equally unable tocomprehend what I had just done, before looking down at the killer, and removing the gun from his icy grip.

Then O’Brien turned back to me.

""Alright fine, you were right this time."" He said, briefly smiling for a moment, the first time I'd ever heard him say or seen him do such a thing respectively, before putting his and the killer’s weapons away and reaching for his radio.

—

The next day, Detective O'Brien visited me at the hospital and took a seat beside my bed, as I recovered from surgery… the bullet that was lodged in my shoulder now removed… my body now wrapped in a heavy bandage.

“Why didn’t you tell me that he was my student?” I asked him.

“You were too close to it.” He explained. “I thought it’d get in the way of your work.”

“Thank you… I guess?” I replied, not knowing what else to say.

O’Brien then went on to tell me that my former student had died of his wounds the previous night, in the same hospital we were currently in… his week-long killing spree finally put to an end, and all record of his crimes decidedly kept from the public by the police.

And so, we did just as we always did, sitting there in silence, as he watched the basketball game and I, well, tried to understand the joy that Americans seemed to find in it, until…

...I suddenly remembered what he had said to me the day before.

""Hey, what was that you said to me at the airport?"" I asked playfully.

""Airport? I don't remember an airport."" He replied, playing dumb, clearly knowing where I was going with the bit.

""You don't remember? But it was yesterday.""

""Sorry. Getting old.""

""Oh I remember now. You said… that I was right!""

""Nah, I would have never said that.""

""I'm pretty sure you did.""

""Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.""

""You know what you said, mate.""

And so we continued on like that for hours, having a good chinwag for the rest of the day, as the heavy snow slowed to flurries… the last remnants of Boston’s passing blizzard, and a week that still haunts my dreams to this day.

Now, whenever I grade a dissertation, I think twice before handing out an ‘F’ so quickly, lest that bad karma come back around to me someday. Call it ‘Action-Reaction.’",12,1732404329.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

I had already given this woman an open invitation for some other activities but she wanted to try a more formal date.

The time approaches, I set the time and place. I dress up as if I’m going out for the night but it’s not even 2pm. She shows up looking lovely. Part of me wonders if she dressed up or if she always looks good just because she looks good.

We sit for a few hours and talk. Later we decide to change locations and eventually we end up seeing a show together and getting a late dinner after. It ends with a nice kiss and generally a feeling of “yeah, I want to see you again too”.

It sounds wonderful. We had a nice time. It was memorable and adventurous and I felt good about it. But like all my stories - there’s a problem. If you showed me her dating resume, this woman could not be much further from what I’m looking for. She’s broke with no hope of it changing. She’s religious, never lived anywhere outside nyc, and doesn’t know what she wants. On paper, it’s not even remotely close of a fit. Before we had this date, I went in knowing she was broke and there was no hope of it changing - and then I just learned more dealbreakers as we spent time together.

And yet, it just sucks even more cause I’d just look at her face as I’d hold her close and I’d think, “god damn, I want to see more of this woman and to keep holding her.” But, it’s has no direction. It has no purpose. It has no future.

It’s sad. I’m not even sure what this woman sees in me and why she even went on a date with me. She’s far more physically attractive than I am. Someday I hope to find out what she saw.",1,1732404234.0,red_scare_pod,6,0.6,False

I'm a huge introvert and find it hard to make genuine connections with people irl so that's what brings me here, what about you? Ultimately I am looking for a long term relationship, but have a lot going on in my life at the moment, finishing up classes and working, so taking things slow and starting as friends first would be best. I'm located close to Portland, Maine and prefer to meet people who are local, but if you're only a state or two away I don't mind driving to meet if things go well. Here's a little about me, I'm an absolute nerd about nature and like to do all kinds of outdoor activities like hiking, foraging, kayaking and gardening. I'm also really into native plants as they are crucial for the foodwebs of ecosystems and find it troubling how much habitat has been lost to development and ornamental landscaping. Ok, off of my soapbox now. Ngl I'm the kind of guy that annoys everyone around by using the scientific names for plants and fungi because I find it so interesting. My goal is to have somewhat of a homestead where I grow my own food, and it's important that a potential romantic partner shares a similar goal. I already have a small vegetable garden for growing tomatoes, peppers, etc for making hot sauce, pasta sauce and more. I work in a greenhouse and am majoring in horticulture so it's kind of my lifestyle lol. As outdoorsy as I am, I also like to play video games and build computers. A great way to get to know eachother would be to talk on discord and play a game. Otherwise if you're nearby, we could grab a coffee and chat. I'm kind of a homebody and pretty introverted, so large social gatherings aren't for me, although I might be up for a lowkey concert with the right company. I have some anxiety issues so it takes me a little bit to warm up to new people, but once I do I can even get a little chatty. My go to music is hip hop, r&b, soul and 70s funk, but its hard to find a genre I don't like. I smoke a lot of weed but am pretty restrained otherwise. No hard drugs, nicotine, I rarely drink, tend to avoid sugar and not really a coffee drinker either. It's important to me that you don't look down on cannabis but I don't care if you use it yourself or not. I'm also not religious and prefer not to date someone who is. Also my age range for relationships is 18-30. I'm an ok cook, do meal prep and can make a mean batch of sugar free brownies that actually taste good. As for my appearance, I'm 5' 8"", have brown hair and blue eyes. I'm pretty slender and have a somewhat muscular build as well. Dm me if you want to see a picture.

1gycrif,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1gycrif/should_i_post_this_on_my_personal_fb_page/,Should I post this on my personal FB page?,"I want to post this on my personal Facebook page, but I'm not sure if I should. Thoughts? I just want to raise awareness and hopefully help people that may be in the same situation and maybe help them get out of it before it's too late. But I am worried about what happens if I talk about what happened to me and people I know find out. It's a loooong read.

One year ago this week, I moved into my flat with the help of my best friend and my incredibly kind bosses. I was moving in an attempt to start a new life away from the most soul destroying relationship that I had ever been in in my life. One that started out pretty normal, but in hindsight, there were a lot of red flags right from the beginning. At the beginning I was told I was the most amazing beautiful girl he had ever met. His soul mate, the love of his life. He could not live without me. I had poetry written for me and we had so much in common. We even had the same pin numbers and codes to unlock our phones. He told me he thought we were ""meant to be."" I never wanted to rush into anything, but I always felt like he was rushing me to get to the next step in our relationship. He would stay at my house while I was at work, making my housemate uncomfortable, and eventually he moved into my house within a month of officially dating, to ""help me out financially."" He insisted on meeting my parents really early on even though at the time I wasn't comfortable with it. When he met my parents he lied to them about his drug habits, and told them that all he wanted to do was take care of me because I was the most amazing girl he had ever met.

At the same time I was constantly told that I was an insensitive and unempathetic person. That I was selfish and rude, and incapable of respecting another person's boundaries. I only cared about myself. Repeatedly yelled at for being ""deaf"" and ""fucking autistic"" when I misheard something or misunderstood something.  I was constantly lied to and had my phone looked through while I slept to 'test my honesty' later on. At one time I was woken up in the middle of the night and screamed at because he had gone through my phone and found messages to a friend about how I was thankful for a friendship I made with an ex partners 3 year old little girl. To him this meant I was 'not over my last relationship' and I had to delete all photos I had with her, which I did but it really upset me. I was so stressed from living like this, I was throwing up every night and had developed stomach ulcers and severe gastritis. My menstrual cycle was non existent throughout most of 2023 and he told me I had probably ""caught an STD from my ex that had made me infertile."" He was constantly trying to turn me against people close to me and got upset when I wanted to go out and do things with male work friends. He was always accusing me of flirting with male friends, and telling me that they wouldn't want to be just my friend anyway. I missed numerous events with friends because it would have been ""disrespecting his boundaries to go out."" I was shouted at and constantly told that I remembered situations wrong. Any argument was always ""made up for"" with gifts and promises to do better. Sometimes he just gave me money. He told me how  he got neglected as a child, bullied at school, cheated on in previous relationships, all an excuse as to why he acted the way he did. As his behaviour got worse and worse, it seemed like his reasons got worse as well. I felt sorry for him. He would pick arguments with me as soon as I woke up, and when I told him I had to go to work, he would tell me I was selfish and never cared about him or his needs. I'd be late constantly because he would tell me I didn't care about him if I just left him to go to work. On the occasions where I said I wanted to break up, he told me that without me he would kill themself. I felt like I was responsible for his life. Things weren't always horrible, some of the time it was good, and we had fun together. But it was like being on a rollercoaster. The lies were constant. And he couldn't keep any of the promises he ever made.

When I finally had the courage to leave he tried to convince me that I was having a ""borderline episode"" and I didn't know what I was doing. Living with him did make me feel like I was going insane, but I knew I didn't want to be with him anymore. He told me that if I broke up with him I would end up alone because both my parents would die, my friends would abandon me and no one would ever love me because I am a truly terrible, narcissistic person incapable of maintaining a relationship. That's what I deserved because I was such a selfish person that only loved myself and used people. The night my boss helped me move into my unit, I turned off my phone because he would not stop calling me. When I turned it back on later that night, he had sent me a photo of him standing on a ladder, about to hang himself. Later, he text me asking to pick him up from the hospital where the police had taken him - he really wanted a cigarette. 

I felt like what he did was my fault, but I did not want to be in a relationship with someone that treated me like that anymore. He said he would change, be better and stop lying but I didn't believe him. One night he came over to talk to me, but when I was firm on not getting back together, I walked him outside to his car and he put his face really close to mine and told me ""I still want to kill myself"" and told me that he'd take all of his valium and drive his car into a building if I made him leave. I made him come inside and messaged his mum to come pick him up but when he realised he called her and told her that I was lying and trying to make a drama. She came anyway and took him home. 

After this, I just worked a lot. I didn't have a lot of money and I didn't have a lot of furniture. I had a single lounge chair that I got at a garage sale for $15 that had a bunch of rosary beads in it by surprise and my bedroom had my bed and a taxidermy goat head. My tv didn't work so I spent a lot of time listening to music and watering my plants. I talked to my cat a lot. I didn't know if I could afford to live by myself but it was better than living like how I was living before. I'd get multiple calls and messages a day but I would mostly ignore them. My hair was falling out. Occasionally I would get home to weird little presents on my door step and it made me uncomfortable. Poems on sticky notes, rolled up cigarettes, old hair ties that I had left in his car. I didn't want to leave the house in case I saw him anywhere.

He messaged me incessantly. He would not give up on trying to 'fix' our relationship which I was serious about ending. He'd spam my phone with loving messages and apologies, telling me he'd change, he'd never treat me like that ever again. He'd blamed it all on his own 'acute mental health episode' or the fact he was abused as a child, although the culprit of the abuse kept changing. He called me repeatedly, sometimes leaving nice messages, sometimes abusive ones. Sometimes I'd just get poems at 2am. He tracked my location through different apps. When I'd tell him to leave me alone his attitude would change back to telling me that I was the crazy one, that I needed to get help, that I was sending mixed messages, telling me I was over reacting and convincing me that I was the abusive one in the relationship, that I was the reason he tried to kill himself because I just discarded him after he did everything for me. He told me that how I treated him during our relationship was domestic abuse. He told me he couldn't live without me. He told me we should just be friends because he didn't want to not have me in his life. He told me that he actually broke up with me, and I needed to get therapy if I wanted him to take me back? I tried to ignore it all. I'd tell him to stop over and over. But it lasted for months. I was afraid to leave my house. I wouldn't go grocery shopping alone anymore. I'd only drive to and from work, but if I saw a silver car I'd have a panic attack. I cried more than once most days and and I'd cry at work and in public if I went out with friends. I locked myself out of my own house 3 times in one week simply because I was so stressed. Chunks of my hair were falling out every day. I kept it all in a bag to take to my doctor. I lost 25kg in about 3 months. I stopped eating because I wasn't hungry anymore. I didn't sleep much because I would wake up frequently just to make sure my doors and windows were locked because when I moved in he off handedly told me this place would be easy to break into. I was so anxious I would spend hours just cleaning or rearranging my house. I would call my mother every day and cry. I didn't want to have a relationship with anyone ever again. I thought I'd just be alone forever.

I went home over Christmas to be with my family and the messages and calls did not stop. When I came back he had organised to swap some belongings that we still had of each other's. I had arranged for a friend to be with me on the day and told him to arrive at lunch time, but when the morning came, he showed up unannounced hours earlier and told me he was there early 'to get it over and done with for my own convenience.' But I knew by this point it was just because he had to be in control. I told him to go home and come back at the time we agreed. But he didn't leave. He sat outside my bedroom window and waited while I pretended I wasn't home. He told me to stop wasting his time. He called me a bitch for not letting him 'move on with his life' and 'drawing this out longer than it needed to'. I called my friend and asked her if she could come over earlier because he had arrived sooner than expected, and she did. When she arrived and I let her in and he realised I was inside the whole time, he said I was a lying psycho. He said I was being a control freak. When I went outside with my friend to see him with his things he was really friendly and told me how good I looked, and gave me late Christmas presents. A bunch of crystals and a plant. He made jokes and laughed and acted like he hadn't even been just sending me abusive messages over text. When he had all his stuff he asked if I wanted to get a coffee and breakfast with him. I said no. He said thank you for the sunshine and I miss you brown eyed girl, and I went inside. 

I went back to work after the Christmas break, and the messages continued. When I eventually blocked his number he moved to emails. His emails mostly didn't make much sense. One sounded like a missing persons report for me. I was going to my doctor frequently and she told me I had PTSD. One day I decided to contact his 'ex girlfriend' on Instagram to ask her some questions about their relationship, he had told me that she had randomly dumped him and blocked him out of no where and it had really messed him up and it really confused me so I wanted to know her side of the story. When I asked her, she told me that they had never actually dated, they were just friends and when she had not wanted to go out with him he wouldn't leave her alone so she ended up blocking him. When I learned this I kind of felt like maybe everything he had ever told me was a lie.

In mid February my friend came with me to file for a DVO with the police. I bought security cameras for my house which my boss installed. The night before he was served with the order he came to my house unannounced, let himself in my back yard while I was watering my plants and refused to leave for 45 minutes until I threatened to call my boss to come over. The next day he got served with the order and his mother sent me a message on Facebook saying she didn't appreciate the police scaring her daughter when they came to the door.

I didn't go to court when the DVO was put in place. I didn't want to see him ever again. I lost more weight and more of my hair fell out, but the messages, stalking and harrassment (for the most part) stopped after that. In April, I went home to visit my parents and old friend from school. On the way home I was driving through a storm, and while I was driving out in the middle of nowhere I put all my windows down and I cried. At first it looked like I was driving through a rainbow. It just made me want to cry and say everything that was on my mind, so I did. I had kept the crystals he gave me for Christmas in my door pocket since Christmas. When I was driving through the rain I threw them out the window along with the red mini key chain he had given me, and after that the rain stopped and there was a double rainbow. I stopped on the side of the road next to a random paddock and took a photo of it, I thought that was important somehow. 
 
I've now been in my unit for a whole year. I feel like a completely different person to the one that moved in here. I feel like the old me died and the new me can handle anything now. It took me until May to start leaving the house on my own again, and my sleeping is a lot better. My hair has mostly grown back. I started painting again. I hadn't done any painting for almost 2 years, and I didn't think I'd ever be inspired to do it ever again. I met a guy who became my best friend who really made me feel understood and gave me the confidence to be myself again. He's the nicest, kindest, most talented and most emotionally intelligent person I have ever met. He really encourages me to be my true self and I feel like I have all my creativity back again. He really appreciates me for all my weird quirks and helps me forget about how damaged I feel sometimes. I'm so glad he's my partner.

Even though I have trouble sometimes getting that stupid little voice out of my head, I know I'm not a selfish horrible person that doesn't deserve any love. I'm know I'm incredibly kind and caring, and really sensitive to other people's feelings and needs. I'm actually highly empathetic and genuinely a good person. I respect people's boundaries and I value honesty and loyalty. I'm not insufferable, and I'm not a 'deaf autistic bitch' that deserves to be yelled at by anyone. I can be blunt sometimes but I'd never make a joke to make anyone feel bad about themselves. I'm not controlling or jealous, although I can admit I probably was a bit when I was younger and immature. Most of all, I'm not a victim, and I'll never blame my actions on how someone else treated me in the past. I did not deserve any of the treatment during that 12 months and the stalking and harrassment afterwards either. 

I'm not sharing this to get sympathy or for people to feel sorry for me. I don't want anyone else that is going through the same thing that I did to feel like they deserve to be treated that that way, and that it's going to get better. Because no one that says they 'love you' will yell at you or try to control who you spend time with or how you think. They won't lie to you and it won't get better. I've been wanting to do something to help people effected by domestic violence for a long time now, and the first thing I think I can do is start talking about it because it's not the victims fault and they shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed to talk about what happened to them.

This is either a brilliant marketing campaign or dumb luck and timing by Whirlpool.,"TL;DR: I gave away 99 Whirlpool Inside Pass Invites so people could get KitchenAid Superautomatics.  This was either a happy accident or a genius marketing plan.

Longer:

As part of a home improvement project, my partner and I decided to upgrade our coffee maker.  As we explored pourover options, nice burr grinders and other equipment to improve our coffee experience, and I did the customary online research, I realized that an espresso machine was within reach.  I’d aways coveted an espresso machine and there were Delonghi and Breville options that seemed within budget.  As usual, I scoured the Internet for deals and explored the depths of the employee purchase discounts available to me as a middle manager in a large global tech company.  The 25% Bosch discount made their new countertop machines attractive but still out of my budget. All of a sudden one day Whirlpool decides to drop a $700 discount on their KitchenAid machines and a promotional email to my work account caught my eye -- $700 off?  Were these machines any good?  Naturaly, I turned to reddit where initial reports were very positive.  This appeared to be a Miele in KA clothing, but cheaper.  Combined with the new EPP discount, all of a sudden a very high quality superautomatic was within striking distance – so we went for it as a shared holiday gift to each other.  We ordered a KF8 in mid-October given the warning that the $700 discount would expire on October 30.

The machine arrived a week later, and it was an instant hit – easy to use, simple maintenance, a giant leap in flavor and experience from the brewed coffee we’d been drinking.  I dove into r/superautomatics and encouraged others to experience this new machine.  It was a great machine even at the current sale price, but at $799-$1299 given EPP discounts presented a great opportunity for people to get into the espresso game.  

As the end of October approached the discount remained, with no signs of disappearing. When Whirlpool emailed and offered 99 guest passes for friends and family to their employee store, I decided it was only fair to offer these to my reddit friends because I’d already learned so much on this sub that helped guide my purchase.  I do not work for Whirlpool, I just want others to be able to take advantage of this good deal.  And take advantage you have – I gave away 99 passes to friends, family and mostly to you – lots of you wanted a discount on your new espresso machine.  

As a career marketing guy, I’m truly not sure if this was an innovative guerilla marketing campaign by Whirlpool or a happy accident – given that it was purely my own desire to share this great product, I’d like to think it was more happy accident, but I’d love to be proven wrong.  Hats off to Whirlpool for recognizing the opportunity to use their EPP channel to drive increased revenue at the end of the year; and perhaps to test the market for these new machines while cleaning out stock from the current model before the next-generation, wi-fi enabled, at a slightly different price point hits the market next year.  Either way, I’m happy to have been able to share my discount and hope all those of you who took advantage enjoy your new KitchenAid!  ",9,1732403832.0,superautomatic,21,1.0,False

I'm a man in my upper thirties, with a wife and kids. I've been a christian since childhood; got married 8 years ago, moved,  and joined a church with my wife shortly thereafter. three years ago I took a maintenance positon with the church's school.  
I've posted about some life stuff on my re so I'm using a throwaway here.  
Anyway, I believe it is a solid biblical church that preaches both the law and the gospel, and agree with the confessions of our particular denomination.

But I can't make friends here. granted I am an introvert, but my heart aches to walk silently through the corwd of 300 plus people every week and have no one aknowledge me or my wife. I see the old blood of the congregation who all know eachother, tight in their clique... but people who have joined since us are welcomed in to the social life of the church   
For the last year I've been trying. I have reached out to six different guys trying to grab coffee or lunch and get to know eachother. They ghost me, or cancel on the day of the lunch/coffee. I've made an effort to greet newcomers I recognize for a month, only to catch on to them ducking out to avoid me as i approach after a service. I've gone to small groups and literally sat alone while a cluster of five guys stand across the room chatting without introducing themselves, even aftter I say Hi to the one I know.

Here's the thing. The job I have is the best paying one i've ever had. and the hours are good. but to the people who go to church here? if they aknowlege me at all its to tell me to restock the TP or go buy some more kitchen supplies. This is poisoning my heart towards these people. I'm at the point where I wouldnt want to make friends with them anymore. 

In theory I could leave the congregation but remain on staff; others are employed who don't attend here. but i balk at going to the leadership and telling them that I am leaving because i feel intentioally and purposefully excluded by the body at large.

1gyco6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gyco6r/i_stole_my_fathers_peace_of_mind_while_he_is/,I stole my father's peace of mind while he is going through a hard time by attacking his faith with one line,"I need to give context here: My father is obsessed with hiding behind his religion as an excuse to never actually apologize for hurting and abusing my sibling and me. He refuses to say the words ""I'm sorry"" it is always regret or how it broke HIS heart. It is only ""God has forgiven me.""

He cheated on our mother and like any self-respecting woman she divorced him, took her children and left moved across the country to a different state. I have recently been chatting with mom, and she has started sharing what he put her through leading up to the divorce. This story has a few players so I'm going to try to name (fake ofc) some people now. Neighbour and siblings' friends' mother - Maggie, Another neighbour - Kelly, Baby mama 1 - Annie and baby mama 2 - Betty.

Mom first realized dad had been cheating when Maggie approached mom and told her that dad had approached her to ask her out on a ""coffee date"" and she had turned him down and chewed him out basically saying why would you want to have coffee with me, go have coffee with your wife at home.

The next clue was when Annie called and left a message on the home answering machine demanding child support. Mom was a SAHM so she got to the machine and heard the message before dad could come home and erase it. A short while after Annie came to our house to show my mother that the baby was not our dad's. Thing is she looked exactly like my sibling. Very obviously dads baby. We'll come back to Annie in a bit, but this context will be important later.

Dad had moved on to Kelly by now. Kelly was not sleeping with him, but he was trying to butter her up now and would park around the block and sneak to her house to ""have coffee"" she also asked him what he wanted, and he had to go have coffee with his wife and kids at home. He kept showing up and she got sick of turning him down and also came to and told mom while Betty was visiting mom at our house. They started cooking a stakeout where the next day when dad forced his way in, she would leave her back door open so mom could ""walk in on them"" catching him red handed so she could have some proof of his infidelity or at least plans to be unfaithful.

The next day day dad just came straight home and told mom ""You think you're so clever, you'll never catch me."" He thought he was so clever that he didn't realize he just openly admitted he was planning on going to Kelly's house again, but someone warned him not to. Mom and Kelly didn't tell anyone else. Remember Betty? Turns out Betty was sleeping with dad too. Mom had no idea until he said that to her. The worst part? Betty was twice his age. Like old enough to be his mother.

He eventually at some point told my mom he had gotten Betty pregnant too and she had to get an abortion because she was too old to carry to term without complications. Shortly after separating mom took us to see him because she could see we were missing him when he proceeded to brag to mom about all the women he had been sleeping with since before they even got married. He also never called us after we moved across the country and mom would have to call him and beg him to talk to us because we missed him, and he would always say ""well you decided to leave me and take them away."" When he did deem us worthy of his time, he always talked to my sibling first and they would cry hysterically begging him to stop and they would be inconsolable after at which point I naturally refused to go to the phone. This always hurt him SOOO much. Poor guy.

Anyhow on to my petty revenge I contacted him under the guise of making peace and not knowing anything at all because mom doesn't remember much from that time, and I was so young. I needed to find peace and understanding (this part was actually true). I was seething as he had attempted to shut me down before I even asked him a single question, so I just abandoned my thoughtfully typed out script and went for the jugular: ""why did you cheat on my mother; what did she do to deserve that"" He attempted to shut me down again with a coin has two sides argument so I told him I know moms side I am asking for yours. The story he proceeded to tell me is bonkers.

Remember Annie? Apparently, she was so obsessed with dad she went to see a witch doctor to curse his family and marriage. How did he know this, you may ask? He went to a psychic who believed is God. Because that makes it legit. He then went to our Priest to perform an ancient cleaning ritual with blessing bushes. Ancient? Our church was literally the youngest national church in the country at the time. There is nothing ancient about the church or it's practices. While he was telling me this, I realized he was under the impression I do not know about the other women, many of whom he had actively pursued long before he met Annie. A strange calm washed over me as I realized he is delusional, and his faith was not based on the actual principles of our church at all. Either that or he is just a hypocrite for the ages.

I was done and was just going to ghost him when my sibling suddenly sent me a message saying they are done and never want to even so much as hear his name again. I asked them what had happened, and they just shut down refusing to tell me. I made them promise me to at least lean on their partner, so I knew they were okay. Then I moved on dad again. This was our conversations:

\[2024/11/13 20:47\] Me: What did you do Why do you always do this? It's like you enjoy hurting her. You have one chance to calmly tell me what just happened, or I am blocking you and you will never hear from me again.

\[2024/11/13 21:31\] Dad: No (my name) (sibling) phoned me to insult me, and I've made many mistakes in life and have peace of mind in serving the Lord now

Many times, I've apologized for my choices, and I need to draw a line that if you whom are my own blood and flesh can't forgive me for my transgressions God has forgiven me and any person who cannot forgive bares a huge burden in their life that will consume them and when reality kicks in then it might be too late.

I'll not stand by and allow anybody to insult me or anybody I cared for at any time or care for now. (siblings name) is taking this too far to phone me and openly writing me off. I'll accept her decision and carry on with my life serving God to my best capabilities and therein lies the blessings and protection and my release from any potential burdens.

Strangely enough why is it that she must influence everybody around her to make believe that I'm to blame for everything that I on many occasions had no control over and then tell me to acknowledge accountability for my actions which I've already done many times over and explained and apologized for on deaf ears to only not heard and also acknowledged.

(take a moment here to notice the conspiracy theory and how he is victim and how he is the only one trying to influence me against sibling who was still refusing to say anything)

You decide yourself what you intend to do and believe and remember that I have never stopped loving you even though there is a perception to that effect embedded in certain persons minds. I'll let you decide and will not even try to persuade you otherwise once your mind is made up. You may block me, but you'll always have a seed of doubt.  (This last line really made me angry, he was trying to take my peace away, again!)

(Sibling) was the aggressor tonight and I'll not accept it coming from (them) although I love (them) very much.

\[2024/11/13 21:33\] Me: They only told me they are done. They refused to talk about what happened which is why I am asking you. I know you said something because you have been doing it their entire life. What did you say to set them off? I understand you don't remember what you said in our childhood, but how many times do we have to tell you you keep doing this? Please tell me what happened

\[2024/11/13 21:40\] Dad: It's okay (my name) you seek the fault by me but I'm working hard on myself whilst I'm down and out trying to stand up You know who's who and what they are capable of and don't need to defend myself in any way or explain myself again and again. I don't know what's happening in (our city) but something's not right

This sudden conduct,disrespect and lack of of forgiveness and the source is so uncalled for but be that as it may you do what you think best becos I'm done begging for forgiveness and not being honoured for the openness I have shown this far to reach out but then be attacked verbally when all I was expecting was a civil interaction.

At this point we I had had enough and decided I was done. I was angry he tried to wish doubt and mistrust onto me when we all know he did something to hurt sibling like he always does. Big thing to note is I am an atheist now due to some religious trauma unrelated to dad. I shared it with him when it happened, and we were briefly getting along. His only response was the most patronizing ""Oh you'll be back"" I have ever heard, and he had been trying to force the church down my throat every chance he got so my revenge formed in my mind in this moment, I'm gonna insult your faith. The way I have never blocked someone so fast after sending this message.

\[2024/11/13 21:42\] Me: Okay well then have a good life. I hope your god helps you get food while your wife allows you to starve. But it's your gods will so it all good right?

The lower-case letters were on purpose too and I'm not sorry. I have the view that everyone should believe what they need to believe so that they can have peace, but in this moment, dad did not deserve peace, and he had just tried to take mine away from me. I was sick of refraining myself from telling him his is delusional and of him trying to force his religion down my throat.

It was the most satisfying message I have ever sent him, knowing how angry he would have gotten and him knowing he will never be able to tell me off is just the cherry on the cake. Anyway, this one got really long let me know if you guys want an update on what was said between dad and sibling as I am slowly getting info from mom.

While speed-walking to work in the rain, I accidentally dropped my wallet without noticing.About 20 minutes later, I got a call from an unknown number. This lovely elderly woman had found my wallet, looked up my workplace from my business card, and actually walked 15 minutes out of her way to deliver it to me personally. When I tried to offer her some money as thanks, she just smiled and said, ""Just promise to do something nice for someone else when you get the chance.""The thing is, she didn't just return my wallet - she completely turned my day around.

### Relic Changes

| Type         | Relic             | Change                                                                 | Reason                                                                                                       |

1gycjyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gycjyg,"Momo, Slime Retriever & Sweetpea Review","TLDR: I highly recommend Arroz Con Leche from Momo, Ghost Puppy Cafe from Slime Retriever, and Autumn Fair from Sweetpea

Momo Slimes:
Arroz Con Leche
Scent: 11/10
Texture: Perlite & WG Slushee 10/10

The scent of this slime is so comforting. It reminds me of the rice pudding my Danish grandma would make for us on christmas. It’s so perfect. The texture is so excellent with the perlite and slushee. Fantastic ASMR and crunchy pops. This is another all time favorite from Momo. 

Slime Retriever:
Ghost Puppy Cafe
Scent IMO: Coffee is the dominant scent 9/10
Texture: TnG Semifloam & Slushee with optional Clay 10/10

I love the texture of this slime. The combination of floam and slushee is perfect and makes really excellent pops. It’s addictive to play with. The packaging, purple floam, label & extras are adorable. I forgot to include the cute golden retriever in a ghost costume pin in the photo. You get so many adorable extras with this slime. It’s so worth it. My husband said it looks exactly like pudding. The scent mostly smells like coffee, which I enjoy. I didn’t pick up on the other scent notes in it as much but it’s not a deal breaker since I enjoy the energizing scent of coffee. 

Be My Pupkin
Scent on Label: pumpkin pie, honey, autumn wreath 7/10
Texture: Ultra TnG with Ring Bead Topper 10/10

This one is really cute too and the texture is super nice and thick. Unfortunately, I messed up the paper label because of slime overflow. I do not particularly love the scent of this one. I don’t get pumpkin pie from it. But it is at least a light scent, so I can still thoroughly enjoy playing with this slime. 

Overall I really enjoyed my first order from Slime Retriever. Their puppy aesthetic, floam texture and cute creative concepts grabbed my attention. I will definitely order from them again. 

Sweetpea Slimes:
Autumn Fair:
Scent imo: mostly vanilla, caramel, popcorn, hints of cotton candy & bergamot 9/10
Texture: WG Jelly & Block Bead 9/10

I love the texture of this WG jelly and the little add-ins are so festive and cute. This was my first time trying block beads and I think my hands are too sensitive for them. I played with them for a while in it but ended up taking them out just because I wanted to play more aggressively with the awesome WG jelly texture. So stretchy and full of pops. The scent is like a really nice face cream or lotion that mostly smells like vanilla & caramel but I definitely notice the popcorn and cotton candy too. 

Apple Popping Milk Candy
Scent imo: Tangy Apple 5/10
Texture: TnG with Floam 10/10

The texture of this is perfect. Amazingly stretchy and makes excellent pops with the floam. The presentation is adorable with the little apple tree charms. Unfortunately the scent was too sour for me and it comes across as a bit artificial. Maybe it was more creamy scent it would have been better. I also didn’t notice mango scent in there. I’ll take this one to work for the kids but it won’t stay in my home collection. 

Spooky Teddy Dog:
Scent on Label: Citrus, Floral, Green, Musk 6/10
Texture: WG Jelly with optional Clay 10/10 

This presentation is so stunning with the Teddy Dog head. I am playing with the base only so far as I love WG jelly and the clay dog is too beautiful. I don’t love this scent but I don’t dislike it as much as the Apple Candy slime. I’m thinking about mixing in the clay piece to see if that mellows out the scent of this slime somewhat. This one smells a little artificial to me too, almost like a nice spray for your bathroom. But also this could just be down to my scent preferences. I should have learned by now that I usually prefer gourmand and sweet scents over perfume, floral & citrus scents. 

Overall I love the WG jelly textures from Sweetpea. The shop was also super kind & responsive and helped me combine shipping orders. The domed lids on the containers are a plus but the containers themselves are large, so I find them harder to fit on my shelf. But that might be a me problem again. Next time I order from them I would take extra care in choosing slimes based on scents I’m confident I’d love. For example Little Red (baked pear scent), Coconut Cream Jelly & Acorn Nougat all sound like slimes I would be obsessed with. 

Also sad side note: I ordered slimes from Elliegant and I think the package was stolen. This happens often in my building. A bit sad about this but I think I’ll try ordering again since they have a sale plus a new collection released.

And I wanted some Prismatic Slimes but the blizzard textures all sold out before I could get them. :( 

On the bright side I just ordered again from Pink Sugar Slimey. The Xmas scents sound sweet & delicious. I’ll post reviews of those, a couple Optimist Slimes, and a few more White Whale Slimes when they arrive.  I keep saying I’ll take a slime break but then Black Friday sales happened. Maybe a slime limit & temporary ban will be my New Year’s resolution. ",3,1732403319.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

I gave my mom a Garmin watch because I'm currently using an Apple Watch. The next day I was at her place and she tells me, 'I think we have a ghost.' I hear a strange beeping in the bathroom. She searched the pipes, listened, but couldn't figure out where it was coming from.

I'm sitting there next day, sipping my coffee when suddenly she say to me... “Hurry, come here, it's happening again.” 

We're searching, listening, and trying to find the ghost, when suddenly I realize that it's her Garmin alerting her to an elevated heart rate.

# Latest project news

**Construction update**

Work on this project is nearly complete for this season - just in time for winter to set in. We have been busy with sign installation, striping and seeding/blanket of the boulevards along with some additional electrical work for the temporary and permanent traffic signals and lighting systems.

[Installing the wiring for the temporary traffic signal at Quarry Drive\/Johnson St NE.](https://preview.redd.it/6ajrmx8geq2e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04d4d3cf3e79d27c3371bab87b5a6b938307322b)

[New shared-use trail and seed\/erosions control blanket on the west side of Johnson Street NE installed this past week.](https://preview.redd.it/qmye3kygeq2e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e47ab4c9826c3fa5b726d703f38724380a7a7e63)

# What's coming up

* Miscellaneous cleanup of the site will happen over the next few days. Removing equipment, extra material, and the temporary traffic signs/barricades will happen next week as we prepare to open the roadway and sidewalks to all traffic.
* Striping for the southbound lanes will be installed today, along with additional striping for the northbound lanes as we prepare to open the roadway next week.
* Electrical work for the new lighting system and the new traffic signal at Quarry Drive will be complete early next week. The new traffic signal will not be operational until next spring due to the time needed to obtain the components. The temporary signal will remain in place until the new signal is operational.

# Traffic impacts

Traffic impacts – see map below for the detour routes that are now in use through next Tuesday night. 

**We anticipate re-opening the roadway on Tuesday afternoon/evening (Wednesday morning at the latest)! Thank you all for your patience and comments - we appreciate it!**

Pedestrians - Note that the route to/from The Quarry has changed until we reopen the intersection at Quarry Drive - please follow the signed pedestrian route. While the sidewalk on the west side appears to be complete, it is still an active work zone and there is not a crosswalk or pedestrian signal at the Quarry Drive/Johnson Street NE intersection yet.

[There is no work planned this weekend. We will complete the work for the permanent traffic signal along with the plants for the rain gardens in the spring.](https://preview.redd.it/c4u7a9mmeq2e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65603ff31efc015e6db9464700075745ed261283)

# Weekly stakeholder meeting reminder 

* We have been holding weekly stakeholder meetings every Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. at the Caribou Coffee in The Quarry Shopping Center. (1730 New Brighton Blvd, Minneapolis, MN 55413).
