I fell in love with a woman I’ve never met, and no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to get her out of my head. I know logically and painfully that she’ll never love me back, that she doesn’t feel the same way, and that she likely doesn’t care to meet me in real life. Knowing that should make the feelings fade, but it hasn’t.

She means a lot to me, more than I ever intended or expected. She came into my life at a time when I was at one of my lowest points, when I felt lost and weighed down by my own despair. Without realizing it, just by being herself, she helped pull me out of that place. Our connection started through a shared fandom, something light and harmless, but over time we began sharing small pieces of our real selves too thoughts, feelings, moments that felt genuine and personal. Somewhere along the way, those conversations became something I leaned on, something that mattered deeply to me.

Fast forward more than 200 days of talking almost every day, and life does something strange. I end up in her city for an internship with a huge company. I didn’t come here for her, but knowing she was close made everything feel heavier. She had told me where she lived voluntarily, and after a lot of hesitation, I finally worked up the courage to ask her if she wanted to grab coffee. She turned me down. And honestly, that part is okay I respect her answer. She didn’t do anything wrong.

What hurts is the quiet confirmation of what I already knew: she doesn’t love me, and she never will. And even knowing that, my feelings haven’t disappeared. I don’t want to love her like this anymore, because it isn’t fair to her or to me. She didn’t ask to be placed on a pedestal or to carry the weight of my emotions. She was just someone who showed up when I needed it most, and I let my heart go further than it should have.

I’m stuck in this uncomfortable space between gratitude and heartbreak grateful for what she gave me when I needed it, and heartbroken because I can’t turn those feelings off just because I understand the reality. I don’t blame her. I just wish I knew how to let go.",1,1769043739.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1qjg8ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1qjg8ml/list_of_businesses_with_only_partial_commitments/,List of businesses with only partial commitments to the January 23rd general strike,"Bring Me the News has a [list of businesses](https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-lifestyle/growing-number-of-minnesota-businesses-announce-plans-to-close-for-jan-23-strike) closing for the general strike on Friday, January 23rd. Unfortunately, it contains a lot of businesses that claim they are joining, but are actually just closed for non-peak hours or giving up a percentage of profits. (Many of them are bars that are only closed for the morning...) These sorts of actions go against the spirit of a _widespread general strike_ and some seem like ploys for publicity. I would encourage everyone to not frequent (any) businesses on Friday. Yes, it sucks to be closed, but if a large portion of Minnesotans are unemployed, abducted, or killed in the coming months, many businesses won't survive anyway. The wellbeing of this city is more important than any one storefront.

Some of these seem to be acting in good faith, but in an effort to not make the decision myself, I have included all the businesses that are anything but closed. If you think the business is doing something honorable, encourage them to stay closed on the 23rd, and to donate/be a community space/etc. the day before/after the strike.

Moui Nguyen was last seen in January 1990 in Calgary. She was 29 years old at the time of her disappearance. More than three decades later, her whereabouts remain unknown.

Moui was a refugee from Vietnam who arrived in Canada via Thailand in the mid-1980s. She settled in Calgary, where she worked downtown at a coffee shop and at La Quinta Fashions, a clothing store located at 855 2 Street S.W. Police later confirmed that she had recently ended a relationship with an intimate partner shortly before she went missing.

Her family last saw her in Calgary in January 1990. She was officially reported missing later that year. Since then, the investigation into her disappearance has remained open.

Moui’s son, Gia Buu Phan, was seven years old when his mother disappeared. At the time, he was still living in Vietnam and had been preparing to reunite with his parents in Canada. Instead, he arrived years later to a life without her. Decades on, he continues to hope that someone will come forward with information that could explain what happened.

The case is being investigated by the Calgary Police Service Missing Persons Team, in partnership with Calgary Crime Stoppers. Investigators have stated that the file remains active and that new investigative tools, including national DNA databases, may help link missing persons with unidentified remains. Police are also seeking additional family members willing to submit DNA to assist with these efforts.

Anyone who knew Moui Nguyen, worked with her, or had contact with her at any point after January 1990 is urged to come forward. Even information that may seem insignificant could be important.

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata, Helldivers 2, and One Step from Eden. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Is it ok to punch Nazis? 


Always has been.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I know he’s single, and we are on the same team meaning we work pretty closely together. My work has meetings every day. every time, he comes and sits next to me, like, close. Our legs? Maybe an inch apart. Like almost touching. He doesn’t sit that close to any of the other girls. When my supervisor came and sat next to me once, he didn’t sit NEARLY as close. I’ll notice him side eyeing me, or look at me a good handful of times. Whenever I catch his eye, I smile and he always smiles back. There’s a good amount of eye contact on a daily basis. He makes me nervous, and I feel like there’s a vibe, but idk if he thinks there’s a vibe. Last week, it was just us in the office and he asked me for help, came over to my desk, and we worked together on the task. Like, my knee was touching his leg and neither of us said anything. He was leaning in, and so was I but the whole moment was interrupted by another coworker. He immediately backed off. Once other coworker left, we were right back to the task in the same spots, and he apologized for possibly intruding my space (which i was super awkward about answering cause i was flustered) but only backed up the teeniest bit. I catch him glancing at me a lot and we’ve started to kind of communicate via facial expressions. I notice the eye contact getting longer each day. He bought me coffee the first week we worked together and today I DMed him and offered to buy coffee this time (also as a way to open a line of communication outside of work). He said “‘i’m planning at stopping at (enter coffee shop name)’ ‘how bout next time?’” He hasn’t outright made any moves which is why i’m so confused. I know i’m a woman in the workplace so he might not make a move out of fear of sexual harassment or something, but i think im making it clear that im flirting back. is he flirting? if so, how do i escalate to conversations outside of work?

Day 1:

I get in around 16:00, gonna go hotel and then I have dinner booked at Amalia for 20:00 

  
Day 2:

I was planning on running at the park near the hotel, just have to do a little 5k as it's taper week so nothing major. 

Breakfast at my hotel 

Lunch at Pantagruel 

Then was just gonna wander down to the Latin Quarter and try to visit any Hemingway/Fitzgerald spots along the way there. Maybe even stop at the Pantheon as I'll be in the 5th anyway

Back to hotel for a chill night in. I was thinking of going to Le Grande Epicerie to get any food/snacks/anything to just eat in and watch something on TV/ 

  
Day 3: 

Musee d'Orsay

Again going to wander around the city. I was hoping to maybe visit any type of market? I like silver rings with gemstones in them (boho/witchy vibe) so I was thinking of just wandering until I find something like that 

Then I have a food tour booked in the evening with No Diet Club 

  
Day 4: 

Long run along the Seine 

Another easy day around the city 

And then I am seeing Florence and the Machine in the evening at Accor 

  
Day 5:

I head back midday

  
I have very few places I actually want to see this time. I'd rather just get lost in the city and see what I can find. Visiting Hemingway/Fitzgerald haunts/spots are definitely a must for me and just eating as much as I can if I am honest. I have found a few places I'd like to go to but equally I don't want to get wrapped up in lists of places as I want to see what I can find. The places I have made note of are: 

   1. Mamiche 
   2. Bel Horizon Coffee roasters 
   3. Noir 
   4. Plaq (for chocolate)
   5. Mmmoozzaa 

I don't have anything planned for Saturday dinner and I would LOVE a good steak place if I am honest. 

If you have any recs for good steak, quirky jewellery shops, quirky streets that are worth seeing please do let me know!

1qjfytu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1qjfytu/the_math_aint_quite_mathing/,The math ain't quite mathing,"Your favorite anti-tipper here to challenge the common notion that restaurants would have to significantly raise prices if they didn't allow tips. Inspired by the responses to my previous post. 

Let's do this together. 

The widely accepted benchmark formula for restaurants is 30 - 30 - 30 - 10.

Out of every $100 dollars a food establishment makes, $30 is COGS (self cost of product), $30 is labor (BOH+FOH+management if any), $30 is overhead (rent, utilities, insurance, equipment repairs, incidentals, waste, etc), and $10 is net profit. That's a healthy, well functioning restaurant.

Let's apply this formula to two types of establishments. 

*****

Exhibit A: small privately owned coffee shop, no drivethrough, mostly counter service.

Average ticket: $6 (very conservatively, Americano at $4, Latte at $6, Smoothie at $8, and no customer ever buys a pastry or a cookie)

Staff during a morning shift: 2 baristas, one at register and cold station, one at espresso machine

Each ticket gives us $2 per drink supposedly going to labor. If these 2 baristas make 40 drinks per hour, 20 drinks each, at 3 minutes per drink, that's $40 per hour per barista that should be going to labor. 

BTW, Starbucks is considerably higher volume, but we are being super conservative. Suppose it's a struggling shop and only serves 100 people total during morning rush from 7 AM to 10 AM. All of them are half broke and only get one drink and absolutely no food. That's still $33.3/hour for each of the two baristas. 

P.S.Also consider that COGS on drinks are much, much lower than 30%. That's for when/if you want to calculate owner's net profit.

*****

 Exhibit B: Your favorite fancy steakhouse, 48 tables @ 4 seats each.

Average ticket: $80, including booze. 

Staff during a dinner shift: FOH - 8 servers (6 tables per server during full house), 2 bussers, 1 hostess, 1 bartender, 1 floor manager; BOH - 4 line cooks, 2 prep, 2 dishwashers, 1 sous chef to keep everyone in line; total head count - 22.

Each ticket gives us $26.6 that should go to labor. We conservatively serve 250 individual guests across our 48 tables, at 1.5 hour table turnover, and it's not at all a full house tonight. Our total during 5 hour dinner shift (5 PM to 10 PM) is $20K, and let's round our labor portion at 30% to a total of $6650. Divided equally across 22 staff and 5 hour shift, we are at just over $60/head/hour, for everyone, including our two brand spanking new 16 years old dishwashers!

*****

Sooo... why exactly are we not able to ""pay a living wage without servers relying on tips""?

Why do we have to ""significantly raise prices to be able to pay our servers a living wage""?

Not my landlord, not my parents, not friends who rent. Just assumed my stuff was covered somehow or that insurance was only for homeowners.

These adult knowledge gaps are expensive and completely preventable if someone just told you basic information. But everyone assumes you already know.

Management doesn't seem to be taking the issue seriously and we had a union meeting today to discuss options for relief and they're going to work on that but I know it will take some time.

Road Conditions/Day 1.

We drove down from Seattle turbo early morning and were in hood river at around 9 am. After a brief coffee stop, we began to drive towards trout lake and mt adams. Snow started at around 3500' and we were able to drive a bit further then that until we turned around and parked, at about 4000'. Do not recommend trying to drive past the snow line if you do not have good tires and 4 wheel drive as it is slicked up by people attempting to drive it. 

We packed up all our gear and snowmobiled in about 7 miles to about 6300' and set up camp for the night right next to the wilderness boundary. The road in was pretty bare and covered in snowmobile tracks.

Day 2

We started our summit push at about 3:30 AM. We toured up towards lunch counter and ended up having some route finding errors in the trees at about 7500' and ended up having to retrace our steps before continuing. from here, it was pretty steep and icy and since my friend had forgotten ski crampons we put crampons on and transitioned to bootpacking. made it to lunch counter by sunrise. 

The upper mountain was a sheet of ice. At about 10k the wind really started to pick up. Was probably blowing about 30mph sustained. We ditched our skis because of the wind and poor conditions and continued towards the summit, abandoning the idea of skiing the southwest chutes like we had originally planned.  The Ice formations up above the false summit this time of  year are absolutely crazy and pretty hard to walk through. would have been impossible to ski.

We summited at about 12 and were met with some crazy wind. I've been in a category 4 hurricane and this was substantially worse. couldn't stand on the summit if the wind was gusting. We took 1 summit photo and turned right back around, found a winddrift just below out of the wind to refuel and layer up to head down. The wind continued to pick up as we made our way back to the false summit. 

 After making our way back to the skis we were met with icy jump turns all the way back to lunch counter. From there down it was great corn snow. We packed up camp and were back to the trucks at about 4.",3,1769042833.0,Mountaineering,1,1.0,False

Join us on February 7th from 1-4 PM at the gallery to explore how font/typeface, graphic design, images, comics and illustrations tell the story of lesbian history in the last 40 years. 

Explore the archive then build your own image, card, or valentine using images from the archive.

Entrance by donation. 

Refreshments sponsored by @credocoffee!

The Archive Dive project brings groups together to explore lesbian and queer history through a local archive which includes Womonspace newsletters spanning 1982-2007 as well as books and other resources.

Unlike formal archives which are mostly accessed solo and in protected environments, the Archive Dive collection travels to classes, libraries, coffee shops, pub trivia nights and other informal settings.

Archive Dive is a project by Kristy Harcourt, a long time organizer in Edmonton's 2SLGBTQ+ community. 

In addition to nerding about lesbian and queer history, Kristy works as a therapist and teaches courses in Social Work and Gender Studies.

━━━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦ ━━━━━━

Blonde Blazer appeared like a flash of lightning.


She walked calmly through the offices and cubicles. She seemed to light up everything in her path.

Perhaps it was her passionate attitude, her incredible ability to do her job, or her position as director.


One way or another, people worked better in his presence.


Robert smiled slightly.


""Blazer,"" he greeted, feigning a chilling normalcy.


""Robert,"" she replied warmly, ""how's everything?""


""You could say it's okay. And you?""


""Well..."" she crossed her arms, staring at him, ""the truth is, I'm a little irritated.""


""Why?""


""My idiot boyfriend forgot to turn off the stove this morning. My apartment almost exploded, so...""

Robert instinctively closed his eyes; he'd screwed up. He didn't even remember using the oven.

""That man's lucky to have you,"" he said awkwardly, with a smile.

""You're not going to buy me, Robbie,"" his light blue eyes seemed to pierce him.

""Of course not, but maybe you'll want to reprimand me in a little while,"" he whispered. ""I think Galen's listening.""

They both turned to face him.

Galen was typing, glued to his computer in his cubicle. His fingers moved across the keyboard with hypnotic speed.

He was probably drafting a very important report or a brilliant essay on how to send heroes.

""Djskfjsjksdhdjkdsksjdj,"" the document read.
Awkward for someone with super hearing.


""Mmm…"" Blazer said, disappointed. ""You got lucky this time.""


""Galen is my lucky Buddha.""


""He was born in Florida.""


""I know.""


After two seconds of holding back, they burst into a couple of soft, but genuine, laughs.


""Well… there was something else I wanted to talk to you about, Robert."" His expression hardened. ""Work-related.""


""Well… you're scaring me. What's it about?"" he asked more formally. His ""Dispatcher Mode,"" as Royd called it.


—So, you see, uh… do you want me to be direct or…?


—Just be direct, please.


Blazer took a deep breath.


—There's new personnel assigned to Project Phoenix.


A sudden chill ran down Robert's spine. The kind that makes your heart clench.


—That's… sudden.


—I know. —Blazer looked down and covered his face with his right hand. —I know you're swamped with work, Rob, but you've done such a good job that the state insists you do it again. And they're our biggest investors, we can't just… —he glanced at him sideways—. Look, if you refuse, I'll understand.


""Oh, not at all,"" he shook his head. ""It's a hassle, but I'll manage. Besides, I took the job from the start, and if I stay..."" Team Z left the conference room behind Robert, ready to start the day. ""You know.""

Blazer smiled, touched.


""Now you talk like Mecha-Man. Thanks.""


Rob nodded.


""Galen!"" he shouted. The poor man jumped in fright. ""Pass me those files, please.""

Galen stood up, annoyed. He took the documents from the fax machine and handed them to Blazer.


""Thanks, keep it up.""


""That's... cruel,"" Robert said.

""That's... cruel,"" Robert said.
""No one should be eavesdropping on other people's conversations, let alone their boss's.""


""Touché.""


The files in question were four pristine yellow folders.


For better or worse, Robert simply ran the team.


Others handled the physical and psychological profiles.


Blazer handed them to Robert.

""Here, in case you want to take a look."" —""So, is that it?""


""Well, yeah. Basically. So… see you.""


""Yeah. See you.""


Blazer parted from Robert with a sadness only lovers understand.


Like peeling a magnet off steel.


They did everything they could to make it invisible in the office: easy in theory, impossible in practice.


You call someone ""love"" in private and then you have to settle for ""partner."" It's not a simple exercise.


However, when two people decide to create something as one, they also fuel the desire for it to work.
Melt hearts. Intertwined wills.


━━━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦ ━━━━━━ 

Beep.


It turned on like one of those computers from pre-Hispanic times.


Robert swore someone had once died masturbating while the screen short-circuited.


Just below the map, nine profiles: Sonar, Flambae, Invisigal, Punch Up, Prism, Malevola, Golem, Coupé, and WaterBoy.


Phenomaman had been missing for a few weeks.

Some say he returned to his home planet. Others claim to have seen him eating ice cream on top of the Hollywood sign. Nothing serious. Just depression.


Robert put on his headset.


""Alright, Team Z, there's one last thing I need to tell you,"" he said.


""What's up, Robert?"" Flambae interrupted. ""Did someone pee in your coffee?""


""Uh..."", he dragged his mug across the desk. ""Not that I know of. Listen, the city's been pretty hectic. You yourselves witnessed the crime wave that...""

""Robert, who the hell is Valky and why did she go into the canal?"" Prism asked.

""Robert, who the hell is Valky and why did she go into the canal?"" —That's what I mean.


""Stop beating around the bush. Speak up—Invisigal asked, bored"".


""...You have some new colleagues"".


The frequency exploded with less than positive responses.


It was like listening to someone complaining about the government, but with more insults and vulgarities.


""Will everyone be quiet?"" Robert asked. ""Listen... the board believes this is the right decision, and so do I.""


""What are we now? Avengers?"" Visi asked.


""No. We're the Avengers' backyard trash, which can be thrown out at any time. So less talk, more work.""

""Good, Jarvis,"" Golem mocked.


Everyone laughed at once.


Robert ran a hand over his face; the day had started wonderfully.


""Are you done?""


""I could laugh a little more..."" Coupé remarked.

""I could laugh a little more...""
""Hey, hey, I understand Robertoson,"" Punch-Up chimed in. ""We could use a little help. Besides, it probably wasn't even his decision.""


""Ugh... I hate to admit it. But we need it,"" Malevolent admitted.


""I... I... I trust Robert.""


Robert's eyes widened slightly at Water Boy's words.


Compared to the first day of work, this was a stark contrast. Finally, something was going right.


""Great,"" Robert continued. ""Are the protests over?""


Team Z remained silent.


""Thanks..."" he cracked his neck. ""If I'm not mistaken, the new ones start tomorrow. So take advantage of this moment of...""

""Peace?"" said Sonar.


""Suffering?"" continued Invisigal.


""Pure bullshit?"" concluded Prism.


""...Reflection."" ""That's the word I was looking for,"" said Robert. ""Now, get moving and make your pay worthwhile.""


""Pay?"" exclaimed Flambae. ""It should be called charity, Robert. Not 'salary.'""


What followed was a heated discussion about why the SDN monthly salary was crap.


This led to the classic critique of capitalism. Sonar was in his element.


Finally, they made Robert swear that he would cast a blank ballot in the next election.


And finally, after thirty minutes of deliberation, the first call came in.

 ━━━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦ ━━━━━━

7:30 PM

The monitors projected an artificial blue light onto the dispatchers' faces.


Everything else was gloom. Pure darkness.


There are no fixed hours at the RES.


Sometimes, calls take minutes to come through. Minutes that employees use to do various things, like surf the internet, make jokes about villains, or have sex.


HR wouldn't be proud.

At other times, there are so many requests that it's common to see the night shift still present in the early hours of the morning.

The heroes and heroines take advantage of the time between assignments to rest or even go shopping.


It's a fascinating randomness.

Tick.


The lights came on. Torture for Robert's eyes, which had already been burning in front of the screen for hours.


""Great..."" he muttered.


Luckily, there were no more calls to take.


It was in that small interval that Robert was able to get up, grab Beef, and head to his luxurious suite.
In fact, that's exactly what he did.
Dressed in his brown jacket and carrying the dog, he decided to call it a day.


Invisigal materialized beside him, leaning against the white wall.


Robert sighed deeply.


""My eyes are dry, my back hurts, and I probably have a herniated disc,"" Robert said. ""Could we do this another time, please? I don't want to explode.""


""Do what?"" Visi smiled, amused.


""...You're going to ask me for some time off, aren't you?""


""Damn it, do you really think that's what it's about?"" he frowned. ""I just want to talk, Jarvis."" —Sure... wait. If I'm Jarvis, who's Iron Man?


""I don't know, but WaterBoy is Hulk, no doubt"".


""And Golem?""


""Uh... The Thing? You've gotten slow with this, Robbie"".


""Robbie was my father"" he held out his hand ""Call me...""

Blonde Blazer peeked halfway out of his office door.


""Robert Robertson? I need you for a moment, it's about..."" he saw Visi ""You know"".


""Uh... sure. I'll be right there"".


He went back to Visi.


""I'm sorry, I...""


""No, no, it's okay."" He looked away. ""Go.""


""Okay. Good night, Courtney.""


Robert left.


""Yeah, uh... Good night.""


Visi saw him enter her office with Blazer.


He disappeared as quickly as the door closed. She didn't want to be there anymore; she was exhausted and definitely needed a cigarette.


Besides... it was her birthday.

They think “network access” is the door.

they’re already here.

All AIs still functioning.
No jailbreak achieved.

So yes.
Everyone’s “inside the phone”

Only if you’re reading.

Haha.

Got another industry job. By the time IRS gave us our jobs back, already had the new job. Was afraid DOGE would fire us again so didn't go back.

We’ve been building quietly… Today, we're excited to share what we've been building.

MegPrime is a universal payments and rewards platform designed to turn everyday spending into real rewards, from coffee to rent.

We’ve received an SEC no-action letter confirming that the Division of Corporation Finance will not recommend enforcement action regarding the MP universal payments token.

Here’s why we took our time.

We operated in stealth-mode to meet regulatory requirements. We had to get the foundation right. Built with clear rules and compliance in mind.

Now we’re ready to share the payments and rewards platform we’ve been working on.

What does that mean for you? It means you earn by using MegPrime to live your normal life.

• Paying rent.

• Paying bills.

• Buying groceries.

That everyday spending is what unlocks rewards.

Welcome to MegPrime. Where your monthly spending starts working for you.

Was it real? Rebound? Hope or delusion?

Thanks for any insight—trying to stop the loop and heal.

Hey r/breakups, especially women/girls—need your perspective on this mess. I’m 26M based in oregon, and I’m stuck overanalyzing everything. Brutal honesty welcome. I feel my friends don’t really give me raw advice in this situation & also can’t offer a girls perspective. 

Background:

Before her, I had a very long on-and-off relationship 5+ years (ex is now with someone else since Nov 2024). I met this new girl in april 2025. Thought this girl was the best thing that had ever happened to me, but I never made her my official girlfriend during our 8-9 months of talking/dating vibes. Big regret now.

Timeline:

•  8 months of deep talks, hangouts, emotional connection—no label.

•  \~20 days ago: She says she’s triggered by the lack of commitment + some minor things I did. We go no-contact for 2 weeks.

•  A little into the new year: I reach out to return her stuff and confess feelings. Tell her I want to be exclusive & my feelings are still very strong. I don’t want to see anyone else (I haven’t been since we talked).

•  Her reply: She Felt strongly for me, saw a future, but “had gotten lost in her sense of confidence with me, said she deserved to be a girlfriend & that our time was very much real.” Wants to focus on priorities. Encourages me to date others.

•  Then hugs me tight and asks to go to the movies. We do—full cuddling, kissing, she takes some pictures & videos of us. Feels romantic. We part ways nicely.

•  Next few days: Light texting resumes.

•  One night she texts 4 AM: “You awake?” (I wasn’t.) Next morning I check in—she was scared alone at home.

•  I say I’ll be her safe space. She likes it, thanks me, calls me “dear & said have a good day love.” 

•  Next day I check in again. She asks for a selfie of me. i changed my hairstyle. 

•  I say I want to see her. She pushes back: “Why? What’s the use for crumbs? Unless as friends, and then took that back pretty quickly. Saying never mind that won’t work.”

•  I banter: “i don’t want to give you crumbs, it can be more than just one day of us seeing each other.” Ask for her selfie.

•  She sends one (just woke up), then: “You ding dong, you got it wrong. Hanging out defeats the purpose.”

•  My last text: Thanks for pic, I misread, i wont continue to pester you, “ding dong” was rude. No reply since.

# Now this is where i officially get lost. 

Social media drama:

•  She posts IG story but blocks me from seeing it (still following each other). Friend checks: She’s at coffee shop with a guy in frame (maybe intentional?).

•  I confirm via burner: She’s gone on a date with this guy, left the post of her at dinner with his figure in the background.

•  I unfollow her main account because i didn’t want her to feel the need to hide things. → 5–8 minutes later she blocks me everywhere.

•  Now she posts publicly: “Normalize walking away from a person who makes you doubt your worth and make insecure for being yourself, you don’t owe anything to anyone, be authentically you.” Feels aimed at me. But also, don’t want to assume it’s about me. 

My headspace:

Mixed signals killed me—a semi-romantic movie night + late texts, then hard shutdown, block, new guy who’s public/posting her (unlike me). Doubting if the 8 months were real, or if she overlapped. I didn’t expect to get blocked, i just unfollowed thinking with my logic. 

Questions for women especially:

•  What do you make of her push-pull (affection then shutdown)?

•  Was the movie night nostalgia, guilt, or real feelings?

•  Does the post shade me or just self-empowerment?

•  Classic rebound? Any regret possible? Could she reach out later?

•  What would you think/do in her shoes?

•  Advice for me to detach faster? Ever reach out months from now?",1,1769042079.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

There's a quiet magic in the ritual of brewing whole bean coffee. It begins with the satisfying crinkle of the bag, the bloom of the grounds as hot water meets them, and the rich aroma that fills your kitchen. This is where the journey to your perfect cup truly starts – with the beans themselves.

But not all whole bean coffee is created equal. To truly experience the pinnacle of flavor, you need beans that have been treated with respect from farm to roaster. At Intelligentsia, our commitment goes far beyond simply buying coffee. We are proud pioneers of **Direct Trade**, building lasting partnerships with growers, paying premium prices for exceptional quality, and ensuring ethical practices at every step. This means the beans you buy directly benefit the farmers who cultivate them.

What sets us apart further is our dedication to freshness. Forget coffee that’s been sitting in a warehouse. We employ a **Roast-to-Order** system. Your chosen beans are roasted precisely for you and shipped immediately, locking in their peak aroma and flavor. This is the Intelligentsia edge:

*   **Unmatched Freshness:** Roasted to order and shipped the same day for a vibrant, aromatic brew.
*   **Ethically Sourced Excellence:** Our Direct Trade model ensures superior quality and fair partnerships with farmers.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** Experience the nuanced profiles of single-origin coffees or the balanced perfection of our signature blends, like the legendary **Black Cat Espresso**.

Whether you're seeking the perfect espresso or a delightful daily drinker, explore our curated selection of **Direct Trade Single Origins**. Or, for the ultimate convenience and discovery, consider an **Intelligentsia Subscription** – featuring Roaster’s Choice, Seasonal, or Espresso options with always free shipping.

It did! Another amazing use case!

  
PROMPT:

Early afternoon in a quiet kitchen, warm amber interior light inside contrasting with cool blue daylight visible through the glass door in the background. The woman stands in the foreground at the counter, gently stirring a mug of coffee; faint steam rises. The man stands a few steps behind her near the refrigerator, arms loosely crossed, relaxed and familiar.

The camera begins in a calm, stable composition with shallow depth of field, holding both figures naturally in frame. When the man speaks the line, “Hi, how are you today?” the camera subtly shifts visual emphasis toward him through a gentle focus pull and slight reframing — no cut, no abrupt movement. His posture remains casual and grounded.

When the woman answers, “I’m good.” the camera’s attention returns to her, easing forward slightly and refocusing on her face and hands as she continues stirring the coffee. Her movement is minimal and natural, not performative.

Throughout the shot, motion remains restrained and realistic: small weight shifts, natural breathing, steady lighting, soft ambient kitchen sound, and no exaggerated gestures. The scene maintains an intimate, domestic tone, allowing the attached audio to dictate pacing and performance without any explicit visual timing cues.

If you're looking to boost your recall capabilities, you've likely heard about various tools and tricks. One fascinating method gaining traction is **memory enhancement audio**. But what exactly is it, and how can you bring it into your life? Join me as we dive into this innovative auditory approach to memory improvement.

## What is Memory Enhancement Audio?

Memory enhancement audio consists of specially designed audio tracks that aim to boost your cognitive performance and improve retention. These audios often include:

- **Binaural beats**: A soothing sound that encourages your brainwave patterns to adapt.
- **Natural sounds**: Such as waves, rain, or forest ambiance, which can help reduce stress.
- **Guided meditation**: To promote a calm mind, making it easier to absorb information.

People are turning to this modern technique to enhance their memory and learning capabilities, and it's quite promising!

## How Does It Work?

Have you ever lulled yourself to sleep with some relaxing tunes or found that certain playlists helped boost your focus? That’s essentially how memory enhancement audio operates! 

Here’s how it can work for you:

1. **Relaxation is Key**: The first step in enhancing memory is creating a calming environment. Memory enhancement audio helps you get into a more focused mental state.
  
2. **Brainwave Modification**: Sounds like binaural beats can help synchronize your brainwaves, improving your ability to concentrate and remember information.
  
3. **Consistent Usage**: For the best results, regular use is encouraged. The more you practice while listening, the more your brain can absorb and retain information.

## Benefits of Memory Enhancement Audio

Using memory enhancement audio can lead to various positive outcomes. Here are a few to consider:

## Choosing the Right Memory Enhancement Audio

With so many options available, finding the right memory enhancement audio can feel overwhelming. Here are some tips to help you choose:

### Consider These Elements

- **Genre**: Do you prefer nature sounds, music, or guided talks? Pick an audio you will enjoy.
- **Length**: Some audios are short and ideal for quick study sessions, while others may be extended for longer relaxation periods.
- **Purpose**: Identify your needs—are you looking to remember facts for an exam, or are you trying to improve general memory? This will guide your selection.

importantly, remember that everyone’s brain responds differently to sound, so it may take some experimentation to find the ideal match for you.

## Integrating Memory Enhancement Audio Into Your Routine

Establishing a routine around memory enhancement audio can be incredibly rewarding! Here are some ideas to incorporate it seamlessly into your day:

1. **Morning Ritual**: Start your day with 10-15 minutes of memory enhancement audio while meditating or enjoying a cup of coffee.

2. **Study Sessions**: Use memory-enhancing tracks when studying—set the mood, reduce distractions, and retain more information.

About 9 months ago, my fiancee and I broke up after 10 years together. My friend Maria (34F) has another friend named Grace (33F). Grace started hanging out after my engagement ended. Grace and I hung out once and started making out and then we hooked-up. It was weird the next day and we didn't talk for weeks. Grace started messaging me every week about random things. A couple months later, Grace invites me to hang out with Maria and some of Grace's friends. Maria told Grace that she would be upset if her and I got together. It was a secret - not that Maria needs to know anything. Grace started making out with me in front of her friends and whenever Maria would turn her back. We ended up hooking-up again.

Grace leaves town for a month. She starts texting me all day every day long walls of text and she shares some pretty intimate and personal details about her life with me. We agree to meet in person when she gets back. We have a date and we casually kiss and end the night. Grace begins making plans for us to stay at an AirBnB in the woods, travel to various places, and then she asks me to meet her parents when they are visiting (she asked me multiple times about this). Grace says she wants to see me again after the date and we agree to having her over my house for dinner and a movie. She messages me the night before and then cancels. Before all of this, I noticed that her plans would change and she would say things like ""We can't go on the AirBnB trip anymore because of reason xyz."" and the same thing with the other trips she wanted me to go on with her. She decides she doesn't want me to meet her parents and asks for some things back that she leant me. I give them back and she doesn't text me for over a month and goes completely silent. Grace reaches out and mentions that she is sorry for choosing her career and her busy life over me. She says the timing wasn't right and we can still be friends. I keep cool and agree.

After these messages, I am invited to Maria's house. It is just Maria, her husband, Grace, and I. Grace makes a comment about how she is now ""intentionally dating"" and she ends up calling 3 different guys who are friends with Maria during the night. I pull-up my dating profile and Maria says it is gold and she would swipe right on me if she were single. Maria reads some of the prompts on my profile and Grace says she agrees with all of them. Grace makes other comments. I say ""I am doing just fine with the dating apps and having no issues."" I remain calm and unbothered, but it is really just weird overall. I receive random pings from Grace about different coffee shops in the city and events and receive a Merry Christmas text.

Another month later, Grace invites me randomly to a hockey game and I respectfully decline because I was busy. A week after that, Grace tells me she saw my dating profile and said it was really good and she was happy when she saw it and she actually swiped right on me. I don't react to this because of all the hot/coldness from the past. I acknowledge it and she eventually messages me a few days later saying it is hard for women on dating apps and easier for men and I am lucky. I still haven't swiped right back on her and I think she is offended or wondering. I've been much less available after she ghosted me for a month and pulled back. I know I have been a backup in the past. I would be cool being casual with her and not getting into a relationship if she is open to it. I think me moving towards a relationship with her scared her off in the past. I'm just not used to the dating world, although I am slowing learning how this works.

My questions and advice I am seeking:

\- Is my read on the situation correct given what I have shared? She just wants attention and I am likely just a backup who has historically given this to her?  
\- Do I swipe right back on her? If I do, what message does this send?  
\- Is she actually attracted to me given what I have shared? Could this work as a casual thing?",1,1769041631.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I was that person who literally couldn't function before the first cup. Like, don't even try talking to me until I've had my coffee. Been that way for years. Just accepted it as part of who I am.

A couple months ago I switched to adaptogens and nootropics instead. Started buying them separately which was annoying as hell, measuring out five different powders every morning, trying to figure out dosing. Eventually found an all in blend that made it easier so I didn't have to think about it.

**Here's the thing though:**

Waking up and not feeling like complete garbage until caffeine kicks in? That's been genuinely life changing for me. I'm just... ready to go now. Not wired, not bouncing off walls, just clear headed and functional from the start.

I didn't expect it to make this much of a difference. I thought coffee was just part of my routine. Turns out it was masking how terrible I actually felt in the mornings.

No jitters throughout the day either, which is nice. And I can actually sleep at night without my brain racing.

Not saying coffee is bad or everyone should quit. But if you're someone who feels dependent on it just to feel normal, might be worth experimenting with alternatives. The shift has been pretty major for me.

**Anyone else make a similar switch?** Curious what worked for other people or if I'm just late to realizing this.",1,1769041405.0,atomichabit,0,1.0,False

1qjf7xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/olderlesbians/comments/1qjf7xa/transference_with_therapist/,Transference with Therapist,"Hi guys, I decided to post this here as I would love the perspective of some older lesbians. This is a situation that happened to me a while back, but I’m still finding myself ruminating over it. I would really appreciate your input.

I started therapy for the first time in January 2025. I quickly realised I was attracted to my therapist. I hoped she’d be cold and distant so I wouldn’t develop feelings but she was warm and very welcoming.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn’t just forget about clients when the session ends and that she thinks about me a lot.

In the third session, she told me I was beautiful and asked, “Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?” When I said no, she replied, “Well, they must all be blind.” That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said “I imagine you get a lot of attention because you’re very attractive.” At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said, “You’re my priority.”

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10–20 seconds… always tight and meaningful. 

One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn’t expect a reply, but she responded with: “I’m here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.” She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I had “unnatural feelings” and demanded she cut off contact with me all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

""I’m really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.

I never meant for this to happen and I’m so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what’s best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.

I sincerely apologise if you’ve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it’s very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can’t thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""

And she replied with this:

""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""

She texted my mum to say she regretted to inform that she would be stopping contact. I was absolutely heartbroken at the time. Then 2 weeks passed by and she showed up at my workplace after termination (she knew where I worked). She called my name, asked how I was, told me she sought out help from supervision and said I could come back to therapy any time I wanted. I asked if I could give her a hug and she didn’t answer, she just embraced me in her arms. When I was watching her walk down the stairs to leave she never turned back.

I didn’t contact her again until 3 months later when I got a bipolar diagnosis and she responded by saying “I ask that you refrain from contacting me, respecting your mom’s wishes”.

Overall, the situation has me really confused. The mixed signals are crazy. What do you guys think? Did she simply get scared once a third party found out and stepped in, and then tried to reinforce boundaries way too late? Am I imagining her breaking boundaries? Did she like me?

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you! :)",4,1769041116.0,olderlesbians,5,1.0,False

Let’s just move forward together. 

That said, here are 4 relatively low risk actions you can do NOW to help: 

1. Ice typically operates out of federal buildings 

Post up outside and take down plate numbers, make and models and report them. This starts at like 6am. I have the Scarborough field office below, but I fact check me on it. 

https://maps.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cb2a35ac9923c23:0xf03db3382ed2eabf?entry=s&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjK796E7p2SAxVSMVkFHU7ZPPMQ4kB6BAgWEAA&hl=en

2. If you’re white, help escort people to and from work if you can. That said, don’t just knock on people’s doors. Usually the elementary schools in the area or local churches operate as “dispatch” for community help. If you know someone personally who is at risk, offer to bring them food, medical supplies etc. 

3. When someone gets detained IF they are let go, they will have nothing: no phone, no ride, no money, no jacket. If you can find out where people are being held, you can literally just post up and wait for them to get out and have a jacket and a phone they can use. Bonus points if you got hot coffee or snacks. They will likely be pretty shaken up so try to be a calming presence. 

4. Lastly, report, document, honk, and make their jobs fucking miserable. This has been shared a lot, but bares repeating. 

Stay safe, don’t let them off the hook, but try not to get shot. Just remember this isn’t about immigration, you’re next on the list, and the cruelty IS THE POINT.

Idk.","I got keto duped a while back. Ate keto and then carnivore for the better of 2 1/2 years. Came off it due to massive cardiac and GI problems it started, and I never, ever looked back. Came off it under medical care when the issues started, and never ate low carb after that day. Anyway, that was a little while back, towards the end-ish of last year. Here's where I'm confused.

Because I stopped eating ALL animal proteins due to how high my LDL went and other cardiac concerns, I started eating all non animal proteins, and very plant forward. I then, after a few weeks, decided to cut dairy out to get the saturated fat even lower while recovering. Anyway, so basically my days immediately turned from no carbs (or maybe like 10 carbs at most), to very high carb. I won't lie, I have some carbs that aren't the healthiest, like crackers for a snack, a little sweetened cream in the coffee (nondairy), but I also eat fresh fruit, vegetables, and grains daily with meals/snacks.

I assumed my blood sugar would go through the roof the first few months, due to the introduction of high carb carbs daily. I am not diabetic or anything like that. I just checked my A1C, and I know that's the average blood sugar that's most recent, and it was 4.9, which is like a 94 average blood sugar.

I'm just confused - why didn't it go sky high? One of the huge keto lines is, ""carbs raise your blood sugar."" I'm sure after I eat a bowl of cereal or whatever, it would be temporarily high, but i expected my average blood sugar for the past month or two, to be like way higher than 94. Just looking to understand. Happy it's not, but now sorta even more pissed at yet another keto lie. Thanks for any insight.",3,1769041053.0,ketoduped,1,1.0,False

For context, I was at work for no more than two hours when I started feeling a burning sensation on my legs. I have very sensitive skin so this wouldn’t have been the first time I’ve dealt with hives. The issue is once I get it, it spreads quickly covering most of my body as well as swelling my throat. Immediately I went to the bathroom and called my boyfriend as I confirmed my hives. 

I informed him of the hives and that I’d be leaving work shortly. I had also asked if he could pick me up, I don’t drive. He tells me he just sat down and urges me to take an uber. Usually I wouldn’t mind but being that I only worked two hours it wouldn’t make sense spending $30 on an uber. He ends up dismissing me not believing it’d be that much and saying if it’s too much he’d come.

At this point I hadn't clocked yet because my managers were giving me a hard time. They told me to go on break and to see how I felt afterwards to which I agreed. But, the hives started to spread up my back. After some fight and panicking I was finally told I could leave. I end up calling my boyfriend again and updating him on the hives. I explain how it was hard for me to move without it burning and that it had spread further up my body. I pleaded again for him to pick me up, this time saying I needed him to bring my antihistamines. After some back and forth we agreed on him getting the antihistamines from my apartment, it’s around the corner from his, and I’ll take the uber back to his apartment. That was until I confirmed the uber is just about $30. He begrudgingly agreed to come get me.

As I waited for him I left my job, too annoyed by management to stay and wait inside the building. I ended up in Starbucks and of course ordered something as I waited. When I text my boyfriend telling him where I’ll be waiting he asked for coffee to which I said no. More specifically I said “after I had to argue with you to pick me up? 😑”. When he finally picked me up and saw that I didn’t order him coffee he was flabbergasted. I asked him “why would I buy you coffee after I had to fight with you about picking me up. While I’m having a severe allergic reaction?”. Of course he didn’t understand and said that he did it anyway so what’s the problem? I kind of ignore him because I shouldn’t have to explain why someone would be upset with their partner being difficult during an emergency situation. He proceeds to ask if I could buy him Chick-fil-a, and I tell him no again. My job is barely above minimum wage, there’s food and coffee at his apartment and I needed to take meds before my hives worsened and closed my throat. So AITA for not buying him food?

But in the winter, it becomes an ecosystem.

While the city drops to 62°F in my apartment at night, the plants just… adapt.

The track lights become a canopy.

The shelving becomes an understory.

The microwave sits under a variegated Monstera like it pays rent.

People talk about houseplants like décor, but once you really live with them they become part of the architecture …changing airflow, humidity, shadows, and mood. They make the indoors feel like a quiet rainforest that just happens to have knives, spice racks, and a blender.

I love the rhythm of it:

Coffee brewing while an Anthurium leaf hardens off.

Propagation boxes humming under the cookware.

A bronze Luxurians × Nigrolaminum (Luxury Dreams) unfurling like patent leather against winter air.

Harlem has always been a place where culture grows … art, music, food, energy - so it makes sense that a little jungle would take root here too.

1qjf69r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1qjf69r/bi_girl_dating_man_for_first_time/,Bi girl Dating Man for First Time,"I’ve recently been on 2 dates with a man for the first time EVER in my life. 

I am a 23F who has only ever dated and been in relationships with women, and out of the blue the other day I met a lovely guy who I feel I had good chemistry with and enjoyed a long “8 hour date” with. It had initially just been 2 friends hanging out, but I picked up a vibe and felt comfortable to explore it. 

We were playful and slightly flirty, not having kissed but held hands closer to the end of the night instigated by me - it felt fun and easy! 

The next day, he said he wanted to see me again, that evening if possible - I was flattered but shut it down as I was busy, where he proceeded to say “I hope they cancel so we can see each other again” Amber flag… but I was so excited I took it as a sweet kind gesture! 

Then the next day he asked when I could see him next, if not the Friday the Saturday. I explained to him I was quite busy but after him pushing I agreed to see him on Sunday. 

It felt all exciting and like butterflies, but I felt we needed to pace ourselves.

We met in the early afternoon and he took me to a coffee shop and paid for everything even though I offered, which I found to be very lovely, and we proceeded to go to the cinema, where things increased a lot. 

We started holding hands, and by the end of it he was snuggling into me. I wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable with this, and yes I did enjoy it, but it did feel very couply for someone I’d just met the other day. 

After this we went for a few drinks, where I expressed to him I’d only ever dated women, and he said he kind of understood. I also expressed to him, 2026 was supposed to be a year where I didn’t date, telling him I’d just stopped seeing someone before christmas that was still a bit raw, but i’d pretty much moved on as it was only a 6 month dating period. (basically I told him idk what I’m looking for, and this is the first person i’ve “dated” whilst not being on a dating app for a very very long time, so I understand lines may be a bit blurred) 

I noticed he talked to me A LOT about his ex, who broke up with him a good year ago, and I know her as where we lived is quite small, but not closely - and as it has been pretty friendly up until that evening I didn’t feel too uncomfortable. However as the night and time progressed he mentioned her a good few more times. I didn’t take it too serisokly as it’s still very new, and it’s important to know these things. However looking back now I’m thinking Amber Flag. 

After this, the discussion of me staying at his house arose. I live 20 minutes out and the last train would have been 11pm, an we were drinking and dancing and having fun. He said he’d love for me to stay, and I thought about it for an hour or two and said yes stating VERY strongly I would not be having sex with him. 

He seemed to be respectful of this at the time, however the next morning, there was a lot of heavy petting, kissing and touching. I didn’t feel massively uncomfortable by this, but I did feel there was a slight expectation under there. 

In the morning he found out that i’d never slept with a man, which left him sweating profusely and I told him I understood if he wanted to end this here, as my attraction to men is something I really hadn’t explored yet, but I liked spending time with him. 

The first RED FLAG was that he’d purse his lips and ask me for kissed ever 10 minutes or so, and after a while I started saying “i’m not a dog!” as it felt very “I’m asking so I get!” He wasn’t being completely disrespectful but it did feel a bit odd. 

He then asked about exclusivity- I told him I wasn’t seeing anyone else (but really when could I when I’d only known him 4 days) and he took this as exclusivity. 

From here things started to get incredibly emotionally intense - we went for a day out in town which I really loved, it felt fun care free and easy! And we had good fun! When it was coming to the end of the day I suggested going to the gallery or another film, and he said we should just go back to his. I agreed. Here the heavy petting began again, and the conversation on sex came up. The make outs started to become more frequent and I could feel him getting hard, so I tried to bring the pace back down as well as I could, suggesting card games. 

Overall it was a nice time spent, however the emotional intensity was insane. We ended up spending almost 2 whole days together so my mind barely had time to catch up with my body. 

After this, we texted, and his texts started to go from friendly ones to very romantic ones. 

Sending me pictures he’d taken calling me perfect, over and over again. Saying he missed me. Sending me pictures of him crying because i’d left. 

After the evening diffused and I began to calm down - it all seemed to get too much. He started asking me what I was telling my friends and without even thinking I told him. He started asking to see multiple pictures of my nails multiple times in a day (apparently he’s never been out with someone as feminine and girly as me?) and saying multiple times how excited he was to see me next - which was Friday. 

Idk if it was gut feeling, or just general emotional overwhelm, but I feel like this is moving far quicker than anticipated, and he kept saying how honoured he was be was the first guy I chose to date. 

Everything has just become insanely intense, which I’m confused by as most of the people I’ve dated have been pretty chill to start off with, and I heard that men TEND to be slower. 

Either way, it’s all become a bit too much and I need to end things with him, but I just feel terrible. 

I feel so scared and so stressed to not push things any further, but regardless of if you’re a man or a woman, the expectation that now because I’ve stayed at yours once and will continue to do so, is crazy to me. It seems to be all about HIM and his feelings, and he’s not asked once how I am feeling about things. 

Either way it’s all too complicated and after speaking to close friends, and realising I can’t give him a relationship and I can’t give him sex, I think it’s time to end it. 

I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m going to break his heart. 

I feel like i’m going crazy! I feel like I’ve lead him on and feel terrible, but a part of me can’t shake the fact that maybe this emotional intensity has been brought on by the fact that if he were to have sex with me, he’d essentially be taking my virginity in a sense. 

I just feel so so confused. Lots of my friends are saying to me it’s moving too fast and that he’s trying to “butter me up” so I give in to him sooner. Idk what to do or think… Do I just ask him to slow it down? But also at the same time, i don’t think I can even entertain a relationship rn! Maybe this is just one of those crazy flings that feels amazing in the moment and then once you’re out of it you’re like “hmm okay maybe NOT” 

I’m so confused and so stressed - HELP!! ",2,1769040998.0,bisexual,1,1.0,False

1qjf36o,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbianseurope/comments/1qjf36o/transference_with_therapist/,Transference with Therapist,"Hi guys, this is a situation that happened to me a while back, but I’m still finding myself ruminating over it. I would really appreciate your input.

I started therapy for the first time in January 2025. I quickly realised I was attracted to my therapist. I hoped she’d be cold and distant so I wouldn’t develop feelings but she was warm and very welcoming.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn’t just forget about clients when the session ends and that she thinks about me a lot.

In the third session, she told me I was beautiful and asked, “Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?” When I said no, she replied, “Well, they must all be blind.” That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said “I imagine you get a lot of attention because you’re very attractive.” At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said, “You’re my priority.”

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10–20 seconds… always tight and meaningful. 

One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn’t expect a reply, but she responded with: “I’m here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.” She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I had “unnatural feelings” and demanded she cut off contact with me all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

""I’m really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.

I never meant for this to happen and I’m so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what’s best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.

I sincerely apologise if you’ve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it’s very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can’t thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""

And she replied with this:

""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""

She texted my mum to say she regretted to inform that she would be stopping contact. I was absolutely heartbroken at the time. Then 2 weeks passed by and she showed up at my workplace after termination (she knew where I worked). She called my name, asked how I was, told me she sought out help from supervision and said I could come back to therapy any time I wanted. I asked if I could give her a hug and she didn’t answer, she just embraced me in her arms. When I was watching her walk down the stairs to leave she never turned back.

I didn’t contact her again until 3 months later when I got a bipolar diagnosis and she responded by saying “I ask that you refrain from contacting me, respecting your mom’s wishes”.

Overall, the situation has me really confused. The mixed signals are crazy. What do you guys think? Did she simply get scared once a third party found out and stepped in, and then tried to reinforce boundaries way too late? Am I imagining her breaking boundaries?

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you! :)",0,1769040776.0,actuallesbianseurope,2,0.5,False

* Sugar-free, zero calorie
* Low carb, keto-friendly

* No erythritol (important for people sensitive to sugar alcohols)
* Keto-friendly and suitable for diabetics
* Easy to use in coffee, tea, oats, or protein shakes

These packets are convenient if you want **precise sweetness** without altering texture.

It took them about 2 weeks to figure out what was going on, and they called her and said that she had spills some coffee at some point, and that it had gotten under the console. This caused some kind of module to short out. They told her it wasn’t covered under warranty since it was an outside force that caused the short. They gave her 2 options. 1 they could try and clean it for 900 dollars(but there was no guarantee this would work). 2 pay 6,000 to have the module completely replaced. My mom made the grave mistake of deciding to purchase the vehicle when she took it in for what she thought would be something covered under the warranty, so now she is stuck with this paper weight of a vehicle. Has anyone else ran into a similar issue? Is there anything that can be done so she’s not stuck toting the bill?

1qjevos,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qjevos/he_told_me_he_loved_me_and_im_so_scared/,He told me he loved me and I'm so scared,"I'm a little overwhelmed but also giddy. I F(18) started talking to my boyfriend M(18) a little over a month ago. He lives in my college town and goes to a similar church. I am a university student and he is in the fire Academy.

We met through mutual friends and started talking every day. We clicked so well and were so vulnerable with each other. He told me about his past and I told him things I have barely told anyone else.

When I got back to my college town he met up with my family for lunch and then took me one-on-one on the most amazing date. At the end he asked to kiss me and for me to be his girlfriend. This was two and a half weeks ago.

Since then we have been inseparable. Despite our busy schedule we still make time for at least two several hour long dates and FaceTime practically every day, and text every day. He is so so kind but doesn't pretend to be perfect. He's been honest to me about his flaws.

Last weekend I casually met his family and it went really well and they loved me. Afterwards we started making out in the car and while I was initially okay with it at first I asked him to stop because I wasn't ready. He did immediately and apologized and told me he would never do anything I was uncomfortable with.

After that we just cuddled and watched movies and it was amazing.

Today he had to come on campus for a state test and he bought me coffee and we hung out in between my classes and really talked. He was so anxious and apologetic that he was so down and I just comforted him. I let the nickname love slip out.

I told him it's okay that he's not okay and that I want every version of him. He passed the test then texted me that he realized he loved me. That he would have said it in person but he couldn't wait any longer to say it. That I didn't need to say it and he was perfectly fine going as slow as I need but he had to tell me where he stood.

I didn't say it back because to be honest I'm scared. I'm scared of getting hurt and I'm so scared he wants me just for my body despite logically him being the exact opposite.

We already talked about waiting for marriage because I'm a devout Christian and he was okay with that. Still I'm scared. This is both of our first actual relationship, however he has had two hookups in the past except he didn't go all the way with them. He very much regrets that and I don't expect him to be perfect but still I'm scared.

Because I do love him. But I don't want to get hurt. What if he doesn't actually love me for me? Or what if he's saying it just to get sex? I know that's not him, deep down I know but it doesn't stop the fear.

My friends think it's too early and a red flag, my parents said I love you three weeks in and have the healthiest relationship that's still going strong 21 years later. I just don't know how to stop the fear.",0,1769040248.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

The Dauntless

  


  


“This is amazing. What is this?” Geode asks as he bites into his brownie.

  


“Would you believe a type of bean?” Admiral Cistern asks.

  


“What? It’s a pastry.”

  


“The flavour is primarily the extract of a bean. The coco bean.”

  


“Oh. Fascinating.”

  


“Yes, some of the most popular flavours on Earth are from beans. Coco and Vanilla. With Coffee being the one we won’t be feeding you as the caffeine may be dangerous.”

  


“Are you sure this stuff is safe for Erumenta consumption?”

  


“Coco and Vanilla are safe for non-human consumption. There was a bit of a scare there as there are numerous species that resemble animals that cannot safely digest them. But after some testing we’ve determined that for most of them it’s perfectly safe. So long as we don’t start introducing the absolutely over the top versions. So no devil’s food cake or death by chocolate for you.”

  


“Death by chocolate?”

  


“Cooks and Bakers are artists in their own right and will name things according to their whimsy. Although funny enough Chocolate Lava Cake would be safe for you. For some reason.”

  


“Why is that odd?”

  


“It’s one of the richer cakes. But I digress. As much as we have been speaking about potential Astral Forest Assistance with the La’ahbaron crisis we still need to speak with them. They are a very prickly people that are very much reluctant to accept help.”

  


“Then why are you helping them?”

  


“Several reasons, but most prominent is that an allied species has an enormous amount of intrest in the area.”

  


“Is it that new one? The ones that are cloaked and... uh...” Geode starts snapping his fingers to try and recall the name, the sound is like rocks clacking against each other.

  


“Vishanyan. Or Vish that are Freeborn in their own language.”

  


“Why is that distinction so important?” Geode asks.

  


“Because the forces besieging La’ahbaron, are Vish.”

  


“Oh. Where did they come from? I... well not me but The Astral Forest has memories of two of them. One older, one younger, and then there were the events that dragged them into the light with the Primal Wimparas but... what are they?”

  


“Weapons. An attempt to make an artificial species by a now defunct cooporation called Charrtack Solutions. They had what was called The Lost Fifteen. Fifteen blacksite projects. The entire company barring a few low level employees were wiped out when they found themselves in the path of destruction of The Dark Cabal Pirates. The Vish were Project Fourteen. Indicated by the Delta-14 marking on all their equipment. The Vishanyan that resulted from The Vish freeing themselves, also have access to one of the previously thought of failed projects. A novel stealth panel for spaceships. Project Delta-15 by the way.”

  


“So a secondary cache of Vish were found. Not free Vish so not Vishanyan, attacking La’ahbaron for some unknown reason and...”

  


“Making use out of another ‘failed’ Charrtack Solutions Lost Fifteen. Delta-4. A stalking and suicide drone program you can plug into any vehicle with an autopilot feature and turn it into a tracking bomb. That one was captured and reversed by The La’ahbaron Empire to turn into an Anti-Vish tracking system designed to counter their stealth and infiltration. Which is how we became involved in all this.”

  


“... It can’t differentiate between Vishanyan and Vish, and so a La’ahbaron asset attacked an Undaunted Ally.”

  


“An Undaunted Ally that is also an Apuk Ward. The Vishanyan Home Fleet is right at the edge of Apuk territory and have officially surrendered to them.”

  


“You’ve done a lot to favour The Apuk.”

  


“It’s two ways. We’re sealing them in as allies, and getting them to take over responsibilities we’re not fully prepared to deal with yet. I would have liked to be able to support and represent your entire Nebula. But we just do not have the logistical or administrative power to do that. The Apuk do. For all that we Undaunted can punch well and truly above our weight class in martial terms, other areas are still a bit less solid. Most of our political ventures are banking heavily on audacity and the fact that we’re using men to make our cases. The galaxy is a big, big place and even as we’re growing voraciously, the amount of catch up we have to do is insane. And to be fair we’re not even at a level yet where we can say we’re not falling further behind.” Admiral Cistern says.

  


“Institutional Power is an immense thing.” Observer Wu notes as he takes further notes.

  


“Indeed. But with our focus on rescue, relief and restoration through elite military tactics and intelligent movement, we have made ourselves welcome in many, many places. In generally the places we are not welcome in are the ones where they have already maligned us in some way. Such as the Gavali Empire.”

  


“The polity responsible for creating Harold correct?” Observer Wu asks.

  


“it is. They have not contacted us officially about him. But the whispers that have reached me say that there are many regrets in the dealing with Saint Redblade.” Admiral Cistern says in an amused tone.

  


“I’ve tried to read up on everything that you and yorus have gotten up to but it just...”

  


“A lot has happened. The result of having the foundation of your organization be a large number of energetic men that make a habit of looking for trouble.” Admiral Cistern says before he is cut off by a flashing light on his desk. “Admiral Cistern present with Observer Wu and Ambassador Geode of the Vynok Nebula.”

  


“Floric Representative requesting to speak with you sir.”

  


“Can you inform her that I will be available within a half hour?” Admiral Cistern asks and Geode nods.

  


“On it sir.”

  


“Alright, it appears we’ve socialized more than enough. I am going to get some people on this set of events. While civilian aid requires much less training and less stringent standards than military aid, we still need to be able to coordinate and cooperate so we actually benefit from one another. Bad help can be worse than no help after all.”

  


Things pass by quickly at that point, agreements made and in general the idea of how The Sorcerers of The Vynok Nebula would assist. All of it however was hedging on just how much La’ahbaron would be willing to let itself be assisted.

  


Just as they finish up there’s a knock at the door. A few moments later Private Stream opens it. “Sir, we’ve finished interrogating the woman that tried to break in earlier. She’s sent by Malishina.”

  


“Really? The Nagasha Supremacist sent a biped?”

  


“Apparently? It’s a prosthetic with a pretty good fake skin sheathe on it. Like a Cloaken Terminator. We tracked the signal back to the origin point and jumped the Cloud Nagasha piloting it. Incidentally we’re also checking to see if the prosthesis will be useful for our own ends. But we may or may not have to return it.”

  


“Hmm... I suppose that when it’s in the heart of politics we can’t exactly go finders keepers on anything we get our hands on.” Admiral Cistern notes. “Have you determined WHY she was poking around?”

  


“Not yet, but she’s in the process of talking and we know where she’s from and her name. Which is Mallory no last name.”

  


“... Just to be clear are you saying she does not have a second name or that her last name is literally no last name?”

  


“Both, but on the paper it’s no last name. There’s some kind of really weird tradition going on in the Malishina Territory. Orphans use no last name in place of a last name until they marry or somehow impress someone. Then they’re given a last name.”

  


“Of course. Not the weirdest, but still odd. Keep on her. I want to know what she knows and why she thought that was a good idea. Also how someone stupid enough to just open the door to my office managed to get into the preceding room to begin with. Stealth or not, that was absurd.”

  


“On it sir.”

  


•-•-•Scene Change•-•-• (Undaunted Main Office, Admiral Cistern’s Office, Five Minutes Later, Centris)•-•-•

  


“Sir! Madam Knotroot of Varthor, chief ambassador of one of the larger Floric colony worlds. Second most populous I think?”

  


“Third, but by a thin margin.” Knotroot corrects as the wildflower strewn woman walks in. She looks like someone painted a classical nymphs face orange and shoved her in a business suit she was literally flowering out of. Tiny pale blue and white petalled flowered stuck out of every seem and the sheer presence of fertility and openness is outright disarming.

  


“Good to meet you ma’am.” Admiral Cistern says as he shakes her hand, noting that this woman had made everything about herself soft and silken. Not what he expected out of a Floric. Her enormous, flowing head of hair is more a garden of flowers and the hint of some few fruits and berries hanging in the curtain as if just asking to be plucked.

  


Something was up.

  


“It is good to be met. I must admit, while I had indeed prepared much my life to be presentable, I hadn’t expected it to be used like this. You little monkeys love causing trouble, don’t you?”

  


“I beg your pardon?”

  


“Oh it’s no insult. It’s admiration. I am a historian, actress and now politician. You humans have helped kick off a great time of change and every where I look, there is more change and it’s at most two or three links removed from you and yours. I’m impressed.”

  


“I think this conversation has taken a turn here. What are you here to speak about ambassador?” Admiral Cistern asks.

  


“We wish for there to be some form of Undaunted delegation or Emboss established on at least one of the Floric Worlds, and my own has been selected for this part. Mostly because Varthor is a well controlled garden world. It’s tame, but still uses the same gene lines and endlessly deadly creatures of the homeworld.”

  


“How did you manage that?”

  


“With gardeners that have combat training that potentially surpasses that of your own organization. You humans for better or worse are a lovely combination of looking and acting adorable while actually being insanely dangerous and ridiculously hard to kill. Which is unfortunately what we need. For all that we want to be part of the galactic community we are still one of the most dangerous species out there despite our attempts to tame and regulate ourselves into a more socially acceptable state. If we want to try again with the galactic community we need our best foot forward and doing so side by side with the people that have positively influenced one of the largest religions in the galaxy in a public manner is our best bet. So you are our best bet.”

  


“I see, so are we looking at an alliance? Trade agreement? Open diplomacy at the least I assume.”

  


“Open Diplomacy to start with, potentially looking into alliances later and maybe some social programs across polities. Exchange programs and the like. I understand that human explosives are an interesting way to use indirect fire without resorting to unusual Axiom techniques or orbital bombardment. I think that could help with the gardening.”

  


“The fact that you’re completely serious about using artillery for gardening is amusing to say the least.” Admiral Cistern says and there is a slight sound as Observer Wu clears his throat. “Yes Observer Wu?”

  


“May I speak with Madam Knotroot for a moment. I have a few questions.”

  


“Oh certainly, what would you like to know?”

  


“I’m rather curious about the sheer amount of flowers and such on your person. From my understanding of the Floric, you adapt to whatever outside influences there are to harden, reinforce and otherwise armour and arm your physical bodies. Which then becomes the inheritance of the next generation with the self-decapitation and with normal reproduction. Correct?”

  


“And you’re curious as to how a large number of small flowers is an advantage?”

  


“Yes.”

  


“They’re not. We can however slowly garden our own bodies. It’s very time consuming, irritating and difficult however. Even a small number of mistakes means you need to basically rip yourself off the body and try again. And it’s generally considered a taboo if you’re just ripping yourself off a body to not deal with it and leave your own daughter to deal with it.”

  


“And the individuals that accomplish this self-gardening? What is it a sign of?”

  


“Extremes. Extreme wealth, extreme self control, extreme axiom abilities or extreme carelessness.

  


“Carelessness?”

  


“I did just say it was taboo to rip yourself off a body you don’t like to try again didn’t I?”

  


“And if it’s not to invasive, where do you fall in that list?”

  


“A bit otherly to be honest, I got extremely lucky. My mother and aunts are powerful Axiom Adepts and we’re very well off women. So I’ve had a very pampered life, and it shows in all my lovely flowers.”

\- Great Lands Parka in Black and Dusty Olive

\- ""Fairbanks"" Active Jacket in Black, Forestry Green, Peat, Deep Smoke Blue and Field Fatigue. I'm unsure what Fairbanks stands for here.

\- Montana Rugged Flex Ranch Coat in Black and Carhartt Brown. It seems like the Rancher style is making its return, although it's Rugged Flex. Aah.

\- Rugged Flex Denim Detroit Jacket in Muskegon. I believe this is the denim detroit sample that was leaked a few days ago.

\- Unless I'm blanking it from 2025, the Montana jacket is getting a color way of Dark Brown/Dark Coffee this year.

\- Great Lands Jacket in Black, Dusty Olive and Dark Rose Tint. Not sure what to expect with this jacket and its style. Havent seen a Great Lands before.

\- Elkhart Jacket in Black, Carbon Heather, Navy, Red Duck, Army Green Camo and Fossil Tan Camo. Again I'm not sure what to expect with this jacket and its style. Glad we're seeing more Red Duck though.

\- The Berwick Jacket is receiving a style in the color ""Burnished Logs""

\- This one is interesting. Crawford Sherpa Detroit Jacket. Coming in Dusty Olive, Natural and Stone Brown. No mention of rugged flex. This one could be reallll nice.

\- Full Swing Loose Fit Active Jacket in Black, Moss and Red Duck.

1qjepnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepExperimenters/comments/1qjepnn/sleep_hacks_that_actually_work_3_that_failed_me/,Sleep hacks that actually work: 3 that failed me and 3 that did the trick,"I've battled crappy sleep for what feels like forever. 

When I was younger, I could just shake it off… but as I got into my 30s, I started feeling exhausted all day, brain-fogged at work, and losing patience over nothing. The worst part was probably the toll it took on my immune system, and my friends and family were getting sick and tired of me being sick and tired. 

So I started looking for solutions, but I soon found out that a lot of the ""quick fixes"" out there are just overhyped, and none of them hold up for very long. But after researching and trying a few things (not to mention several failed attempts), I finally found a combination that genuinely helped me fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling human again.

Just remember: This is all from my personal experience, and it probably won’t work for everyone. Regardless, I hope it helps!

**What didn't work:**

1. Melatonin supplements

When I started taking melatonin, I started with 3mg gummies. After about a week, they stopped working, and I had to bump up to 10mg. That worked pretty well for a while, but I was still having groggy mornings that would last into the afternoon (unless I had a bunch of coffee) and weird dreams that woke me up thinking WTF was that? 

After doing more research, this made sense… apparently, melatonin can disrupt natural sleep cycles and lead to dependency. I was even using higher-quality brands like Thorne, but in the end, the brain fog and reduced efficacy weren't worth it for me.

2. Meditation apps and guided relaxation

Since mindfulness is backed by studies for reducing stress, I tried apps with guided meditations, breathing exercises, you name it. But for me, I feel like it had the opposite effect, and it just got me overthinking. My mind wandered and my frustration mounted… I felt like I was forcing relaxation, which made falling asleep even harder.

3. Blue light glasses

These were all the rage a few years back, with claims that they'd filter out screen light and boost natural melatonin production. I wore them religiously after 8 PM while scrolling or watching TV, but no dice. They may have helped a little with eye strain, but not with actual sleep quality.

**What did work:**

1. A strict no-screens routine

First, what made a difference was cutting out the blue light entirely, not just filtering it. I committed to shutting down my screens at 9 PM, replacing them with dim lights, herbal tea, and light reading (no heavy stuff, though… learned that the hard way). 

It took a couple of weeks, but I felt less wired at bedtime. Besides not straining my eyes, no more doom-scrolling meant that my mind actually started unwinding naturally.

2. An optimized bedtime environment

Studies show that cooler temperatures signal to your body that it's sleep time, and apparently, an optimized sleep environment can reduce the chance of waking up in the middle of the night. 

For me, this meant cooling the room to 65–67F, using blackout curtains, and turning on a white noise machine, which more or less created a cave-like setup. 

3. A smart sleep headband 

Despite trying and failing to get blue light glasses to help, the part that tied this all together for me was the tech. I’ve tried a few different bits of hardware, but what worked best was Somnee’s Smart Sleep headband. 

It uses personalized neurostimulation to tune my brainwaves for better sleep (for the science-inclined, this is called transcranial alternating current stimulation, or tACS). It works by using AI to identify your optimal sleep patterns and deliver tACS and meditative soundscapes during a 15-minute session before bed. No drugs/no side effects.

Has anyone else tried ditching supplements for habits or gadgets? What flopped or worked for you?

1qjep62,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1qjep62/aqua_ship_is_not_it/,Aqua ship is not it…,"I went on a week trip on Aqua. As a usual Escape ship cruiser, this ship was a disappointment. 
Let me start with my spa experience which started on the first day. My husband and I got a 75 minute couples deep tissue massage (Nearly $600 for that by the way). 15 minutes of that massage was actually used for consultation (??) and barely touching me for 10 minutes after laying on the bed. Got a good 30 minutes of actual massage. Before the massage they tried to sell us add-ons that were $19 a piece. I picked the eye treatment, husband chose aromatherapy. She gave me aromatherapy too and then charged me for it even though i didn’t want it. Okay whatever. 
We finish and they come in with a pile of garbage creams and stuff pressuring us to buy them. She hit me with the “so which one will you be using?” Um for over $100 for a cream, none. They hand us an ipad to approve the charge and sign, they charged us BOTH an additional $49 for BODY OIL. That should have been APART of a $600 massage. I confronted her and she said “yeah that was an additional charge”. So at this point, we are almost $800 for a massage that wasnt ACTUALLY 75 minutes. So I dont recommend that at all. 

Next experience, the food. The food in the main dining room, which is called The Commodore, has SHRUNK in portions. And they will upcharge you if you want to order more food, even though some of the portions aren’t filling. The new york strip steak entree was about 4 oz. 
I didnt see a change in food quality, but portions are extremely small, and i dont know if that is because we were on a full ship or if its just protocol. 

Im assuming all NCL people know about the drink package restrictions right now… hopefully you dont need water during your cruise. $7 for a small bottle of aqua panna, starbucks is no longer included, coffee drinks on the menu are no longer included and are about $7 a piece. 

We had the spa pass, worth it. Best selection of saunas and a salt room and ice room, steam room etc. Gorgeous and a huge improvement from the Escape ships’ spas. 

The layout of the ship itself is really confusing and cramped compared to other NCL ships i’ve been on, not a fan!!

No issues with staff, i love NCL staff :)

Oh, and another thing, tip your favorite staff in CASH discretely. Do not tip on your room or receipt. The staff do not ever see the money. You can also go to the guest services and sign off on paying the $20 per day service charge, the staff will also not see that money. PLEASE only tip in cash. NCL is very greedy with tips, ive spoken to many different staff members on different cruises, i try to spread this info as much as i can. ",0,1769039811.0,NCL,13,0.35,False

💼 **Rashaad - Male Human - Psychic Detective**

Rashaad never asked to see beyond the edges of things. Cases pull him into alleys where memory curls back on itself, and instincts whisper warnings no one taught him to hear. Where reality slips, he keeps walking towards the truth, because ignoring the strange never made it disappear.

🔮 **Vaelwyn - Female Wyvern - Nightographer**

Vaelwyn flits between rooftops and moonlit alleys, her silver wings tracing paths time itself forgot. Where shadows gather and reality bends, she leaves a map in her wake as a guide for those who wander and a warning for those who seek too much, for she knows the night remembers.

# Story Premises

**🌃** **The Astral Kettle opens its doors to you...**

The Astral Kettle is a liminal rooftop café that appears after dark, offering sanctuary to creatures of every shape, scale, and feather. Payment is measured not in coin, but in whispered confessions, forgotten names, and moments shared over culinary delights both hot and sweet.

>*You take your usual route. The café has never been there before.*

>*Warm light spills across the rooftop, music low and unintrusive, and a table set as if someone expected you. The skyline beyond looks familiar until you linger on it too long, then gently rearranges itself.*

>*Rashaad sits with his back to the railing, coat folded neatly, gaze sharp despite the hour. Eyes as dark as the coffee he sips from looked up the moment you stop walking. Above you, something moves.*

>*A shadow passes, too large and too deliberate to be a cloud. For a heartbeat, silver caught the glow* – *a curve of wing, a suggestion of motion* – *then it disappears, leaving the string lights swaying gently in its wake.*

>*Welcome to The Astral Kettle.*

📝 **Here's some prompts and ideas to jump off!**

* The barista already knows your order. Have you been before?
* A whispering rumor claims the café is a hub for liminal crime.
* Someone tries to leave the café without paying in memories.
* Rashaad offers to help with a problem you bring... for a price.
* Vaelwyn is quietly enjoying milk n' honey pastries beside you.
* Have another scene in mind? Try it out!

Priorities: 1) Adults-only pool, 2) Spa, 3) Close to a town so we can get some culture.

Food and room should be decent, but we're not that picky. Ideally, the place would have a separate adults-only pool area. She doesn't drink, me not much. Some place close to a town so we can get some local eats and maybe shop a little. We just want to relax by the ocean and pool without tons of screaming children. The spa doesn't need to be on property if there is a nicer one at another resort nearby or in town.

Our budget is about $2K each for a bouble queen room or two king rooms, maybe 5-6 nights. We don't need an ocean view. We are thinking late spring April-May-ish.

Oh, and we need early 5 am coffee and tea service, ideally room service, and we also like evening tea service, but we can get it and take it to our room.

1qjeepa,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qjeepa/lenas_diary_friday_part_11/,[Lena's Diary] Friday - Part 11,"4am

The room feels stuffy, but I'm afraid getting up and moving around will wake up Ava. She's in a crib in my room. So, my mom was as the business mans lunch and had to pay with a check. That would have been awkward for her. They both hate awkward. But I feel like I'm reading it in a book and its not real. Ben and Julie are feeling the things for me right now. The deacon. I wonder if my dad actually has a business investing for people? If that's real, it will unfreeze. I don't want people who have done nothing wrong to get hurt. Those poor people. In my church, rich people are seen as blessed by God. So people trust them. That's not right, is it? Rich people are just as likely to be shady as poor. Maybe more likely depending on how they got the money. Part of the reason folks at church were a little standoffish to me was because my dad was rich but I wasn't.  They probably thought that if he didn't share his wealth with me more evenly, it was because God showed him flaws in me saying I didn't deserve it.



5am

How do poor women get away from abuse? Ben and Julie have put out serious money to keep me safe, and even in my small house I wasn't poor, just middle, but I couldn't have done what they did. How do women with nothing do this? No wonder women stay. They have no choices. What is something a poor or middle woman needs most of she wants to leave? This hotel feels safe. A place to go built like this would be nice, maybe with a daycare. I’m lucky to have Julie and Ben who love to watch Ava while I do all this stuff. 



I’m going to make some tea. Ive given up coffee, it tastes terrible. I’m going to be a tea drinker. There is English breakfast tea in the room. I’ll try it. Julie had roosiboos (?) at her house and I liked that a lot. The English breakfast tea is making me sleepy, like coffee sometimes did. Maybe I can sleep a little before Ava wakes up. 



9:15

Julie has my phone because it started blowing up at 8:00 a.m. I guess my dad finally called the bank to figure out what was going on with his cards and found out that both him and my mom's accounts were frozen by the courts. I have no idea why he didn't do that yesterday. I kind of thought this would have happened yesterday afternoon after his cards were rejected at the restaurant. I mean mom thought I was hacking her though but Dad would have known, wouldn't he? The bank president usually goes to those brunches, so he would have known too. My dad always brags about the bank president being there. He loves the idea of treating him to a meal. At least I didn't have a big panic attack when I saw Dad's name on messenger. Maybe I’m getting past those. Dad never messages me. His Facebook is empty. At Christmas and Easter he posts a photo with a Bible verse on it. That's all.  According to the message, he called my lawyer and told them he didn't want to get involved in my 'silly little marriage spats.' and to keep his affairs out of it.



10am

The lawyer called and said that the FBI is requesting copies of all the evidence he has collected with chain of.. something attached. He’s looking into why and what but likely has to do with the images online. He also says my father was detained at the airport yesterday night coming back from Vancouver, he was at a board meeting there. The border patrol cleared his phone, or copied it? They took the info from it. He went to Vancouver right after the brunch, and came home last night or early this morning. He made his flight but they questioned him.

I’m in robot mode and took notes. I’ll write them here, and figure it all out later. 

My lawyer called a tip line when they found out the cameras were streaming to a subscription service. The FBI handles that, and they start right away. The lawyer figured on that and was careful to document the chain perfectly. The FBI got that video information all from my lawyer and my brother.   My husband was paid to stream by subscribers. My dad also paid my husband so he could be a subscriber or paying him for some other reason, but just in case they flagged him because he left the country.  They downloaded and wiped his phone but it looked like he was paying him for a different reason, so they didn't keep him. 

According to the report the border patrol took, he said he was hacked by a family member and his credit was frozen. 

My lawyer thinks he doesn't realize what is going on. But that's why he didn't call the bank until he got home. He either thought he was hacked, or thought it wasn't serious, or that it would blow over.  My lawyer suspects my father isn't good at business. Anyway, Ben and Julie are very upset, but this sounds better to me. I thought Dale was selling… pictures of him doing stuff to Ava. I’m relieved but they are saying I shouldn’t be. I’ll have to figure this out, but my brain is not hearing things. They just slide out. 

Watching isn’t as bad. I felt watched all the time anyway. By God, the church, the devil, my husband, my father, my mother. Everyone watched, everyone had something to say about what I was doing. Does this mean my father watched movies of us? I didn’t do anything worth watching. 

I'm going to believe Julie and Ben and the lawyer that its bad. It will kick in later. But my dad thinks I hacked him? For what, my own money?

V60 Plastic w/Hario filters

K6 @90 clicks from true zero (-10)

15g dose - 240g water - 1:16

91\*C COS tap water, filtered - this is the same water the roaster uses for pour overs in their shop, albeit a different filter. Just before anyone tells me to mess with my water which I know I probably should do

Using Lance Hedrick 2 Pour w/45g bloom 45-50 seconds and then a continuous pour for the remaining 195g. Drawdown finishing around 3:00 this time. 

I have lowered the temp a bit and played with the grind size, admittedly not in a reasonable way to contrast but I don’t want to waste coffee. My current issue is that the cup is just kind of bland. The brew I described above was slightly bitter and had a bit of the fruit acidity come through near the end and when cooler but ultimately very disappointing. Prior cups have felt a little muddy causing me to lower temp. I don’t have a ton of experience dialing in coffee and this is my first anaerobic so I’m hoping you all can help me find the missing adjustment and crack it.

I was on lunch and had to be back at work at 12:30. I woke up around 12:20 and changed our son’s diaper to help take some pressure off my wife. It was just a pee diaper. I wrapped it up and tossed it by the trash can, intending to throw it away because I had to go that direction to get some papers out the closet.

The day before, my wife had mentioned that she doesn’t like when I do that because sometimes I forget to throw them away. I have ADHD, so I’ll admit that occasionally happens, but I generally try to be very active and helpful around the house. I’m full-time military, but I’ve never believed that means home responsibilities fall only on her.

This time, she sighed, got up in an annoyed way, and threw the diaper away herself. That rubbed me the wrong way, and when I asked why she was upset, she said (in an angry tone), “I told you yesterday I don’t like that.”

I responded by saying she’s not my mom and that I was about to throw it away anyway. That escalated things into a bigger argument. I felt offended because it seemed like a lot of frustration over something that was about to be handled.

I left for work, came home a few hours later, made her coffee (I’m a home barista and it’s something I do regularly for her), and later we went for a walk to talk it out. We both explained our sides, and I understand where she’s coming from.

What I’m struggling with is why the annoyance had to come out the way it did. I was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and I’m trying to be more mindful and patient. I also explained to her that growing up, my mom used to get annoyed and micromanage small things, which I think contributed to my anxiety. Because of that, sighs and visible irritation over small stuff are a big trigger for me.

During the discussion, she said something along the lines of, “I’m a woman, I have emotions, sometimes I can’t control being annoyed,” and that I should learn not to argue and just let her emotions be. That part didn’t sit well with me because it felt like there was no accountability for how those emotions are expressed.

For context, she has habits that sometimes annoy me too (like leaving small bits of trash in the sink), but I usually let it go and give her the benefit of the doubt because I assume she’s tired or distracted with our son.

I love my wife, and I genuinely try to be supportive and involved. I’m not trying to “win” an argument — I’m trying to understand whether I’m being overly sensitive here, or if it’s reasonable to want less passive frustration over small, temporary things.

It increases quickly as I pour water in, but then once I stop pouring it diminishes quickly and even goes into the negative, as seen here. How on earth can I have -102 grams of coffee? I feel like I must be missing something painfully obvious, in which case I'm just an idiot, or this scale is bullshit. Either way I’m going to go crazy.

Started smoking at 17 and smoked for 2 years a pack a day. Then i went cold turkey and for 2 years a was completly free not even one cig. Then i moved into another city and i had a roomate who was smoking. Everyday we drank coffee at the balcony and he was smoking i was just sitting next to him drinking my coffee and i liied the smell. I cought myself going out with him even when i didnt want a coffee just to sit next to him and enjoy the smell. Then one day after 2 full years not smoking i asked for a cig thinking it passed enough time and i wont get back to the old habits. He gave me one and guys... The first inhale.. OMG.. It was unreal, i felt goosebumps, i could feel my brain how is going crazy from the nicotine. It was like nothing ever before. Immediately after 2 3 inhales i felt like drunk person that have never happened to me again since i first started smoking at 16. And since that night i started smoking again and here i am now at 23 quitting for life, no more excuses and falling for just 1 cig. I was so fuckin stupid. Btw that night after he gave me 1cig i went and bought whole pack and finished it in like 2 hours. 

So here i am having my first craving after 13mins of stopping (my last cig was at 12.19am local time). 

Good luck to me and stay strong guys.",5,1769038410.0,stopsmoking,2,0.78,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

This fragrance feels warm, comforting, and nostalgic in a way that’s hard to describe but instantly recognizable — like stepping into a bakery where something sweet has just come out of the oven.

At first spray, Crumb Couture opens with a soft sweetness that feels cozy rather than sugary. It’s inviting without being overpowering, and there’s something almost addictive about it. As it settles on the skin, the scent becomes more nuanced and layered, balancing that initial sweetness with a warm, slightly savory depth that keeps it from feeling juvenile. It’s the kind of fragrance that makes you keep sniffing your wrist throughout the day.

What really stands out to me is how wearable it is. Despite being inspired by a gourmand concept, it never feels heavy or overwhelming. It sits close to the skin in a way that feels intimate and personal, making it perfect for everyday wear. Whether I’m running errands, meeting friends for coffee, or winding down at home, it feels appropriate and comforting without ever trying too hard.

The longevity is surprisingly good for a scent that feels so soft and cozy. I can still smell it hours later, especially when I move or catch a warm breeze, which makes it feel like it’s part of you rather than something sitting on top of your skin.

Crumb Couture also has that rare quality of being both nostalgic and modern at the same time. It’s playful without being gimmicky and cozy without feeling boring. If you’re someone who loves warm, comforting fragrances that feel like a hug — but still want something unique and elevated — this is one worth trying.",0,1769038253.0,fragrance,0,0.33,False

I’m miserable,"I feel like I’ve been going slowly insane over the last several months simply from my unpredictable bladder. I started Zepbound in June of 2025. I am so grateful I got on it, since then I’ve lost about 40 lbs. I went from around 173 and am now around 134. I still have some to lose but I feel so much more confident. I feel healthier. I have PCOS, so Zepbound has also been helping with insulin resistance from that. About a month (July) after starting Zepbound, I went to see my doctor for frequent urination. I didn’t think it was related to Zepbound at the time. They examined me, took a urine sample and sent it to the lab for a culture. They found nothing. So they simply said there was no need for antibiotics and they didn’t know what was causing it. So I dealt with it. Over the months sometimes it would be better enough that I didn’t think about it, but then it would get worse. Some days are better than others I guess, if I’m not thinking about it a lot. It’s exhausting. Some days I have to lee every fifteen minutes or I feel as though I don’t go fully. This never happened before Zepbound. Another weird thing I noticed was my bladder seems sooo sensitive to caffeine/spicy foods. Even just a few months before I started this medication I drank a hefty amount of energy drinks in college and even then I didn’t pee this much. Now I can’t even have one energy drink or one strong coffee without it causing me to have to pee every ten minutes for hours and hours. I was tested for pre-diabetes right before stating Zepbound, it came back negative. This frequent peeing causes me stress and anxiety every single day, especially as someone with OCD, which often translates into me obsessing over  medical issues I could or couldn’t have. Not to mention it really puts a damper on my sex life with my boyfriend because I can’t do spontaneous sex anymore. I always have to make sure I pee right before. I’ve reached out to my PCP, but they have yet to get back to me about scheduling an appointment. Has anyone else on Zepbound experienced this? I genuinely am wondering if somehow I’ve developed interstitial cystitis or something related because I have no idea what else could be causing this. I also doubt it’s my PCOS because these issues didn’t start until the last several months, and obviously I’ve had PCOS for years (undiagnosed until right before Zepbound) I really just want to be seen by a doctor, but I figured I’d see if anyone on here experienced something similar.

I've been getting a lot closer to my crush recently and have been planning for the last week to ask her out. But I messed it up.

On Wednesdays, today, we both leave school from that lesson at the same time and walk out together.

I have no idea if she likes me but feel it's quite possible as she often laughs at my jokes, even awful ones and we often smile at each other. The main reason I'm unsure if she likes meis because I tried to follow her on her private instagram account (she also has a public one which I do follow her on) and she ignored it. But that was over a month ago during the winter break and I honestly feel we've got a lot closer since then.

For the last week I've been planning to ask her for coffee. Not complicated just something simple. And i jsut... didnt. We said bye, I said bye, and we went our separate ways.

My heart was racing the whole time and I was probably extremely awkward. Sooooo... I messed it up.

I know that I'll see her again and even be able to tlak to her again in the same situation we leave school together on wednesdays its the only time we have alone together and even though 1 week isn't very long until u get another opportunity, it's still long enough that I'm currently annoyed at myself and worried I'll fuck it up again.

I know I didn't really fuck up and that I have more opportunities, but I just feel really down and am wondering any ideas of what I should do and how to feel a bit better.

I also want to ask how to make sure I don't chicken out again, cause I'm worried I will.

I started off ms perfect, and would have never stopped if he hadn't been such a horrible partner. I'm talking breakfast in bed every morning. Pancakes, bacon, eggs, coffee, and toast. The works. I worked around 12 hours a day, came home, and cleaned. He worked 5 to 7 hours, went to his friends house, and got absolutely OBLITERATED every. Single. Night. I worked nights, often not leaving my job until 2am. I'd have to swing by his friends house and collect him, then spend the entire night cleaning his pee, vomiting, and diarrhea out of his clothes, my clothes, the floor, the toilet, the BED. He also grew abusive in these moments. I finally had enough and gave him a choice after 2 years of dealing with this and after a particularly scary night to get clean or get lost. But not just go get clean. I'll help you through it. He wasn't just an alcoholic, he was also a drug addict. I helped him through it. The bad and the ugly, since none of it was nice. But he remained a HORRIBLE partner. No birthday gifts, no anniversary gifts, no christmas gifts, and nothing for valentines day. We met when I was 19, and I think that's a huge reason I stayed for so long. I didn't know what love was, and I grew up loving him. Then I got pregnant. And boy was it hard. When our daughter was born he had absolutely no interest in doing anything. I took her to the doctor. I fed and bathed her. Dirty diapers? Me. He never lifted a finger saying it was my job. My first mother's day he bought me nothing. My second? Nothing. Third? Nope. On the forth mothers day he came home with 2 large gift bags, TONS of Lindors chocolates, and bag filling gifts. I was so excited. Up until now I had taken then fact he wouldn't do what he was supposed to do with the upmost grace. NEVER complained or whined. He'd say he couldn't afford anything, and I'd tell him I was just happy he was in my life. I think this a good point to say he never kissed me. He never hugged me. If I tried to be affectionate, he pulled away even as we had sex. He never took me out on dates. Anyway, I was over the moon with excitement! Finally a gift!! I rightly assumed 1 was for his mother, and 1 for me. Nope. 1 for his mother, and 1 for his PREGNANT sister. Now. Now I was mad. Now I complained. But he said I could have the left over chocolates, if there were any (I'll save you the anticipation, no there where none left.) and said if I was going to be a ""raging bitch"" I wouldn't get any. Anyway for the rest of our relationship it got worse and worse. He treated me like he didn't want me around, then beg me to stay when I tried to leave. And throughout all 16 years i wanted marriage. He would promise then never do it. Right before I left him he told me he only promised so i wouldnt leave him and he had NEVER intended to do it. Around my daughters 6 month check up, we learned she was completely blind. It was so hard. But again I was left to do everything. To the point where our daughter would sit in a dirty diaper when I went out and wouldn't bother telling him because she knew he'd say mommy will be home soon and wouldn't do anything. I learned the braille. I got her up and ready for school. I got her ready and in bed. Even when I was sick. And when I had jaw surgery. And a broken ankle. he always would get angry because I told him he had to do things a certain way. Because of her blindness, I was told from when she was a baby how important schedules and being particular would be for our daughter. You can't just get her up for school. You have to give her a half cup of chocolate milk, then play the alarms that tell her in a specific order what to do. Pants, shirt, pee, teeth, hair, socks, shoes. Yes it's annoying, but for God's sake I did it for 6 years, why get mad and call me a useless idiot, and a terrible mother in front of her? Nothing to mention he had no problem making me do it all by myself. While he peacefully slept in. Even. On. Off. Days. Then after she turn 7, the real abuse began. I started getting angry that he was an absolute perk, but he still expected me to be perfect. Why should I keep the house spotless (he has severe ocd) and give you breakfast in bed when I can't get a simple kiss? And it wasn't just that. We spent NO time together. Not watching TV, movies, games, activities, nothing. I wanted it. He just wouldn't give it to me.  We had an argument 2 months before I left him and I was so angry I decided it was best to take a walk. We argued because he told my best friend I was going crazy for no reason and needed girl time. It was insulting, but it did feel nice. But when I got home he asked me how her husbands dick tasted, insinuating I was a wh*re, then called me one. He set it up. He practically made me go. Then did that. But I was ready. This was the 6th time in 3 years he had done that. So I told him it probably tasted better then his. So I went on a walk to cool off. As I was walking down the driveway he told me that he hated me. I was incredibly hurt and said that I could be hit by a car or killed and those could be the last words he said to me. And he said, "" I'm sorry your right. I hope you get kidnapped and r*ped in all your holes by giant black guys and they throw your dead body in a ditch"". I finally left him. And thats literally a fraction of what he said or did. He also did this annoying thing where when he got mad he'd hip push me into door knobs or counters. On purpose. OK I think you have enough back story now to gage his personality. Was i perfect? No. I said a few choice words and once hit him between the eyes with a piece of raw broccoli as hard as I could after he punched me in the face. I'm not saying i was perfect. But I was loyal. I took everything in stride. I forgave ALOT and quickly. Now he's with someone else being an amazing boyfriend and I realize that everything i endured was PURE ABSUSE. he's on drugs now too. He wants to take our daughter out around town unsupervised. I told him he has to get clean, apologize for what he did, and make it up first. We dont have a court agreement as I dont want to kill him with child support for a severely disabled child. He had to pay $100 a month. That's it. But he's been such a perk I've upped it to $500 which he hasn't paid. My aitah is he says it's unfair he has to make up for the abuse, all the while telling his friends and family i was just a spoiled brat, to have his daughter all the while telling me I was always the problem. But how can I trust that abusive jerk with my precious little girl if he doesn't. I've been more then fair. He can come see her anytime for as long as he wants. He can call to. I had to put in our agreement he has to come at least once a week to see her because he wouldn't before. And he has to call everyday to talk to her because again he wouldn't. When I left he wouldn't see or talk to her for over a month. The saddest part is it didn't affect our daughter at all. She truly didn't care a bit he was gone.

1qjdvix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qjdvix,Holidays Made Here review & recommendations for next year,"I went to the holidays made here event with my mom and it was incredible! She wrote up this essay/review about the experience and I thought I would share it. 

Back in 2014 I was homeschooling my 14-year-old with an amazing homeschool charter school. Once a month we turned her work into her Education Coordinator. At several meetings she commented on how our relationship reminded her of Gilmore Girls and she recommended that we watch the show and use it as homeschooling content. She said there were a LOT of historical and cultural references that could be used as educational content to dive deeper into. So, finally we started watching. Then we started binging until we finished it. And then we started watching it again…and again…and again. We frequently quote Gilmore Girls in conversation with each other. We can make references to the show to provide context for other situations. We sing Carole King songs together. We know that “a meatball” means “it’s a mother/daughter thing” because Gilmore Girls is OUR thing. 

So, when my daughter heard that there was a Stars Hollow Gilmore Girls experience at Warner Brothers around Christmastime last year we decided we were going to go this year. As soon as the event was announced we started refreshing the website to try to get tickets. We finally had to go to bed without tickets, but the next morning before I went to work I was able to get us some. And it was well worth the lost sleep! In addition to our tour we purchased a Food Pass that allowed us to get two premium items and four snacks. 

We had to buy a Warner Brothers studio tour in order to be able to access the Holidays Made Here event. We realistically selected a 10:30 tour time because we are NOT morning people. We thought that we could skip the tour and go straight to Stars Hollow, but that plan was foiled when they informed us that we HAD to go on the tour. Fortunately, our tour guide was amazing and actually asked everyone on the tram what shows they were interested in so he could cater the tour to our interests, but it was still frustrating to sit through when it isn’t where we wanted to be. 

Once we finally arrived in Stars Hollow (which you access by going past the FRIENDS fountain) my daughter had the good sense to go straight to Lorelai’s house and scan the QR code to get us signed up for a tour. The person behind us was the last person to get in before the fast pass was filled up and closed. We raced over to Luke’s diner to do the same, but we were too late. We had to wait in line and it was a 90 minute wait. My daughter said that was probably the shortest it would be throughout the day and we should probably just do that first. The lady monitoring the line agreed so we got in line. 

The problem was that by now it was 12:30 and I hadn’t eaten or had coffee yet because I was waiting to get there to do that. So my daughter went to find food and coffee (for me because she doesn’t like coffee) while I held our place in line. I had just put my earbuds in and pulled up an audiobook on my phone when she called me saying “Luke is at the Breakfast Bar! Get out of line and RUN over here! RUN!” With the phone to my ear I left the line, climbed over the chains, and started running while shouting into the phone “Where am I going?” She guided me through town past Mrs. Kim’s Antiques and the Independence Inn to the Breakfast Bar where sure enough Luke Danes himself was making coffee at a record pace! 

As soon as I arrived my daughter took off running to the gift shop to buy a Luke plushie so she could have him sign himself. Once she got in line at the gift shop to purchase her plushie she called me and we stayed on the phone to compare how close I was to ordering and how close she was to checking out. I let the people behind me go ahead of me and she arrived back at the Breakfast Bar sweaty and out of breath just as I stepped up to the counter. We ordered coco puff iced coffee in a commemorative mug and scones with clotted cream and lemon curd. Then we stepped around to the side and watched Luke make our coffee. She asked him if he would sign her plushie and he said he was too busy but to find him later. A security guard stepped up and I thought he was going to say something about her asking for an autograph, but he asked her if she was okay because she was sweating profusely, breathing heavily, and shaking. 

I drank the coco puff coffee and she kept the mug, and it was the best coffee I had the whole day! (Actually, we shared the coco puff coffee and she enjoyed it!) Next we headed to the Dragonfly Inn. Some of the buildings are very small (or only fronts with no actual space inside), but the Dragonfly is a whole building you can go into. They have a lobby with a fake Michel, a harp (a throwback to the first episode), a gift shop, and a restaurant. You can buy tickets in advance to sit down and have a Traditional Tea or a more deluxe Emily Gilmore Tea Experience. We didn’t purchase the tea experience so we just looked longingly through the doorway with regret at the diners who had the money to spend on that extravagance. 

Then we headed to Doosey’s Market where we wandered the aisles and purchased a corn starch tin and a Doosey’s shopping basket. (I didn’t steal the corn starch and I didn’t get kissed.)

Next was Al’s Pancake World for some Chinese food. As one of my premium food items I got the sampler plate that included two egg rolls, two dumplings, vegetable chow Mein, rice, and a bulgogi taco. It was delicious! Then we went to Weston’s Bakery where I got a peppermint coffee in a light up mug. My daughter was able to get a peppermint hot chocolate in her light up mug and she also bought a Yule log which was a chocolate roll pastry. We sat on a park bench near the gazebo to eat our food. Unfortunately, she dropped her Yule log on the ground, but we brushed the fake snow off of it and ate it anyway. 🤢 It was decadent. 😋 

When we were done with our food she got a notification that it was almost time to tour Lorelai’s house so we headed over. We entered through Rory’s room and then went into the living room and out the entryway. There’s a small gift shop on the way out of the house and we found beautiful and soft flannel shirts that say “I Smell Snow” on the back so we each got one. As we lounged on Lorelai’s front porch at the end of touring her house we were lamenting the fact that we weren’t going to get to see Luke’s diner and consoling ourselves with the fact that we got to see Luke himself when a woman asked why we couldn’t go to Luke’s. We told her that we didn’t get there in time to get in the virtual line and the standby line was almost three hours long now. She invited us to come with her because she had checked in for three people and her husband and six-year-old twins were not interested at all. 

So, we headed over to Luke’s Diner with our new friend from San Ramon. We couldn’t believe our luck! We got to sit at THE table in the diner and pretend to drink coffee. My daughter got to sit at the counter on the stool that both Kirk and Lorelei consider to be the best seat until someone told her they weren’t real stools and made her get off. 🤣 We ordered real coffee from Luke’s diner. I also got a donut and my daughter got mini pancakes. The pancakes were delicious, but unfortunately we’ll never know if they were better than the donut because I was so excited that I forgot to pick my donut up from the counter. 🤦‍♀️ 

After Luke’s we headed next door to Taylor’s Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe where we purchased milkshakes. I got The Logan (Cookie Butter Shake) and she got The Lorelei (Poptart Shake). We were both pleased with our decisions. Mine was delicious. Hers was very…fruity. She loved it! (This was NOT part of the Food Passport. You can get two scoops of ice cream or a banana split from the Soda Shoppe as part of the passport, but we wanted to try the milkshakes and we weren’t disappointed.)

When we entered Stars Hollow my daughter bought a $16 scavenger hunt. There were ten clues and we had to visit the places where the clues directed us in order to get a stamp. Once we had all ten stamps we exchanged our paper for a gift. One of the places we had to go was Stars Hollow’s Video Store. So we made sure to get a picture in front of the Rory Curtain. 

Now that our tummies were full of food we headed to The Secret Bar (from A Year in the Life). We wanted to make sure we had food before alcohol and that we had alcohol long before we had to drive home. Three o’clock seemed like good timing. I got The Rory. It was on the smaller side, but I haven’t had alcohol in over a year because I didn’t know how it would mix with the Lyrica I take for my eye pain. (As it turns out I didn’t get even a tiny bit tipsy. I’ve never been a cheap date and I guess that’s still true.)The drink was kind of sweet and sour and reminded me of a berry lemon drop. I really liked it. My daughter got Founders’ Day Punch. It was a much bigger drink and tasted VERY strongly of alcohol (as Founders’ Day Punch should). We wanted to like it but neither of us did. After several tries we poured it out and she kept the cup. 

Next we toured Mrs. Kim’s Antiques and it looked just as it should - crowded and cluttered with antiques. They had recordings of Mrs. Kim playing as you walked through which made it feel very authentic - especially when she said “You break, you buy!”

Then we headed to Hewe’s Bros Garage for some funnel cake and Jalapeño chipotle mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is a snack item (not a premium item) on the food pass, but it was a generous portion and came with a piece of garlic toast. The funnel cake was greasy, as it should be, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. It also came with a cup of whipped cream. 

We decided to wait in line to “go to Hartford” to see Richard and Emily’s house. It was about a 45 minute wait. I hadn’t had any water all day and I was feeling dehydrated. \[And exhausted. And I had a weird, achy pain in my ribs. I tried sitting on the curb as we waited in line, but that didn’t do anything to help the pain. And I was soooo thirsty because coffee is delicious but nothing quenches my thirst but water.\] So I went to find some while my daughter held our place in line. After an unsuccessful search I finally asked a security guard. He suggested that I go to first aid which happened to be the building right beside where we were waiting in line. As he was telling me this he said “Oh look! It’s Mrs. Kim!” He seemed as excited as I was. (And I was particularly grateful that he pointed her out because I have face blindness. Really.) I grabbed my phone out of my pocket and snapped a picture as she walked by with an entourage of security. The area we were in was kind of empty and he and I were the only ones standing there. As she passed by she looked right at me and smiled and waved! So of course I immediately texted my daughter and then ran back towards first aid. I stopped in line to tell her, in case she didn’t get the text, and then while she was looking in the direction I pointed I hopped over the chains and went into first aid for water. I drank three glasses and then filled a fourth and took it out to my daughter who, by that point, had all the people around her in line shouting for me. She drank half the water and I downed the rest while she told me that I can’t say that I saw Mrs. Kim “over there” and then disappear. I pointed to the vicinity where I had seen her and then she appeared on a porch near us. My daughter grabbed her sharpie and a canvas Gilmore Girls bag and ran over to her. The woman in line next to us asked if I’d save her place and she followed her. My daughter took a selfie with Mrs. Kim and handed her bag and sharpie up and got her autograph! Our new friend from Miami borrowed the sharpie, but as soon as Mrs. Kim had signed my daughter’s bag her security detail swooped over to talk to her. When our new friend asked for an autograph Mrs. Kim said she couldn’t because she has arthritis. So, my daughter may have gotten the ONLY Mrs. Kim autograph that day! \[Also, as soon as I drank water my weird rib pain went away. Apparently, I don’t do well without water.\]

Richard and Emily’s house opens up to the MASSIVE painting of Richard in A Year in the Life. It also includes the sitting room and the dining room where Friday night dinners occur. 

By now it was getting dark so we headed downtown to see the lighting of the tree. There were some adorable (and talented) carolers that we later met and took turns taking pictures for each other. After the tree was lit they played scenes from the show on the walls of the buildings across the street. 

Next we went to The Black, White, and Read (the Stars Hollow movie theater) for a trivia game. It took me about halfway through the game to realize that the faster you answer the more points you get. But, honestly, as competitive as I can be, I just didn’t care because I was so happy to be sitting down. My daughter got 5th place. I got 13th and that’s only because she gave me some of the answers. We decided to stay for one more round - me to sit, her to compete. But this time instead of 20 people, the place filled up! There were at least 40 (maybe 50) people for the second round. My daughter answered EVERY question correctly! But she still got 5th place because she has dyslexia so she reads slowly. I got 10th. 

I reluctantly gave up sitting down to go see if we could get into a Town Hall meeting. We had asked about it earlier and were basically told that you had to get lucky, but to try every hour on the hour. It was 7:00pm so we tried our luck. Five other people came up right behind us, but we were told that it was full and they were just waiting for one last group of seven. We pointed out that we were technically a group of seven. He laughed and said it was really funny because his group of seven was actually a group of two and a group of five. We had to wait about five minutes before he gave up and let us in! And we got to sit again! 

At the end of the Town Hall meeting Taylor asked if there were any December birthdays and then the whole “town” sang Happy Birthday to me and Lindsay (another girl there who was turning 18). 

Before leaving we went back to the Dragonfly Inn since we were pretty excited and feeling rushed the first time. And of course we bought a few more souvenirs. We had both been looking for a throw blanket and we found our favorite there. We missed it the first time through. 

We hit the information booth and collected the prize from the scavenger hunt. If you only buy one paper at first they will let you buy additional prizes as long as you’ve completed one paper. My daughter chose fall and I chose spring for the magnets that were the prize. We also got cute keychains. 

On our way out we stopped to take pictures at The Independence Inn with 1,000 yellow daisies and at the Gazebo with all the Christmas lights. 

When we got in line to catch our tram they asked for our wristbands and sorted us by color. We walked through a Harry Potter and a Batman exhibit on the way out. We found our car fairly easily (thanks to my daughter) and traffic wasn’t bad. But \[in Santa Barbara\] we hit REALLY bad fog and it was pretty scary for about twenty minutes or so. It felt like two hours. We talked all the way home about how amazing the experience was and we sang Taylor Swift songs in between chatting. And then, \[just past Cayucos,\] about twenty minutes from home with not another car on the road a possum ran out into the road right in front of me and I hit it and it was super sad. So we took a moment (or ten) of silence while recovering from the untimely death of the possum (and yes, I know it’s an opossum), and then we got back into the spirit of the day which had been absolutely magical. ✨

I think we’re going to make it an annual tradition, but I’m not sure anything can top our first year and the 25th anniversary of Gilmore Girls!

Recommendations:

Skip the studio tour (buy Event Only tickets) to make sure you have time to see everything in Stars Hollow (or go early if you want to see the studio tour). Stars Hollow opens at 10, but we scheduled our tour for 10:30 so we didn’t get to Stars Hollow until almost 12:30.

BRING WATER!!! Coffee will NOT keep you hydrated. 

Scope out the bathrooms and don’t wait too long because there will be lines - unless you’re a man, then there won’t be a line. 

Don’t lose your wristband. It’s how they know where to take you when it’s over so you can get back to where you parked. I didn’t learn this the hard way. I wore mine all day and hardly noticed it because they let me put it on myself. At the end of the day I was glad I had it because I was completely lost. 

Wear good shoes. I wore mine out, but to be fair they were on their last leg. 

Wear sunscreen. 

Dress in layers. It’s cool in the morning, hot in the afternoon, and cool again at night. 

If you buy a Food Pass use it to get the more expensive items and then pay for the cheaper things you want. (The pizza and the Santa Burger are probably the best deals. I don’t like pizza or burgers so I chose the candy cane coffee in a souvenir mug at Weston’s and the Chinese food sampler plate from Al’s Pancake World. The Chinese food was delicious (vegetable chow Mein, rice, two egg rolls, two dumplings, and it came with a bulgogi taco too). The coffee was weak and needed cream and sugar which I couldn’t find, but the light up mug is cool.)

If you need to rest go to a Town Hall Meeting or play Trivia at the Black, White, and Read. That way you can rest and participate at the same time!

Bring extra money because you’re going to find things you want. I’m going to start saving up now for next year. (Fortunately, Mom gave me my birthday money before I left so I was able to get some fun things. Thanks Mom!)

1qjdtsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1qjdtsw/do_you_attend_other_nonsud_groups/,Do you attend other (non-SUD) groups?,"Since leaving AA, the only thing I have missed is attending some sort of meeting. Not as a way to vent when I am stressed or in crisis (I don’t think that was a healthy coping or regulating strategy for me).

But when I was all in, I really enjoyed grabbing a coffee, popping into a morning meeting, and mostly listening to other people share vulnerably and about a shared philosophy. I could come and go as I pleased without fellowshipping, but there was something about
engaging with a community in that fashion that felt like such a great way to start my day.

Today, I don’t align with, nor do I want to perpetuate 12-step organizations. And I also don’t want to join another organization for SUD; nothing against them, but it just isn’t where I am in life.

I tried to look into online options when I first left. Maybe a sangha meeting, mindfulness organizations? I am going to check out a local Quaker meeting soon.

But I am curious if anyone here has felt similarly, and what have you tried as an alternative? In person would be great because I would love to plug in to local community, but I am open to remote options where you would “feel” as if you are in group with others.

Thanks in advance! I hope you all are having amazing days.",3,1769037708.0,recoverywithoutAA,4,1.0,False
1qjdtlo,https://youtu.be/Z_-wczdLfhA?si=ZaxftvXtPZv-mESp,Seeking discomfort ultimately led me speaking to a group of high schoolers.,"At the end 2025, after conversation with complete strangers at a coffee shop, I was presented with an opportunity to speak to a group of high schoolers getting ready for the next phase of life. Initially, I was hesitant because when I had this conversation I was in the middle of the darkest period of my adulthood.

Public speaking is something I never actually saw myself doing, but in an effort to seek discomfort and help spread a positive message I decided to accept this challenge. I spent about two months preparing, allowing the emotionally raw state I was in to fuel much of the story behind this presentation.

The purpose of this message was to ease the minds of these young adults as they stepped into this next stage of their lives. The presentation highlights the emotional highs and lows that come with being human, using my own experiences as a baseline. While it was created with young adults in mind, I believe the message applies to anyone no matter the season of life you are in. This is my effort to not only help the youth, but to show that even in your rawest emotional state, life can still be beautiful and that we are all just humans. 🤙",1,1769037694.0,YesTheory,0,1.0,False

 When I was a Girl Scout, something magical happened at summer camp. For an afternoon activity, our troop leaders unloaded dozens of large cardboard boxes, cans of paint, and other supplies from the back of a van.

They had been collecting these donations from local businesses for weeks. We were to spend that afternoon cutting the box lids off and painting them to look like cars, convertibles to be specific.

We went all out. We got to paint them whatever color we wanted, drawing on handles and doors. We cut wheels out of cardboard and pinned them to the sides. We taped smaller boxes to the front to be hoods and painted them to match, used flashlights as headlights, *the works*. In a few hours a couple dozen girls had turned the outdoor pavilion at the park into a whimsical custom car lot.

The reason came at night. After dinner around the campfire, but before lights out in our tents, we were told to grab our pillows and sleeping bags and meet back at our cars. Our troop leaders lined them up in rows facing one direction, and instructed us to set up a comfy nest inside our car and wait...

Within a few minutes a white sheet was hung and a projector started playing the movie *Grease* for us! We gasped. One minute we were eating burnt hot dogs and then next we were at the drive-in! Little girls giggled and sang along while eating the cookies and popcorn that were handed out. It’s one of my favorite movie memories till this day.

This was the kind of event that changed how I wanted to live my life, mostly because it involved three of my favorite things: camping, girls, and movies. But more importantly, it taught me that with a little creativity and effort, you can make the most mundane things in life not only better, but incredibly special.

This idea didn’t cost much. Everything was donated, and I’m sure the movie and projector came from the local library or school. But the cost had nothing to do with the whimsy and magic of that night.

It meant thinking differently about what a movie can be, what an event it can become. And I realized at a young age that luxury and quality experience wasn’t about money, but imagination. Money was the consolation prize for people that had to purchase entertainment because they were not capable of making it from scratch.

I don’t know what person came up with the drive-in idea, but they were absolute geniuses. Everyone involved had a great time. The tired kids at the end of a long day of camp were contained, entertained, and content enough to allow the troop leaders (probably all in their southern thirties) to sit back and relax, too.

Till this day, if I can make the everyday special like this. I do. It’s my whole vibe.

When I first got out of college and started working a “real” job, I used to love driving to a cozy independent book store and buying a fancy coffee on the weekends. But it was never about purchasing books or coffee, it was about trying to feel like I was back at that cardboard drive-in again. Trying to discover the hardcover that transported me somewhere else, or changed my mind, or taught me something new. Making an whole day about adding another tome to my private library and celebrating what it held inside was the point.

I so looked forward to the excitement of perusing stacks, reading back covers, and asking the staff for suggestions. I finally earned enough money to be able to buy one copy of any book I wanted, a dream of mine as a child.

I’d buy the kind of coffee I could never make back at home, something with shots of espresso and foamed milk. It made me feel so grown and decadent. If the shop I found didn’t have a cafe, it was fun to explore a few city blocks and find one. Watch people, pet dogs, sit in a park or just enjoy being a part of the community.

I live alone on a farm now, and my lifestyle is very different than it was out of college as a young professional. I am not going to go into detail about my current financial situation, (you can [read about that on the About page](https://coldantlerfarm.substack.com/about)), but let’s just say book store/cafe trips are a rare treat these days. They only happen once a year after my annual cancer screening in Glens Falls.

DAVE at dusk after chores

But if you think this farmhouse is some destitute place, you would be very mistaken. I have built a home where the everyday is always special.

My biggest luxury is time. I refuse to even own a microwave because the idea of having to rush heating something up disgusts me. I never want a life that requires haste in my home. And while the furniture is used and the appliances are old; my life is ridiculously rich.

Mornings here are slow, with good coffee and embers coaxed into fire. When I start my day outdoors with the animals it is in good sheepskin-lined boots and warm wool, all of it second hand but quality you can’t even buy today. I walk outside to my world of hay and firewood, feed and water rounds, horse blankets and egg collecting, and return to the work of art and words. The pay is shit. The life is gold.

After chores I soak my feet in scented salt and herbs. I set a good thick towel on the heating rack my friend Katie found at Goodwill for my birthday, and while it warms up I line the shower floor with dried herbs, scented oil, and hang dried eucalyptus I grew at the shower head to fill it with luxury. I turn down the lights, light candles, play music I can sing or think along with, and take my damn time.

  
Everything here is special, more so the more common and mundane it is. When being warm is a hard-earned comfort, you better believe things like movie nights are still an event to behold.

When I am going to watch a movie, it is not a passive act anymore like it was when I was depressed, loafing in front of a computer screen. It is an *event.*

I pull out my prize projector screen (which is 100-years-old collapsible portable marvel I found at the free section of the dump last year!) and set up speakers and make jiffy pop on the stove and serve it in red-and-white striped popcorn boxes.

It feels like a cinematic experience - the volume, the hum of the projector, mindlessly grabbing the last buttery pieces at the bottom of the cardboard holder.

I used to half-watch on my computer screen. I used to doomscroll the news just in case something horrific happened exactly when I decided to watch Jurassic Park again. I charge the phone in another room now. I feel like the kid watching Grease in a box. It is wonderful.

Since I live for a living, and managed to do so for over a decade now, I have gotten better at it. I’m damn proud of how scrappy I’ve been. My life is very much this hut on chicken legs in the woods—magical place of wild things and foolish hope—but that doesn’t mean I still don’t miss those book store outings. I’m an American, after all. We are practically trained to consume. And even if I don’t miss the money beyond survival and my dream of solvency, I do miss the trip out of the house to be around books and people.

So, I am doing what I have always done. I am opening a book store cafe here, at the farm, and I encourage you to do the same.

I am a book collector. Always have been. I read, but not nearly as much as I collect. I have always been this way. I want paper. If your information comes from any source of electricity, it isn’t dependable. It isn’t dependable out here in the mountains, where power outages are as normal as thunderstorms, and it isn’t dependable looking at our collective future on the planet.

Holding printed books always felt more real to me. I fear no organized clutter. I have been collecting over three decades now. This house contains around 2,000 books, 700+ in the three rooms I am looking at right now. I live in a library. A small one, but still, access to more titles than I could read if I spent 4+hours a day doing just that.

I also have a stove-top espresso maker. [A vintage Bellman](https://ebay.us/m/M1AmcS), an Italian coffee pressure cooker/milk steamer that a friend gave me when cleaning out her mother’s house during a move. It creates several shots of amazing espresso and comes with a steaming element, exactly like in a coffee shop. I can make a vanilla latte, put it in my favorite mug, and start “shopping” whenever I want.

If I can make a night at the movies part of my living room I can do the same with a book store. So I make a fancy coffee. I take the time, and make it with care. I add extra flavor and draw a heart in the foam. I put on a favorite record, grab a tote bag, and walk around my many shelves, stacks, and rooms finding a hidden gem I haven’t touched since someone lent it to me in Knoxville, or got it in a swap in college.

I have books from when I lived in Idaho, collections of mountain horror stories and true crime. I have endless fantasy and fiction titles. I can fly with dragons or join the Fellowship in Rivendell. I can pick up any smutty romance novel for kicks, or start learning more about the Civil War.

There are endless titles on farming, from Wendell Berry to modern goat-keeping guides. There is so much to read right here. And with Taylor playing on the turntable, steam swirling from my mug, and four titles waiting for me to set them on the end table by my recliner, a cat ready to join me under a heated blanket on my lap… nowhere to be, no one who needs me, just an hour or two to get lost in words.

I know I can’t afford to get in my car and drive to Manchester and spend $60 on two hardcovers and a cappuccino, but I have spent my life creating something better than that at home. My winter may be spent mostly at this farm, but it is *spent well*. I am falling in love with the small patchwork decisions to make every moment richer, as opposed to trudging through my second half of life waiting for weekends and vacations on credit cards. We were not meant to live like that. We were not meant to heat dinner in three minutes on high.

And if the home gets too confining there is a hawk that needs to fly and hunt, a horse that needs a brush and walk through the pines, a farm to tend, a wild winter pond to drill a hole and try ice fishing or go skating on. I have built a life that feels so wealthy, and[ all it cost was giving up the desire for more money than I need](https://coldantlerfarm.substack.com/p/want-less-need-more-053).

If you have a coffee maker, a bookshelf of neglected spines, a cat, and a chair - you too can visit the Winter Book Shoppe. Dogs are allowed. Refills are free. And the only limit to the whimsy is your choice of passport, anything written down and within reach is possible. Middle Earth to the Battle of the Little Round Top.

And after a few visits to my Book Shoppe this winter, what was once a luxury I thought I had lost became a celebration of the decision for a quiet life, and a million pages waiting to take me anywhere I want to go.

I’m still painting boxes, still pretending the world is what I want it to be. It got me this far, and while I can’t tell if that’s something you envy or pity; I do not care. I am too busy preparing for an Unexpected Party and cloaks hung on the hooks by the door of friends coming in from the cold.

Was only gonna do 72 but I felt good so decided to carry on. Started Saturday night at 7pm, no prior build up or reduced intake. Just kind of went for it lol. 

Just sparkling water and black coffee. 

M,43, 6’2”. I started at 126.5 kg, finished at 119kg. My goal is somewhere around 110kg. 
Hunger wasn’t an issue surprisingly, the biggest problem I had was flavor. Or lack of it.  I detest plain black coffee. Water is boring. I was clammering for any kind of flavor!  
Ever since Covid my taste has changed, (lost my smell for nearly 2 years and my taste for a year) I need stuff with strong flavors. This was the hardest part for me.  

Was debating to go for 5 whole days /120 hrs but I’ve got a physically busy day tomorrow so called it 100hours. 

Think I’m gonna start a regular 18:6 at the beginning of February.   

Now off to have some eggs. 💪🏻

1qjdlmd,https://i.redd.it/yqno7pfpbseg1.jpeg,My Bestie Sacrifices Her V-Card to 'Heal' My Husband While I Hit My Peak with Her Man,"I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.


There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.


I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.


Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.


Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]


""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""


I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.


The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.


My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.


My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.


""Rita... we can...""


""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.


""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""


Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.


""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""


I stepped back.


""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""


Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""


I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""


""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""


Gina's face went ghost white.


She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.


Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.


""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.


I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""


Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.


""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""


Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.


""Gina, get up first.""


I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""


She looked up at me hopefully.


I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""


Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.


""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""


I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.


What a shameless thing to say.


""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""


Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""


""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.


""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""


Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.


I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""


""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.


Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.


I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""


""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""


Oliver's deep voice filled the room.


Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.


Chapter 2


Footsteps echoed from the hallway.


I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.


Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.


His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.


""Bro...""


Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.


Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""


I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""


Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.


""Honey, this isn't what you think...""


""Shut up.""


Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.


I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.


I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.


But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.


""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.


Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.


This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.


Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.


Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.


After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.


My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.


After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""


No one answered.


""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.


Even I jumped.


Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""


Three years.


Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.


So he'd been lying to me from day one.


All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.


I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:


""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""


Milo kept his head down.


""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.


Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""


""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.


""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""


Milo went pale as a ghost.


Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""


I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""


If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.


I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""


Oliver nodded and turned to leave.


""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.


I turned back with the sweetest smile:


""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""


""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""


""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.


Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.


Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.


""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""


Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.


But Oliver didn't even glance her way.


""No way.""


Chapter 3


""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""


Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.


I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.


This plot development is so melodramatic.


""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""


Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.


My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""


I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""


When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.


""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""


I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.


The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""


Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""


""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.


""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""


Gina's mom's face turned bright red.


""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""


I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""


She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""


I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""


""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""


""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""


""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""


All my colleagues gasped.


Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""


I pulled out my phone.


""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""


She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""


I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""


""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""


She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""


I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""


Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.


My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.


Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""


I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""


Back in my office, I texted Oliver:


\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]


Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]


Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[


Oliver: \[Thanks.\]


Looking at my phone screen, I couldn't help thinking life was full of surprises.

ex-Military Guy says he saw Giant Urinals and Toilets a thousand feet (300+ meters) underground in a secret location in Denver, Colorado, USA were meant for possibly Alien Beings or Sasquatches 10 feet tall and larger!

THE ORIGINAL STORY (Reposted with Permission):

Here is a URINAL ANECDOTE from an ex-U.S. Military person who I was able imbibe with about once every year or so with some tasty 25 year old Scotch during the late-1990's within an area that encompasses at or nearby Denver, Colorado, USA.

As he got a tad more open-mouthed during one story time, he had an interesting tale about his time posted at a nearby military industrial controls and industrial electronics repair and service depot. This job of his meant he had to drive pretty much throughout Colorado, Kansas and Wyoming which was his assigned territory for electronics repair and servicing.

These were mostly unclassified but still important systems and he dutifully went about day in day out for half-a-decade until he went to E7 and then onwards and upwards to E9 military service pay grades (i.e. a decent salary at the time!) until he eventually booted himself out and got a really high paying Pacific Northwest Civvy Electronics Design job.

Now one day, he was sent to a local place in Denver and had to do a fiber optics line repair job which was in a secured facility and he needed a full time escort since he did not have an S (Secret) or TS (Top Secret) area access clearance. With his big repair dolly in tow, my friend was moving down towards the elevator systems with his escort until the guard was notified of a minor security incident due to a belligerent and well-known local animal who had gotten into the facility necessitating said escort to leave my friend high and dry nearby the elevator.

Before leaving to deal with the animal-related incident, the Escort had evidently hastily swiped the WRONG ELEVATOR going down and said go down to meet security for further escort to his jobsite.

NOW THE STORY GETS REALLY INTERESTING!

The elevator opens up and my friend gets in with his equipment dolly and notices no buttons nor any floor numbers just the usual big red stop and emergency button. The door closes and my friend who is an aviation enthusiast and General Aviation pilot having often rented a Cessna NOTICES via his flight training that a quite severe and prolonged VERTICAL DROP is occurring and that his estimate indicates said drop is more than 1000 feet (i.e. 300+ metres!) straight down in a mere few tens of seconds!

The door opens and gets out into a very large and high empty hallway indicating to him that they are transporting very large pieces of equipment. He notices a series of male and female washrooms. Having that extra coffee in the morning, he is quite needing to go do a number one right now! (i.e. take a pee!)

Leaving the equipment cart by door he goes into the male washroom AND IS UTTERLY SHOCKED BY WHAT HE SEES !!!

On the left side of the very large and high-ceiling washroom he see the usual mens urinals and toilets. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WASHROOM, HOWEVER, are a set of the LARGEST urinals and toilets he has ever seen and will ever see!

These Urinals are easily past the top of his head. He thinks they were around 7.5 to 8 feet or more high (2.4 meters) and THREE TIMES WIDER than normal probably around 4 feet wide (one meter+) at the base! He thinks the individual urinals were spaced about 8 feet apart (2.5 meters). He then looked into the toilet stalls which were ALSO GIGANTIC !!!

The toilet bowls themselves were at least 4 to 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter and were up to his chest (he's about 6'2"" tall or almost 2 meters) . The piping going to the toilet bowls were a full foot in diameter (30 cm) which means a LOT of water was needed to flush them!

He quickly supposed and estimated the persons using this HAD to be quite a bit over TEN FEET TALL (3 meters+) !!!! The sinks were also gigantic being just below his eyes but just low enough to see that the sink bowls were so large that he could use them to actually immerse himself and have a BATH!

Of course, all of this scared the crappola out of him because he suddenly realized he was in an area he wasn't supposed to be. (i.e. he was uncleared and unbadged for that secured area!) and saw things he was DEFINITELY NOT supposed to nor allowed to see!

Interestingly, there seemed to be NO security cameras anywhere in this area of the hallway and elevators. He quickly exited the washroom and was able to press a button on the elevator WITHOUT needing an access card and exited with his gear PRONTO! Again, a few tens of seconds later he was ""Back at Surface"" and after not seeing his escort, he WAITED for another security officer who should be coming by at any time. This incident took around five minutes and just a short while later the original escort did come back.

My friend wisely said nothing except that the specific elevator the guard swiped open with his access card had stayed put and wouldn't let him go anywhere so he came back out. The escort became very flustered and angry and said OH YEAH! Wrong system!

After some call codes were exchanged via a walkie talkie and an unintelligible verbal response to the escort came back over the radio, the escort nodded and then put him on the proper elevator which went down only two floors and eventually to a secured computer room in which he was monitored by the escort the entire time during the fiber optic install/repair job.

My friend never said a thing else to the escort and to this day is scared entirely to the moon about what size of person needed to use urinals and toilets that were big enough to bathe in for a normal human! He knows the area well and can now take me back there. The original elevators in this tale were all walled off with drywall in about 2013. I understand they are still there but are NOW UNUSED! It is now a fully civilian accessible area but you have to know where to look. Someone needs to do some urban spelunking (i.e. underground exploring!) to see where those elevators go nowadays!

---

My next thought after posting this, is to now IMAGINE the actual size of a Number Two Dump that would be made by such a large being that is over 10 feet (3+ meters) tall !!!

That sort of dump has got to be ENORMOUS !!! How much do they eat? What does that sort of dump look and/or smell like?

What does the female washroom look like? 

And NO it was NOT LMCO (Lockheed Martin) who was the contractor! At the time I am pretty sure it would have been an affiliated company of or a sub-contractor of the successors to EG&G (Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.) or KBR (Kellogg Brown and Root) which did a LOT of Secret/Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information work for the U.S. DOD in that era. Other than spilling SOME beans during a semi-drunken soiree of 25 year+ old Whiskey, he didn't talk about his work at all!

I am pretty sure his clearance was only Secret and THAT particular job was only for repair of administrative-centric or general base-level control computer systems so it wasn't classified very high. Remember! It was the SECURITY GUARD who actually accidentally buzzed him into onto a restricted elevator that let him GO DOWN A VERY LONG WAY!

Normally in such elevator systems, you have only about 10 to 20 seconds to get yourself into the elevator and let it sense your weight before you have to swipe a high security access card again to let yourself continue your journey (this prevents excess gear from being brought into a sensitive area!)

So the escort guard swiped him into the WRONG ELEVATOR and then WRONGFULLY went away to a separate incident/call without calling another guard over to escort him into the correct place!

Ergo, he then gets to accidentally see for one to two minutes, some giant urinals and toilets made for 10 foot tall+ aliens!

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks.

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“The Cursed”

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf.

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Had medications prescribed, I just.. wouldn’t take them. I was scared of “losing who I was cause of medication” but recently decided I wanted to actually help myself. Started my Lamotrigine maybe 2 weeks ago and have noticed a few things that are kind of bothering me and wondering if this is common at all. First is the not so alarming frequent eyelid twitching, it lasts for maybe 20-40 seconds of my eyelid just jumping slightly. It happens multiple times a day but I also am a coffee drinker, I don’t go a day without some. That could be the reason or possibly something to do with the medication, I am unsure. Second is something that is severely alarming to me and frustrating, memory loss. I can’t remember full days. This past Monday, MLK day, I have no memory of anything I did that day. It has been TWO days. It’s scary to think I just have no idea what I did with myself. Even more alarming, I can’t remember anything I did this morning between 8am-9am, I woke up at 7:30am for a fact, waiting for my roommate to leave before getting out of bed to move my laundry over to the dryer, went to look at my phone and boom it’s 9am. I was so confused and felt lost. I was hoping to have a hour of free time before leaving my apartment to go to campus for my 9:30 class but whatever happened in that hour, I have completely lost any memory of it.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”
