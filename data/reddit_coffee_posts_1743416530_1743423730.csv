1jo1tnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1jo1tnz/my_mother_always_acted_like_my_place_was_hers/,My mother always acted like my place was hers,"Saw a dumb tiktok about someone coming home and her mother decorated her whole apartment with cheap, ugly things - that sounds judgemental but I think most people would agree it was really, really bad.

And it’s stupid, but I read the comments and most people found it endearing, they felt bad for the mother, she meant well.

I don’t know, maybe it isn’t always concerning. But my mother did this to every room and place I lived in, until I was 34. She knew exactly what she could get away with, how to make control and not letting your child have agency look like being a really good, involved mother.

It clearly still affects me that my mother’s cover clearly works very well. People still go: that’s so cute, she’s just trying to help. When my mother came to visit when I moved out, she only came to rearrange my furniture. She’d walk in and start dragging a closet to the other side of the room. Her shitty boyfriend would make me feel guilty when she brought things I didn’t want. I didn’t just have to be grateful, I had to feel guilty, for getting things I hated. For my bed suddenly being in a different place. For not being able to find anything. For her going through personal things. For her criticizing everything.

In my early 20s I got a new place and worked so hard to make it perfect, and I worked extra hard for when my mother came to visit - I thought I could prevent her from being who she was by doing that. Of course she walked in and immediately began moving my dining table. (It’s slowly beginning to make me laugh now, which I feel is a victory) She’d never sit down, have a coffee, talk to me, say my place looks nice, how was I doing, nothing, not a word. She just walked in and criticized everything and took control and didn’t talk to me. While I stood there, awkwardly, uncomfortably.

And that time, it broke me. I’d worked so hard, and it had made no difference. No compliments, only critique, and then all my hard work was undone before my eyes. For the first time I told her to stop. And I didn’t back down when she didn’t listen. What did that lead to? An insane temper tantrum, crying, yelling, and then she stormed out. Leaving a mess she’d created. Then she told everyone I’d been mean to her, dramatic, I’d picked a fight for no reason. She was like a toddler, upset I wouldn’t let her paint on the walls - my walls.

Years later, she didn’t remember her behaviour, of course. She only remembered I’d been mean and too sensitive and difficult.

I always cared about my surroundings, but maybe all of this made it more intense. I’m an artist, I care about how things look, a lot. She’d always say that: you’re so particular, you have a specific taste(doesn’t everyone?). I also have OCD - surprise, as a result of the lack of control as a child. And I’m pissed off now that she acted like I was the problem. As if I was the weird one for wanting to be in charge in my own place.

I’m no contact, and there are still so many moments where I notice how my brain’s been programmed. The last time she came over, she wanted to look in the drawers in my bedroom - obviously probably the most private place in anyone’s home. I had to stand in front of them to stop her. I still have to remind myself that I can have private things, I don’t have to figure out clever ways to hide everything. Because I don’t have to fear anyone looking through it.

Sometimes I’m shocked my furniture is still in the same place when I wake up. It was always chaos with her. Growing up, she’d move the furniture constantly, wanted to paint another wall, remove a door, redo the kitchen, you never knew what you’d wake up to or come home to. And the fact that that continued in what should’ve been my safe spaces once I moved out means I never felt settled and safe. Now, I love that nothing moves, only very occasionally - and then it’s my choice. I know exactly where everything is, I have breakfast in the same place every day, I can count on my apartment to be there, as I left it. I can breathe.

I also hid my diaries very well, and all my books about trauma & abuse & sex. Before she same over, I’d scan my books to see if there was anything I needed to hide. I remember hiding ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ the last time. I didn’t want the looks, comments, criticism, gossip to the rest of the family. It genuinely makes me emotional that all my books are on display now. I don’t feel scared, ashamed, of any of it.

And in the first months of NC I constantly looked at my apartment through her eyes - what would she criticize, how could I prevent being judged. A crack in the wall, a stain in the carpet, a tiny bit of mess, I looked at it as if I was her. Felt the shame, because that’s what I needed to feel to protect myself.

And then in the middle of doing that, I’d suddenly remember I didn’t have to. And the weight off my shoulders in that moment, jesus. The relief, the joy. Now I’ve intentionally not fixed some things just because I can. To tell my brain I’m safe. My apartment is mine, and any place I’ll move to will be mine, it’s finally over.",1,1743423563.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1jo1ndx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1jo1ndx/ohio_eviction_after_death_of_owner/,Ohio eviction after death of owner,"Hi, and thanks for reading.  A very long story, shortened.   My step grandpa moved in a homeless young woman he met about a year ago.  She worked at McDonalds, and he was part of the morning coffee drinking men.

She preyed on him, a beautify blonde.  He let her move In with him, to help cook and clean while she got on her feet.   Fast forward 1 month later- in a drug induced rage she took the keys out of his scooter when it was parked very close to his lift recliner.  He could not get out of the chair, she jumped up on the arms of the chair and ended up breaking the tall lamp that was behind it.   The cops took her that day for DV and entrapment (it was a different word on the court paperwork).   She calls him from jail and gives him the sob story… wants to marry him….  He goes to the court house and drops the charges.  She comes back.

Over the course of the next 6 months there are NUMEROUS police visits to his house.   The family is enraged that he dropped the charges.   

Her house cleaning abilities were lacking and grandpa fell in the bathroom and broke his hip.  In the mean time she goes to jail for child support and he pays her back support to get her out.   She goes back to the house and he checks himself out of the rehab unit before the doctor even cleared him to put any weight on the leg.

He is now fully dependent on his scooter.  The home health agency witnessed her rage and told grandpa they quit.   A previous home health agency then came back.  God love that nurse- as she stood toe to toe with the girl.  Both home health agencies report elderly abuse.   The girl is arrested again for DV and a restraining order issued.   

Late in 2024- the girl goes to jail for breaking the restraining order (thanks to that home health nurse) and grandpa goes to the er complaining of pain in his ribs from his “girlfriend” hitting him.  They xray his ribs and send him home.   1 week later he has a new 911 complaint where they found he had an infection and transferred him to a larger hospital.  

There they find a laceration to the bone in his elbow that is infected.   He has a wound pump, pic line, and transferred to a nursing home.  

Grandpa died from sepsis.  The girl has been told for a month to leave the house.  She insists that grandpa told her she could live there forever and that she could have a vehicle of his.  The house is not paid off and will need some work before it can be listed for sale.  Formal eviction paperwork is being filled this week, but my step dad wants to start moving his dad’s stuff (what is left that isn’t broken) out of the house, since we know of the drug addiction and do not trust that she will not destroy anything.   

I told him to stop paying the electric since grandpa is gone and just play stupid-

But I do not think he can take possessions.

There was no lease, was supposed to be temporary.",1,1743422993.0,Ask_Lawyers,1,1.0,False

Need your suggestions for content and mostly on English"," Car wheels turned towards hill side road of Coorg. Maya lowered the car window to enjoy the fresh breeze with coffee scent. After making several turns, she reached her new house, which she bought for lease for 2 years. She climbed out of her blue polo hatchback. She was wearing black tee shirt and sandal color pant just ending above knees exposing her yellowish legs to the sun. she kept her blue hand bag by the side of the corridor and looked around the garden in front of her home. Our neighbor looks smart and stylish said a man in 60s, She doesn’t look like a new doctor, she looked like a model with oval face, small nose, fleshy lips, enough don’t praise too much Mom will become angry said his daughter Deepa. Deepa invited Mala to her home and gave some tea, you can wait till your luggage comes said Deepa. This is my dad Manu and My Mom Sara. Mala greeted both. I heard the old tent items were in house only, will she come back asked Maya. You are asking about Julie, she was good girl, don’t know what happened, it’s been 3 years she disappeared. What about your family asked Manu. My Ex husband was in UK, we got divorced recently said Maya. I am sorry, you look young said Deepa. Deepa was not married yet; she is 42 worried Sara; you are asked Sara. I am 32 now will be 33 in 2 months. You can get all the items nearby, diverted Deepa. Truck sound disturbed their conversation, the house owner came with key, sorry we got late said the truck driver. Mani the main guy with big biceps and big body in the group of 5 men ordered them, to keep all items in the place. She scanned Maya from head to toe every time while he carried items in the home.  You have strong hands she complimented by tapping her arms while giving the money. I am Mani, you can ask me anything, I am a locality, he grinned. Maya scanned her new home, the white tiles, gray and blue mixed walls, rock solid stairs leading to upstairs. A big hall was filled with furniture, the side of the entrance, to the left of the hall is the bedroom. The right of the hall is empty, back of the hall is the space for kitchen. She took the stairs, there is the space for one king size coat, there was a closed Steel Bero, a big painting of one king on the wall. She opened the window to the east it leads to the lake view which she admired while entering the home, she smiled at the light glittering in the water. She opened the north side window; she could see Deepa’s home. She could see Manu’s shadow from there. She tried to open the Bero which is near to that window, she opened after some struggle, it was empty. There was secret rack, she placed hand in it, she found a locket in it. Her gaze on the locket was disturbed by the calling bell, She came down and opened the stairs, Mani gave milk pocket and lighter, anything you need he asked no I am fine she told. He grinned again, she called him,where are Julie items. He came inside the home dashing her hand internationally. He guided her to the room to the right of kitchen. It is length occupying kitchen and room in the right. Its filled with many items,I will check thanks said Maya. He came close to her making her move one step back, he blushed while leaving. She boiled some milk and gave it to Deepa home, around 5 in the evening. She walked around the village, her home is the first while entering the village, others are blank spaces, next home was Deepa then after some plantations followed by some adjacent homes and it continues. She continued walking after around 1km, when the lake is is over, she found on temple and some temples. The house in there is much closer than before. She entered one phone shop and bought one charger. How are you said a voice from before, hello uncle said Maya, how is everything asked the old man ya all good thanks for everything she held his hands while saying. Serve well for our people, do you need anything here asked the old man. I need one laptop service man. I will ask Alex to come tomorrow, he know all about computers. She did some cooking and lied in bed. She didn’t get sleep, she felt hot,She recapped the day events Deepa family and Mani the way they eyes Skirted flashed into her eyes. She came to the hall and tried to switch the laptop she got from Julie’s room. She examined the locket it was made of plantium the locket it pentagon shaped. Bell sound made her chill,it was 11 in the night ,She looked throw the window.It was Mani ,I kept my tools here he said. She opened the door, the moon light shinned on Maya’s night dress. What is that tattoo meaning he touched her shoulder ,you can take your took box she stretched her hand towards sofa. Mani took the tools,What is chain ,he reached for it in the tepa. I don’t know can you please leave she asked. Mani touched the edges of pentagon locket and played with his hands,See you tomorrow,handling the chain to her. See you around he said and left the house. She heard after some seconds closing the door,She opened it ,he was not there ,so fast he left she taught,she glanced left and tight of the entrance,she smelled blood,she saw few before she process it to her brain it disappeared. She felt a shiver in the shine ,closed the door and ran into the blanket and closed her eyes tightly.


Meeting:

Maya was having her breakfast around 10.30am, she was wearing same gray petticoat which she wore last night. She didn’t sleep well; she had some mild migraine. Bell rang, she got irritated on hearing that sound. She opened the door, a handsome young man was standing in the doorway, their eyes meet for few seconds they are absolute silence, the earth has stopped rotation according to them. Maya smiled a little, said hi, I am Alex ,I came for Computer service. I am maya, you are Maya he blurted. You are alluring said Alex. She blushed. She took the laptop to the hall; Deepa came in when Alex was repairing. I will make tea for you both said Maya, they are sipping tea in the hall with doors open. What are you doing asked Maya, I am a freelancer do some projects said Alex. He doesn’t do anything; he just finished college , not going for job. he is only one not admired in the town after completing a degree. I don’t like to work for another implored Alex. She is elder than you said Deepa, No said Alex and Maya. They both blushed while sipping tea. Alex joined Maya in the kitchen cleaned his cup, Thanks for the nice tea, he grinned. I will leave now said Deepa. Alex and Maya were speaking about various things while he worked on laptop. Why Deepa is not married she asked, there was a family curse it seems ,who ever marries her first will die ,that was happening for generations he concluded. I need to take this to my place; I will come again with working laptop. She nodded. I have seen you somewhere, I feel like we know each other well said Alex. Maybe you like elder women teased Maya, I am old enough to like, he flirted. Maya pinched his arm; you are too thin said Maya. While Alex was in the doorway sun was in high and hot light glared her vision. Her heart pounded fast when he was in steps. Can you bring cctv 2 one for here and one in hall asked Maya. Are you ok asked Maya, noticing the tense in her voice. You are lean than me gain weight diverted Maya, I can lift 60kg , I am 74 she said, I can lift up to 80kg both blushed while Alex made a turn in his Ninga green bike. She closed the door and she felt the same connection as Alex said, they know each other for long time. She rearranged few things in her home. She wore the chain in her neck and checked in mirror for some time, the silver-colored platinum in yellowish neck locked good but rose gold could be great She thought. She took bath and dressed in sleeve less blown full skirt with V neck. She noticed the chain has changed into Rose gold now. Her mind wonders around Mani, now chain. She came out the home for fresh air, she stood near the garden examining grass, some useless trees. The rose tress which died long back, what happened kid asked Manu who was sitting near his home fence. I want someone to clear this waste and plant some new trees she asked. I shall arrange some men said Manu. Thanks uncle, Can I ask you something she added. Are you afraid of any family curse asked Manu, before he could answer, Deepa came there and greeted Maya, nice dress and matching chain she said. Julie used to have similar one in Silver she told. Maya eyes scanned for her locket; Can I see the locket. She wished to change into cross not to get humiliated as she stole Julie’s chain. Maya went near the fence preparing for the lie its Her’s may be same design. Maya took the lock out, it was orange gem in rectangular shape now, Deepa touched at the base of it, touching the top of Maya’s breast, I like this design, she touched again. Manu penetrated his eyes in the V section and touched her top breast while examining the chain. Julie’s had a hand locket. Hand locket exclaimed Maya ,yes like its going to take something. She took out the chain and placed in tepa staring at it, in ocean of thought. She arranged in order, Mani, chain , Deepa and Manu being a pervert she discarded the last one. Other two things and who is Julie filled her mind. Around 6pm Alex entered in his bike. He gave a laptop, now its opening and contents are there. Tomorrow I can fit the cctv he said. She nodded. Can we go for short walk, sure said the Alex. They both walked in the streets touching their shoulders, I wish to sit in this lake for some time sure he said. Alex guided her, they crossed few silver oak and pepper planatations. There more they come closer to the lake, more cool air it blows. She arranged some woods and sat in it. Maya eyes ran throw the silver lake, closing red sun and purple clouds. This is beautiful said she. Yes but there are so many ants, he cleared some place and sat down next to her. So which specialist you are asked Alex. I am general medicine. How long you been here. I did college here so for past 4 years I am here said Alex. This place has lot of mysterious I believe said Maya. Yes I heard few people disappear, few have seen some strange devils and so on. Mani would have vanished as Julie stirred her mind. You know mani, strong man with height around 6 feet, I know him. He interpreted her before she describes him. She blushed a little. Alex rose with help of her knee to get up, she rose from the wood. Its late he said. His home is near to the temple, you want any work from him asked Alex. I want clasp her big biceps, like this clasping Alex, hands. He is married with two kids he teased Maya. Maya prayed him to be safe. Maya released her hands and walked with some distance to Mani’s home but Alex was as usual walked teasing her. They reached Mani home asked about Mani, his wife told he didn’t come home till yesterday. Its usual he goes missing for days she added. Maya was not happy with her answer. They reached the home around 9pm. She asked him to wait, she prepared some dinner in half an hour and they both had. Maya held his hands can you stay here. What excited him, no I mean for company said Maya. I feel fear to sleep alone today. I can give you company everyday he grinned. She hugged him, the warmness in their body increased their pleasure. Their faces came close inhaling each other breath. He leaned to kiss her, she turned her face, end up kissing her check. I like you but will not have sex with you today, air coming out of her mouth raised his blood in his lower part. I have a plan for you she said releasing the lock of their hug. She took the syrup white cup; fill this she said. Fill this with blood she told .I like you, but I don’t believe in madness he said. She blushed pushing her face to the right. She kissed on his checks, go to the bathroom and fill this with white fluid, she winked. Today we sleep in this bed and fill each time you get arousal said Maya. I like this game; I will kiss on lips each time before and after, I go to bathroom said Alex. She bitted her nail like a child and nodded yes. He kissed her drinking the nectar on her lips for a minute, she pushed him for breath. I will change my dress she said. He drained his balls. They both lay down face to face in bed. He peered through her yellow petticoat, she raised his chin, you focus on only face today. Next week you can come down, Next week he grimaced. I must go to hospital tomorrow. They talked till 3 am. Around 8 in the morning Maya woke him with coffee, you should be tired. You cheated me said Maya, we kissed more than 25 times but you come only 6 times teased Maya, placing hand around his shoulder and kissed him.

Gold is surging.  
The dollar is sinking.  
Food is getting expensive.  
AI is lurking.  
The whole system trembles - like a bridge made of pencils and duct tape.

We’ve built systems of belief to define value—  
but somewhere along the way,  
they made us forget their origin:  
**us.**

People.  
Creating. Growing. Producing. Teaching. Listening. Caring.  
**Holding the world together.**

As financial markets spiral into uncertainty,  
and the future feels scripted by algorithms and fear—  
we need to remember:

**Our coffee is still great.**  
**Our machines still run.**  
**Our hands still hold.**  
**Our vision creates the future.**

So what now?  
Wait for someone to “fix the economy”?  
Flee to gold, crypto, stock food and *fear*?

Or…  
can we allow ourselves to envision something greater than that?  
Something that truly sets a benchmark for what we are?   
And **WHAT IF**:  
This value wasn’t printed— but lived?  
What if trust didn’t require a bank— just a new angle of belief?  
**Keeping** ***almost*** **everything the same… but shifting the way it affects us.**

What if the system doesn’t need fixing— only reconnection?

**The waters are shifting and a new current is possible.**  
**It can start quietly.**  
**It can start small.**

1jo1etx,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1jo1etx/personal_review_just_got_my_eufy_s1_pro_very_happy/,Personal review: Just got my Eufy S1 Pro - very happy!,"After reading countless posts in this sub-reddit, we bought an Eufy S1 Pro. Our, ""Bobo"" is working since last Friday — and we’re already totally in love with it.

From the moment we set it up, it was clear: this isn’t just another robot vacuum. It’s a quiet genius on wheels. Within minutes, it had mapped our home with eerie precision, learning every nook, every cranny, and every forgotten corner under the sofa. Watching it work feels a bit like magic — or at least like living in a slightly more futuristic version of our own home.

Setting it up was a breeze. The Eufy app guided us through the process step by step — super intuitive and smooth. After connecting the robot to our Wi-Fi, the app immediately suggested a firmware update, which installed in under 5 minutes. It was reassuring to see that everything was up-to-date before the first cleaning run. From there, we could customize cleaning zones, set schedules, and even adjust suction and water levels — all with just a few taps.

The mopping function is another standout feature. Instead of traditional cloth pads or oscillating elements, the S1 Pro uses a wide roller mop that spans nearly the entire width of the device. This roller applies consistent pressure (up to 1 kg) to tackle everyday dirt and even dried-on stains like coffee or ketchup with impressive efficiency. What really sets it apart is the continuous self-cleaning system: fresh water is constantly fed to the roller, while dirty water is simultaneously extracted into a separate tank. This ensures that the roller stays clean throughout the entire mopping process — so your floors are always being wiped with clean water, not just spreading dirt around.

In our home, we have mostly hardwood floors and very little to no carpet, and that’s exactly where the S1 Pro truly shines. The roller mop glides smoothly across the parquet, leaving behind a spotless, evenly cleaned surface — without streaks, puddles, or missed spots. It's an ideal match for anyone with sensitive flooring who still wants that deep-clean feel every day.

The suction power? Great. It picks up everything — from dust bunnies to hair — and leaves the floors looking like we just cleaned them ourselves (except we didn’t). And thanks to the auto-empty station, we barely have to think about it. It just does its job — reliably, efficiently, and without complaint.

Object detection was another reason we chose the S1 Pro — and it hasn't disappointed. With two kids in the house, there’s always something on the floor: LEGO bricks, socks, toy cars, or that one lone crayon under the table. The S1 Pro handles it all with impressive care. Thanks to its advanced AI and 3D camera system, it can accurately recognize and avoid small everyday obstacles without getting stuck or dragging them around. It’s not just convenient — it’s peace of mind. We don’t have to do a pre-cleaning sweep before sending it off. It just knows what to avoid and keeps going.

What we love most is how effortless it all feels. No more arguing over who’s going to vacuum, no more dragging a heavy cleaner from room to room. The Eufy S1 Pro has quietly become a part of our daily routine — and we wouldn’t want to go back. It now runs once a day, and the result is genuinely noticeable: the entire apartment just feels cleaner. There’s less dust, fewer crumbs under the table, and an overall sense of freshness we didn’t expect to achieve so easily.

And if you have kids, you know the drill: sand in the hallway, muddy footprints, mashed-up bits of food under the dining table — it all adds up, every single day. But now? That ""little bit of chaos"" is under control. The S1 Pro takes care of it quietly and reliably, and it’s honestly hard to imagine life without it.

It might sound dramatic, but it honestly feels like we’ve upgraded our quality of life with this little machine. For anyone still on the fence: do it. You won’t regret it. Buy it.

*Just got back from doomscrolling the latest AI-generated copypasta on my FYP—absolutely wild how LLMs are churning out deepfaked NPC-core content faster than you can say ""sigma grindset."" My feed's been algorithmically hijacked by de-influencers pushing cloudflared side-hustles and crypto rug pulls, but honestly, I'm more into vibe-checking the latest AGI doomerism and debating whether post-quantum cryptography is gonna nuke Web3 before it even hits mass adoption.*

*Meanwhile, my friend just soft-launched their situationship on their alt, and the comments are pure chaos—full of parasocials and stan accounts trying to cancel them over decade-old receipts. Lowkey, I need a digital detox before my screen time spikes into the stratosphere, but the FOMO is real, and I can't ghost my Discord crew mid-raid. Anyway, brb—gotta touch grass before my mental bandwidth hits critical levels.*

  
**After that he offered to make even more extreme version of it, which I gladly accepted. So here's the more extreme version:**

*Hard relapsed into my doomloop today—my neurospicy brain got hijacked by a GPT-churned infocalypse feed, straight-up eldritch vibes. Every tab is a hallucinatory LLM soup of glitched-out prompt injections and AI slop, while my shadowbanned alt is stuck in some post-verification purgatory thanks to a botched hyperfi swap. Meanwhile, my mutuals are waging a subtweet cold war over some crypto DAOpocalypse drama, and the parasocial fallout is pure terminally-online maximalist energy.*

*On the metaverse side, my wearable threw a firmware bricked fit mid-VR sesh, leaving me hardstuck in a liminal uncanny valley of uncapped FPS uncanny horror. Tried to touch grass, but the meatspace was giving giga-L entropy—just infinite AI-generated sludgeworld aesthetics with latent diffusion facsimiles of real life. The whole vibe was so off, I had to hard-reset my vibe stack before my social battery perma-melted. Anyway, logging off before the next hyperreal psyop cooks my last remaining sanity pixels.*

**Finally, I asked it for a version that isn't just about tech neologisms and online spaces. I asked it to include some stuff from real life. And here's the result:**

*Had the most chaotic core morning—woke up in a full-blown decision fatigue spiral because my gut health was off (probably too much sludge coffee and not enough adaptogens). My room was peak goblincore disaster, but I was too in my feral era to care, so I just dry-scooped some greens powder, rawdogged a cold plunge, and hit a microdose pilates sesh to stabilize my nervous system.*

*Stepped outside and immediately got ick’d by a sidewalk takeover of loud cheugy corporate girlbosses manifesting their delulu soft-life dream in broad daylight. Meanwhile, some dude in full blokecore was loud-quitting his situationship on speakerphone—pure cringe. Tried to ground myself with some barefoot earthing, but my intrusive thoughts kept looping back to the insufferable smog-breathing normies rawdogging their burnout while doom-eating overpriced, deconstructed ‘vibes-based’ lattes.*

*Anyway, I need to go decompress with some forest bathing before I spiral into an overstim burnout and start main-charactering my own downfall.*",0,1743422130.0,EnglishLearning,1,0.25,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Maysev - Hass EP [Pilot]**  
*Recommended if you like: The Caracal Project, InsideInfo, Ratatat*  

Some of the talents I feature on here may already be quite severely underrated, but it's rare for anyone, both firmly established and freshly up-and-coming, to get even _close_ to what Alexander Lipka has been achieving with his **Maysev** project. Each and every single release sees the Ger-man raise the bar another few kilometers higher than it already had been, and his newest EP, **Hass**, on UKF's **Pilot** is no different. But first, let's fill in the blanks we've left since the last time we talked about him!

**1.1. Recap**  

Since we've already thoroughly dissected the Lipkaiser's previous EPs, [Onward on Neosignal's sibling NËU](https://redd.it/pweu7h/) and [Self-Shading on the one and only DIVIDID](https://redd.it/z6v4pd/), I'll refrain from going over his whole story for the (may)seventheeth time, but there's still plenty new stuff to comb through from 2022 onward! For instance, Alex finished that year off with two further _Secula_ collabs on the D to the IVIDID and his debut on that other Dutch uppercase label, _VISION_! However, the next two years together have only brought us another group project with the aforementioned Austrian lad remixing _Tom Finster_, a single with _Martens_, an, admittedly very cool, link-up with the one they call _Phace_, and a rework of Proxima's contender for best track title ever, _Rogue Sofa_. While Herr Lipka filled the gaps and kept his fans happy with all sorts of sample packs, production tutorials and even exclusive music on his Patreon, which became a solo mission of his in early 2024, things were rather quiet.

But then, a particularly catchy guitar riff had started making the rounds. Was it The Caracal Project? Was it Bloc Party somehow making DnB now? Then, the confirmation in the form of an eight-part ID showcase - it was Maysev! And he had clearly been _cooking_. After said sought-after dub, and an actual Caracal collab were rained down upon us as singles, we've now arrived at the conclusio of said buildup, the **Hass** EP! So, let's see what mister Libkoch has been up to all this time then, shall we?

**1.2. Hass EP**  

Wasting no time at all, Alex throws us into the deep end of incredible sound design with relentlessly looping rays of pure beauty beaming down on us on EP opener, and aforementioned long-time dub, **Left**. Once freed from this auditory onslaught, we're sliding into him effortlessly performing an incredible guitar solo on top of punchy, live-sounding drums, paired with the already-iconic riff. With the ever-present riff on our side, we make our way through the eery quietness and last bits of the buildup hype machine, before it launches into a back and forth between the deeply rumbling hard knocks of life and a flippant bass-y response, whose constant evolution through the gnarliest of sounds is only interrupted by our ever-so-catchy companion. What a joy this tune is!

Contrary to this extended player's title, we continue with more stuff I absolutely adore, on **Before You**. Featuring none other than on-album-worker Fèlix **The Caracal Project** Burnod, we are once again treated to an absolute joyride through guitar-lead electronic melodies the likes of which I haven't heard since my _Ratatat_ fanboi days. Brought into the whimsical world of the drop with four _hard_ knocks, we ride along a wave of creative sound design that is _unbelievably_ delightful, especially when the lead goes through all sorts of super-charged phases towards the latter half of it all. Not to mention that gorgeous acoustic guitar outro! With lots and lots of reverberative wonder, third stop **Cut Me Loose** breaks (get it) away from the D and the B, and instead takes us down the _House_ rabbit hole. Filtered-down, chopped-up vocals, warm bass, a lo-fi rhythm to relax and vibe to, and a truly unique, soft-mannered lead guiding us through it all - what a vibe.

As if acoustic and electronic guitars weren't enough already, **Five.One** sees Alex adding a _Flamenco guitar_ into the musical mix. Layers of chordophone action, with live-recorded drums straight out of a jamming session, all building up into a crescendo of fast-firing, unpredictably rhythmic, straight-up _hypnotising_ drumwork, on which the now-shinier-than-ever guitars strum along while threatening basses start shining through. While already quite the spectacle, Alex is not resting on these laurels and amps up the brightness of the shimmering synths, the griminess of the basses and the sheer _drip_ of the guitar work in the later parts. To counteract this snare massacre, Alex gives us another Lo-fi House type treatment on **Drown Me**, full of his chills-inducing signature vocal processing à la _Dead End_, glittery melodies, and waves of bass that burrow themselves into your brain, growing larger and larger and deeper and deeper. 

To finish this incredible journey off, we bring it back to DnB, with title track **Hass**. Featuring DIVIDID owner, cinematic soundscapes creator, feeder of two cutie pie and totally not chonky cats, one half of Negative Plus photography, one half of _June Miller_, and full-on lovely human being altogether Marc **Abis** McCann, there's already a lot to love conceptually, contrary to the title. However, I was not prepared for the intricacy of the arrangement, the masterful contrast of the analog and digital world, pitting lovely harp melodies, birds chirping and dramatic violins against glitching vocal chops, uniquely evolving synths and brash basses. From the sunny spring atmosphere of the plucky zither breakdown, the underbelly of it all grows larger and larger, until finally erupting into an continuously and aggressively rumbling earthquake, that only stops in its tracks when the synths suddenly overpower our senses, before sliding right back into it, more aggressive than ever before. Lastly, we revel in the sheer beauty of the shimmering string arrangements and the gorgeous marriage of analog and digital in one of the best, most touching outros I've heard in quite some time.

**1.3. Conclusion**  

By creatively and perfectly fusing the real with the digital, the outstanding, incredibly memorable guitar playing with the grimey basses and shimmering sound design, Maysev managed to craft an EP for the ages here. Cannot express my love for this enough.

Currently 82kg want to get to 68-70kg

My average meals a day look like this

Breakfast 7-8am
Oat milk coffee 10mls vanilla syrup 
With a banana, yoghurt or a croissant (only twice a week) I don't eat breakfast everyday but always have my coffee 

Lunch 1-2 pm
Some sort of chicken salad wrap containing 1chicken thigh 1cup lettuce 1/4 red pepper, 2 whloe slices of red onion, 1/2 tbsp light mayo and hot sauce.

35g mallow and marsh or 6 piece dark chocolate  

Dinner are usually things like (think Hf or mob) 6-8 pm

Chicken noodles 
Pasta pesto
Carrot and date salad.
Chickpea dahl
Sausage trays  bakes

Snaks usually in the evening 8-9pm
4 dark chocolate digestive or mini ice cream.  Not everyday maybe ever other.

We have a take out maybe 1 a week

Been doing this diet and tracking since Feb and I've gaining 2kg and I feel like am gaining more. Only weigh myself 1 or 2 a month.

What do I need to change more walking/ add a different exercise, change eating habits?

An insight is appreciated

1jo1cel,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents2/comments/1jo1cel/i_hate_been_a_new_mom/,i HATE been a new mom!!,"Wow I can’t believe I’m writing this but tbh I have no one to say this to. I mean if I ever say it out loud I would be judged hard.
I’ve tried to say it to my mom and my partner and oh god they told me not to say it again.
But in reality I absolutely HATE been a mom. I love my baby, she is so sweet and adorable. A really good baby so far (she is 8months).
I just miss my life and my freedom. 
I miss going out whenever I wanted, grabbing coffee or shopping, or even showering without her chasing me around and screaming most of the time.
I can’t even take a sht in peace.
I can’t plan on doing anything fun cause I would have to find a sitter for her.
Oh and the not sleep is the worse. It changes my mood. 
I used to be such a happy bright and smiley person. Now I’m mostly angry all the time, regretting been a mom.
And don’t even make me start on how my relationship dinamic has changed.
(So far I have a great partner but still IT ISNT THE SAME) 
I would never let anything bad happen to her. But if my partner and I ever separated I would give him custody. 

I know I would not be happy or capable of raising her alone. And even if I could I just don’t want to do all the work alone.
How is it far for only women to have to keep the kids?! Honestly ridiculous.
I also feel like my mood swings are up and down A LOT. Idk if it’s the hormones from having her 8 months ago or what. 
A lot of times I get angry super easily at my partner and say really mean things. 
I can go from 0 to 100.
I also have 0 sexual cravings. None. No idea why. Before that(even when I was pregnant I would be sexually active). Now I just feel ew about it. 

I don’t get why women don’t tell you how horrible been a mom actually is. 
NOW that I have a baby some other mom have say bad things about motherhood but not before! Like why won’t they warn us??! 
I hate women now for that too.
If I even got pregnant again I would not have it. Period. Idc how bad it sounds. I truly don’t. 
Becoming a mom is the biggest mistake of my life. And this short paragraph isn’t even half of the bs I’m going through.
And if other women ask me I would be try honest and tell them is horrible, I hope I don’t get judge but if they want the truth I’ll give it to them. ",2,1743421964.0,regretfulparents2,0,1.0,False

1jo17yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1jo17yq/dust_busters_or_data_collectors_whats_the_deal/,Dust Busters or Data Collectors: What’s the Deal with Robot Vacuums?,"Alright, let’s talk about those little robotic cleaning machines buzzing around your floors—**robot vacuums**. They suck up dust, dodge your dog, and save you from breaking out the old broom. But here’s the million-dollar question: **Are they secretly collecting data on us?** And if they are, how secure are these things? Let’s dig into the dirt—both literal and digital—and figure out what’s really going on with these high-tech helpers.

# The Robo Revolution: More Than Just Dust Suckers

Robot vacuums have come a long way since they first rolled onto the scene in the early 2000s. Today, they’re **smart-home superstars**, loaded with cameras, lasers, sensors, and Wi-Fi connectivity. Brands like iRobot (Roomba), Ecovacs, Roborock, and Eufy promise spotless floors with zero effort. But here’s the catch: all that fancy tech isn’t just for dodging furniture—it’s also **scooping up data** about your home and habits. So, what’s the deal? Are these robo cleaners just tidying up, or are they low-key snitches?

# Vacuuming Up Your Life: What Data Are They Grabbing?

These little dudes aren’t just picking up crumbs—they’re gathering intel. Here’s the **lowdown** on what robot vacuums can collect:

* **Home Layout**: High-end models use LIDAR (lasers) or cameras to map your house—room sizes, furniture placement, even that weird corner where you stash your gym bag.
* **Usage Patterns**: They track when you clean, how often, and which rooms get the most action. Are you a neat freak or a once-a-month warrior? They know.
* **Voice Commands**: Got a mic for Alexa or Google Assistant? It’s listening to what you say—and maybe more.
* **Images/Video**: Some, like Roomba’s J7 or Ecovacs’ Deebot X2, snap pics or record to “learn” obstacles. That could mean photos of your laundry pile—or you in your boxers.
* **Wi-Fi Info**: They connect to your network, logging details like signal strength or network names.

A single cleaning session can generate **tons of data points**, painting a creepy picture of your life. But where’s it all going, and who’s peeking at it?

# The Cloud Cruise: Where’s Your Data Headed?

Your robo vac isn’t hoarding this info in its dustbin—it’s **shipping it out**. Here’s who might be catching a ride:

* **Manufacturers**: Companies like iRobot and Ecovacs use your data for “product improvement”—think AI training to dodge pet poop better. But they’re also sitting on a goldmine.
* **Third Parties**: Some brands share “aggregated” data with partners. Ever get a targeted ad for carpet cleaner after a spill? Hmm.
* **Hackers**: Weak security means your vac could be a backdoor for creeps. More on that in a sec.
* **Big Tech**: Amazon tried buying iRobot in 2022 (deal fell through), raising eyebrows about pairing vac maps with shopping habits.

The Mozilla Foundation’s 2023 *Privacy Not Included* report slammed robot vacs, calling them **privacy nightmares**. Every brand they tested—including iRobot, Samsung, and Ecovacs—flunked hard, with vague policies and sketchy sharing habits.

# Security Speed Bumps: How Safe Are These Things?

Here’s where it gets dicey, dude. These robo vacuums aren’t Fort Knox. **Security flaws** have popped up like dust bunnies:

* **Hacking Horror Stories**: In 2024, Ecovacs Deebot X2 vacs got hacked—attackers took control of cameras and mics, spying on owners and yelling insults through speakers. One guy in Minnesota watched his vac get hijacked *twice* despite a password reset.
* **Bluetooth Blunders**: Security researcher Dennis Giese cracked Ecovacs models via Bluetooth, accessing live feeds from across the street. The fix? Still pending as of late 2024.
* **Data Leaks**: iRobot’s Roomba J7 testers had pics of their homes (including one on the toilet) leaked online in 2022 by third-party contractors. Whoops.

Most brands tout **encryption** and **updates**, but gaps remain. Ecovacs claimed a PIN protects remote access—except hackers bypassed it because the app, not the server, checks it. Roborock does better, processing some data on-device, but even they’re not bulletproof.

# Comparison Table: Privacy & Security of Top Robo Vacs

Let’s break it down, dude—here’s how some big names stack up based on what’s out there:

|**Brand**|**Collects Images/Video?**|**Cloud Storage?**|**Encryption?**|**Hacking Reports?**|**Privacy Vibes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**iRobot**|Yes (some models)|Yes|Yes|Yes (leaks)|Shaky|
|**Ecovacs**|Yes|Yes|Partial|Yes (major hacks)|Trash|
|**Roborock**|Yes (optional)|Optional|Yes|No|Decent|
|**Eufy**|Yes (some)|Yes|Yes|No|Middle Ground|
|**Shark**|Yes (some)|Yes|Yes|No|Okay|

**Takeaway**: Roborock’s got an edge with on-device options, but Ecovacs is a dumpster fire for security.

# Real-World Dust-Ups: When Robo Vacs Turn Rogue

This ain’t sci-fi—it’s real. Check these **wild examples**:

* **Roomba’s Toiletgate**: 2022 saw testers’ intimate pics (think bathroom oopsies) hit social media after iRobot shared them with Scale AI for training. Consent? Debatable.
* **Ecovacs’ Rude Awakening**: 2024 hacks had vacs screaming obscenities at owners. One dude saw his cam feed hijacked while sipping coffee—live on ABC News.
* **Battery Boom**: A Florida family’s vac caught fire in 2024, blamed on a battery glitch. Not data-related, but a reminder these things aren’t toys.

Your chill cleaning buddy can turn into a **privacy punk** fast if the wrong hands grab the wheel.

# Why So Nosy? The Cash Behind the Cleaning

Why do they care about your messy living room? **Money and power**, dude:

* **AI Training**: Photos and maps make smarter vacs—but also smarter ad targeting.
* **Data Sales**: “Anonymous” data gets sold to brokers who don’t care about your name, just your habits.
* **Control**: Weak security lets manufacturers (or hackers) remote-pilot your vac. Convenience comes with strings.

It’s a trade-off: you get clean floors, they get your life’s blueprint. In the U.S., lax privacy laws let them roll wild—Europe’s GDPR reins it in more, but not perfectly.

# Locking Down Your Robo Vacuum: Fight Back

You’re not helpless, dude. Here’s how to **keep your vac in check**:

* **Go Offline**: Pick a model that works without Wi-Fi (like some iRobots) or block it on your router. No app, no problem.
* **Check Settings**: Disable cloud uploads or camera features if you can. Ecovacs and Roborock let you tweak some stuff.
* **Updates**: Keep firmware fresh—patches fix holes (if the company bothers).
* **Dumb It Down**: Toss a cloth over the cam when it’s docked, like one hacked owner did. Low-tech win.
* **Research**: Skip brands with bad reps (looking at you, Ecovacs) and read the privacy policy—even if it’s boring as hell.

It’s not perfect—offline vacs lose mapping perks—but it’s your call: privacy or polish?

# The Final Sweep: Clean Floors, Dirty Secrets

So, what’s the deal with robot vacuums? **Yeah, they collect data**—maps, habits, even pics—and **security’s a mixed bag**. Some brands (Roborock) play it safer, while others (Ecovacs) are walking disasters. They’re awesome for lazy cleaning, but they’re also **roving spies** if you’re not careful. As of March 31, 2025, the buzz is growing—hacks are hitting headlines, and people are getting paranoid.",1,1743421535.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

I (36m) live in NY, she (29f) lives in CA - around an hour from LA. She works in San Diego. We dated about 7-8 years ago and ended up just going different directions in life due to youth, etc. We reconnected in January and had a few really great dates, went to Vegas together and I flew her to the east coast which she’d really never seen.

We speak every day, every week I send her roses. Her friends love me, her parents overwhelmingly approve of me, and for the most part I’ve been very happy. On Friday, I flew into town and spent about 12 hours in transit to show up at her job with fancy coffee for her and her coworkers. 

From that moment she “didn’t feel good” and had been sleeping on the couch because of my snoring (which has never been an issue for any partner I’ve ever had) and really just slept outside of the times where I took her out to eat. I had previously booked a honeymoon themed room at a Poconos style hotel she’d been talking about for tonight, and she mentioned to her parents at dinner that she’s thinking of bailing due to her feeling under the weather. 

Last night after dinner within about five minutes of me falling asleep she left the room due to my snoring. I’m at the end of my rope here, as I feel like I’m doing all the work and getting nothing back. Would I be the asshole for just leaving at this point?",3,1743421240.0,AITAH,12,0.8,False

Here’s a more organized and readable version of your concept, broken into sections for clarity:

The Concept: Market Socialism Operated Community Shops
The idea is to create community-owned shops (e.g., coffee shops, pizza shops, burrito shops) where employees are equal owners, splitting duties, salaries, and decision-making equally.

These shops would operate under Market Socialism principles, ensuring fairness and equality among workers.

The problem: These shops cannot start organically because traditional business models often lead to disputes over investments, control, and hierarchy.

Why Charity Crowdfunding is Essential
To establish Market Socialist-operated shops, the project must begin with Philanthropic Charity Crowdfunding. This approach eliminates investment-related conflicts and ensures a foundation where all employees are equal.

Example of potential conflicts in traditional startups:

Investors fight over location, name, menu, or uniform colors.

Disputes arise over unequal contributions (e.g., “I put $27k; you only put $23k!”).

Crowdfunding avoids these issues by creating a platform where employees are recruited as equals from the start.

How It Works
Fundraising:

Gather 5,000 Americans, each contributing $200, to raise $1 million.

Use the funds to purchase:

2 houses ($300k total) for employee housing.

6 cars ($200k total) for transportation.

$500k cash to start the shops (e.g., pizza shop, coffee shop, burrito shop).

Recruitment:

Use social media to vote for hardworking citizens in the community (e.g., Taco Bell employees earning minimum wage but demonstrating strong work ethic).

Offer these citizens the opportunity to leave their current jobs and become worker-owners of the new shop.

Living Arrangements:

Each recruited worker receives:

1 car (paid for by the community).

1 room in one of the houses (each house has 3 rooms for a total of 6 workers).

Workers live rent-free while saving money to eventually buy their own homes.

The Goal
Workers are encouraged to save money while enjoying equal ownership of their workplace and living arrangements.

Once all 6 workers move out to buy their own homes, the houses remain in community ownership for future projects.

The experiment continues with new crowdfunding campaigns (e.g., $750k instead of $1 million if housing is no longer needed).

Scaling the Experiment
Start with one shop (e.g., pizza shop) and expand to others (coffee shop, burrito shop) in the same community.

As more shops open, workers can promote the movement as free individuals who have benefited from Market Socialism principles.

Future crowdfunding campaigns can be adjusted based on needs:

Example: 5,000 people × $150 = $750k for a burger shop without housing costs.

Long-Term Vision
The experiment aims to uplift hardworking citizens stuck in minimum-wage jobs by giving them ownership opportunities.

By creating a network of community-owned shops, these citizens can escape capitalist hierarchies like Taco Bell or Starbucks and achieve financial independence.

The movement grows as more shops open, inspiring others to join and contribute to this enlightened path.",2,1743421034.0,Market_Socialism,0,1.0,False

1jo11jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jo11jk/when_does_the_hope_run_out/,When does the hope run out?,"Hi, my name is John, male 42. I think im only really here for a glimmer of hope. Looking for that way out of the potential darkness I have right now.

John before June 2024 was in good health, played sports, had a good job, own home, car, holidays, loving wife and supportive family. However since that time, John today has become semi-reclusive, tired all the time, missing joy in his life and has almost constant lower abdominal pain, pre-dominantly on the lower right side but also extending across the middle under the belly button. He has cancelled holidays, work commitments, family events. 

What happened to John?

June 2024 - Was sick at work, probably stomach bug or food poisoning. Projectile vomit, nausea, exhausted, lethargy. Took about a week to feel better. Thought that was the end of it. 

July 2024 - Still feeling a bit rough. GP prescribed Ciprofloxacin. Seemed to help for a short time but was still experiencing, fatigue, diarrhea, lack of energy

August 2024 - Endoscopy, only note was mild gastritis

September - FCT noted as being 'mildly elevated' but returned to normal a week later. Also had a CT scan with contrast which showed no issues except a very small gallstone

Oct 2024 Dec 2024 - Things seemed to get slightly better but still experiencing manageable diarrhea but tiredness still present

Feb 2025 - Prescribed and completed 7 day course of Metrozonidole from GP. After this, things started to go really south. Was bedbound for about 3 weeks. Completely lost appetite (and 8kg in weight). Diarrhea, complete loss of motivation and significant lower abdominal pain where I could be curled up in bed with a hot water bottle. Was prescribed Amtrypllin 10mg per day which helped but unfortunately made my head a bit funny so I stopped. 

March 2025 - Colonoscopy, MRI and Endoscopy. All clear except a very small erosion in terminal ileum. Awaiting biopsy results in about 2 weeks but general feeling is there is nothing obvious to worry about 

Additional notes:

Over the course of the last 9 months I have had at least 10 blood tests which have all been 'normal'. Many stool samples which, with the exception of the September result, have all been normal. 

  
Today my poops are relatively normal but pain is a constant and every day I wake up feeling like ive been in a fight. I am eating a careful diet, no spicy, coffee etc, no alchohol, fizzy drinks. My cholesterol is back to normal which is positive.

Im just asking anyone online if this sounds like them and how did they get through it? Ive read a lot of these reddits about potential post infectious IBS and how this can take months, if not years to resolve. I also understand there may be other conditions (like just normal IBS or IBD). Not looking for a diagnosis but an offer of experience from others about their journey so I might be able to relate it to mine.

I have had numerous GP's, Gastro's, friends and relatives who all say things will get better, it just might take time. The difficulty I am having is believing them. I do not feel like I am improving day by day or week by week and I struggle to get through most days due to lack of sleep and lack of energy. It feels like my core strength is being sucked out of me due to the pain in my lower abdomen. 

If I broke my arm, I would put it in a splint, suck it up for 6 weeks knowing that it will heal in that time. Here, I am putting my gut in a splint but not knowing whether it will improve or even if it will improve. How long is it before I start looking at ways of managing a chronic condition or keep the hope that symptoms might ease off and I can start being normal John?

Even with the combined strength of both of us we could not get the door open. And neither the window for that matter. 

Luckily, I still had my phone, even if the battery was running low, and so did Lana so we could text and she assured us that she was fine. Julie had locked her in as well but she didn't say or do anything else. 

We contemplated calling for help but Lana was against it. This situation was delicate, something none of us were able to fully grasp. But we shared the sinking feeling that getting help and leaving this town wasn't an option for now.

Not if whatever mystery fueled this place could harm us even if we left. Especially *if* we left. To understand any of this, we needed another moment alone with Finn. 

Finally, fatigue took the reins and Younes and I both went to sleep. The following morning I awoke from a sweet smell, a mixture of cinnamon and vanilla. Groggily, I got out of bed and walked to the door; to my surprise, it was unlocked again. 

I let Younes sleep and left the room as silently as I could. I passed an open door and my heart skipped a bit when I saw Finn inside. He was sitting on the end of an enormous bed, his expression empty. When he noticed me, he blinked a few times. 

There were so many things on my mind but at that moment I didn't know what to say. He looked so broken. 

""She's gone. Went to the market,"" he muttered.

""So we can talk?"" I asked. 

""I think so. I'm never completely sure.""

I stepped inside and closed the door behind me.

""Where were you last night?"" I tried to keep my voice low but I couldn't hide the anger in it. ""Your *wife* threatened Lana, locked her and us up in our rooms. Finn, why on earth would you come back here? Why would you get married to a person like that? And what are these people? Are they even human? I swear they move with insane speed, they are always smiling, they don't know how normal conversations work. Jeez, I know this is your family but-. God, are you like them too? Were you just hiding it?""

He flinched like I'd struck him.

When he spoke, his voice was barely more than a whisper.

""I didn't want to marry her. I didn't want to marry *any* woman.. It was the only way to calm it down and I figured it was done. But now it wants us to have a child and shit, I just couldn't go through with that. I'm sure that's why it started targeting you again."" 

The rawness in his voice and the familiar look in his eyes took away some of my anger. He never meant to harm us, he was a victim of the circumstances he grew up in. Whatever those were in reality. 

""What is *it*?""

He looked around and shook his head so I sat down next to him and put an arm around his shoulder. 

""Hey, you saved us back then, right?"" I asked quietly. ""Keeping an eye on Lana, locking me and Younes in our rooms.""

""I don't remember much of what happened those days but either way I was the reason you were targeted in the first place.""

I kept racking my brain, trying to come up with a logical explanation for it all. Perhaps I was drugged, and that caused my illness. The accident Younes escaped could have been them too. But how would they've gotten Lana to jump from a building?

""So, what now? You can't become a father and doom an innocent being to all this just to stop it,"" I sighed.

""I think it's too late for that either way. Now that you've touched our soil, it won't want you to leave.""

""And we can't call for help, can we?""

He shook his head. 

""You can reach the outside world but you risk dooming anyone you contact.""

The sound of laughter reached through the house and we both became rigid. I quickly got up and held my ear to the door.

""I think Younes and Lana are up.""

\--

They were not only up, but already sitting in the dining room while Julie filled their cups with coffee. They both wore the same clothes Julie had given them yesterday. There was no hostility in their eyes, to an outsider it could appear that they were actually having fun. 

Julie scrunched her nose when she spotted me.

""You're not dressed.""

I looked down at myself, still wearing those ridiculous pyjamas. 

""You should get dressed and join us for dinner. Julie wants to show us around town after,"" Younes said in a cheerful voice. 

""Breakfast, not dinner,"" Lana corrected.

They all burst out in laughter. 

""Shouldn't we go check on the car instead?"" I asked.

""That can wait until later. I'm sure Mr. Fabel will let us know once it's done,"" Lana said and Julie gave her an approving grin. Reluctantly, I turned back upstairs while Finn joined them. 

\--

After a very strange breakfast where my friends acted like terribly written characters in a sitcom, we started our stroll to the town center. Finn didn't join us, claiming he had to go to work. Whatever that meant in this place. 

Julie kept chatting Lana up, telling her all the different baby names she'd come up with and I felt sick just thinking about them bringing a new child into this hell. 

I walked a few paces behind them, next to a silent Younes, while I took in the surroundings. This town felt as though it had been washed in an unnatural glow, as if a vibrant filter had been placed over reality, making everything appear more vivid than it should. But the scariest part was the residents. Every single eye turned to us and followed even as we kept walking. Even the children kept staring at us with empty expressions.

I picked up my pace and joined my friends, who seemed oblivious to the staring and with Julie right there, I didn't dare to mention it. 

The town center consisted of an open space where a market was still going on. Julie led us away from it and toward some kind of official building with a fountain out front. 

""This is where we were married and every other couple for that matter. It would be just perfect for you too, you know,"" she smiled at Lana, who beamed right back at her.

I hadn't seen Lana in years before yesterday, could she be engaged? 

I was about to ask just that when Julie's eyes landed on me.

""Noah dear, you look quite queasy. Is the sun bothering you? You can head back home and take a quick nap before lunch if you like.""

I wanted to tell her that I was actually feeling fine but then I got an idea. With everyone else gone, I might be able to rifle through their stuff and find some kind of clue on how we might get out of this.

""Yeah, actually, that sounds like a good idea. If you guys don't mind?"" I directed that question to my friends, who eyed me with slight confusion.

""If that's what you want. You sure you'll be alright?"" Younes asked. 

I wondered if I should ask one of them to come with me, to help me look, but there was no way I'd leave either of them alone with Julie. 

""Yeah, I'll be fine.""

\--

When I got to Finn's street, I could swear I heard a monotonous thumping behind me. 

I slowly turned my head to steal a glance behind. The sight that met my eyes sent a jolt through me - I stumbled back, lost my footing, and hit the ground, scraping my knee. But the pain was the last thing on my mind. 

Dozens of people were standing behind me, simply staring at me with their eyes and mouths wide open.

""Are you quite alright, young man?"" An elderly woman asked, but I ignored her as I quickly got back to my feet and hurried to the house.

Only when I reached it did I dare another glance back, only to see that they were still there. Watching me.  

I quickly opened the door, which was unlocked and disappeared inside. 

My breathing came in shallow gasps and I thought about my parents. My loving parents, who were nothing like these monsters that raised Finn. I had to get out of here. For them. 

I stumbled into the living room, only to be greeted by the faces of Mr. and Mrs. Fabel. As if I'd conjured them with my thoughts.

And while they had bright smiles plastered on their faces, they did not look happy. 

""A little birdy whispered to us that you were being difficult,"" Mr. Fabel said, taking a step closer toward me.

""What's about to happen is no punishment, dead. Only a reminder,"" his wife continued.

I took a couple steps back. 

""Don't touch me,"" I hissed.

They both shook their heads in unison.

""There will be no need for us to do that. Our guide will give you the taste you so desperately need.""

I needed to get out. Quickly. But for some reason, I couldn't move my feet. At least, until my vision became blurry. Everything went dark, and I slumped to the ground. All my senses slowly shut down. I had a vague sense that someone was carrying me. 

I felt hot air on my face and it took me all I had to force my eyes open. 

I wish I hadn't. 

The Fabels' breath, from their heads pressed together just inches from my face, filled the air. Then one of them reached a hand between us and closed my eyelids with their fingers. 

\--

""Noah?"" 

The sound was muffled, I wasn't sure who was calling me.

""Noah, open your eyes.""

Something cold splashed my face and I jerked awake. For a split second, I let myself believe that I was home. That it was all a dream. But when I saw Finn's face above mine, I knew it wasn't. 

A big crease had formed on his forehead and he was shaking. I tried to move, but I felt exhausted. Like I'd just run a marathon. 

And the pain was back. 

The worms in my brain, the stone in my throat, but it was even worse than the last times. Tears streamed down Finn's face. 

""What happened to me?"" I croaked out. 

He didn't answer.

""Finn?""

""You're sick again. But it's worse than before. Your skin, it-,"" he didn't finish the sentence. 

But when I lifted my arm, I understood. The black craters, the ones I'd seen on my tongue years ago were now spread all over my arms. And from the pain I felt, I could only assume they didn't end there.  

It felt as if I was slowly being eaten by an invisible creature. One that would take bites out of me until I ceased to exist.

""I'll fix this,"" he whispered. ""I promise. No matter what I have to do. I'll-,""

""Don't,"" I interrupted him. ""Just tell them I'll be good now. I'll behave.""

I think Finn kept talking to me but I couldn't really hear him as my consciousness slowly slipped again. 

\--

I couldn't say what time it was when I woke up again. Finn was gone, but I heard a commotion from downstairs. The heaviness in my body had lifted and the pain was gone. I dared a look at my arms and to my relief found only my regular skin.

The door swung open and Younes entered, eyeing me with a look I couldn't quite place. 

""Were you sleeping this entire time?"" He asked, clearly oblivious to what I'd just been through.

""Did you just get back?"" I asked. It felt like I'd been out for a whole day. ""Nevermind, I need to tell you something.""

""Can it wait a second? There's something *we* need to tell you. Come in, honey.""

Lana entered the room and took his hand in hers.

""We think it's best we let this all go and find a life for ourselves here.""

My heart pounded like a drum.

""*What*?""

""If we leave, Lana might off herself. What's the solution? Locking her up in a cell where she can't harm herself? And what's mine? The car could crash on the way back, killing me. And you might get sicker and sicker until you wish you were dead. At least, here we can act out a normal life. Maybe get a house for ourselves.""

""What about our jobs back home? Friends? Family? Our entire *lives*?""

""The best we can do for our friends and family is staying far away from them."" 

""How are you both so calm?""

They both shrugged.

""This is our fate and fate can't be changed.""",2,1743420274.0,Likeeyedid,0,1.0,False

I was leaving the library when I walked past this girl who was—no exaggeration—the perfect mix of cute and cool. Like, how-do-you-even-exist levels of attractive. For a split second, I swear she glanced at my football jersey (or maybe I just imagined it because I wanted her to notice?). Either way, my brain short-circuited, and I kept walking like a NPC with broken dialogue options.

Now I’m stuck wondering:

Was that a missed connection, or am I just romanticizing a random moment?

If I see her again, do I go with a casual “Hey, weren’t you at the library the other day?” or just awkwardly spill my coffee near her as a cry for help?

Seriously though—how do you approach someone in a low-key place like the library without making it weird? I’d love to hear your success stories (or hilarious failures) for inspiration.

And if by some miracle she’s reading this: Yes, I do know way too much about football. No, I do not know how to talk to pretty girls without overthinking. Let’s fix that?",4,1743419583.0,paruluniversity,1,1.0,False

First off, I'm a hot chocolate person, and don't enjoy coffee all that much unless it's from a café... which is strange considering I've just bought a pretty expensive breville barista express (long story short, I had a budget to set up a home office from my work, and the entire budget went to this... because you know... why not? I have all the other home office stuff already)

I've been googling around and watching a whole bunch of YouTube videos, and realizing that it's simultaneously more complicated and simpler than I thought. I've been learning so much, it's more than a little overwhelming.

Before i receive my machine and set it up though, I've got a few questions considering this journey I'm about to go on:

1. Should I bother investing in tools like distributors and spring loaded tampers before actually getting good at making a cup of espresso?
2. I've seen some people placing filter paper in the bottom of the porta filter. Some people buy a sheet and cut them out. Are these regular coffee filters one might find for those drip coffee machines?
3. I've seen people saying that the built in grinder of the breville isn't the greatest, but it ""serves the purpose"". Should I be looking into buying a better grinder?
4. In my country, finding ""freshly roasted"" coffee isn't easy, or even common. Should I just buy some bulk green coffee and a small roaster, or won't it matter all that much?",0,1743419304.0,espresso,4,0.5,False

Because that’s how I’ve felt for the past two days. Constantly. I just can’t shake the feeling, and I don’t know what to do, or how I can make it stop. I’ve never posted on something like this before, but at this point I’m willing to try anything, I’m desperate for some advice.

I’ll take you back to the start, or what I assume to be the start of it all. 

I live a fairly ordinary life. I’m a 21 year old guy, living on his own in a bit of a rundown flat, commuting to work on the train everyday. This doesn’t leave me a lot of spare time for anything else, really, because my commute is an hour each way. My days consist of waking up at 6:30, getting dressed, walking to the train station, catching the train, walking to work, working, and then doing the same process in reverse. That’s it. I don’t really have any friends to hang out with, and I’m not exactly on the best terms with my family (for reasons I won’t go into here), soI sit on my own each evening, watching TV or playing video games. I keep myself to myself, and get on with my life.

Now, you may be thinking that my life sounds pretty miserable or boring, but to me, it’s perfect. I’ve always been a bit of a loner, so my daily routine suits me perfectly, and I’ve been living happily like this for the past year. 

That is, until a dream I had 3 nights ago (Wednesday).

Like all dreams, it didn’t have a beginning. I was simply there, no recollection of opening my eyes in this new place, or how I’d got there. I was standing in the middle of a large grassy field. I could feel the wind blowing gently on my face, and I ran my hand through the large grass strands that stretched up from the ground to meet me. I looked around, and realized I was alone. The field was empty, save for a lone tree, a few hundred feet away from me. I started to make my way over to it, not knowing why I was doing so, but just having the feeling that there was something there I needed to see. As I got closer, I could make out the faint shape of letters carved into the wood. From where I was standing, I couldn’t quite make out what they were, and so I decided to get closer for a better look.

And that’s when I felt it for the first time. Even in my dream, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and a chill went down my spine. I could tell that I was no longer alone. Someone else was here, watching me. I span myself around, and caught the first glimpse of them. They were far away, so far away that all of their features were obscured by the distance. All I could make out was a featureless shadow, standing in the grass, watching me. I stood for what seemed like hours, just staring back at them, unsure of what to do. 

And then they started to run.

The figure lurched forwards with impossible speed, heading straight for me. Instinctively, I span back around and began to take off in the opposite direction, towards the tree. The words on the tree were becoming clearer, but I still couldn't make out what they were yet. As I ran through the grass, trying desperately not to trip on the uneven terrain, I glanced behind me to ascertain how much distance I had left between me and my pursuer.

Not much. 

It had impossible speed, coming at me like a steam train, closing the gap between us in a matter of seconds. It would only be a few more until it was on me. I began to panic and tried to pick up my pace, but as is the curse of most dreams, I was running at a snail's pace. My foot slipped, and I was sent crashing to the ground. I flipped over just in time to see my pursuer pouncing on top of me. I could see now that it was not the distance that had caused it to look featureless. It was featureless. Just a black hole of pure energy in the shape of a person. It brought its ‘hands’ up to my face, placing them on either side of my eyes. I began to cry and plead with it, begging it not to hurt me. It didn’t listen. Instead, it plunged it’s dark thumbs into my eye sockets, blocking my vision and causing me to scream out in pain.

And then I was awake, screaming still.

I scanned my room, looking for the creature, but I was alone.

“Fucking stupid nightmare.” I muttered to myself as I led back down, trying to slow my breathing and calm myself down. I managed to eventually get back to sleep, and awoke at 6:30 to my normal alarm buzzing next to me. I got up and began to get ready for work as normal, when my mind drifted back to my nightmare. I tried to think of the letters I had seen carved into the wood of the tree, but all I could remember were,

“Erom ecno niks ym no enihs”

There was still a lot more carved into it, but in my panic I couldn’t make out the rest. 

“Whatever,” I thought to myself.

I left my building and began my walk to the train station, the thoughts of my dream already beginning to fade from my memory, chalked up t o nothing more than a stupid dream caused by a scary video game or something. 

You’d be surprised by how quiet the streets are in a big town at 7am. No one trying to sell you things, no one bumping into you or pushing past, most of the time it’s just me and the road. Nice and quiet. It was the same on Thursday morning, but as I got closer to the train station, I began to get a familiar feeling. The hairs on the back of my neck began to stand up, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around slowly, hoping to just see another commuter making their way to work behind me.

The street was still clear, with no sign of anyone else having been there other than me. I breathed a sigh of relief and shook my head, thinking that the previous night’s dream was just playing tricks on my mind. However, as I began to turn my head back in the direction I was traveling, my eyes caught a glimpse of someone, standing behind a lamppost. Only half of their body was visible, the other half hidden behind the metal pole. They were standing about 200 meters from me, so I couldn’t easily make out any of their features. All I could see was an eye, glistening in the reflection of the streetlight. Whoever it was was watching me, motionless. I stood for a moment, debating what to do.

I brought my hands up to my face and momentarily covered my eyes as I rubbed them. When I removed my hands once more, the figure was gone.

I let out a faint laugh, cursing myself for being so stupid as to believe someone was watching me. It was most likely just someone making their way to work, just like me. They had momentarily stopped to look at me, the only other person on the street, just as I had done to them. And then they had moved on, got on with their day, just as I had to do now as well.

The rest of the day went by as usual, with nothing out of the ordinary to report, that is, until I was on the way home. I got on the train home as I normally would, and we set off back towards my home town. There are a number of stops between where the train begins and where it ends, with the carriages steadily becoming quieter and quieter as the journey progresses. By the time it reaches the final stop, I am normally the only person left in the carriage, which I am more than okay with, as it means no one has to sit next to me.

As the train slowed to ready itself for the next station, I felt my hairs stand on end once more. I sighed at myself. 

“Not again” I thought, wishing that my brain would stop playing tricks on me. It was clearly hanging onto the dream more than I had thought, and was not letting not go any time soon. The train slowed to a halt, and the doors hissed open to allow any passengers to get off. It was a quiet station in the evening, and so the platform was deserted, save for the shape of a lone person standing at the far end of the platform. It had been raining, and so my window was covered in thin streams of water, obscuring the figure and making it seem as though they were a strange shape - almost as if you were looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror. Their body seemed twisted and deformed, no longer even resembling the shape of a human. The thought of it sent more chills down my spine, and as the doors hissed shut and the train pulled off, I silently thanked the gods that we weren’t delayed.

When I climbed into bed that night, I prayed that my brain wouldn’t force me to experience another one of its concoctions, and that I would just be able to forget the whole thing had ever happened. But my mind, once again, had other plans.

I was standing in the middle of a crowded street, streams of people passing around me. I glanced down and found that I was dressed in my work clothes, consisting of a shirt, tie and smart pants. I felt at the tie, and let it slip through my fingers. The silk felt so real. I looked back up to the street and found myself surrounded by staring faces. Everyone had stopped what they were doing and were staring at me, their mouths hanging slightly open in a look of shock and awe. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. All those sat in coffee shops, in the flats above me, and in cars all stared at me through the glass of their windows, the same expressions resting on their faces. They were unmoving, unbreathing, unfeeling. All emission had drained from them, as though they were statues.

And then as one, they took a step closer. Faces squished against the windows as those inside the buildings tried to get closer, seemingly unaware there was something in the way. I began to panic as the space between me and the crowd lessened as they moved closer once more. They were a single organism, moving together as though the individual bodies were simply limbs controlled by one malevolent force. There was now only a meter between me and the nearest person, and this gap was closed before I was able to react. I felt hands grabbing at me, ripping my shirt, grasping my tie and pulling it, tightening it’s grip around my throat and cutting off my oxygen supply. 

“Please… stop!” I choked, pushing and shoving at the mass of bodies, desperate to get them away. I was met with a deafening reply, as every mouth began chanting the same thing. My memory of what they were saying is pretty hazy, but from what I can remember, it sounded something like,
“Uy ma e, em era uy”

The voices were dark, inhuman. I felt as though my eardrums would burst at the volume of the chanting, the vibrations reverberating through my body. I was being crushed from all sides, my clothes being ripped off, my skin being ripped at and scratched by unrelenting hands. I cried out in pain, and as with the previous night, I was awake, still screaming.

I looked at my hands and found that I was shaking. My ears were ringing, as though they had been exposed to a high volume in the night. I picked up my phone and checked the time - 5:47. 

“Screw it.” I thought to myself, there wasn’t a chance I was going back to sleep after that. I climbed out of bed and walked to my bathroom. I splashed cold water onto my face in an attempt to wake myself up and make me think rationally about the situation. All that had really happened was I had had a couple of bad dreams, and seen two people obscured by various things. That was it. Nothing unnatural about that. I breathed slower now, the rational side of my brain slowly beginning to take hold.

As I brought my head back up to look at myself in the mirror, I noticed a shadow standing in my shower, obscured by the shower curtain that had been pulled across. I gasped and my blood ran cold. I was frozen by fear as I stared into the reflection. Whoever was in the shower was facing the mirror as well, their shape clearly visible. They were unmoving, as still as a statue.

I slowly turned myself around to face the curtain, the shape of the intruder still visible. Tears began to form in my eyes as I reached out a hand. I grasped the fabric, and in one quick motion, yanked the curtain across to expose the figure.

It was empty. I let out an audible mix of relief and fear as I brought my shaking hands up to my head.

I went into work early that day.

I couldn’t really focus properly on what I was doing, my mind filled with thoughts of my follower. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. I had definitely seen a figure standing in my bathroom, watching me. It had been in my flat. Feet away from me.

I traveled home as usual, thankfully not having the feeling I was being watched at all. I stepped off the train onto the platform and followed the few others that had got off down the nearby stairs that led to the exit. The stairs lead down to a small tunnel under the station, lit by crappy lights that flicker occasionally. At the end of the tunnel is a corner where a set of stairs live, leading up to the entrance of the station. Next to this corner is a mirror, placed onto the wall near the ceiling, allowing you to see if anyone is about to turn the corner, preventing you from bumping into them. As I neared the corner, I glanced up at the mirror, and found that there was someone standing just round it. They were wearing a shirt that seemed to be two sizes too small for them and a tie that looked as though it was choking them. A mass of lumpy skin bulged through the gaps between the shirt’s buttons. I stopped in my tracks, just before the corner. I looked into the mirror closer, and even though they were hunched over, I could see that the person’s head was deformed, as though it was just piles of skin thrown together clumsily. I could hear it wheezing, as if the simple act of breathing was causing it immense pain. I could feel tears beginning to well in my eyes again as I felt my hairs stand on end once more.

“Shit, shit shit.” I whispered to myself, trying to hype myself up just enough to make the three steps to the turn. Every part of my body wanted to turn around and run in the opposite direction, but I resisted. I was startled by a shout from behind me, and turned around to see the cause, only to find a group of kids running down the steps, cheering and joking with each other. I turned back to face the mirror, and found that the figure was gone again. Just like in the morning. I took a few shaky steps forward and turned the corner, confirming that there was no one there.

And then last night, I had the worst dream yet.

I found myself standing back in my bathroom, brushing my teeth. I could taste the mint of the toothpaste as I brushed, spitting out the foam into the sink below. I brought my head back up and stared at myself in the mirror. I was met with a twisted, deformed version of myself, smiling maniacally at me. I stepped backwards, and he stepped forwards, his head protruding from the glass as though it were an open window. A crooked, broken hand reached up onto the frame, and in one smooth motion, the body slithered out pulling itself through. It flopped onto the sink, smacking its head onto the porcelain and causing it to bleed. I fell backwards as I retreated, stumbling into the bathtub. I sat and watched in horror as the being got to its feet, the bones cracking as it twisted it’s broken body around to face me. The mirror-me continued to smile as he began to move towards me. At this point, I was paralyzed with fear as he began the same chant as the previous night.

“Uy ma e, em era uy. Uy ma e, em era uy.”

“Please… please don’t hurt me!” I cried as the shaking, twisted hands reached out towards my face. I turned my face away from the creature and braced myself for the inevitable. 

When I opened them again, I was back in my bed. My breathing was heavy, and my head hurt. I groaned as I sat up. I raised my hand and rested it on my forehead, trying to nurse the pain. When I made contact with my skin, I found that I was covered in something sticky. I pulled my hand away and grabbed my phone, shining the torch onto my palm.

It was covered in blood.

I felt my forehead again and could feel a deep cut in the flesh. I winced in pain as I touched it, and realized that the wound was extremely fresh. I tried my best to clean the wound in the bathroom, and wrapped a bandage from my first aid kit around my head.

In the hallway outside my flat, the lights are controlled by a movement sensor. It’s pretty bad, and only stays on for a few seconds, even if you keep moving. As I walk back to my bedroom, I notice that the light is on outside. I walk up to the door, and double check the lock. The light goes off as I get nearer, but as I turn away from the door, I see it switch back on, the light glowing under the door. 

I move back into my bedroom, and open my laptop. That is where I am now, writing this, asking for help. I don’t know what to do, or how I can stop this. All I know is that whatever is following me, it’s getting closer, more confident. I know it is outside my door, the hair on the back of my neck is on end.

1jo0jx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jo0jx3/experience_not_ordering_from_espresso_coffee_shop/,Experience (not) ordering from Espresso Coffee Shop,"So, generally speaking I'm not that fan of publicly bashing online shops. If its a big brand it won't matter at all, and if its a small retailer/reseller feel bad doing so. Things go south, mistakes can happen, some things are out of our control, yadda yadda. However, when this stuff happens, I feel its important to take accountability if possible, and be upfront and clear, specially in such a hobby where many of the products we are buying (whether we like it or not) are outrageously priced and borderline luxurious to most people outside of this echo chamber.

I don't expect my Amazon order, number 10374727 for the day, to be personally addressed and hand delivered, but I do expect some of that when ordering a 1000€ espresso machine.

ECS has not done anything even remotely close to that. They have been **dead silent, unhelpful, and trying to put the blame on others as much as possible.** On top of that, they keep being unclear and shady about their stock up to this day, **still taking orders for a product they have a backlog from, at least, December.**

**That's it, thats the TL;DR**. They are legit, offer good prices, and assuming things are in stock and everything goes right, you get your product. But if tht doesn't happen, its a terrible experience.

***Full context:***

I happily own a second hand Profitec Go in blue that I very much love, but couldn't really get around the color. On Nov 29 2024, Black Friday sale was happening on ECS and decided to pull the trigger for a brand new Go in black as I had someone willing to take the blue off of me, and it was a steal at 750€.

It was a backorder as I was kinda late to pull the trigger and the sale had been going for a week. **First issue**,  the black variant said ""1-2 weeks delivery"" on their page, but the product description has been manually changed to ""Available from mid January"". Went ahead and contacted them, who informed be about how mid Jan was indeed the new date, and that it was possible that I could even be left out of that batch and have to wait for the next one. So at this point, **they were already backlogged, still taking orders with a set backlog ""date"", and unless you contact them, you didn't know it was quite likely this date wouldn't hold. And to top it off, they were ""uncertain"" whether you would fit in the first batch or not.** I said, sure, and placed my order that same day. **I was charged the full price of the machine that same day**. In that same convo, I tried to be a bit pushy and get a date assuming the wrost. The reply I got was **""maybe 4 weeks""**.

Mid January comes by, goes by, and its now mid February. **Not. A. Single. Word. from them.** I didn't know if i made it in the first backorder batch or not, if my order was already delayed, or if something else happened. Nothing. At some point during this month I start checking the site every now and then, with the Go on their page now saying ""March 2025"" and me thinking **surely, an order from November, which their sales person estimated 4 weeks after the January batch, should drop earlier than this one I can order right now.** Also, at some point, my order status, which you can only check on their site, and has no email notification on status change or anything, changes to ""awaiting stock (Paid)"". Cool, thanks for (not) letting me know and also not forgetting you've had my money for over two months now.

Its now March 4th, and with some fuzz going on in this sub about Profitec having trouble stocking the Go as well as the Move in some other places, I decide to check in, this one with my understanding mode on. I query them about this, saying how I knew Clive, WLL, and some other big retailers were also having issues. Their response? **""Yup yup, its Profitec's fault, they don't have stock. Have a good day.""**

Around the time of this chat, they also change the estimate on their site to ""Mid March"", keep in mind, **all this while still allowing orders to be placed.** Also around this time, a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1j9n75n/waiting_for_my_go_since_december/) drops by in the ProfitecGo sub exposing the same issue, with the only minor difference that the user who posted it said they offered a ""5% off"". Not that i care that much, but still worth noting that **you may or may not get an apology worth anything, very consistent customer service policies indeed.**

It is also around this time that plenty units of the 2025 revision of the GO start popping up online, both here, in forums. and even in Lance's channel, with him even claiming he got it during Black Friday as well (which was pretty funny to hear), but ECS couldn't get a hold of a single one of these units.

Finally we get to this day, March 31st. By this point I was very curious to see what would happened, as up to the 30th, the site still claimed ""Mid March"" which I found interesting with everything that had been going on. I start my daily routine, pour my morning capuccino on my *still blue* Go and check their site.

***May 2025***, and they still take orders. Holy. F.

At this point I just give up, write a new ranty message to their customer support, and ask for a refund, which they promptly provide. Worth noting in this last chat with them is that their reply (which I will gladly provide if necessary, I don't want people to think I'm changing what's been said) is basically this:

**""Hi, sorry for the inconvenience. This is Profitec's fault for not being able to keep up with stock. Here's your cancellation confirmation and once more its Profitec's fault, don't forget that. Have a nice day""**.

Despite this being an ""informative"" post, this have raised some questions in my mind, so if someone has read this far, I'd really love to know your input on these.

I got charged the day I placed the order, but if i understand correctly, ECS being a retailer for Profitec's, gets their stock and then sell it no? It not like I backordered anything and ECS needed the money for Profitec to manufacture my order just after I placed it.

Also, they to this day keep on backlogging units, as ordering the machine is possible. How does this work? How is it possible their salesperson expected a 4 weeks lead time between batches, you have a 4 month delay at this point, but you still expect to fullfil all that backlog in one restock somehow?

Anyway, pretty bummed right now, I'll probably spray paint my blue Go in black and post the terrible result on r/espressocirclejerk or something, just to cope.

1jo0jb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jo0jb1/i_have_been_so_frustrated_with_my_sister_recently/,I have been so frustrated with my sister recently.,"I (19 F) am going to try and make this as short as possible, My sister (25) is essentially my best friend, we usually have a great relationship and she does a lot for me but she tends to be someone who bases her life off of aesthetics and she wants most things in her life to be specifically curated on her basis and if it isn’t she usually gets irritated. She is also very moody on a regular basis, and will make it clear that she is.

Recently we’ve been having many fights, which  most of them have started because she suddenly decided something is now bothering her that she doesn’t care about prior to that. She won’t make any mention of a problem before and then one day she will approach me and say something in a catty tone. For example “You just leave all the clothes on the couch, i can’t even tell what’s clean or dirty.” (We share a bedroom and have a couch in the room) When all of the clean laundry is folded and there’s two shirts you can clearly see have just been worn and when i try and explain that to her because i know she’s being rash, she will immediately say that im being defensive.

Another example is we’re going on an international trip soon and she told me that i can’t wear the clothes that she’s packing (we share clothes) because she’s going to pack it based on the outfits she’s wearing on specific days. And then when i got angry at this i told her to just pack normally so we can share clothes like we always do and she got angry at that and started telling me that ‘i disregard the type of person she is, and she can’t just pack normally because that’s what makes sense in her brain.’ My problem was never with her packing though it’s just that it’s going to be detrimental to me.

Another example is when i was telling her that we should go to this really cool club in the country we’re going to and she said “I’d rather go to a coffee shop.” So i said “I get it but we’ll already be doing that, let’s do something different and have something we can tell a story about.” She said “i’d rather tell stories about coffee shops” and then i told her she’s a granny and then she got angry again and told me that im disregarding her as a person and that she’s not living her life to tell other people stories.

I have mannyyyy more stories but these are all occurrences that have happened in the last week and it’s just been building up. Then it turns into a stupid scuffle that could’ve been avoided. And i’m not sure if it’s because of miscommunications or because we’ve been so long in each others space. I know i have my fair share of adding fuel to these arguments and i’m not innocent myself but i’m so exhausted of these constant problems.",1,1743418927.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

My wife and I are planning a 2.5/3 week honeymoon in Vietnam this July. Our rough itinerary is as follows, and we are looking for recommendations for accommodations and activities at each spot. 

Our priorities for accommodations are that they be relaxing and off the beaten track for typical tourism, immersed in nature ideally, we generally prefer a smaller more local feel to a corporate/larger resort feel, & would still love to be accessible to attractions but as long as we can get a sense of the place and enjoy the local culture we are not very concerned about the typical tourist attractions.

Rough itinerary:
- first stop Hoi An. We are looking at spending 4 days / 3 nights to kick the jet lag. Ideally would like to be by the beach and if the place has free bikes that’s awesome. Nothing set in stone and open to suggestions! 
- next stop, Ninh Binh. Any recs would be wonderful!
- Ha Giang loop. We are thinking a 3 day / 2 night tour. Any companies for the tour you’d recommend? Any notes?
- Hanoi. Looking like 2 days / 3 nights. Recommended neighborhoods, activities, best food, best coffee, etc.?
- Ha long bay - 2 night cruise is our plan, but welcome ideas or recommendations.

Anything essential we are missing? Or any suggested reshuffling of the itinerary?

--------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom-infused coffee has been gaining popularity among health enthusiasts and coffee lovers alike. This unique blend combines the rich flavors of coffee with the many health benefits of medicinal mushrooms. But how does it work, and what makes it beneficial? Let’s explore the science behind this fascinating trend.

The primary ingredients in mushroom-infused coffee are coffee beans and various types of mushrooms. The most commonly used mushrooms include Lion's Mane, Chaga, Reishi, and Cordyceps. Each of these mushrooms brings distinct properties to the blend, offering a plethora of advantages.

To create mushroom-infused coffee, the mushrooms are typically dried and ground into a powder. This powder is then mixed with coffee grounds before brewing. The heat in the brewing process extracts beneficial compounds from the mushrooms, allowing them to blend seamlessly with the coffee. This method ensures that you receive maximum health benefits while enjoying your daily cup of joe.

One of the scientific properties at work in mushroom-infused coffee is the presence of polysaccharides, which are long chains of sugar molecules. These polysaccharides play a role in boosting the immune system, helping the body fight off infections and diseases. They may also help reduce inflammation, making mushroom-infused coffee a smart choice for those looking to improve their overall wellness.

Here are some key benefits associated with the mushrooms frequently found in these coffee blends:

- **Lion's Mane:** Known for its cognitive benefits, Lion's Mane may enhance focus, memory, and overall brain function. It can promote nerve growth factor (NGF), which is crucial for the maintenance of healthy neurons.
- **Chaga:** This mushroom is rich in antioxidants, helping to combat oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It's also believed to support healthy cholesterol levels.
- **Reishi:** Often referred to as the “mushroom of immortality,” Reishi may help to alleviate stress and improve sleep quality. Its calming effects make it a popular choice for those looking to unwind.
- **Cordyceps:** This mushroom is known for its potential to enhance athletic performance and boost energy levels. It may increase oxygen uptake, making it useful for those engaging in high-intensity workouts.

The combination of coffee and these powerful mushrooms creates a drink that offers both a caffeine kick and health-boosting benefits. Unlike traditional coffee, which can sometimes lead to jitters or energy crashes, mushroom-infused coffee provides a more balanced experience. The adaptogenic properties of the mushrooms can help to stabilize energy levels throughout the day, making it a great alternative for those sensitive to caffeine.

In addition to their individual benefits, the combined effects of coffee and mushroom extracts can lead to an improved mood. The synergy of caffeine and the various bioactive compounds found in mushrooms can promote feelings of well-being and clarify your thoughts. This combination is particularly appealing for those looking to enhance productivity and creativity.

Moreover, the taste of mushroom-infused coffee can be surprisingly delightful. Depending on the type of mushroom used, it can add an earthy, nutty, or even slightly sweet flavor to your brew. This unique twist can transform your regular coffee routine into a delightful adventure for your taste buds.

When selecting mushroom-infused coffee, quality is essential. Look for brands that source their mushrooms from reputable growers and ensure that their extraction methods preserve the beneficial compounds. Whether you choose instant coffee mixes, ground coffee, or pods, find products that offer a blend you find enjoyable. Taste testing can be part of the fun!

Mushroom-infused coffee is more than just a trend; it combines the best of both worlds—your favorite morning beverage and powerful health benefits. The science behind it shows that the carefully chosen mushrooms can elevate your coffee experience, offering cognitive, physical, and emotional support. If you're looking for a new way to enjoy your daily brew while reaping potential health rewards, give mushroom-infused coffee a try!

The Health Benefits of Incorporating Mushroom-Infused Coffee into Your Daily Routine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mushroom-infused coffee is taking the wellness world by storm. If you’re a coffee lover looking for a healthier alternative, incorporating this unique drink into your routine can offer several benefits that traditional coffee might not provide. Let’s explore how mushroom-infused coffee works and why it deserves a spot in your daily diet.

At its core, mushroom-infused coffee blends the robust flavor of regular coffee with the nutritional power of various medicinal mushrooms. The most common mushrooms used include Lion’s Mane, Reishi, and Chaga. Each type brings its own set of health benefits, making the infusion not just a trend, but a potential boost to your overall wellbeing.

The process of making mushroom-infused coffee involves extracting beneficial compounds from the mushrooms and blending them with coffee. While you can find pre-made options, you can also make your own by steeping powdered mushrooms directly in your coffee. This way, you add an earthy flavor that complements the coffee's natural bitterness.

### Benefits of Mushroom-Infused Coffee

- **Enhanced Focus and Clarity:** Lion’s Mane mushroom is known for its cognitive benefits. It contains compounds that may help improve focus, memory, and mental clarity. If you find yourself needing an extra push during long work hours, mushroom-infused coffee can help you stay alert and sharp.
- **Stress Reduction:** Reishi mushroom is often called the ""mushroom of immortality"" for its ability to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Adding it to your coffee might help you manage daily stressors better, making your morning routine a lot more enjoyable.
- **Rich in Antioxidants:** Chaga mushroom is packed with antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress in the body. Drinking mushroom-infused coffee can contribute to a stronger immune system, making it a refreshing substitute for your typical cup of joe.
- **Improved Metabolism:** The combination of caffeine from coffee and the unique compounds in mushrooms can help boost metabolism. This synergistic effect can assist with weight management, especially if you’re using it as a replacement for sugary drinks or processed snacks.
- **Support for Gut Health:** Many medicinal mushrooms contain prebiotic fibers that can enhance gut health. A healthy gut contributes to better digestion and absorption of nutrients, which is crucial for your overall wellbeing.
- **Better Sleep Quality:** Although it may seem counterintuitive, some people find that mushroom-infused coffee helps improve their sleep quality. Since certain mushrooms can have a calming effect on the mind and body, drinking them in moderation may set a balanced tone for your day.

Mushroom-infused coffee into your daily routine can be simple. Start by swapping one of your usual cups for a mushroom blend each week. You can choose from instant powders, ready-to-drink beverages, or even brew it from whole mushrooms. The flexibility means you can easily find the right option that fits into your lifestyle.

It’s important to note that while mushroom-infused coffee offers numerous benefits, it shouldn’t completely replace regular medical advice or treatment. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you’re pregnant, nursing, or on medication.

When you choose to incorporate mushroom-infused coffee, it’s essential to look for quality brands that source their mushrooms responsibly and thoughtfully. This ensures the integrity of the health benefits and provides you with the best experience possible.

Mushroom-infused coffee is not just another wellness trend; it’s a fantastic way to enhance your daily coffee ritual. By combining the rich taste of coffee with the empowering properties of mushrooms, you can set your day off to a great start while nurturing your body and mind.

I wanted to ask why does my automatic espresso machine not taste as good as the old model. The machine is a delonghi magnifica s, we had the old magnifica and it made amazing coffee. With this newer model the coffee exits just fine but it is more watery. We tried adjusting the grind and put max intensity but nothing changed. The coffee beans are the same we used before.

I’m back to share another chapter of our startup rollercoaster - 2.5 years, 70+ ideas, and a lot of coffee later. My co-founders and I have been grinding through concepts, and after a wild ride with [our last app, Nemlys](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/14qn8r1/startup_lessons_learned_problem_solution/), we’ve landed on something new: NanoReads. Here’s what we’ve learned this time around.

A great market is your best friend. With Nemlys (a relationship app to help couples connect), we saw demand - people *wanted* better relationships, but it was scattered. Some folks craved deeper conversations, others just wanted date ideas, and the buckets never quite lined up. Plus, most weren’t used to paying for relationship apps, even though big players like Paired and Agapé were killing it. It taught us that demand alone isn’t enough - it’s gotta be focused and payable. Fast forward to fiction book apps: the market’s huge, buzzing, and people *pay*. Apps like Radish, Dreame, and Hinovel are raking in millions - readers are hooked on romance, dark romance, and serialized stories. That’s a green light we couldn’t ignore.

Research isn’t guessing - it’s digging. When we set out to find our next niche, we didn’t just brainstorm and hope. We went hard on data: top ARPU apps, top revenue apps across categories, retention champs. We poked around SensorTower, AppFigures, and Google Trends to see what’s popping. We scrolled app store comments for gold - people complaining about clunky interfaces or begging for more werewolf romance gave us clues. It wasn’t pretty - just a messy file of apps, communities, comments, and half-baked ideas - but it was raw fuel.

So, we built it. Nanoreads ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/romance-stories-nanoreads/id6743482190) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paradoxbuilders.nanoreads&hl=en_GB)) is bite-sized fiction - novels, romance, dark romance, delivered in addictive chunks with cliffhangers and twists. Think BookTok vibes but on your phone, tailored to what readers already love. We’re not perfect (far from it), but we’re using what we found: which genres dominate (spoiler: romance and paranormal), what ad creatives hook users (dramatic teasers work), and where existing apps stumble (UI and pacing). Every step’s built on data, not dreams, and we’re adding our own spin to keep it fresh.

Lessons? A strong market with paying users beats a flawless solution any day. With Nemlys, we iterated fast - [shared an MVP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/v3u81j/find_early_adopters_among_couples_for_my_startup/) over 3 years ago, got feedback, rebuilt it twice. Retention sucked, UI was a mess, but we learned. Nanoreads is the same game: launch, listen, tweak. Only now we’re in a space where demand’s screaming, and we’re not stopping at ‘good enough.’ Traction’s slow, but it’s there - readers are sticking around longer than before.

How do we research a new project? We start with people, then back it with numbers - ARPU, revenue trends, retention metrics. Tools like SensorTower and AppFigures cut through the noise; app store comments spill the real tea. It’s messy, unglamorous, and beats any framework. What about you - how do you hunt for your next big thing?",0,1743418133.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,0,0.5,False

**Chapter 1 - Visitor**

**Location - UE Sonar Station Beta “All-Seeing Eye”, Mars Orbit, Sol**

**Date - 13/09/2341**

**Time - 02:13 EST**

**Subject - Warrant Officer Bailiff, Human**


Warrant Officer Bailiff was rudely awoken by a loud, two-tone klaxon sounding throughout the station. It took him a split second to acknowledge the sound and recognise its meaning; the station's EWS had detected an unknown ship heading towards the Sol system. Bailiff snapped himself to attention and hurriedly put on his uniform, pulling his peak hat over his head as he left his quarters and entered the narrow hallways of the station, heading towards the primary control centre. It took him precisely 53 seconds to pace the halls from his quarters to the control room, and the moment he passed through the door he demanded a status report.
 
“Sir! Unidentified vessel approaching the system via slipspace, estimated to exit near Neptune.” Chief Petty Officer Davies announced, snapping to attention and giving Bailiff a quick salute.
“Do we have an ETA? What about the size of the vessel?” Bailiff quizzed. 
“Size is indeterminate sir,” Davies stated. “But it should be here in about six minutes. If that's any indicator, it can't be much larger than a destroyer.”
Annoyed by his subordinates' lapse in discipline, Bailiff asserted, “Acknowledged, but we have to do better than making guesstimates about what a ship could be. We have to be sure.” 
“Sorry sir, but there's not much we can do while the vessel is still in transit. As soon as it translates back into realspace, I’ll ping its location with sonar and get a reading on its dimensions. We can determine its classification and purpose from there.”

By now the remaining crew had entered the control centre and occupied their assigned stations, busying themselves with preparations to greet the unknown visitor. Protocol for situations like this dictated that upon detection of a vessel, a preliminary assessment was to be sent to Sol Security HeadQuarters, and upon entry of the system, the ship in question was to be scanned, evaluated, classified and then tagged as friendly, potentially hostile, hostile, or indeterminate. The final results of this process were then to be sent as an update to the preliminary assessment, and the crew were to maintain standing orders until otherwise notified. 
Vessels tagged as friendly were usually civilian ships like cruise liners or personal transport ships, or anything that lacked offensive capability. 
Vessels that had military markings or offensive capabilities were tagged as potentially hostile, including armed freighters and the like. 
Hostile vessels were usually ships that fell into the previous category who thought it was a good idea to power weapons, but the tag also accounted for warships or vessels that  carried WMDs. 
Indeterminate was the problem. Vessels tagged as indeterminate could be anything that didn't fit into the previous three categories, namely scout ships. It's hard to classify someone as a civilian if they're here to steal your secrets, but they aren't exactly military either. 
Bailiff had reported a lot of indeterminate vessels recently, and Military Command was getting antsy.
 
“Our guest has arrived, sir,” Davies announced. “Scanners are all on and the data is coming back now, I’m beaming it to the primary screen.” 
Bailiff looked at the screen with anticipation, hoping to high heaven it wasn't a scout. 
The ship's dimensions placed it at roughly half the size as a frigate, too large to be an independent ship but not large enough to be a freighter. It wasn't visibly armed and the energy readings were too low for it to be carrying hidden weapons, so it couldn't be military. 
Interestingly, the ship's energy and heat readings had majour fluctuations that occurred twice. 
Bailiff quizzed the room, “Anyone want to explain those power and temperature spikes?”
A female Ensign sat behind one of the many scanner control stations turned her head to look at Bailiff before saying, “Sir, the fluctuations look in-line with a cloak drive powering up.”
Bailiff turned to the crewman sat at the decloaking station and asked, “Petty Officer, can you confirm the Esigns assessment?”
The crewman looked at Bailiff and said, “Aye, sir. They tried to fire it up twice, both times my computer acknowledged the attempt and overloaded their heat sinks, forcing a shutdown. If I’m not mistaken, their engines are off as well, on account of having nowhere to store the thermal energy they produce. Sir.”

Bailiff nodded slowly and cursed inwardly. A cloaking attempt was practically insurance that this vessel was a scout, and Military Command was going to be pissed. 
Bailiff turned his attention back to the primary screen that displayed all of the collected data about the ship, noticing that the station's computers had already tagged the vessel as “indeterminate”. The screen showed a rough estimate of who the ship might belong to, meaning the UE ship database didn't have an existing entry of this exact ship class, but it did contain ships with similar architecture. 
Bailiff looked at Davies and asked, “This screen says there's a 93.2% chance this vessel is Scillixian, aren't they one of the species that our diplomats classified as ‘unlikely to encounter’?”
“Sure,” Davies replied, “them and about 20 dozen other species out there. The xenophiles can't be right all the time.”
Bailiff was preparing to chastise Davies for his loose tongue and lack of discipline, but a young crew member managing communications suddenly perked up and caught his attention.
“Sir, incoming message,” she began, “It's from the scout sir, in their language.”
“Can we translate it?” Bailiff asked.
“I’ve already started sir. One moment.” she replied. 
That one moment seemed to drag on forever as Bailiff pondered what exactly they wanted.
 
*First they try to sneak their way into an uncontacted species’ home system, and now they want to talk?* He thought to himself. *These reptiles better have a decent explanation ready or our defense fleet might just blow them up for trespassing.* 
After what seemed like an eternity in Bailiffs head, the comms officer began speaking again.
“Sir, the message reads as follows; ‘Hailing unknown contacts, we ask you cease your attack at once. We are unarmed and mean you no harm. We request the discussion of our departure from your territory in peace, our communication channels are open.’” The crewperson finished speaking and looked at Bailiff expectantly. 
“Attack?” Bailiff asked, “We haven’t attacked them have we?”
In response to his general question, the petty officer controlling the decloaking system rejoined the conversation.
“Sir, I think they mean the thermal barrage that shut down their cloak drive. They probably have no idea what actually disabled it and assumed they were under fire.”
Bailiff stood for a moment and considered his next move before speaking, “Comms, relay that message to Diplomatic Headquarters, if the Scillixians want to communicate then this just turned into a first contact and none of us are qualified for that.”
The communications officer nodded in response and got to work.
 
A few very long minutes later, the comms officer relayed the diplomat's response and sent it to the main screen. Bailiffs’ eyes widened in shock as he read, and found himself raising his voice in disbelief as he inquired if this response was genuine. 
“Comms, are you certain this is the actual message they sent? They want to use our station to hold a diplomatic meeting- a first contact no less? I can’t even count how many security protocols that course of action is going to break!”
“It’s genuine sir. I’m not sure I want to believe it myself, but apparently our All-Seeing Eye is the ‘least compromising secure facility in the system.’” the comms officer replied, obviously just as bewildered as Bailiff.
“What do they even expect us to do?” Bailiff asked, half rhetorical and half hopeful, “It’s not like we have a meeting room on board and we sure as hell can’t use the control room as a substitute.”
“What about the break room?” Davies suggested, “There isn't anything compromising in there unless you consider a coffee machine to be ‘highly advanced technology.’”
“I guess it’ll have to do,” Bailiff responded. “If our diplomat doesn’t like it then they’ll have to go somewhere else. When are they expected to arrive?”
“Half an hour sir, on the dot,” said the comms officer.
“Well alright then. Comms, send our visitors a message; tell them to approach the scanning station slowly and await docking instructions. Davies, you and I will be greeting the diplomat in docking bay Alpha as soon as they arrive. We’re on the clock now people, let's get a move on.”
Bailiffs orders were received and the crew began executing them like ants, rushing off to the break room or busying themselves with a keyboard. As he made his way to the break area to assist in preparations for the first contact, Bailiff couldn’t help but complain inwardly.

I picked up an airbrush pen during my Target run last Thursday - just one of those mom impulses - and wow, did we have fun!

There's something magical about watching your child get completely lost in creating. Lily's usually so hard on herself when her drawings don't turn out ""just right,"" but with this? Pure joy. We spread out on the living room floor, testing all the stencils, mixing colors... next thing I knew, two hours had flown by and we'd completely missed snack time!

A couple things we learned:

Cardstock is your friend - our first attempt bled right through onto the coffee table (thank goodness for wipeable surfaces!)

That little trick of spraying it upside down after use? Lifesaver for keeping it working smoothly

The only downside is the limited colors - of course her favorite (sparkly gold) wasn't included. We're making a special trip to the craft store this weekend to pick out some extras. Seeing her so excited about art makes every messy moment worth it.

Anyone else have favorite creative activities to do with their kids? I'm always looking for new ways to keep us connected in these busy days.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please read this post in full before messaging me 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I was diagnosed after childhood, and like many ""high functioning"" (I don't like that term) autistics, I completely crashed when I went to college. I was already diagnosed with depression before my autism diagnosis. Everyone thought it was related to a traumatic event but I think it came from being undiagnosed autistic for so long and everything that came with that. Later this diagnosis was changed to dysthymia, but I think I mostly struggle with burn out, not depression.

Anyway, after trying to cope for 4 years, dropping out of college to attend (mostly online) university, building up debt and study delays all over.. I started looking for help last June. But every professional I've talked to, including a student psychologist, says I have ""too much self-reflection for a psychologist to help me"". Basically, the thing a psych would do, I apparently already do myself. It's true that I'm very good at self-reflecting and understanding why I do or think certain ways (post-diagnosis anyway lol), but that doesn't help me if I don't know how to change it! 

I have an autism coach now, who I'm sure will help me manage burnout in university, but she's definitely focused on the practical solutions and strategies. She's great, and I really need what she's providing, but I feel like I'm missing professional emotional support if that makes sense. 

I don't know how to cope with the fact that I'll never be able to live the life I expected to, because I can't carry as much weight as I was told I'm supposed to. I don't know how to handle the fact that the people around me (except my partner) don't seem willing to understand this fact. I don't know how to navigate my relationship with my mother, now that I'm trying to advocate for and be a bit kinder to myself, instead of always pushing myself harder. I don't know how to handle her talking about my ""so-called autism"" like it's something minor, when it is literally part of who I am. 

I know I have certain behaviours and anxieties because I'm afraid of rejection, I know where this comes from. But what do I do with that?? I know I constantly cross my own boundaries and need to say no to people instead, I know *when* these boundaries are about to be crossed. But what do I do when these people reject me or get mad at me for guarding them?? 

I feel like I'm drowning and while I appreciate there being someone who teaches me to swim in the long term, building that skill takes time and in the meantime it's so hard to keep my head above water. My life has become a constant battle with my own mind and body because neither wants to work anymore but I have to keep going going going and I don't know how to balance that. I can't drink coffee anymore because I always have an upset stomach, I'm nauseous all the time. I can't read long sentences anymore, because by the time I reach the end I have forgotten the beginning. I have regular meltdowns, which I never had before, and small panic attacks on a daily basis.

All I do is study, escape in games and books when I can, micro-dose cannabis because that's the only way to not get overstimulated from my own brain these days, and disappoint friends and family again and again and again because I don't have the energy to deal with them. Sometimes I don't have the energy left to talk. I can't unmask outside my home but keeping the mask up takes energy I don't have, so I just become this weird shell of a person, neither my mask nor myself, knowing I'm supposed to do or say something but not managing to figure out what. 

And it's true that for all of this I know *why*. I do. But I don't know *how* not to. I don't know how to make the suicidal ideation go away. I don't know how to calm down my racing head without drugging it. I don't know how to unmask outside my home. I don't know how to stop being so scared of rejection and disapproval. I don't know how to find the energy to clean and I don't know how to accept things being messy. But apparently, because I already understand the why's, nobody can help me with this. 

Sorry for this really long vent, it feels like I'm alone in this and I know there's people here who can relate. Thank you if you read everything, I know you can't help me but it means a lot to be heard by someone, even if it's strangers online. ",1,1743416929.0,autism,9,1.0,False

Unfortunately, my R58 v2 has developed a problem.

I’ve been facing two issues with my Rocket R58 V2 that seem connected:  
  
  
  
1. Portafilter holder heating issue (50% of the time):  
Sometimes when I activate the machine to heat the water, the portafilter holder stays cold. To fix this, I have to pull the lever to release some water until it heats up, then close it again. After this, the portafilter holder  gets hot as it should. This might be related to the next issue since I release water/pressure to resolve it.  
  
1.1 Brewing issue after heating:  
Once the portafilter holder is hot, I can’t brew coffee because I need to turn off the machine, pull the lever to release either water or air, and then turn the machine back on. Only after this can I brew coffee. If I skip this step, the pressure goes to MAX instantly (around 10 bar), and no coffee comes out.  
  
2. Portafilter holder heating but no brewing:  
On other occasions, the portafilter holder heats up correctly, but when I try to brew, the pressure goes straight to MAX (around 10 bar), and no coffee is extracted. In this case, I turn off the machine, remove the portafilter, and pull the lever. After a few minutes (sometimes instantly), I hear water or just compressed, short intermittent air releasing with pressure. After this, I can brew coffee normally.  
  
I’m currently living with this workaround, but I’d love to know what the issue might be to fix it. Any suggestions are appreciated! Thanks!",1,1743416820.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A year ago, I moved to Portugal, and while life here has been exciting, it's also been incredibly isolating. Back home, I had family and friends—I wasn’t the most social person, but I had people around.

Now, in this new culture, I see couples everywhere—on the metro, at the beach, in cafés—and I can't help but crave that kind of connection too. I want someone to hold hands with, hug, share a pizza, and have coffee with. But being an introvert makes it incredibly hard. I haven’t even learned Portuguese yet, and though I think some girls might be interested in me, I just freeze up.

I keep hoping that someone will approach me first, that things will magically fall into place. But deep down, I know that’s not how it works. It’s frustrating because I want to break out of this comfort zone, but I don’t know how.
