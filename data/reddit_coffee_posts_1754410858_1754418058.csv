* Pulsar Next Level - $40 + Shipping

The Lelit has only ever seen distilled water + TWW Espresso Machine Profile water. Was backflushed with Cafiza once a month. Recently re-greased the cam in the level arm, so it no longer squeaks. DF83 burrs were aligned by the seller originally and I have not adjusted since. Probably about 50 lbs of coffee through since purchase at the beginning of 2024. J-Max and Next level pulsar are very lightly used. I couldn't get the pulsar to give me good brews, but that may just be me.

Included Accessories:

Bianca: Both portafilters (spouted has never been used), the original unused Lelit baskets (IMS 9-11g, 14-18g, 18-21g), a VST 20g basket, 2 backflush disks, lelit tamper, normcore self-leveling tamper, normcore magnetic dosing funnel, about 50 normcore filter papers that fit the VST basket. Also includes the plumbing kit and the water filter.

DF83: Includes the original dosing cup and dosing funnel cap, MHW3BOMBER blind shaker, and 3D printed parts, including the blind shaker stand, exit chute, and slow-feeder/anti-popcorn device (have never used the chute or the flow-feeder YMMV). Also comes with original portafilter fork, although the blind shaker stand does fit the dosing cup, so I would recommend using that.

1ZPresso J-Max: Comes with carrying case

Pulsar Next Level: Comes with about 1.5 packages of filter papers

If the buyer of the Bianca or DF83 don't want some accessories, I am willing to sell them separately. Also, while I don't want to separate the DF83 and the burrs, I would be willing to listen on that.

1mif3kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mif3kl/discover_if_the_nespresso_vertuoplus_by_delonghi/,Discover if the Nespresso VertuoPlus by De'Longhi Espresso Machine is Worth It Review,"Recently, I had the chance to test out the De'Longhi ENV150BAE Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine. As someone who considers coffee an essential part of my morning (and sometimes a midday pick-me-up), I was genuinely curious if this machine could become a staple in my daily coffee routine. Its promises of versatility, ease of use, and high-end coffee experiences set the bar pretty high. Here's how my experience stacked up.  

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
The machine fits perfectly on my kitchen counter, sporting that sleek Ink Black finish that just screams modern class. Measuring 12.81"" x 16.2"" x 12.8"", it’s neither bulky nor cumbersome but rather sits comfortably without looking overwhelming. Its fully automatic operation and user-friendly buttons make it a breeze to operate even when half-asleep before my morning caffeine hit. I also appreciated the thoughtful inclusion of the Aeroccino3 milk frother, which matches the stylish finish. This add-on expanded the machine’s functionality, letting me froth milk for lattes or cappuccinos in seconds. 

**Functionality with a Twist**  
I had a lot of fun exploring its Centrifusion technology—something unique to Nespresso’s lineup. Essentially, the capsule spins up to a mind-boggling 7,000 rotations per minute to mix the coffee grounds with water, creating a crema-topped masterpiece. Using barcoded capsules isn’t for everyone, but I must admit it’s convenient. Instead of fiddling with grind size or brew settings, the machine reads the capsule’s barcode and adjusts itself to deliver consistent results. Yes, it takes a bit of the artistry out of coffee-making but more than makes up for it with sheer convenience.  

**Versatility in Cup Sizes**  
The versatility this machine offers blew me away. You can brew a variety of cup sizes: everything from a robust 1.35 oz Espresso to a generous 14 oz full-brew Alto. I also appreciated the option to create iced coffee by pouring freshly brewed coffee over ice—perfect for hot summer afternoons when I don’t want something piping hot.  

[Find the best price for De'Longhi ENV150BAE on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07ybvtm6f/)  

**Highlights**  
- The milk frother took my coffee game to another level, producing hot or cold milk foam effortlessly.  
- Energy-saving features like its 25-second heat-up and automatic shut-off added a sense of practicality.  
- Operating the machine is foolproof with the touch of a button. No steep learning curve here!  
- I loved how the complimentary starter set of capsules provided a range of flavor options right from the get-go.  

**Hurdles to Consider**  
Every product has its quirks, right? While there’s a lot to love about this espresso machine, there are a few things worth noting:  
- Being reliant on proprietary capsules may not appeal to those who love using their own freshly ground coffee beans.  
- The machine, versatile as it is, doesn’t come cheap. But hey, high-end coffee never does!  
- Cleaning isn’t overly complex, but the milk frother does take extra diligence to maintain.  

**Product Competitors**  
I couldn’t resist comparing this machine to a few other espresso makers in the same price range, like the Breville Bambino Plus. Unlike the VertuoPlus, which emphasizes quick, automated brewing with capsules, the Bambino gives you more control over the espresso-making process. While I enjoyed the Bambino’s steam wand for milk frothing, the Nespresso system proved to be far more convenient for fast, reliable results. On the flip side, for coffee enthusiasts who love experimenting, a Breville model might suit their taste buds better.  

The Keurig K-Café is another machine that crosses paths with this one, particularly for its simplified pod-based operation. However, where Keurig lacks is in creating authentic espresso shots—an area where Nespresso excels. For milk-based drinks, though, both machines deliver comparable frothing abilities.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Is it worth the splurge? If you’re hunting for a machine that offers an upscale, café-like experience in the convenience of your home, the answer leans towards yes. The De’Longhi ENV150BAE doesn’t just make coffee, it crafts an experience. However, if you’re more cost-conscious or prefer the flexibility to use your own coffee grounds, it might be less attractive. Ultimately, its value lies in how much you prioritize convenience and ease of use in your daily coffee ritual.

All I accomplished was burning cash on Shopify fees and watching useless affiliate marketing videos.

My Stripe account was a ghost town. I was genuinely ready to call it quits last week. Out of pure frustration, I stopped chasing 'winning products' and decided to see if I could break the AI tools I was already using. I figured if I couldn't \*find\* a product to sell, maybe I could \*force one into existence\*. That's when I noticed a few patterns that changed everything. It boils down to three tactical shifts: 

1. 'Role-Based' Prompts are a cheat code : I stopped asking AI for generic things like 'a marketing slogan.' I started \*commanding\* it: ""You are a world-class copywriter from the 1960s Mad Men era. Write three ads for a coffee substitute."" The difference in output quality was night and day. The AI's safety filters and generic outputs are tied to generic queries; hyper-specificity bypasses them. 

2. I stopped selling to everyone: Instead of targeting a broad niche like 'fitness,' I drilled down to 'new fathers over 30 trying to get back in shape.' The audience is smaller, but they have urgent, specific problems and are starved for tailored solutions. It's easier to be a big fish in a small pond. 

3. The real key was a Contrarian Strategy.I looked at what every 'guru' was pushing—dropshipping, Amazon FBA, etc.—and deliberately did the opposite. I focused on creating a high-value \*digital asset\* that I own completely. Zero overhead, zero shipping, infinite inventory. 

This is the first thing that has actually moved the needle for me. I documented the entire process—the exact prompt templates, the niche-finding checklist, the whole system—mostly just to prove to myself it wasn't a fluke. It's now a full step-by-step playbook. I'm no expert, just a regular person who got tired of the usual nonsense. The mods here don't allow direct links, but for anyone who wants to see the exact framework I used, the link to the guide is on my profile.

The Angel Lane café happens to be local to me, and frankly it’s an astonishing thing for the area. Over the past three or so months I've been on four occasions. Each time I've gone for the fruitier of their two batch brew options. Each one has been excellent, three of them were remarkable. They were most fruity, tea-like, exceptional brews. One was their Gesha. Today I had their Las Flores.

I can’t justify the price tag for their beans at the moment, unfortunately, so I see their batch brews, which are standard price, as the cleverest outdoor-in-London coffee hack I currently know.

I haven't been to their other locations, and I can only vouch for the Angel Lane cafe, though I expect the others are probably great too. The railway arch on Angel Lane was their original roastery. It's always very quiet in there when I’ve been, and I'm worried they'll close it. That's why I want all of you to flock there.

I am M34 and my gf is F32 - we have been dating long distance for 9 months or so and will be moving to the same place in 2 months time. 

At the time we started dating I had seen another girl for several dates over a 2 month period, however, I had not broken things off with another girl when my GF and I met. I was honest about this with my now GF early on in our relationship and we discussed that I would break things off with the previous girl I had dated - I had told my GF that I would prefer to meet the previous girl for a coffee to end things (as I thought this was the right way to handle it), however, my GF expressed her opinion that I should instead send a text. In the end I did send a text, however, I lied to my GF and told her that I saw her for a coffee - I am not sure why I was not honest about this (I think because I was ashamed of not doing the ""right"" thing), however, I did not admit to this lie until several months later, around 2-3 months ago.

I have always been clear with my GF that I did not have strong feelings for the girl I was previously dating and I did not consider it to be a serious relationship, I originally described it as more of a friendship - for example, we did not discuss being exclusive or in a formal ""relationship"" at all, we did not introduce each other to our friendship groups (although she did meet my friends once by coincidence at a concert) and we did not generally message very much outside of seeing each other for dates. We did not have a physical relationship, although she did stay over at my place twice. 

I once hid an IG story about me and my current GF from the girl I was dating previously early on on my current relationship, which my GF picked up on. My reason for doing this was to try and avoid hurting the previous girl's feelings, however, I understand this is not how it came across.

I also deleted my messages with the girl I dated previously as I did not want to get ""found out"" about having texted her to break things off instead of going to get a coffee, which I had lied to my current GF about. 

6 months after I broke things off with the previous girl, she messaged me out of the blue asking to give it another go as she said that she realised she had strong feelings for me and hadn't been as open or communicative or put in as much effort as she should have at the time we dated. This message was the first contact we had since I broke things off and I was open with my GF and shared this message straight away. However, this message made her think that there was something much more serious between me and the girl I was previously dating than I have told her about as the previous girl made it clear that she had strong feelings for me (along the lines of she had never felt like this before) - my GF's view is that she would not have such strong feelings and message 6 months later if it wasn't much more serious. There is also no evidence other than my own word that it was out of the blue and we hadn't messaged at all in between as I had deleted previous messages.

My GF understandably questions my honesty and openness about the girl I was previously dating due to these various things and this continues to be a difficult topic, mainly as my GF believes that it was much more serious with the girl I was previously dating and this is something that I am hiding from her.

1mier3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/1mier3i/how_would_you_handle_this_situation_stay_or_go/,How would you handle this situation? Stay or go? Advice requested!,"I started working as a lead toddler teacher at the beginning of June for a Montessori school and I’m debating moving on but struggling with the decision.  
  
First of all, it has been constant drama and stress since I started. The last lead was not doing her job, but the admin gave her the benefit of the doubt and never said anything to her until *after* she put her notice in. The cupboards were a mess and there was hardly any work on the shelves, entire pieces of furniture removed from the room, and no documentation was being done. She wasn’t guiding the children on how to use materials or setting boundaries in the classroom. I’ve had to start with a blank slate. So, I’ve already put a ton of work into this job. Cleaning, organizing, ordering supplies, setting up the room, making schedules, and so on. I’m also NOT a Montessorian, so I’ve had to navigate 3 assistants in the room that are not collaborative and expect me to tell them what to do, even though I have still been learning myself. Two of them worked alongside my AD, who was the lead toddler teacher in the room before she was promoted. She has been a great resource but also began stepping on my toes by acting like if I didn’t do things how she did it, it was wrong. One of my assistants was being passive aggressive towards me and became upset at the littlest things, which resulted in me having to speak to HR. Since then, things have been good with my AD and this assistant, but we are also talking about a short period of time (not even 2 weeks).

I want to believe things will continue to improve from here now that I'm getting the hang of it. However, I’m not even sure if I resonate with Montessori!

 On one hand, autonomy is really important to me, and I love that I have my own classroom and can make newsletters and set things up myself. Right now, I have tons of time to prep and do computer work because the children nap from 1-3PM (might change come September when new little ones join, but who knows). It’s a beautiful campus with a large outdoor space. We can take walks through the park, have water play in swimsuits and sprinklers, garden, and so on. I’ve been able to put orders in the Amazon cart directly and the center buys whatever I want, for the most part. Leads are salaried and get paid for lunches and some school breaks. The school feeds us and gives us coffee. The other leads are all pleasant so far, no gossip or toxic attitudes.

 On the other hand, I struggle at times with the Montessori curriculum. It’s considered ‘open-ended’ because children can choose their work, HOWEVER, the materials themselves are highly structured and intended to be used in specific, sequenced ways. As a neurodivergent person, this really saps my spark! I’m used to creative and imaginative play environments, with small group activities and lessons, so at times this has felt rigid and frustrating. I have more materials out right now like trains, dolls, or cars than the typical Montessori works but technically, if a child puts the dolls in the train and starts rolling across the floor, I’m supposed to remind them that it’s two different works and to keep their train in a designated area or on a mat. Even when I set out art, it's presented with intentional use of certain materials, instead of children having a station where they can choose whether they want to paint or go crazy with glue and sequins. I appreciate that it's less crazy, but it's also such a low vibe (if that makes any sense).  
  
There is also limited collaboration and social play. I can see how this (somewhat) works in a toddler classroom since forced sharing leads to scuffling over materials and tantrums, but I also see this conflict with their need for interaction at times.  
  
We also aren’t supposed to interrupt their concentration when they are working, which has felt conflicting at times because I felt they could have learned so much more with scaffolding, asking questions, and conversation. That’s exactly what they tell us to do in ECE classes! Sometimes the way we are meant to be quiet and so highly structured feels unnecessary and unnatural to me and I’ve been dreading what new things the admin will declare I need to work on in the future because I don’t think I can tighten the reigns more than I have!   
  
They also would like me to attend Montessori training, but I’m beginning my BAS degree in the fall, so I just don’t see how I can make that work. This means that after this school year, it’s likely they won’t extend my contact, anyway.  
  
I’ve already put so much into this job and feel conflicted about leaving suddenly before the new school year starts. I mean, I’m sitting here working on my welcome letter for families while simultaneously interviewing with other companies. LOL! If I leave, I’ll have to repay a $1k hiring bonus and they will probably be upset. Though ultimately, I know that companies will replace someone without a second thought so I'm trying to focus on what's best for me. I don't want to walk away from all the good things about this job, but I'm unsure if it's worth it. Am I giving up too quickly? Do I stay for the remainder of the year, even though it might be missed opportunities and more stress? Or leave? Do I give them advance notice, or wait until I find another job and simply give them two weeks and/or quit? WWYD?!",2,1754413278.0,ECEProfessionals,0,1.0,False

I’m a 49-year-old guy who moved here a few years ago with my wife and our dog. Somehow, despite living here for 3 years, I haven’t been able to build a solid group of local friends (mostly because I work from home). I’m hoping to change that.

Here’s me in a nutshell:

* I love outdoor activities (hiking, camping, exploring).
* Big fan of all things Philly sports (but I can stomach the Titans if I must).
* I enjoy playing games — board games, card games, skill games… maybe not Fortnite.
* I’m always down to explore new activities, whether it’s axe throwing, concerts, art exhibits, comedy shows, or something I haven’t heard of yet.
* I run a healthcare-adjacent AI company, so I can nerd out on science/tech, but I’m not looking to talk shop 24/7.
* I don’t do the church scene, don’t have kids, and I’m allergic to political extremes.
* I’m just looking to meet other good people (ideally guys in the 40+ range) who enjoy life, good company, and can appreciate sarcastic banter.
* I don't care about your race/ethnicity/sex/gender/etc. NOT looking for sex/romance, though.
* Hmmmm.... I hate to have to say it, but I'm also mentally stable and financially secure. So, I'm not ""looking"" for anything other than some local friends.  

I’m not looking for a huge social circle — just a few like-minded people to hang out, catch a game, hit a hiking trail, or simply grab a cocktail/beer/coffee and trade offensive jokes.

The service was absolutely terrible! We saw the waitress 4x through the whole meal. I asked for water and when my food came I was going to ask for a cup of coffee, but she never came back until she had the check. The food took 30 minutes to get there, but people who got there after us were served sooner. 

I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon (4strips), rye toast and fruit and added green and cheese to the eggs. My plate came with the eggs absolutely smothered in green (which wasn’t a huge problem), there were only 2 strips of bacon the melon was mushy and I didn’t get my toast.  The glass of water I asked for was filled to the rim with ice so the lemon couldn’t be pushed into the water. It definitely wasn’t two eggs unless they’re using the smallest chicken eggs they can find. The rye toast wasn’t cut in half. 

My wife got the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and hash browns.  Her serving of hash browns was half the size of the tables around us and the gravy was bland enough that you could taste the flour. 

My cup of water never got refilled and the waitress never asked if we were done, she just dropped the check and told us she would be our cashier. 

Any one of these things on it own wouldn’t have been a big deal, but all of it together definitely was.

1mielzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mielzm/does_the_subzero_4204490_refrigerator_water/,Does the Sub-Zero 4204490 Refrigerator Water Filter Deliver? Detailed Review Inside!,"**Testing Out the Sub-Zero 4204490 Refrigerator Water Filter**  

Having spent a few weeks using the **Sub-Zero 4204490 Refrigerator Water Filter**, I feel more than qualified to dive into its merits and quirks. This filter ticks a lot of the boxes you'd expect from a premium product, but as with anything, it isn't without a couple of minor hiccups. I’ve personally tested this filter in my own fridge and even roped in my brother—a confessed tap water fanatic—to give his two cents.

**Solid Build and Sleek Aesthetic**  

The design of the filter feels solid in every way you’d want it to. Polypropylene might not scream luxury, but it sure is sturdy and reassuring. Measuring 2.6""D x 2.6""W x 11.9""H, its compact size comfortably fits into most compatible refrigerator models without being an eyesore. Plus, the white finish blends seamlessly into my Sub-Zero’s interior. While some filters look clunky, this one felt deliberately tailored, which I appreciated.

**Ease of Installation**  

Installing the filter was a breeze—so simple even my friend, who cannot assemble anything without accidentally breaking it, had zero issues. It’s compatible with Sub-Zero Classic Refrigeration models (after #4134313 serial numbers) and PRO models, which was great for my unit. No tools were needed; pop out the old one, twist this in, and voilà—just like that, you’re on your way to crisp-tasting water.  

[Ready to buy Sub-Zero 4204490? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07c5wbjzz/)  

**Filter Performance That Stands Out**  

Water quality? Top-notch. This filter performs as advertised, boasting an NSF certification, which eased my initial concerns about safety and filtration effectiveness. It reduces chlorine levels exceptionally well, which could immediately be noticed in the improved taste and odor of the water. My partner, who turns up her nose at tap water’s faint chlorine whiff, couldn’t stop pouring herself glass after glass—mission accomplished, I'd say!

Even the flow rate, at 0.78 gpm (2.05 Lpm), exceeded my expectations. No sluggish trickle here—it kept up with our busy household without breaking a sweat. Its 750-gallon capacity also ensures you won’t need to replace this filter too often, which felt like a relief after checking our grocery bills lately.

**Advantages**  

- Excellent chlorine reduction improves water taste and smell.  
- Easy installation—no technical skills required.  
- NSF-certified for peace of mind.  
- Works seamlessly with multiple Sub-Zero fridge models.  
- Durable polypropylene construction ensures longevity.  

**Longevity and Capacity**  

One standout feature is how long this filter lasts—750 gallons is nothing to scoff at. This roughly translates to about six months of consistent use for my family of four. I’ve used cheaper filters before that needed a change every two or three months, and honestly, the convenience here feels worth any minor extra cost.

**Functional Limitations**  

Every great product has its downsides, and this filter isn’t immune. While it works flawlessly for compatible refrigerators, those with off-brand or much older models might hit compatibility issues. It’s frustrating if you purchase this, thinking it’s universal, only to realize it’s custom-fitted for newer Sub-Zero designs. Also, while I appreciate the reduced chlorine, it doesn’t completely eliminate all contaminants—I was hoping for a touch more filtration sophistication for the price point.

**Pitfalls**  

- Limited compatibility with some non-Sub-Zero fridge models.  
- Does not thoroughly remove some additional contaminants.  

**Competing Products**  

When comparing this product to leading alternatives like GE’s RPWFE Water Filter or LG’s LT1000P, it holds its own in both build quality and efficiency. However, LG’s filters often come with multilayer filtration technology to tackle more contaminants, while the GE RPWFE incorporates advanced chip technology for seamless alerts when it’s time to replace. Those bells and whistles do come at a higher price, though. For cost-to-quality balance, the Sub-Zero option delivers where most people care—taste, safety, and durability.

**Quality for Price**  

Considering its longevity, solid construction, and stellar performance, this filter undoubtedly feels like smart spending. While pricier than generic refrigerator water filters, I’d argue it’s worth every penny for anyone using compatible Sub-Zero models. After all, quality water makes everything better—from morning coffee to post-workout hydration.

I looked up and shit you not fucking Alan Ritchson was making eye contact with me. Huge man, good fucking god bro like what the fuck. He had a tan shirt with FREEDOM on it and asked assertively but kindly if his half and half tea was ready. I was like ""uh- uh- yeah."" And the chick employee next to me took it around the counter and gave it to him while i stared like an idiot, slackjawed, parsing if i was looking at who i thought i was. Then he said thanks and left.

And then no one noticed. Everyone was so busy. Eventually I googled this and left a comment in this sub (im not actually a member of this sub i admit, ive only watched clips of Reacher, im just a film major and i recognized him). I found on his insta he said he has a cabin in the smoky mountain region and that makes perfect sense because thats where we're located and we're on the highway linked to a fucking airport bro I SAW ALAN RITCHSON IN MY FUCKING COFFEE SHOP BROO

Gale is it!!! Five millennia ahead and Gale is all we have!!! And he’s a rock star at that!!! The good people at Artemis Labs mixed him with one of the clones of Mick Jagger.

He’s good people, you unappreciative tools.  

We here at Betaluma, Washington we assembled a late night vigil for Gale last night.  He was going to send methane bombs from the future onto us and unleash new varieties of cockroaches on us if we didn’t.  

So we used our bare hands to stay up all night assembling him out of clay and cat liter (feces free) just like he asked then painted it with onions and fruit dyes all alone cause none of you cared!!!

All you had to do was put one blasted picture of Costa coffee.  But no! Did you! No and instead you left us to have to hold an all-night candle vigil to appease him.

(We start the scene where we see I.M.P company building as usual, until we cut to the office and see Loona looking through phone on a “fancy style” app. Moxxie and Millie enter the room while carrying their coffee.)

Millie: *smiles* Morning Loona.

Loona: *Look at her phone.* Whatever.

(As Moxxie and Millie sat down on the couch and were about to drink their coffee. Suddenly, Blitzø kicks down the door. Which made Moxxie and Millie spilled their coffee on Moxxie's crouch, which earn Moxxie a lord cry of pain.)

Blitzø: Loona, M&M get suited up! A client wants our asses to guard a fashion show in the Envy Ring!!

Loona/Moxxie/Millie: *Shock* THE ENVY RING!?

(We then cut to what looks like a car hanger, the shutter door opens and the I.M.P van exits out of it. As it drives, we see the sky is purple and there are buildings that have signs like “The “real” style just for you” or “ Try the""real "" deal"". As they drive past them, they stop at a gate. As one of the Guards, who is a fish demon walks towards the van and checks the list that had names on it.)

Guard 1: *Checks the list* Name?

Blitzø: Blitzø, the “O” is slight. Your boss hired us for security.

(As the Guard looks at the list, he sees “I.M.P” on it and lets the second one know.)

Guard 1: *to Guard 2* Let them in!

(As Guard 2 nods his head, the gate begins to open and the van drives in. As the van stops, the gang gets out as they were wearing their bodyguard outfits from Helluva boss s1 ep2. As Loona gets out, she is wearing a suit and wears a black skirt with black heels. Then they look in front of them and see it was a big purple palace, with a serpent-like head on a water fountain in front of the palace and it had a black flag with a purple envy symbol on it. As they looked at the palace, they were amazed by its look.)

Millie: *Amazed* Wow, that's the greatest place I have ever seen!

Blitzø: Yeah, let's go inside. The client waited for our asses to be there.

(As they go inside, they see some imps and fish demons setting up drinks, decorations and other things around the palace. They then see an imp talking host of the party, she was a female demon-like serpent with purple on her scales and with gray under her belly. She was wearing a black tail suit with gold trim on and had a light purple flower, she had a bright red bowtie and black gloves. She had black horns with two purple stripes on them, she was wearing a queen crown on her right head while wearing a half-mask on her left side and she had cobra-like fins with the black “Envy” symbols on them. This host was none other than the queen of the Envy Ring herself, Leviathan or Lucy for short. As Lucy was talking to the imp, she spotted the I.M.P gang and slithers to them.)

Lucy: Ah, if it isn't I.M.P, I assume you know why you're here?

Blitzø: Because you want us to guard your “fancy” show?

Lucy: Well that, and the reason why is because I need my show secured for anyone trying to kill me or my girlfriend Vikki.

(Once she said “Vikki”, Loona was surprised to hear that name.)

Loona: Wait, did you say Vikki?

Lucy: Yes, why do you ask?

Loona: Oh, uh…

Blitzø: *Realized* Wait, isn't she that bi-?

(But before Blitzø could say that, Loona quickly covers Blitzø's mouth.)

Loona: *Nervously smiles* We met at Bee's party one time.

Lucy: Ah, yes, Beelzebub. She may be the Queen of Gluttony, but Bee really needs to clear it up after she's done.

Loona: *Nervously smiles* Yeah, she really does need to. *Nervously chuckles*

Lucy: Well, if you four need anything? Let me or one of my servers know. 

(As Lucy slithers away, Blitzø takes off Loona's hand off his mouth.)

Blitzø: Loona, Why did you have to cover my mouth?

Loona: Look, as much I would love for you to say that. I don't want to die by Leviathan, so don't say the “b” word.

Blitzø: Ok Hon, but just let me know if you want to leave. Ok?

(As Blitzø walks away, Loona looks very nervous. We then cut to the palace, as there were spot lights going back and forth and a banner saying “Leviathan's annual fashion show”. We then cut to the inside and saw many imps & fish demons in the room where a catwalk was at.)

Announcer: Welcome ladies and gentlemen, to Queen Leviathan's annual fashion show! Now, let's get this show started!

(Montages & song)

(We then cut to see Loona looking around the place, until she spotted Vikki in a purple dress and long black gloves talking to some imps & fish demons. Then Loona quickly walks away, then she goes to the second floor. As she walks, she sees a balance outside and goes to it. Then she Grabs a lighter and a pack of cigarettes and grabs and lights one up, as she leans on the railing. She heard a voice behind her)

???: Oh, wow. Lookee who it is.

(As Loona turns around, she was shocked to see the voice was from vikki)

Loona: *sighs in announcing* Oh, fuck... You again…

Vikki: *Smirk* Stalkin' me now, huh? 

Loona: *Annoyed* Oh, don't fuckin' flatter yourself, vikki. I have my own life, y'know, without YOU in it.

Vikki: *Smirk* Uh huh, sure! Lunatic Loona. 

Loona *Annoyed*: It’s just “Loona”, vikki. And gee whiz, we've been in each other's relative vicinity TWICE, in the last FIFTEEN YEARS! That would make me, THE SHI-!

(As Loona was about to finish her sentence, they suddenly felt a rumble. We then cut back to the fashion show, until a wall was destroyed and it revealed some imps and fish demons with guns. As they move out of the way, a big demon comes out of the smoke and reveals themselves to be a big demon with purple tentacles. He Had black scales while wearing a black leather vest with white symbols of the “envee” symbol on each side. His shoulders had purple mini blades on them, his left arm had a dark purple fin behind his arm and his hand was purple with mini dark purple fins between his fingers. His right hand had a crab-claw with purple on it. He had a gray neck with two purple stripes on it, he had two purple fins attached to the head and neck. He had purple sharp teeth while he was wearing black triangle glasses, he had purple Speaks on his forehead while he had a fishing rod-like on his forehead. This was none other then the wannabe ruler of envy and Lucy's enemy, mark)

Mark: *to everyone* Greetings fuckers!! I am Mark, you're soon to be ruler! And I want to know, *Demonic* Where is leviathan?!

(As he said that, the floor started to shake. Until smoke appears and shows Lucy in her full demon form. which her whole body was big, she had wings behind her back that were massive, she had 6 eyes and her claws are sharp)

Lucy: *full demon form* What do you want now mark, can't you see there's a show going on here?!

Mark: *grins* I think you know what I'm here for?

Lucy: *full demon form* When will you learn that I'm the true ruler of envy?!

Mark: *grins* Until I, *Demonic voice* GET what I want!!

(As they start to charge at each other, everyone runs to exit. Then blitzø, moxxie and Millie started shooting and fighting the imps and fish demons. As this was happening, Loona and vikki run into the room and were shocked to see what was going on)

Loona: *Shock* What the fuck is going on?!

Vikki: *sighs* Is mark!

Loona: *confused* “mark”, who's mark?

Vikki: Lucy's enemy, he tries to fight Lucy to rule the envy ring every single damn time!

(As Vikki was talking about Mark, Loona spots a imp pointing their gun at vikki. Until Loona jumps on vikki before the imp could kill her)

Vikki: *sarcastic* Gee, thanks for the help.

Loona: We gotta take cover, follow me!

Vikki: *Annoyed* Oh, I'm not listening to you anymore! 

Loona: Look, just follow me! We need to take cover!

Vikki: *Annoyed* really, why should I listen to you After what you did?

Loona: Are we still talking about that?! Look, I'm sorry, ok?!

Vikki: *Angry* “You're sorry?!” ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

(Then a flashback happens and reveals Loona and Vikki, when they were a couple together)

Vikki: We were a perfect couple when we first met, we promised each other we would marry each other one day!

(We see vikki on her phone, until she spotted a picture of Loona with another female hellHound saying “with my girlfriend at lulu world”)

Vikki: But all that changes when you decide to go out with another girl!

(Then we cut to another scene where we see Loona and Vikki arguing, then we cut to a final scene where we see Loona walking out of the room with vikki crying)

Vikki: And I bet you didn't even care once about me!

(We then cut back to the present, where Loona looks at vikki with tears in her eyes)

Loona: I DID CARE ABOUT YOU!

(Then Loona turning around to face vikki with tears in her eyes, vikki appears mildly taken aback at Loona's revelation)

Loona: I DID love you, I did!

(One of Mark's imps see's Vikki and Loona and his gun pointed at the two Hellhounds direction, Vikki reacts quickly and pushes Loona to the ground. As they crawl to bar stand, Loona turns to vikki)

Loona: Look, I'm sorry for everything! I, it, I was-! *sighs*

(She looks down with sorrowful sigh)

Loona: It was my fault. 

(Vikki still gives her a look of disapproval)

Vikki: Glad you could admit it. Want a medal?

Loona: Look vikki, I'm sorry…

(Then we cut to the same flashback, we're we see Loona leaving vikki's apartment)

Loona: I am so sorry you got so hurt…

(Then Loona pulls out her phone and sees a picture of her and vikki in bed cuddling, until Loona let's out a tear as she whimpers)

Loona: sorry for what I did, and I... I know I can never make it right.

(Then we cut present, as we see Loona still talking to Vikki)

Loona: *let's out some tears* I mean, I do hate— SHIIIIIIIIIIT!

(As Loona was about to finish her sentence, the imps and fish demons fire their guns at the two Hellhounds, until they run out of bullets and vikki peeks her head out)

Vikki: *shouts at the imps and fish demons* Trying to have an emotional moment here, dickheads!!

(We then cut back the blitzø, moxxie and Millie as they kept fighting and shooting the imps and fish demons. Then we cut to Lucy and mark still fighting, until they locked hands at each other)

Mark: *grins* You know, once I kill you and become the new ruler. I'm gonna have fun with that hellHound of yours as my personal bitch!~

(Once he said that, Lucy was beyond piss off)

Lucy: *full demon form* YOU STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM HER!!

(Then Lucy punches mark, casing his glasses to break from it)

Mark: *Angry* You bitch, you know how expensive those glasses were?!

(Then they start fighting again, until we cut to Loona and Vikki. As they try their best to dough the bullets)

Vikki: So, why didn't you try to tell me any of this? Or come see me? Even once would've been fine!

Loona: I tried, but even since you cheated on me. I didn't want to see you ever again!

Vikki: I never cheated on you!

Loona: You didn't? 

Vikki: No! Because someone sent me a picture of you cheated on me first!

(Eventually, they both share a look of realization)

Loona/Vikki: *realized* Oooohhh…

(Until they heard the bullets firing at them, until vikki grabs a gun from one of the fish's demon dead bodies and starts shooting at them)

Vikki: Look! Misunderstanding or not, it's hard to just forgive you. It's been 7 months, *shoots three demon fish* and that's so much time... But! *shoots another imp* I guess you didn't really ruin my love life.

Loona: Wait, so, I didn't break your heart when we broke up?

Vikki: I mean, it felt painful... *hits a goon with a knife* and challenging, and y'know *puts her guns down* FUCK YOU STILL, BUT... It's not like I'm broken. And I now have someone who understands me and…

(She then pulls out her gun and shoots more of Mark's goons)

Vikki: HYAH, HYAH, FUCK YOU!

(Then she Grabs another gun from the dead imp and shots every single imp and fish demon she sees)

Vikki: My life has actually been pretty great.

Loona: Yeah, that's lovely. You got a good thing going with lucy, don't ya?

Vikki: Oh yeah, it's been... *blushes* Fantastic... *flustered* UH, CUZ YOU KNOW, IT'S A GREAT GIG! And, hehe, and she's got the LONGEST TONGUE! You know? LIKE THE SLIPPERY AND SLIMYS TONGUE YOU EVER SE-...

Loona: Yeah yeah yeah, I get it, I get it! *puts hand on her shoulder* I'm happy for ya, vikki.

(But their moment was ruined as more imps and fish demons tried to shoot them, but Loona and Vikki shot back at them. We see Lucy and Mark still fighting, until Lucy throws her head at Mark's right arm and chumps it off. As Mark's right arm falls to the floor, mark screams in pain)

Mark: *in pain* FUCK!!

(As he hold his right arm, he looks sees his minions were dead and he narrows his eyelids at Lucy, as he looks at her menacing)

Mark: *narrowing his eyes* You may have won this round Lucy, but sooner or later. *Demonic voice* I WILL BECOME THE NEW RULER!!

(Then mark runs out of the hole he made, leaving Lucy, vikki and the I.M.P crew panting after the fight)

Millie: *panting* Well,..that was something.

(Then Moxxie faints and falls to the floor, then we cut to the outside of the palace to see ambulances and news reporters in front of it after what happened. Then we see Lucy talking to the reporters, until we see Loona talking to Vikki)

Loona: So, I guess that was something none like any other huh?

Vikki: Yeah, I guess it was.

Loona: So, *puts her arm around vikki's shoulder* friends? 

Vikki: *starts smiling* friends, *puts her arm around Loona's shoulder*

Loona: Well, I guess I should be going now. See ya *Walks away*

(As Loona was heading towards the van, vikki stops her)

Vikki: Oh, Loona,...

(Loona stops in her tracks and looks at vikki)

Vikki: *smiles* It was nice seeing you again.

Loona: *smiles* Me too, vikki, me too.

(As Loona walks towards the van, she looks at vikki one more time and waves goodbye. Then she enters the van and it drives off. As Vikki see's the van driving away, she pulls out her phone and sees the picture she still had of Loona throwing up. Until she deletes it and it switches to show a picture of Loona and Vikki putting their hands together into making a shape of a heart. As vikki looks at it, she smiles to it)

I’m having a huge back-and-forth with a catering company I really like and I feel like I may be missing a glaringly obvious point here + would like some advice before I sent ANOTHER email LOL

I’m planning to do stations at my wedding with the additional hand-passed appetizers at the cocktail hour. I talked to a friend in catering and she said for a wedding of my size (110 before RSVPs) that two stations with some apps makes sense. Here’s where I’m getting confused:
Each station has multiple options within it (e.g., we want to do a fried chicken station- that comes with two different types of chicken, mashed potatoes and corn). They have quoted us 110 quantity for EACH station, plus the hand passed apps as requested and we’re doing a coffee station for people who aren’t huge drinkers. 

I asked why we needed 110 of each station and they said in their experience it’s essential so we don’t run out of food… I definitely think I’m missing something, could someone please explain? The way I’m picturing it is they’re counting this so everyone could have essentially two dinners LOL and that can’t be right! I was hoping to overshoot it in case people wanted to mix and do like 60-70 of each.

1miehnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1miehnh/evaluate_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Evaluate the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60 Kit Review,"Brewing coffee is both an art and a science, and the Hario V60 Ceramic Pour-Over Coffee Set, Size 02, White, invites you to explore this fine balance. I’ve been an avid coffee enthusiast for years and experimenting with different brewing methods is my passion. When I got my hands on this pour-over coffee set, my mornings felt elevated, as if each cup turned into a small but meaningful ritual. From its sleek, minimalistic design to its efficient performance, the set offers plenty to love but isn’t without nuances. Here’s what stood out during my daily testing sessions.

**Design and Build Quality**

The ceramic dripper is undoubtedly the star of this set. The pristine white finish not only oozes elegance but also speaks to the quality and durability of the material. Ceramic is fantastic for retaining heat, making sure the brewing temperature remains consistent—a crucial factor in achieving a balanced, flavorful cup of coffee. Paired with a heatproof borosilicate glass server, the material combination ensures the entire setup looks and feels premium. I appreciated the BPA-free handle and lid on the server, which provided that extra assurance of safety and sustainability. While lightweight enough for home or office use, the set doesn’t feel flimsy in the slightest.

**Ease of Use**

This pour-over method definitely requires some technique, but it’s not as intimidating as it seems for beginners. The Hario V60 comes with a coffee scoop and filters, which takes the guesswork out for newcomers exploring manual brewing. As someone who’s used several types of pour-over coffee makers, I found this setup particularly intuitive. The ridges inside the dripper encourage an even flow of water, and once I got the pouring rhythm down, brewing became second nature. Whether it’s a fresh morning grind or a quick pick-me-up in the afternoon, the process feels surprisingly therapeutic.

**Strengths**

- Exceptional ceramic design for consistent heat retention.  
- The V60 dripper is incredibly lightweight but sturdy to handle.  
- Glass server with BPA-free handle and lid adds points for safety and aesthetics.  

[Check Hario V60 price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b01l6ocxas/)

**Performance and Coffee Flavor**

This is where the magic of the Hario V60 truly shines. With the right grind size—medium-fine worked best in my experience—the coffee produced has a bright, crisp profile that highlights the beans’ natural flavors. I brewed everything from a mellow Ethiopian blend to a robust dark roast, and the coffee grounds extracted cleanly and evenly every time. What excites me most about this method is the control it offers. Adjusting the pour speed and water temperature can unlock subtle flavor notes, giving you a different experience from batch to batch. However, you do need a gooseneck kettle for precise pouring. Without it, the technique can feel a bit cumbersome.

**Negatives**

- Requires a gooseneck kettle, which is an additional expense.  
- The ceramic dripper can chip if handled carelessly.  

**Target Audience and Practicality**

This pour-over set is fantastic for anyone who takes coffee seriously but may feel overwhelmed by high-tech espresso machines. It’s also a great choice for those exploring manual brewing for the first time. Having tried multiple brewing methods, I can confidently say this setup is as beginner-friendly as manual coffee-making gets. That being said, it’s less suited for people who need their coffee in a rush each morning—manual brewing does require time and effort. On weekends, when the clock doesn’t rule your life, this method feels meditative.

**Product Comparisons**

Now, comparing this set to competitors like the Chemex and AeroPress, the Hario V60 stands out for its precision and control. Chemex offers a similarly clean and vibrant taste but leans toward aesthetics and larger-serving sizes. The AeroPress, on the other hand, is faster and more compact but lacks the intricate flavor extraction that the V60 achieves. If extracting every nuanced note from your beans matters to you, the V60 takes the top spot.

**Value Proposition**

When considering the price, the build quality, and the consistently excellent coffee it produces, I’d say this set delivers fantastic value for the manual brewing enthusiast. Known for its durability, the ceramic material ensures longevity, while the included extras like the filters and scoop make it a ready-to-use kit. Investing in this product gives you the tools to enjoy café-level coffee at home without shelling out daily for barista-made cups.

# best Ice Cream Cone Chocolate? 2025 Review

The subtle difference between a good ice cream cone and a truly extraordinary one often lies in the quality of the chocolate lining. A well-executed chocolate coating not only adds a rich, flavorful layer but also prevents the cone from becoming soggy, ensuring a delightful eating experience from the first bite to the last. in 2025, the market offers a variety of chocolate options designed specifically for coating ice cream cones, each with its unique characteristics. This review aims to explore the top contenders, evaluating their taste, ease of use, melting properties, and overall value for both home enthusiasts and commercial operations.## Key features Analysis

The effectiveness of ice cream cone chocolate hinges on several crucial factors. These range from the type of chocolate used to the stability and ease with wich it can be applied to the cone.

**Chocolate Type and Composition:** Different chocolate types contribute vastly different flavors and textures.

The composition of the chocolate, be it dark, milk, or white, significantly impacts the final taste profile. High-quality dark chocolate offers a rich, intense flavor with a slightly bitter edge, appealing to those who prefer a refined taste. Milk chocolate provides a sweeter, creamier experience, often favored by children and those who enjoy a classic, comforting flavor. white chocolate, while technically not ""chocolate"" due to its lack of cocoa solids, adds a sweet, buttery note that can complement various ice cream flavors beautifully. The ideal chocolate for cone coating should have a balanced fat content to ensure a smooth, even spread and prevent cracking.**Melting Point and Viscosity:** Optimizing these is crucial for efficient application.

The melting point is a critical factor since it determines how quickly and easily the chocolate melts. A lower melting point may offer convenience but can also lead to a runny consistency that makes the application messy. Conversely, a very high melting point might require excessive heating, perhaps altering the chocolate's flavor and temper. The ideal chocolate melts smoothly around 110-120°F (43-49°C) and maintains a viscosity that allows for an even, controlled coating without being too thin or too thick.

**Hardening Time and Texture:** Creating the perfect crunch is a key element in the overall eating experience.the hardening time dictates how quickly the chocolate sets on the cone, influencing the overall production speed. A rapid hardening time,typically within 5-10 minutes at refrigeration temperatures,is desirable for both home and commercial settings. Furthermore, the texture of the hardened chocolate is crucial; it should be firm but not brittle, offering a satisfying snap when biting into the cone. The coating should adhere well to the cone surface without peeling or cracking, even when exposed to freezing temperatures.

**Flavor Profile and Intensity:** Choosing complementary chocolate to enhance the dessert.

The flavor profile of the chocolate must complement the ice cream, not overpower it. A subtle, balanced flavor allows the ice cream to shine while adding a layer of richness. The intensity of the chocolate flavor should be considered based on the intended pairing; as an example, a milder milk chocolate might be preferred for delicate vanilla ice cream, while a bolder dark chocolate could pair well with richer flavors like chocolate or coffee. Aromatics and secondary notes, such as hints of caramel, vanilla, or nuts, can further enhance the sensory experience.

**Ease of Application and Cleanup:** This plays a notable role in both commercial use and home use.

The ease of application is vital, especially for large-scale operations. Chocolate that requires minimal tempering or pre-treatment saves time and reduces the likelihood of errors. A user-kind application process could involve simple dipping or automated spraying. Clean-up is also an essential consideration; chocolate that cleans easily from equipment and surfaces minimizes downtime and waste.

## Core Benefits

Utilizing the right ice cream cone chocolate presents a variety of tangible benefits that enhance the overall product quality and user experience.

**Improved Cone integrity:** A well-formulated chocolate coating acts as a barrier, preventing moisture from seeping into the cone. This ensures that the cone remains crisp and structurally sound, even after being filled with ice cream. This is especially crucial for cones intended to be kept for extended periods or in humid environments. The chocolate's water-resistant properties preserve the structural integrity of the cone, delivering a more satisfying texture.

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** Chocolate contributes a delightful flavor dimension that complements the ice cream. A high-quality chocolate lining not only adds a layer of richness but also harmonizes with the different ice cream flavors, creating a balanced and enjoyable taste.From the initial bite to the last, the chocolate enhances the overall dessert experience.**Increased perceived Value:** The use of premium chocolate elevates the perceived value of the ice cream cone.Consumers associate high-quality chocolate with luxury and sophistication, which can justify a higher price point and increase customer satisfaction. Utilizing premium chocolate sets the product apart from competitors and creates a more memorable impression.

**Extended Shelf Life:** The lipid content in chocolate helps extend the shelf life.

adding a chocolate layer helps slow down any deterioration.

**Improved Presentation:** An evenly coated dark chocolate cone is far better looking and appetizing than the pale wafer cone.
An upgraded cone that is more enticing is a benefit to customers and brand reputation.

## FAQs Section

**what type of chocolate is best for coating ice cream cones?**
The best type of chocolate for coating ice cream cones depends on personal preference and the desired flavor profile. Milk chocolate is a popular choice for its sweet and creamy taste, while dark chocolate offers a richer, more intense flavor. Couverture chocolate, with its high cocoa butter content, melts smoothly and provides a glossy finish, but it requires tempering. Compound chocolate (also known as coating chocolate or confectionery coating) is an choice that does not require tempering and is easier to work with, but it may not have the same rich flavor as couverture chocolate.

**How do I melt chocolate for coating ice cream cones?**
Chocolate can be melted using a double boiler or in the microwave. When using a double boiler, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, ensuring the bowl does not touch the water.stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. When using the microwave, heat the chocolate in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until fully melted. be careful not to overheat the chocolate, as it can burn.

**Do I need to temper the chocolate before coating the cones?**
Tempering is only necessary when using couverture chocolate. Tempering involves heating and cooling the chocolate to specific temperatures to stabilize the cocoa butter crystals, resulting in a glossy finish and a crisp snap. Compound chocolate does not require tempering, but it should still be melted carefully to avoid graininess.## Competitor Comparison

Second time was just about 2 months later, it was memorial day, i slept late and slept maybe 6-7 hours again, felt tired and complained about being tired, ate food but didnt hydrate and drank a cup of coffee, got up to grab some socks, knelt down, and had a seizure. The third time was 2 months later, so a few days ago. I had decent sleep, went to bed later than usual, 6-7 hours of sleep, went on a run for the first time in a while ( wanted to get into it), came back and felt wrecked, made a coffee, was halfway thru drinking it when i had a seizure. I am now on keppra, but i wanted to ask about what this is. I dont feel an aura or anything, and i also all 3 times made a groaning noise before blacking out. I also remember groaning, thinking wtf is happening to me or wait its happening again, and black out. The third time felt much quicker when it happened than the first two, and my contacts fell out when i was awake, it was most likely the worst of the bunch. But i always make the same groaning sound, then black out, wake up after 2-3 minutes, cant remember what i did during the day for about a half hour.

# The Eternal Reel: Déjà Vu Cracks the Code of Time

*By writer/futurist ROC HATFIELD*

In a world obsessed with timelines—social feeds scrolling endlessly, AI predicting our next move—it's easy to forget that time itself might be the ultimate illusion. But what if your life isn't a live stream but a pre-rendered blockbuster, every frame etched in cosmic celluloid? That's the mind-bending premise of the block universe, a concept rooted in Einstein's relativity that suggests past, present, and future coexist in a static, four-dimensional slab. No flowing river of time, just an unchanging block where ""now"" is as relative as your GPS signal.

Enter the glitch: déjà vu. That eerie sensation of reliving a moment, like a skipped beat in reality's algorithm. For one anonymous thinker we'll call Alex, it hit during a mundane phone call. ""All of a sudden, I knew a person's name was going to get mentioned,"" Alex recounted. ""I realized I'd lived this moment before. I wanted to cut them off, but I froze—like I was encased in ice."" The name dropped, the moment passed, and Alex was left wondering: Was this a peek behind the curtain of a predetermined script? Or something quantum, a leak from parallel realities?

This article dives into this temporal rabbit hole, blending cutting-edge neuroscience, quantum speculation, and philosophical head-scratchers. As we hurtle toward an era of quantum computing and AI that blurs causality, experiences like Alex's aren't just curiosities—they're clues to whether we're players or pawns in the universe's grand simulation.

# Einstein's Timeless Block: The Physics of No ""Now""

Albert Einstein didn't coin ""block universe,"" but his special relativity laid the foundation. In 1905, he demolished absolute time, showing that simultaneity depends on your frame of reference—move fast enough, and ""now"" warps. The block view, or eternalism, posits spacetime as a fixed structure where all events are equally real. ""The universe is a giant block of all the things that ever happen at any time and at any place,"" as physicist Sean Carroll once put it.

The block implies unchangeable events: tomorrow as fixed as yesterday. Philosopher David Kyle Johnson warns of the implications: ""If what I will do exists before I even do it, it seems I have no real choice."" Alex's film-reel analogy nails it: time as a spool, our consciousness the projector light flickering frame by frame. But in this block, the movie's already shot—no reshoots allowed. Or is there? Quantum mechanics throws in randomness, suggesting probabilistic branches rather than a single reel. Some muse it could be a ""timeless recursion"" where loops echo across the block.

# The Brain's Time Warp: Decoding Déjà Vu

Déjà vu isn't rare—up to two-thirds of us experience it—but it's rarely cosmic. Science pins it on the brain's memory circuits glitching. Studies link it to mismatches in the temporal lobe, where familiarity signals fire without actual recall. ""It's a brain hiccup,"" explains psychologist Chris Moulin, often triggered by stress or fatigue. Sensory input hits unconsciously first, then consciously, creating a loop. Alex's frozen feeling? Classic. Dopamine overload might play a role too, and epilepsy studies show déjà vu spikes in temporal lobe seizures.

But harmless glitches can turn profound. Some describe ""déjà vu of insight,"" where unsolved problems echo past analogies. For Alex, it felt predestined, aligning with block theory's fixed moments. Yet, it's memory retrieval gone awry, not time travel.

# Quantum Leaks: Parallel Worlds or Pseudoscience?

What if déjà vu *is* quantum? Physicist Michio Kaku posits it as a ""leak"" from parallel universes, per quantum mechanics' many-worlds interpretation. ""Is it ever possible on any scale to perhaps flip between different universes?"" he asks, tying it to superposition and entanglement. Some suggest fragments from alternate realities bleed through, or retrocausality—future influencing past—plays a role. But mainstream science balks: no empirical link exists between subatomic weirdness and brain functions. Kaku's ideas fuel pop culture, from posts calling déjà vu a ""brief quantum glimpse"" to debates about it as proof of multiverses.

Online, users share wild tales. One described déjà vu as a ""timeline jump,"" complete with ear ringing and mental fog. Another called it ""a memory from the wrong direction,"" a ""ripple from a recursion."" Some liken time to a ""field"" where frequency shifts cause loops, echoing quantum vibes. Even an anecdote of a ""reality glitch"" in a coffee reflection felt like a matrix error.

# The Caster's Shadow: Free Will in a Fixed Frame

If the block's cast, who holds the pen? Determinism says physics' laws and initial conditions (Big Bang vibes) dictate everything—no conscious director needed. Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer quipped, ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."" Bertrand Russell echoed: ""All notions of matter were determined by the laws of dynamics.""

Yet compatibilists fight back. Free will exists if ""free"" means uncoerced actions, even in a determined block. Neuroscientist Anil Seth argues: ""The clockwork universe doesn't erase agency."" Quantum indeterminism adds wiggle room—randomness at particle levels could seed true choice, though it might just swap fate for chance. Alex's query cuts deep: ""If the past, present, and future are cast, who cast it?"" Science shrugs—perhaps a higher power, but that's metaphysics.

# Rewinding the Reel: Living with the Mystery

Whether déjà vu is a neural fart or a quantum wink, it underscores time's subjectivity. As we edge into 2025's quantum supremacy—computers simulating realities faster than we can blink—experiences like Alex's might evolve from anomalies to auguries. Is the film indelible, or can we hack the projector?

For now, lean into the freeze. Next time déjà vu hits, don't fight it. It might just be the universe whispering: You've been here all along. And in the block, that's eternally true.",1,1754412385.0,u_SUPERLIGHTNFT,0,1.0,False

Me (24F) and my bf (36M) have been together 4 years. Things are usually pretty great. He's super close to his family, which is mostly a good thing, but they live about an hour and a half away. So any trip is a whole day thing with the driving.
This weekend was his nephew's 7th birthday. Sweet kid, no issues there. But my job this past week was an absolute hell week. Genuinely, one of the worst in a while. By Friday night I was basically a zombie. I was just... fried. My brain was static and I could feel myself getting sick, you know that scratchy throat feeling? The last thing on earth I wanted to do was spend 3 hours in a car and then make small talk at a loud party full of kids.
Look, I told him on Thursday, way in advance, that I was just not gonna make it. I apologized and said I was so burnt out I needed the weekend to just not be a person, lol. I told him to please go, have the best time, and I felt bad so I ordered a pretty awesome Lego set to be sent right to their house.
He seemed a little bummed but said ""okay, I get it.""
He goes on Saturday. I send a happy birthday text to his sister. All good, I think. He comes home and I can just TELL. He's quiet, barely looks at me.
So yesterday, he hits me with the ""we need to talk."" He tells me he's really hurt. That his mom was asking where I was and it was ""embarrassing"" for him. That it looked like I didn't care about his family.
I tried to gently remind him that I was running on empty, that I literally felt sick. And that's when it spirals.
He starts bringing up old stuff. ""Well you didn't come to that BBQ in July either."" (I had plans with a friend I hadn't seen in a year). ""You seemed bored on the FaceTime call with my parents last week."" (I was tired after work!). It was like every time I've ever been anything less than 100% enthusiastic and available was suddenly evidence in a court case against me.
The line that really got me was, ""It just feels like you're the problem. You don't try."" Ouch.
And look, I get it. Family is his everything. A part of me is just screaming that I should have just slammed a coffee and gone. It would have made him happy and kept the peace. But the other part of me feels like... am I not allowed to have a breaking point? Does a good partner not understand when you're just completely tapped out?
I just feel like I'm being blamed for just... being a person who gets tired.

1. English is not my native language. Sorry for any mistakes.
2. I want this post to be anonymous for obvious reasons, so I will omit some facts.
3. At this point, there has been no cheating in any way, at any point.
4. I am very anxious while writing this, bordering on a mild panic attack, so please, be mindful.

I am a straight male, 25. My girlfriend is 24 and she's bi. We are both diagnosed with adhd, and so, we tend to act emotionally. We have been living together since 2022 and in the next three months, we will have our 4th anniversary of being together. I am currently gathering money for an engagement ring.

Our relationship is mostly stable and happy, but not without flaws, and especially the last 8 or 9 months have been very hard for us. My girlfriend has some baggage: for starters, she is dealing with eating disorders and obesity. This is hard for her both mentally and physically, and her hormones are all over the place, which in turn leads to many outbursts. Also, we do not get physical very much, maybe 3-4 times a month max, which angers me, as I tend to have a big libido. Her family is broken: her dad only sends her some money every month, and her mother is caring but also very, very insecure and manipulative. She probably has something akin to narcissistic personality disorder. And she secretly hates me, which makes family meetings very cringy and fakey. Also, my girlfriend is almost chronically tired, which leads to an unfair division of household duties. (Probably also something related to her health condition) There are a few other smaller problems, like her dog, having some form of separation anxiety, which makes him hard to deal with, especially when we want to get physical with each other; he just becomes jealous and starts attacking us.

But i am not perfect myself: you see I tend to be a very stoic and pragmatic person. I am very understanding. But some of these problems we are dealing with go back to the beginning. And after 4 years, i am sometimes tired. This leads sadly to me getting angry in the worst possible moments. I tend to yell, which i hate because my own parents also screamed at each other all the time. I sometimes doubt myself, especially i do not feel handsome and manly, when we have sex so rarely, even though my girlfriend says that i am attractive to her. And yeah, lately we have not been going out much. It's on me

Let's say around 6 months ago i started working in a company. I made a lot of new friends there, some gals, some guys. We tend to work well together. One of my female coworkers, let's call her Jessica started flirting with me lately.

She looks similar to my girlfriend, but is fitter. She has a similar sense of humor to her, and she is also a tad bit insecure. We started talking, because duh, we work together on the same project. But over time, we started talking more and more. And now she has an obvious crush - she seeks contact with me, always asking what's up or if i would like to drink some coffee with her. She likes baking. She once asked me, What's my favorite pie - Of course, 2 weeks later she baked an apple pie. She started to wear blouses with larger cleavages. She was even so obvious that today she told me that, before making any moves, she likes to befriend potential boyfriends, you know for the vibe check purposes, and that lately her friend gave Jessica a tarot reading, which revealed that she would meet a certain gentleman at work whose heart she would fight for. And this gentleman would have to make a difficult choice. xd

But the worst part is that i kind of like it. I feel good with Jessica. She's hot and i like spending time with her. And i guess i am a bit exhausted with problems in my own relationship. But at the same time, when my girlfriend hugs me in the night, it just sends me, how cute she is.   
  
I try to hold my distance. We haven't kissed or anything. And when i went out with her, it was only in a bigger group and with my girlfriend's consent (She does not have problems with me having female friends.) I feel bad, terrible even. And i also feel anxious as hell. Terrified. I do not wish to hurt anybody.

On the one hand, there's nothing theoretically holding us back. We don't have a mortgage or children. On the other hand, my parents love my girlfriend, and she's also met many of my friends. We have a history.

I feel bad that I ever even considered breaking up (much, much earlier, even in my last job), but I try to remind myself not to act rashly and to observe these thoughts. They usually pass.

So I want to ask what you think about this? Can you help me? What do I do? Should I tell my gf about my crush and should we consult couple therapist maybe? Should i just ignore it and see if it passess? Should i just ignore Jessica and burn that bridge, even if it will be hurtful for her? ",2,1754412199.0,relationship_advice,11,0.75,False

I’m hoping this page can help find the owner of these two dogs. The smaller dog’s name I believe is Sonny.

For the past two days a Rover pet sitter has been leaving the dogs totally alone, tied to a post, for multiple hours in the morning from 6am to 8am while entering the Harris Teeter at King Street to drink coffee, charge her phone, etc. They were out there distressed, crying and barking for the sitter to come back. She’s identified herself as a Rover pet sitter, and is hostile and hysteric when confronted. I called Rover’s emergency line yesterday and they stated there was nothing they can do.

The neighbors and I are heartbroken about this experience and believe the owners should know what’s happening to their dogs while they’re away. If anyone could help, it would be appreciated.",12,1754412138.0,nova,6,1.0,False

I have trouble making friends as I am socially awkward and such, so I was super happy someone else initiated wanting to be my friend. We have only hung out once and I initiated the lunch. Another thing I need to mention is she has kids and one of them has extreme autism. She brought him to lunch, which I was perfectly fine with. Since then, I have tried twice to hangout with her. Meetup events, one just a coffee house hangout and the other a board game one. Both events she said she was all for going (these events are free, so neither of us is spending money on it) and I would hear nothing from her in the coming weeks leading up to these events. Both times I reached out the day before to confirm with her if tomorrow still works. Only then, do I get a response, ""Oh sorry I can't, I have xyz."" I understand people with kids have their responsibilities, but the hangout was so nothing to her, she completely forgot about it and couldn't have taken two minutes to reach out to me earlier saying sorry I completely forgot I have xyz. It takes me reaching out for it to even occur to her. I know not everyone with kids does this to their friends, my best friend and my sister both have kids, both younger and they still hangout with me.

(I do hope this post is ok bc reddit rules are still confusing to me.)

What I’m about to say will be long but hopefully entertaining - I am, now, a game designer after all.   
Let the adventure being (/◕ヮ◕)/ ✧˖°. \*:・ﾟ✧

My name is Ziva✌️ - I will be your guide today. ᕙ( •̀ ᗜ •́ )ᕗ

**About the game**  
I'm currently developing a party card game called Table Read where you perform wild, scripted lines in absurd delivery styles like ""dying pirate,"" ""with an evil laugh"" or ""out of breath."" It's all about the theatrics. 

While watching the season 3 ""Ham It Up"" episode of Game Changers with Giancarlo Esposito, I was a disappointed that everyone was performing the exact same line. The idea stuck with me. It turned out that, my heart did, in fact, sing a song so loud... I had to sing along… ヾ(´〇\`)ﾉ♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ ﾟ

Table Read is essentially MSN's Take Some Direction but counter clockwise. 

**How to play the game**  
While there are a few variations on how to play Tabel Read, the core way is to act out the provided lines. Give it a try!

**YOU**  
*(Overly confident)*  
*Table Read was so much fun last night! Same time next week?!*

**YOU**  
*(Like a jealous robot)*  
*His name is Percival - sounds like he should be on a quest.*

**YOU**  
*(Excessively horny)*  
*My dearest Gertrude, I've come to inform you that the prize-winning cucumber from last year's county fair has, in fact, achieved sentience and is now demanding its own legal representation.*

**YOU**  
*(Like a TV anchor mid-meltdown)*  
*Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my coffee, done my stretches, and emotionally processed the 8th grade. But fine, let me explain. First, the raccoon was already inside the vending machine. Second, the chips were expired.*

**How can you help Ziva and Table Read?**  
I'm looking for playtesters to help me refine the game. Since it's still in its early stages, I need to confirm a few things, mainly whether it's both fun and easy to learn. I'd love to hear your thoughts on:

* How clear the instructions are.
* If the game's scenarios are engaging.
* Whether you have a great time playing with friends.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have. Your feedback is incredibly valuable, and I'm eager to make this a collaborative project. As a thank you for testing, you can submit your own ideas for the game cards in the feedback form.

**Ready to play test? (งᵔᗜᵔ)ว**

1mido2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestSeattleWA/comments/1mido2l/rob_saka_comp_plan_amendments/,Rob Saka Comp Plan Amendments,"I wanted to share this info to urge folks to reach out to Sakas' office and let him know your thoughts.

I know some people may disagree with me but I believe we need to aggressively plan to add density to housing in the coming 10 years and if we mess this up now we will only be hurting in the future:

**TL;DR:**

* Saka is reducing the Neighborhood Centers for Fauntleroy (near the C line and Vashon / Southworth Ferry) and Morgan Junction, while increasing it for High Point (adding a school to the boundaries, effectively adding nothing)
   * [Fauntleroy](https://www.theurbanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-04-2.19.43-PM.png)
   * [Morgan Junction](https://www.theurbanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-04-2.19.29-PM.png)
   * [High Point](https://www.theurbanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png)

The reasoning for the Fauntleroy reduction, which is substantial was this:

>Members of Fauntleroy’s neighborhood association started a letter-writing campaign in opposition to increased housing density, telling councilmembers that “the unique character of the Fauntleroy neighborhood will be damaged forever if the One Seattle Plan is implemented here.”

In Addition to this I also want to reach out to Saka and encourage him to support Alexis Mercedes-Rincks amendment for corner stores to be permissible on any lot, not strictly corners.

This would help us increase density of small local businesses and neighborhood amenities.

I would kill to have more access to coffee shops or stores that aren't on arterials where biking or walking is dangerous. I'd love to be able to walk 2 blocks for a coffee in the morning instead of 1 mile. While the mile walk is a nice break, I don't always have 40 minutes free in my day round trip to get it done.

I wrote a long email to Saka expressing my concerns on his amendments and urging more proactive zoning for density, while also asking him to support AMRs cornerstore (neighborhood business) amendment. I have also requested expansion to my neighborhood center boundaries.

I hope by putting this out here more people can engage with this process.

The 10 year Seattle comp plan is already overdue and it's being gutted by NIMBY activism.

One more point I also want to make - because we don't have state income tax - a major reason for our budget shortfalls is going to come down to sales tax. If we continue to restrict density we will choke off our primary source of funding for our communities. Taxes are collected in real estate transactions as well as simple adding more neighbors.

Ever walk into a local business and feel concerned because it never seems that busy? Let's invite more neighbors to support them and keep our haunts around. Let's keep rents manageable if not lower them and let's making housing affordable for everyone instead of choking our city out year after year.
