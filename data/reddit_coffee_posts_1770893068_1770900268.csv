It will be free for anyone to attend. Does anyone have any ideas of venues who wouldn't mind me using their space for this for free? Ideally within the south side shawlands, govanhill area. 

  
This session will be called Against the Algorithm and I will be organising some fun prompts around the stuff we see on our phones and the impact it has on us, the nostalgia we have for the internet before adverts and subscription models. 

  
It's my first time organising something like this so I will be lucky if even 5 people attended but I need to sort a venue before I can publish it. It would be really nice if i could provide tea and coffee and a jug of water for anyone that comes alone - happy to bring this myself. Any help would be appreciated.

1r2sdwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1r2sdwj/asheville_small_business_owners_has_anyone_here/,Asheville small business owners — has anyone here actually looked into AI agents yet?,"

Hey Asheville neighbors,

“AI” gets thrown around a lot it seems. Half the time it sounds like Silicon Valley hype, the other half it sounds like robots coming for your job.

But here’s a genuine question for local business owners:

Have you actually explored what AI agents can realistically do for a small Asheville business?

Not “replace your staff.”  
Not “turn your coffee shop into a sci-fi lab.”

I’m talking about practical stuff like:

* Answering common customer questions automatically
* Following up with leads so you don’t lose them
* Posting consistent social media content
* Handling appointment reminders
* Filtering and responding to inquiries
* Generating reports so you can actually see what’s working
* Even keeping upwith your company social media accounts regularly.

A lot of owners I talk to are either:

1. Too busy running the business to research it
2. Unsure what’s real vs hype
3. Worried it’ll be complicated or expensive

Totally fair.

The truth is, for local shops, restaurants, salons, breweries, contractors, etc., AI works best as a quiet assistant — not a takeover.

And it’s getting surprisingly accessible.

I’m genuinely curious:

* What would you automate *first* if you trusted it?
* What feels confusing or intimidating?
* Have any of you tried something already (good or bad experience)?

Let’s have a real discussion about it — no jargon, no nonsense.

If anyone wants to brainstorm what AI could realistically do in their specific business, I’m happy to chat in the comments or DM. I’ve been building automation systems for small businesses and I love helping owners think through what’s actually useful (and what’s a waste of time).

Asheville’s full of creative, independent businesses. Tools should support that — not dilute it.

Curious to hear your thoughts. 👇",0,1770900055.0,asheville,0,0.5,False
1r2sdn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volunteerism/comments/1r2sdn3/a_place_for_people_in_tokyo_with_dementia_to/,a place for people in Tokyo with dementia to volunteer: a pop up cafe,"From BBC World Service: · There's a café in Tokyo giving people with dementia a place to volunteer - and where pauses, mix-ups, and gentle confusion are welcome...

Orange Day Café is a monthly pop-up known affectionately as ""the café of mistaken orders."" There, muddled orders and long pauses aren’t seen as mistakes - they’re all part of the experience. That's because as well as serving delicious coffee and cakes, the café is giving people with dementia a place to volunteer and find a sense of community.

One the best-known volunteers, Toshio Morita, is in his 80s. He's become something of a local celebrity in the area, with his orange apron, chequered headband, and charming smile.

""It's fun and lively here when there are many customers,"" he says. ""I am excited when I see people enjoying their drinks, and when they start chatting to me.""

Mix-ups can happen in the café, but nobody minds. And the tables and menus are colour-coded to help the elderly waiters take orders. Toshio Morita has been working at the café for just over a year now, and his wife Masako says he always looks forward to it, but she worries how long he can continue:

""I wonder... if he can still do this, especially with his dementia symptoms progressing.""

Japan's population is aging, and the country's Ministry of Health estimates more than five million people will be affected by dementia by 2030.

Many of Japan's elderly also live alone - so when Akiko Kanna founded the Orange Day café, she wanted to give people with dementia a chance to find human connection.

Her own father was diagnosed with dementia five years ago. By the time Akiko was able to open the café, her father was sadly too ill to take part himself. But Akiko says running it has been a great experience:

""People want to draw a line between people who are disabled and abled. I don't like that,"" she says. ""Everybody needs a place to be needed.""

1r2scgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowStakesConspiracies/comments/1r2scgo/coffee_is_the_new_smoking/,Coffee is the new smoking,"50 years ago, smoking was pretty much standard in all environments. People saw no issue with needing some form of nicotine to start their day, deal with a stressful moment at work, or relax with a nice view whilst outdoors. Now that the world is more health conscious, people have replaced one small, socially acceptable drug habit with another - coffee (or rather, caffeine).

As someone who hates the smell/taste of coffee, and gets palpitations when having more than a long thought of caffeine, I'm observing this trend from the outside. People start every single day with a coffee - ""oh I can't get out of bed without my morning brew"" ""don't talk to me unless I've had my coffee"" etc., and these are socially acceptable things to say? Then every health/fitness/outdoors influencer loves to feature some fancy way of brewing coffee in their content, even lugging loads of complex kit up mountains with them to make a perfect cuppa with a view. 

Then the crowd of ""if I stop drinking coffee I get headaches"" - the whole thing is a socially normalised drug addiction and corporate plant to make up for lost cigarette sales.

I've recently started learning Thai and I had a simple need : being able to manually select the characters I want to review and quiz myself on them. I looked around but couldn't really find an app that does this simply, so I decided to build my own.

The app is not meant to be a multiple choice quiz for now. So grab your notebooks and pens.



*No account to create, no imposed learning path, just cards and a quiz.*

>**Heads up, this is a work in progress (WIP).**



The core features are there and functional, but the app will keep evolving. I'm actually fullstack webdev freelancer so i work on it everyday.

[https://thai-flashcards.app](https://thai-flashcards.app)



*What it does :*

* Support English / French language
* Browse Thai characters as flashcards
* Select the ones you want to review
* Configure and launch a randomized quiz based on your selection
* Navigate and Pause/Resume during the quiz
* Results at the end
* That's it.

*Good to know :*

* No sign-up, no account required
* The app is installable (PWA) : from your browser, add it to your home screen
* Works 100% offline
* Free, no ads

*Here are some planned improvements :*

* Rework of all UI elements as I'm not really happy with them yet
* Detailed pop-up for each card (including sound, different fonts, illustrations maybe, etc)
* Settings: dark/light theme, global font choice
* More advanced display filters (live/dead/obsolete, final sound, position)
* Proper contact form for suggestions, bugs, improvements or anything else
* Adding numbers, tones, the 20 \[ai\] words and other language specifics (ร, อ, etc.)



I want to keep the app 100% free. If there are actually users down the line, I'll figure out a way to help cover costs (mainly the server). Probably with a ""buy me a coffee"" button or something along those lines somewhere.

I don't want any third-party intrusion like ads or pop-ups that would ruin the experience.

If you give it a try and have any feedback, corrections or improvement ideas, I'd be more than happy to hear them. Feel free to drop a comment here, send me a DM or contact me by the app directly.



**Thanks in advance and happy learning !**

To put it short, I find myself constantly thinking of her, literally can't get her out of my head! And the real mindblowing part? She's not even the most attractive physically, but somehow I am attracted like a magnet! Her eyes are so deep, it's like she stares into my soul. Never happened to me before. I mean, she looks OK, but nothing extraordinary, but for some reason, I don't even care! I am hooked.

  
Anyway, she's giving me hot and cold signals. Examples of hot signals:

1. Offered me a ride once and we had a nice talk over family issues, work, life, kids, etc.

2. Caught her staring at me several times. When she notices, she instantly looks away

3. When we talk, we stare into eachothers eyes, and it feels like the environment around us just blurrs

4. I find it very easy to open up with her, and she tells me things about her and her family. Nothing too dramatic, but those little personal things

5. It feels like we communicate without words. At times she knows exactly what I'm about to say! Like when you're trying to find the right word, and she just says it right upfront as if she read your mind! 

Cold signals:

1. Her text replies are very short. Nothing inviting or extended. 

2. She kind of hangs out with other male friends, which I know for certain try to flirt with her. 

3. She rarely initiates contact or conversations. It's ususlly me who starts them and she follows. 

4. I sometimes test her by arranging settings that will allow us to be together, in a very crabby way (not direct, but to make it look like a coincidence), but she offers to invite others too, which I find rather discouraging.

At some point, I just had enough, so I stopped initiating, texting, offering coffee, and all those little gestures (giving her food, asking how she was, offering help or assistance). 

This was going on for 2 weeks, and I'm sure she noticed or felt the difference (I try to be as nice as always when she does ask me something or approach me, because I don't want to ruin our work relations). 

Anyway, last time, she approached and offered to drink some coffee together. We did and had some deep conversations. In a different occasion, I grabbed something to eat and probably said something about not having a spoon, she heard that and offered me hers. 

I think that if she weren't interested, she probably had no reason to act like that. On the other hand, all those hot and cold, closeness and then staying aloof and cold dynamkcs just drive me mad! 

  
I have no idea where this leads, but I'm curious to find out. She intruiges me as a person and at the same time, I say to myself: get over it you fool! You're hallucinating.

  
Fellow scorpio females - please share your advice!! 

  
Me: cancer sun, aries moon

Her: scorpio sun, taurus moon

  
One more detail, which is VERY important is that she knows I'm in a relationship. She is single though. 

  
I don't know what the hell is going on, but I certainly know that I'm in some deep sh\*t over her.

Steve Bailey’s Notes; Miss Bea would not want you to know, she is only 82 years young. LOL. Her birthday is in September. Her family reunion was Thanksgiving weekend in 2019 & so she visited with me at Anson County Historical Society office on Tuesday, November 19, 2019 & so she wanted to know about places to visit in Anson County on Thanksgiving weekend, so after we treated ourselves to a delicious Alaskan white fish meal for lunch at Pa's Country Kitchen in Lilesville NC & then we came back to Wadesboro & I pointed out to her James Price's Antiques & then we went to visit Julian & Melanie at the Dream Inn Bed & Breakfast on South Greene Street in Wadesboro (next door to First Presbyterian Church) regarding their available rooms for that weekend & then we rode by Lord George Anson Antiques on Camden Road & then we rode over to Speckled Paw Coffee House on West Wade Street & she signed up for the Speckled Paw Email Newsletter. Anyway, Miss Willie Beatrice left Wadesboro with lots of brochures to pass out to her relatives at the family reunion –

The following tribute was copied from the Alpha Alpha Chi Omega Chapter - Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated website; 

Ms. Willie Beatrice Colson is a retired Administrator, Lifelong Educator, youth church leader, advocate for senior citizens, and a native of Anson County. 

Miss Colson attended Johnson C. Smith University and was initiated into the Gamma Delta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated in the Fall of 1961. She is now a Golden Member and a Charter member of an AKA Graduate Chapter. She stated that a lot of her political involvement stemmed from on campus involvement through the sorority. The supervising graduate chapter was comprised of many highly visible and politically astute women, including former regional director Dr. Doris R. Asbury. They were taught how and where to conduct voter canvasing and everything political in the black neighborhoods. Their training, she recalled, was provided by nationally known political leaders. 

JSCU’s varsity and choir travel tour bus took them to other NC HBCUs on the weekends for political leadership and trainings. Ms. Colson recalls interacting with Jesse Jackson, Nikki Giovani, Dorothy Counts Scoggins, Dr. Dorothy Yancey, and Malcolm X. Ms. Colson was not yet at an age where she could register to vote, but she attended voter sessions, marches, and worked to register potential voters in Monroe. 

Miss Colson graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in 1964 with a Bachelor’s degree in Education and began a lengthy career. Colson also has an endowment fund in her honor, The W. Beatrice Colson Endowed Scholarship at Johnson C. Smith University. 

When she graduated, she began teaching in High Point, NC and after a short period, she began teaching at Winchester Avenue School, which was segregated, until they desegregated the Monroe City Schools in 1967. She began teaching at Benton Heights and taught there until 1982 when she moved to Monroe Middle School and taught 6th grade Language Arts and Social Studies. In addition to her Bachelor’s degree, she has also received a Certificate of Advance Study from University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the Master of Education Degree from University of North Carolina at Greensboro. 

In 1984 she was hired as Assistant Principal of Walter Bickett Elementary School and in 1985, she was hired as Principal of East Elementary School where she remained until she retired in 2004. Colson also has an endowment fund in her honor, The W. Beatrice Colson Endowed Scholarship at Johnson C. Smith University. 

Ms. Bea has a long life of service. In addition to being a 50+ year and Life member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated® she is a member of the JCSU Charlotte Chapter Alumni; Planning Board Member for the town of Wingate; Chapter Member and Chaplin of the Lion’s Club International (Wingate); Committee Member of Union County Home and Community Care Block Grant; Union County Delegate for the NC Senior Tar Heel Legislature; Alternate Delegate Member for the Area Agency on Aging (Region F); member of the Charlotte Section of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW); Life Member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); Wingate Precinct Officer Member of. Union County Democratic Women, and more. 

In 1988, Ms. Colson was awarded the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. She has also received the Key to the City of Monroe, and they recognized May 16-23, 2005 as the Beatrice Colson (Ms. Bea) Week, Outstanding Young Educator, Principal of the Year, North Carolina Black Leadership Caucus Outstanding Service and Membership Award, Union County Black Leadership’s Julia B. Baker Award for Community Service, and recognition from Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. through their Dove Award for Service to the Union County Community. 

Today, Ms. Bea is still active in her community and her focus is on the underserved elderly residents of Union County. Ms. Colson is an active member of the Prestigious Pearls of Anson and Union Counties Interest Group. She also serves as a trustee for the Mt. Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church in Wadesboro, NC. 

It is obvious that the HBCU experience and the influence of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated® further ignited the drive for service in the heart of Ms. W. Beatrice Colson. In speaking with her, it is evident that she is a jewel and a treasured resource.

I need some wlw dating advice from some more experienced sapphics because I'm unsure what I'm doing loll.

So, me 18 (f) bisexual, have been on dating apps for a while. The thing is since I'm young, Idk much about how to navigate the sapphic dating world? When I have been interested in women or men I always make the first move, so since I've been on dating apps I've sort of been waiting for girls I'm talking to, to do it since I'd like some change lol. 

Most of the time though, it doesn't go anywhere. The latest situation I was in involved me and a girl talking for about a week and then she went offline for five days.

I've now matched with someone new who lives only 2 miles away from me last night, and we spoke this morning too. I don't always know when the right time to ask someone on a date is and I have decided that I'm going to do it this time because I don't want to be in another situation where both of us are talking and neither really make that first step. 

The thing is, I don't know how long to wait before asking a girl on a date? It's valentines day in two days and was thinking of suggesting we do something light e.g. getting coffee or going to the park but I don't want to freak her out by asking her too soon. I also don't want to wait too long, so that she thinks I might be uninterested?

Does anyone know what a good time-frame typically is? Ofc, the valentines day thing is an idea I had it doesn't have to be definite, I have no problem waiting longer, I'd just like to hear the queer community's opinions on talking stages and lengths of time. ",1,1770899624.0,ainbow,0,1.0,False

1r2s6nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1r2s6nt/i_think_my_previous_manager_want_me_back_but_i/,I think my previous manager want me back but I don't know if I should,"Sorry, my English is not my first Language, forgive me if I write something wrong or confusing. 

So when I were just graduated at 18, I got a job at a 3 star hotel as a commis chef, I have a co-worker that's half my age (I'll call her T), she were the head chef so she's above me, I see T as my mentor, she's always guilding me and taught me alot of things, and my naive self trusted her so much that I do anything she told me to, treat her like my guidance and almost feels like a mother to me (I never have a mother figure in my life so whenever I have an older woman who's show love and care for me, I become very happy and start to attracted to them). 

The drama happens when the F&B manager suddenly quit and leaving her spot empty and T volunteered herself and got approved. After becoming the manger, she told me to eavesdropping to every conversation and tell her everything I heard, I trusted her too much so I just do as she said without a second thoughts, then she used all the information I gave her a long with her new access to the cameras to schemes and sabotaging the kitchen team and report any single mistake to the HR, causing a lot hard times for the kitchen team. My co-workers also started to hate me because of it, I told her about it and she said that I did the right thing, they got what they deserve,  they were just jealous because I got her and they didn't. 

So when I can't stand it anymore, I jumped department to become a waitress under her management. T suddenly no longer the kind and gentle woman I knew, she used me for every situation (makes me work on my day off, tell me to fetch things for her, make me handle every problem on my own), manipulate me, jokes on my weight when she's literally half my size, making me feels fat and ugly for a long period of time,  keeps making me feels like owned her something. I hate whenever I own someone something, when people buys me anything, I got that urge of needing to repay them, and T take advantage of it, she forced things upon me, I never asked for her to buy me foods, medicines and declined when she asked so she stop asking, just buy them for me anyway, only to go around and brag about it, telling people her credits, telling them how good she is for taking care of me with the things I didn't asked for, taking care of me one by one. Since she's already bought food for me so I bought coffee for her, the coffee shop is not far, only a building away and the price is not that high. I used to buy her once everytime I got my salary but slowly it's become my daily chores, using my own money because I got guildtrip when she once said ""I give you more than just money"" 

I once told her that when I quit working here, I will never come back, and she told me ""you'll crawl back to me in 1 or 2 years"" and when I said I won't them she just laugh ""we'll see"", that's the part that I realize that she's always make me think that I am nothing without her, I cannot leave this place because I can't survive without her. So when I finally got fed up and start to talk back, she did not take me serious at all, when I tried to avoid her, she comes to my face and sit in front of me, smirking. She even unfriended me, I didn't notice until she send me a friend request after a week only to tell the others that I got scared of her for unfriended me so I begged her to add me again. Her ego is huge, she always said that ""I don't like being flattered, it's sound fake"" and have her ego hurt whenever I tell the truth and always feel extremely satisfied whenever I flattered her with sweet praises. 

Once when  her ""jokes"" went too far, humiliated me in front of my co-workers, calling me ""an idiot but always act so smart""(only because I typed the wrong brand of beverage), calling me fat all the times, telling me to eat slow and lady-like, making me thought that I eat like a pig, we had a fight, a big one, she told me what is wrong with me and I told her I were hurt only for her to say ""it's just a joke, can't you even take a joke?"", I told her again that I were hurt only for her to nod and say ""okay"" and pull out her phone and asked me ""so you want to quit, huh?"" What else can I do? Keep working only make the situation only got worst so I said yes and she texted the HR about me quiting. 

I though that were the end but only to be told by one of my co-worker that after I quit, T ran around talking behind my back, framed me, calling me ungrateful, crying with fake tears ""she blocked me after she yelled at me that she quit"" ""she called the HR telling that she'll quit the next day without a thought"" ""she left me without anyone to replace her"" ""she's a traitor, I did everything for her and now she's treating me like trash"", she unfriended me first, I never once block her, I just stop texting her. And when I tell the chairman's assistant about how fake she is, T said ""how could she do this to me?""

Months after I quit, a friend of mine that's still works there asked me ""what if T send you a friendrequest and text you, will you accept her?"" I immediately knows that it's T tell her to ask me so I said no, I won't, I still cannot forgive her for all those things. And a few months more, my friend asked me again, telling me that T actually REALLY cared about me, telling me that T is not the same as I think, telling me that T is still trying to ask about my well-being, my life, where do I work, then ask me the same question, I don't know how to answer, I don't want to be mad after almost a year of leaving that place, I'm in a much better place now, but she left me a trauma that makes me feels like talking is a sin, I'm scared of trusting anyone now, I'm scared to ask for help with anything because I'm scared that what if they take advantage of me like she did, I don't know what to do...should I just say no and tell her to stop asking about me or just forgive her and see if she's gonna apologize. 
(Thanks for patiently read this post, I really appreciate it)

I took the max dose since I was so spooked by this new constipation I’d be suffering… 3+ days of nothing. It worked about 6-7 hours later and I was cleared and gave myself diarrhea. Then I discovered that my frequent use of painkiller seems to be what was causing the diarrhea, so I decreased my intake, and I started taking fiber and colon cleanse gummies. I also took 2 Imodium pills to stop the diarrhea cuz it was a lot… now, a week later and I don’t recall having had a bowel movement since the Imodium. So I decided to take 2 last night instead of 3 so I wouldn’t have such diarrhea again… but it’s been 10 hours and I don’t feel the same urge like last time. Can anyone offer insight? I don’t hydrate well but I never did and never had constipation issues because things like cereal and oat milk, coffee, and alcohol kinda “balanced” me out… I drink alcohol less these days and cut the coffee as well to just occasionally… but I eat lots of yogurt and still have oatmilk and cereal and nothing is helping:( I’m concerned something is very wrong.",1,1770899437.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

For the longest time, Manesar has had a very specific reputation. When you hear ""Manesar,"" you think of factories, the Maruti Suzuki plant, heavy trucks, and industrial grids. You definitely don’t think of ""luxury living"" or ""forest trails.""

But real estate in the NCR region has a funny way of surprising us. Just when we thought we had the map figured out, a new disruption arrives. This time, it’s [**M3M GIC (Gurgaon** ](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/property-details/m3m-gic-manesar)**International City)**.

Spread across **Sector M9, M10, and M11**, this massive 150-acre township is trying to do something that hasn't really been done in this belt before: turning an industrial powerhouse into a lifestyle destination.

https://preview.redd.it/4gqx60bx42jg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f55d67713ecbc79757ec62014a1beb362d029105

If you are an investor looking for the next growth corridor, or a homebuyer tired of the clutter in central Gurgaon, M3M GIC Manesar needs to be on your radar. Here is why this project is more than just a new launch—it’s a shift in the city’s center of gravity.

# What Exactly is M3M GIC?

First, let’s clear up the alphabet soup. GIC stands for **Gurgaon International City**.

The name is ambitious, and frankly, so is the master plan.

M3M isn't just building a few towers here. They are building a self-contained ecosystem. Think of it as a ""city within a city."" The project is a mixed-use integrated township that combines three distinct worlds into one seamless campus:

1. **Ultra-Luxury Residences (M3M Forestia):** High-rise homes designed for the modern family.
2. **Premium Industrial Plots:** Spaces for businesses to set up offices, R&D centers, or light manufacturing.
3. **High-Street Retail:** A commercial spine to ensure you don’t have to drive 20 kilometers for a good coffee or a movie.

The idea is simple: You live where you work, but you don't compromise on the ""living"" part.

# The Residential Zone: ""Forest Living"" in an Industrial Hub?

This is the part that catches most people off guard. How do you create luxury in Manesar?

M3M’s answer is the **""Forest Living""** concept.

The residential clusters (often referred to as *M3M Forestia West* and *East*) are designed to be an oasis. The developers have dedicated a staggering amount of the land parcel to greenery—nearly 70-80% of the area is open space.

* **The Homes:** The configurations here are generous—**2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 BHK apartments**. These aren't the cramped ""affordable housing"" units you might expect in emerging sectors. They come with wrap-around balconies, floor-to-ceiling glass facades, and layouts that prioritize ventilation.
* **The Vibe:** When you enter the residential gate, the industrial world outside disappears. You are surrounded by dense tree groves, water bodies, and landscaped walkways. It is designed to lower the ambient temperature and improve air quality, creating a microclimate that feels distinct from the rest of the highway belt.

# The Business Edge: Industrial Plots

If you are a business owner, this is where things get interesting.

Finding a clean, legal, and well-connected industrial plot in Gurgaon is a nightmare. Most existing plots are either in dilapidated estates or legally disputed.

M3M GIC offers **Grade-A Industrial Plots** ranging from **400 to 1800 square meters**.

Why does this matter?

* **Plug-and-Play:** These plots come with ready infrastructure—wide roads, power backup, and modern drainage. You aren't buying raw land; you are buying a developed asset.
* **The Ecosystem:** You are situated right next to the big boys—Maruti, Honda, and the supplier ecosystem of IMT Manesar. For logistics, warehousing, or assembly units, being part of this supply chain is invaluable.

# The Connectivity Cheat Code

The biggest selling point of Manesar has always been its road network, and M3M GIC sits right at the nerve center.

* **NH-48 (Delhi-Jaipur Highway):** You are practically hugging the highway. This means effortless connectivity to the rest of Gurgaon and Delhi.
* **KMP Expressway:** The Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway is minutes away, acting as a bypass for heavy traffic and connecting you to the rest of NCR without entering the city chaos.
* **Dwarka Expressway:** With the cloverleaf junction operational, you can now bypass the Kherki Daula toll mess and zip straight toward the airport or Delhi.

# The Lifestyle Upgrade

Let’s talk about the ""Soft"" aspects.

Usually, living in an industrial zone means sacrificing social life. M3M GIC solves this with its massive **Clubhouse and Retail Plaza**.

* **The Club:** We are talking about a 5-star level clubhouse with temperature-controlled pools, bowling alleys, co-working spaces, and fine dining. It’s designed to be the social hub for the thousands of families who will live here.
* **Retail Therapy:** The high-street retail component ensures that your weekends aren't boring. Brands, cafes, and daily conveniences will be right at your doorstep, creating a vibrant nightlife that Manesar currently lacks.

# The Verdict: Who is this for?

**M3M GIC Manesar** is a specific product for a specific audience.

* **If you work in IMT Manesar/Bhiwadi:** This is a no-brainer. You cut your commute to 10 minutes and upgrade your lifestyle to luxury standards.
* **If you are an Investor:** You are buying a diversified asset (mix of residential and commercial demand) in a high-growth corridor. The rental yields here—driven by the expat Japanese and Korean workforce in Manesar—are historically higher than standard residential zones.
* **If you are a Business Owner:** The industrial plots offer a rare chance to own a freehold asset in a gated, secure environment.

Manesar is shedding its ""factory"" image, and M3M GIC is leading that makeover. It’s bold, it’s big, and it might just be the smartest bet in the NCR market right now.

Every semester I convince myself that if I just show up to the department’s “writing sprint” or a lab co-working block, something magical will happen and I’ll leave with 10 pages drafted and a clean plan for the week. In theory it sounds great: accountability, structure, vibes, people around you grinding so you do too. In reality, it’s been the same pattern over and over. We book a room or hop on Zoom, spend the first chunk talking about who’s behind on what, which committee meeting was awful, or someone’s PI email that ruined their morning. Then we do the “ok let’s do 25 minutes” thing, but half the people are still whispering or typing loud or asking quick questions that turn into mini side conversations. I try to be the responsible one who redirects us back to work, and I instantly feel like the annoying hall monitor. Last week I went to a “shut up and write” session for my dissertation chapter and I came prepared like it was a battle: outline printed, refs ready, headphones, snacks, the whole deal. Within 15 minutes we were debating what counts as a “real” writing day and whether it’s better to start with methods or intro. Someone else kept walking in and out to make coffee, which is fine, but each time the door opened I lost my train of thought. Another person was doomscrolling job ads and sighing every two minutes and I could feel my brain copying that panic. Four hours later I had added a few citations and rewritten the same paragraph three times, and then I went home and did real work alone at night because I was mad at myself. I don’t want to be a hermit, and I get that community matters in a long program, but I’m starting to wonder if these groups help anyone who isn’t already self-directed. Or maybe I’m doing them wrong and I’m just bad at group settings. For people who have made writing groups or study groups actually useful in a PhD, what were the rules that mattered? Do you keep it silent no exceptions, do you ban “quick questions,” do you set a concrete deliverable before you start. I’d love to hear what’s worked, because right now it feels like I’m wasting my best focus hours on the aesthetic of being productive.

1r2s0y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cocobeebee/comments/1r2s0y9/carpet_cleaning_service_because_vacuuming_isnt/,Carpet Cleaning Service – Because Vacuuming Isn’t Always Enough,"https://preview.redd.it/c40jz5xs32jg1.jpg?width=3375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9eee924a00d7ad9a7b49dc1bc99ca9709a754c1

Let’s be real for a moment.

Most of us vacuum our carpets and assume that’s enough. The surface looks fine. There are no major stains. Everything seems clean.

But then slowly… the carpet starts looking a little faded. The room doesn’t smell as fresh. It feels slightly rough under your feet. That’s when people usually search for [carpet cleaning near me](https://cleanindiacare.in/professional-cleaning-services-in-delhi-ncr/) — not because the carpet looks terrible, but because something feels “off.”

At Clean India Care, we see this all the time. Carpets may look clean on top, but deep inside, they hold dust, allergens, and dirt that regular vacuuming simply cannot remove.

**What’s Really Hiding in Your Carpet?**

In a city like Delhi, dust is everywhere. Even if you clean daily, carpets quietly collect:

* Outdoor dust and pollution
* Fine sand particles
* Food crumbs
* Pet hair
* Moisture from humidity
* Bacteria and allergens

Over time, these particles sink deep into the carpet base. Every step you take presses them further down.This is exactly why clean india care’s best carpet cleaning services are not just about appearance — they’re about hygiene.

If left uncleaned, the trapped dirt slowly damages the fibers. That’s why carpets start looking old before their time.

**When Should You Book Professional Cleaning?**

You don’t have to wait for visible stains. Here are simple signs:

* The carpet looks dull even after vacuuming
* There’s a mild smell in the room
* Allergies feel worse indoors
* The carpet feels rough instead of soft
* It’s been over 12 months since deep cleaning  

Most clean india care’s customers who call us for carpet cleaning near me say the same thing after service:  
 “I didn’t realize how dirty it actually was.”

That’s the difference professional equipment makes.

**How Carpet Cleaning Does It**

We don't simply do a clean with a carpet cleaning, we do a complete clean.

Our first step is to inspect the type of carpet we have. Each type of carpet requires a different method of cleaning. After that we use high powered vacuum cleaners to remove all the loose dust.

After we finish removing the loose dust, we treat each stain or spot separately. There are many different types of stains that have their own method of treatment like: coffee, tea, oil and ink stains require different methods of treating.

Next, we do what we call deep extraction cleaning. This is where our cleaning machines will take out dirt from within the fibres using both steam and hot water extraction. This will remove a great deal of dirt that regular home cleaning machines will leave behind.

If you were looking for carpet cleaning near me, you’ll find the deep extraction cleaning method is the most important factor to your overall satisfaction.

Finally, we will ensure that the carpet is thoroughly dried to prevent excessive moisture from being trapped inside your home.

With us, you will have the best possible carpet cleaning in Delhi that is safe, deep and effective.

**How can dirty carpets look clean?**

Rental or do-it-yourself carpet cleaning machines may seem like a way to clean carpets, but they do not really work. It leaves too much water behind, and it does not extract enough cleaning solution to remove soap residue. While rental and do-it-yourself carpet cleaning machines only clean the top of your carpets, they do not extract dirt and grime from within the carpet fibers, and within a couple of days, the dirt and grime will return.Because the dirty carpet was not properly cleaned, dirt remains inside the carpet fibers from rental or do-it-yourself carpet cleaning machines, and therefore customers eventually call Clean India Care for professional carpet cleaning near me.

When people search for the best carpet cleaners in New Delhi, people typically want three things: deep-cleaned, safe carpet cleaning, and no damage to their carpets. This is exactly what we specialize in.

**Health Benefits You Shouldn’t Ignore**

Carpets trap allergens and dust mites. That’s normal. But if they aren’t cleaned regularly, indoor air quality suffers.

If you have:

* Kids
* Elderly family members
* Pets
* Allergy issues

Regular carpet cleaning in Delhi becomes even more important.

Offices also benefit. Clean carpets make workspaces feel fresher and more professional. Many companies now schedule routine carpet cleaning near me services to maintain hygiene standards.

**How Often Is Ideal?**

For most homes, once every 6 to 12 months is enough.

If you have pets or heavy foot traffic, every 6 months is better.

For offices, every 3 to 6 months works well.

Waiting too long makes cleaning harder and may permanently damage fibers. That’s why timely carpet cleaning  helps protect your investment.

**Simple Maintenance Tips**

After getting service from the [carpet cleaning in Delhi](https://cleanindiacare.in/best-delhi-ncr-deep-cleaning-service-near/), here’s how you maintain it:

* Vacuum twice a week
* Clean spills immediately
* Use entry mats
* Avoid over-wetting during spot cleaning
* Rotate furniture occasionally

Small habits make a big difference.

**The Final Words**

Carpets are subjected to tons of dirt, shoe prints, waste and pollution. While vacuuming helps to remove the surface of your carpet, vacuuming alone does not fully remove all hidden dirt within the fibers of the carpet.

A Professional[ Carpet Cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet_cleaning) Near Me can remove hidden dirt from the carpet that contributes to the cleanliness of your home, relieve your carpets from feeling less than their original plushness, and enhance the air quality that you breathe within your home.

When customers tell us that we provide the best carpet cleaning, we take that compliment seriously! For Clean India Care, cleaning is much more than just the visual appearance of the carpet. It is about providing your home with cleanliness, hygiene, comfort, and long-term maintenance of the carpet.

A freshly cleaned carpet will not only affect the floor but will affect the whole room!



**(FAQ) Frequently Asked Questions**



1. How long will it take to have my carpets professionally cleaned?

Cleaning time will depend on the dimensions of the area and how dirty the carpeting may be. When it comes to an average-sized house, cleaning a carpet usually takes between 1 and 2 hours. For larger houses and/or office spaces, Cleans will take a bit longer.

2. How long does it take for the carpet to completely dry after the carpet cleaning process?

Drying times will typically range from 4 to 8 hours depending on how much air circulation is available to assist in the drying process. To ensure your carpets fully dry, we recommend not walking on the carpet until it has completely dried.

3. Is carpet cleaning safe for kids/animals?

Yes, all of the materials used by Clean India Care are safe for kids and pets. Once your carpets are 100% dry, you can use them without concern of any danger to you or your children and/or animals.

4. Will old stains be completely removed by Clean India Care?

Old stains may come out but, due to the age of the stain or possible damage to the fibers themselves, it is possible that they may not come out 100%. Clean India Care will always inspect the carpets and give you honest guidance prior to doing any work.

5. How often should I schedule my professional carpet cleaning?

Most homes are professionally cleaned every 6 to 12 months. Families with pets, children, or a lot of foot traffic may want to schedule carpet cleanings every 6 months to maintain a hygienic environment and to extend the life of the carpets.

6. What types of services should I be looking for in a company that does carpet cleaning near me?

When doing carpet cleaning you are going to want to find a company that has techs that are trained in carpet cleaning, uses modern equipment, offers safe cleaning solutions, and has good customer reviews. A professional service should provide deep extraction cleaning methods, use appropriate drying methods, and provide clear pricing for their services. By selecting Clean India Care to provide carpet cleaning near you will ensure that your carpets will be thoroughly cleaned and no damage will be done to them in the process as well as leaving your carpets smelling great for a long time.

Naturally, iced coffee is the only proper drink for that. Also I didn’t reckon on the paper bags nor having handles.

Other supporting evidence: I’m the only one who can properly drive in the snow. Every time I drive on 20 and someone in front of me misses an opportunity to turn left on an unprotected green, my car gets an earful of “Jesus Christ, why you driving on FUCKin 20 if you can’t make a left there?” I’ve braved the Basket on the day before Thanksgiving and been to Shaw’s in pajamas and sandals in a moderate snow flurry. I contemplated baptizing the car mechanic with my coffee after he had the balls to say I should have gotten him one after I spent forever waiting for him to show up in 15 degrees with the sidewalks I had to brave to get that coffee covered in ice.

I crave attention!
And I will accept attention from literally anyone.

Strangers.
Bots.
People with usernames like xX_DaddySlayer420_Xx.

All of who know absolutely nothing about me.
If you have internet access and the ability to type “u look good,” congratulations—you now control my emotional stability.

These people know ONE thing about me:
A carefully selected angle.
Good lighting.
And a caption I rewrote 14 times.

They don’t know my favorite side of the bed.
They don’t know I hate small talk.
They don’t know I’ve watched the same comfort show so many times Netflix is concerned.

And yet I’m like:
“Yes, random username with a cartoon avatar, please tell me I’m amazing. Your opinion matters more than my therapist’s.”

Why am I built like this?

Why does one “🔥🔥🔥” from a stranger hit harder than 10 compliments from people who have seen me in sweatpants with questionable life choices?

I’ll ignore sincere praise from people who love me…

But one stranger says “damn” and I’m ready to reinvent myself. 

Anyway. This led me to an important question:

Am I an attention whore?
An attention slut?
Is there a difference?

Because both seem fully committed to the same lifestyle:
Posting. Refreshing. Overthinking.
Emotionally thriving off crumbs of validation.

One just sounds more professional.

 Actually..can I take a moment of your time?! 

 REAL TALK...we need to talk about this because I'm tired of people using these terms interchangeably. They are NOT the same thing.

An attention whore is transactional. They're in it for the metrics. They need your likes, your comments, your shares. They're posting their gym selfie at 6 AM with some bullshit quote about ""grinding"" because they NEED that dopamine hit from strangers. They're checking their notifications every 30 seconds. They'll argue with you in the comments because engagement is engagement, baby. They're monetizing your eyeballs.

An attention slut, on the other hand?   They're doing it for the love of the game. They don't care if you like them. They just need you to ACKNOWLEDGE their existence. They just want to be perceived. They're telling the same story for the fourth time at the party because they genuinely enjoy the performance. They're not checking if you liked their post - they're already moving on to the next bit. They'll do a dramatic reading of the Denny's menu just because there's an audience of two people present. Pure, unmonetized chaos.

The attention whore is a businessperson. The attention slut is an artist.

The attention whore wants your follows. The attention slut just wants you to witness them.

In conclusion, the attention whore is playing chess. The attention slut is playing Calvinball while wearing a costume they made from tinfoil.

Both are valid. Both are exhausting. And I'm definitely an attention slut and I'm not sorry about this 47-paragraph Reddit post.

Issue with not being able to drink enough because of aversion and nausea

I've had this issue for a good while. I try to drink more, but I just don't feel any need to. I'm almost never thirsty and even when I'm pretty dehydrated, I take two sips and done. I can't force myself more. I always get so nauseous, I don't vomit, but it's really forced and I feel like I can't swallow. It's especially hard with swallowing medications, I always feel like I'm gonna throw up just when the meds and water touch my mouth. Soups don't really help, it used to but it's basically the same, I get aversion and nausea and can't finish. Eating is fine. I can drink some flavored stuff, chocolate milk, soda is easier but still won't drink it even when the bottle is next to me, coffee which is dehydrating and that's basically it. I have limited resources, I'm at a mental hospital but I keep forgetting to tell this to the doctors and idk if it's even nessesary + I don't wanna end up with IV.

But the more I play around with my brewing variables—especially temperature stability—the more I realize it’s actually a pretty solid tasting protocol.

​The Water ""Hack""
Most people drink the water after the coffee to wash down the silt. But if you drink it before, it’s a total game-changer for the palate. If you can manage to brew without incinerating the beans (staying strictly around that critical 94°C / 201°F threshold), the water clears out your taste buds so you can actually catch those subtle, nutty, or even fruity notes of the roast. If your mouth isn't ""clean,"" even the best beans just taste like ""coffee-flavored smoke.""

​The Lokum Factor
Turkish coffee has a massive ""mouthfeel"" because of the suspended silt and high TDS. It’s a very heavy, tactile drink. The starch and sugar in a small piece of lokum actually act as a ""reset"" for your tongue's tactile receptors.

​What’s interesting is that if the brew temperature isn't controlled—and the water hits a rolling boil that chars the grounds—the coffee becomes so bitter that the lokum just feels like a ""sugary bandage"" to mask the flavor. But when you manage to ramp the heat slowly (mimicking that traditional sand-brew speed) and keep it below boiling, the coffee and the aromatics of the delight (like rose or pistachio) actually start talking to each other rather than fighting.

​The Takeaway
Turning the ritual from a ""habit"" into a technical sensory experience makes me appreciate the effort in the cup so much more. It’s less about tradition and more about optimizing the chemistry of the drink.

​How do you guys handle the side glass? Water before or after? And has anyone found a specific pairing that actually works for them? (Personally, double-roasted pistachio is the hill I'm willing to die on).",1,1770898143.0,TurkishCoffee,0,1.0,False

However, when managing a vast inventory, scaling product photography and videography can be challenging. 

Amazon sellers often grapple with finding the right balance between efficiency, quality, and cost. So, how can they achieve flawless **listing images** and videos across thousands of products without overwhelming their resources?

The answer lies in streamlining processes, adopting innovative tools, and implementing scalable solutions. This article will explore effective strategies that Amazon sellers can use to manage bulk product visuals, ensuring that every product gets the spotlight it deserves.

 From automation techniques to outsourcing tips, we’ll cover everything you need to know to scale your product listing images and videos efficiently.

# Key Techniques to Optimize Product Shoots for Amazon Listings

# Use High-Quality Equipment

Quality photography equipment will really make a difference. Smartphones have improved the quality of their cameras, but nothing beats the clarity and sharpness of professional cameras. DSLR cameras, good lighting kits, and a good tripod will ensure that the **listing images** look professional.

For instance, the DSLR camera can reveal finer customer details on a product- for example, the texture on a leather handbag, or the thread stitching in a pair of jeans-which will give the customer a great idea of the product’s quality.

# Lighting

Lighting is one of the critical aspects of [product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-strategies/). Bright lights ensure that the colors of the product to be photographed are accurate and the details come out clearly. 

Soft, diffused lights are best used to do away with harsh shadows and give a look closer to a naturally set product. For smaller products, lightbox and softbox lights are especially helpful.

* Example: Shooting jewelry softer lighting can bring attention to where the sparkle and shine happen, without glare or shadows appearing in reflections or sharp crevices to make listing photos look better to buyers.

# Seamless Consistency Across All Products

The heart of optimizing product shoots for multiple products is consistency. If you sell a range of items, ensure that your **listing images** have the same style, background, and lighting. It makes your Amazon store look polished and streamlined throughout, which creates brand identification.

* Example: If you are selling kitchen utensils, photograph all the utensils from the same angle with the same background and lighting. That will give your Amazon storefront a polished and professional look.

# Multiple Angles and Close-Ups

Customers tend to see all aspects of a product before making a purchase. Ensure you provide several listing images, which show your product in different angles, plus close-ups of features that are considered important. This helps customers better understand the size, texture, and functionality of your product.

* For a case, show pictures of the front, back, and sides of the phone, as well as zoomed shots of the material and texture. Special features, such as shock absorption or unique designs, can also make **listing images** more detailed and appealing.

# Use Props to Show Usage

Sometimes, the customers may find it a little challenging to think of how they can use a product when they just see it. You can make this easier by including props in the product pictures that will explain its purpose and appeal. Ensure that the props are not more prominent than the product.

* Examples: In case you are selling a set of knives, you can show them in action by slicing fruits or vegetables because this will give the customer a better idea of how the product functions and how sharp it is.

# Professional Photographers or Studios Hire

If a large inventory or high quantities are required, then professional photographers or studios could be hired for the task. This is because these are professionals with experience and equipment needed to handle big projects.

 By outsourcing them, you will be free to work on other elements of business while ensuring your images will always have good quality.

* Example: Many leading [Amazon sellers work with product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-3d-rendering-vs-product-photography/) studios that specialize in e-commerce. These studios understand how to meet Amazon’s requirements and can produce consistent, high-quality **listing images** in bulk.

# Lifestyle Photography

Add [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) along with product photos, so the buyer can see how the product will look in their world. Lifestyle photography is the description of the [product in the real world and makes listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/) images more relatable and attractive.

* For instance, pictures of a tent mounted in a camp with people nearby can be used for a camping tent so that the visitor pictures themself using the product and thus reaches a higher conversion rate.

# Optimize Image Editing and Retouching

The final and the most critical part of photography is editing. Photo-editing software is to be used to adjust the brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color balance for clean and professional images. 

Imperfections in images are to be removed in **listing images**. However, there should not be over-edited images as this will deceive the customer, thereby generating dissatisfaction.

* For instance, if there is a little scratch or blemish on the product, retouching can minimize that flaw and hence make it seem flawless in images for listings. Just ensure the final product matches the picture to prevent complaints from your customers.

# Use 360-Degree Photography Or Videos

For those products where customers need to see every single detail, 360-degree photography or videos are really effective. It is an interactive approach which allows customers to rotate the product and view it from every angle, thus giving a more complete understanding of the item.

* Example: For a pair of shoes, 360-degree photography will be able to showcase the design, stitching, and texture from all sides. This is a big game-changer for products where appearance is a major selling point.

# Batch Your Photography Sessions

All product shoots go in batches to save on time and resources. Take many products in one session, using the same setup and lighting. This will save you a lot of time and provide you with very consistent **listing images.**

* For instance, you will take photos of all the items in one shot while photographing a line of cosmetics such as lipsticks and foundations, reducing on time that takes on setting and removing equipment as well as images which come with the same lighting style.

# Tag your Images Properly for SEO

[Optimizing listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-on-optimizing-your-amazon-listing-images/) does not just end with taking the picture. If you want to get more [traffic on your Amazon listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-increase-amazon-listing-external-traffic-20-tips/), make sure you name your image file correctly and add alt text which carries relevant keywords to improve visibility in search engines.

* For instance, instead of providing a file name “IMG\_001.jpg” , assign the name as “red-leather-handbag-front-view.jpg”. This helps search engines understand what an image represents and strengthens the SEO of your product.

# Infographic-Type Images for Major Features

For products that have several features, you can create an infographic image of the most important ones. That kind of listing image quickly communicates the benefits, and customers easily understand what differentiates your product.

* Example: If you are selling a blender, an infographic image can list features such as “500W motor,” “stainless steel blades,” and “5-speed settings.” The visual image helps convey the information rapidly and effectively.

# Monitor Competitors’ Images

Study your competitors listing images, as you might learn much: note their lighting, angles, or special techniques used, and try to learn from them about your strengths in the images that you capture.

* For example, if images of the competitors’ comparable products look flat and lifeless, then consider additional angles as well as lighting for enhancing **listing images**.

# Rotate Images Periodically

Replace the [product line](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-fba-tools-and-strategies-for-expanding-your-product-line/) or better products and refresh the listings by ensuring that your photographs represent these changes accurately. Browsing through pictures will have customers believe your listings stay fresh, so it’s appealing to return to shop your new inventory.

* Example: Whenever you redesign your packaging, ensure you take new photographs which present the new look. Thus, you will be guaranteed that your **listing images** will always be updated and accurate.

# Videography Tips for Managing Large Product Inventories on Amazon

[Every Amazon seller must](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/top-5-chrome-extensions-every-amazon-seller-must-have/) capture the attention of a buyer. Videos help customers see a product in action and help clarify features and benefits, far better than what pictures do. But how do you manage the videography for a large inventory? 

Below, we are going to explore 15-20 practical techniques that can help Amazon sellers streamline and scale their videography efforts effectively.

# Create a Video Style Guide

One requires setting a style guide for ensuring uniformity of all the videos that are going to be used in marketing a product. The lighting angles, transitions, fonts, and background music guidelines should be indicated.

 Working with many people saves time. This way, your brand identity shall shout, especially if there is upbeat music and clean white backgrounds, and every video copies that template.

Instead of shooting one video at a time, schedule appointments to record multiple products in a single setup. This saves time in setups on lighting and cameras. 

* For example, if you have a set of kitchen gadgets, shoot all the products on the same day, using the same kitchen setup. You’ll find this technique particularly effective if your products are similarly designed or function.

# Pre-write the Videos Scripts

Pre-writing scripts keeps focus while shooting and minimizes missing crucial features of the product. Every script should outline the most important selling points, benefits, and other features of the product. 

* For example, if you are presenting a blender, the script might have phrases such as “1200-watt powerful motor” and “three speed settings.”

# Consistent Backgrounds and Lighting

Having the same backgrounds and lighting in your videos will make your Amazon store appear sleek and professional. Designate an area specifically for filming and keep up with good controlled lighting so that all your videos look uniform. 

Several sellers use light tents or even LED light panels to make sure the lighting conditions remain the same.

#  Use Automation Tools

Automation will also make editing easy, especially if you are working with hundreds of videos. With Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, you can make templates that you can use on your hundreds of videos. 

This will save you time and effort from repeatedly posting the same items like logos, intros, and outros. Example: an automated editing template can add your brand intro and a product description to every video with little manual input.

# Invest in Quality Gear

Although it is easy to compromise on the camera and microphone, good quality equipment will make the video very attractive. Bad quality videos will even make the buyer shy away, despite having a fantastic product. 

* For instance, with a DSLR camera or mirrorless camera using a good macro lens, details in products are easily captured and appear more attractive.

# Use Turntable Displays for 360-Degree Views

Use a turntable display in recording 360-degree views of your products so that you allow the customer to view the whole thing from all angles. The display is quite helpful when a shoe or a jewelry product features design aspects that the viewer has to see the front and back or back sides and top or inside designs.

Position your product on the turntable. The product should rotate very slowly while you are filming its rotation.

Close-up shots make the audience focus on specific points that may differ from your product. When you shoot, keep zooming in aspects of the product that speak about quality, functionality, or any point of difference. 

* For instance, when selling a smartphone case, close shots of the material, ports, and buttons help view the quality and fit in the customer’s eyes.

Videos demonstrating how to use the product in actuality help the potential buyer understand the nature of the product. For instance, do not just take a photograph of a coffee maker as it sits on the countertop.

 Instead, demonstrate how one goes about making a cup of coffee using the appliance. Identify the ease of use that makes it stand out, for instance, one-touch operation. This gives the customer an understanding of how well it performs and if it can be relied upon.

# Video production: Outsource to experts

If the video production is too overwhelming to handle in-house, consider doing it with professionals. Most agencies specialize in [product videos](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-ways-you-can-make-your-amazon-product-videos-stand-out/) and can handle everything from scripting to editing. 

For the Amazon seller who has thousands of products, it will be very useful since most professional teams are geared toward handling bulk video production.

# Use B-Roll Footage Effectively

B-roll footage is supplemental footage that can add depth to your video-a product from different angles and in various contexts. 

* For example, if you are selling yoga mats, then footage showing someone unrolling it, stretching on it, and rolling it back up is essential; this way, the viewers get a much richer visual experience and understand how to use the product.

# Focus on the Benefits, Not Just the Features

Although highlighting features is very crucial, customers are more responsive to the kind of benefits. For example, do not say the blender has “three-speed settings.” Rather, outline how you can use each to make a smoothie, soup, or sauce. 

This puts the customer in a position to think about how this product might make life easier or less complicated.

# Green Screens Versatile Background

Green screens make it easy to change the background. This really does help in saving time and even resources, especially when filming different products. 

A green screen can give the audience an impression that a product is being used in such a setting as a kitchen or office setting without necessarily having to move from one location to another. It does this with much less expense, and is flexible in post-production.

# Use Basic Animations and Graphics

Any text overlay, animation, and infographic added to your video can make it more educating and entertaining. For example, a short animation on assembling how easy it is to assemble a product can be explained better to the customer. 

The use of graphics in displaying major features may quickly point out what information is being kept forward for the customer.

# Storyboard Before Shooting

Storyboarding keeps the visual planning of your video flowing in a coherent manner. This preparation reduces as much reshooting as possible, and everyone involved will have a definitive view of what the final video will look like.

 For example, a basic sequence sketching for a product demonstration video can help streamline the filming of the video process.

#  Use the Same Content in Multiple Channels

Repurpose your product videos on as many platforms as you can. You can share these videos on social media, your product pages, and even on advertisements. 

A product demonstration video for Amazon can be reduced to a 15-second clip for Instagram or TikTok. This is maximization of the value each video gives you and allows more reach for your product.

#  Use Slow Motion for Emphasis

Slow-motion shots can be used to emphasize a point that you want to make about your product, such as a detail that would otherwise go unnoticed when shown at its regular pace. If your product happens to be a waterproof watch, then a slow-motion splash of water on it will work for the presentation.

# Get Feedback and Iterate

Once your videos are live, pay attention to feedback from customers. Look at engagement metrics to understand what’s working and what isn’t. Are viewers watching the videos all the way through, or dropping off after a few seconds? Use this information to refine future videos and improve your videography strategy.

# Keep Videos Short and Focused

Keep product videos brief and simple; short attention span. Optimize video for 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Hug the essentials and avoid extraneous detail. For instance, with a simple product, like a case for a phone, the video would focus on how it fits, the quality of the material, and how easy it is to install.

#  Good Use of Music

Background music can be a fantastic addition to the viewing experience if done appropriately. Choose music that matches the personality of your brand and does not dominate the narration or product sounds. 

Upbeat cheerful music would work very well for lifestyle products, while more serene music would do better for health and wellness items.

# The Role of Automation in Scaling Photography for Amazon

# Understanding the Need for Automation in Product Photography

The idea behind product photography is to assist in the creation of **listing images** that could grab the attention of customers and clearly communicate the features of a product. 

While some of the products can be done manually, it becomes highly impossible when there are thousands of them. Without this automation, sellers may face quality inconsistency, delays, or increased costs.

* For example, imagine a supplier selling home furnishings; one item has many variations and thus one has to list several images. It is unwise to waste time manually taking the pictures from different angles and colors in size. Thus, automation improves productivity because it reduces human interaction in its operation while at work.

# Automation and How to Improve Product Photography

Product photography automation may be the use of tools and software that minimize inputs. Here are some ways that automation can benefit an Amazon seller:

# Batch Editing Software

One of the most important challenges in dealing with a large inventory is editing product images: color correction, removing backgrounds, and standardizing listing images for all the products can consume hours of manual effort. 

Batch editing software can attend to thousands of images at one time, saving hundreds of hours of manual effort. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom have a feature called batch processing, which allows sellers to apply consistent edits to hundreds of photos at a go.

* For example, a fashion accessory seller may have to tune the brightness and contrast on their **listing images** to help them pop on the page. A seller will not do this in batches by having to open each photo separately to edit individually but, instead, will use a batch editing software that applies one setting on all of their pictures uniformly.

# Automated Photography Systems

The high-volume seller is beginning to take to automated photography systems. They feature automated turntables and lightboxes, which capture several angles of a product with little effort. 

Devices can be preset to camera angles, lighting, and rotation speeds to create consistent, professional **listing images** without requiring the operation of a photographer.

* Example: An electronic devices seller can take several angle shots of every product to depict details. Utilizing the automated photography system, he could set up the equipment to take shots at every 360-degree rotation and ensure all details are captured in high-quality listing images.

# Image Recognition and AI Tools

AI-enabled tools can detect wrong backgrounds, lighting, or where a product is misplaced and correct it automatically without any human intervention, thereby saving time and, more importantly, meeting strict guidelines at Amazon.

* Example: An AI tool scans a batch of photos; those that do not match the Amazon requirements- incorrect background color or insufficient resolution, for example. This means that sellers will know sooner what needs to be changed to ensure **listing images** uploaded should be problem-free with much less manual checking.

# Benefits of Automation for the Amazon Seller

# Quality Consistency

Keeping all **listing images** of quality is the foremost benefit of applying automation in product photography. 

Consistency plays an important role in creating professional brand images. Automated systems ensure a uniform light, angle, and background setting for each of the photos, eliminating any discrepancies that may arise.

* Example: The health supplement vendor can use automation to take the picture of the bottles all from one angle and at one type of lighting so that listing pictures will look the same as they cross the board.

# Time and Cost Savings

The saving of time and money is another benefit of automation since it reduces manual labor. Sellers do not have to hire large teams to handle product photography since most of the work can be performed by the automated systems. 

For small businesses, this proves very helpful as they cannot be able to hire professional photographers for every product.

* Example: A small-scale retailer selling home appliances will save half the time in producing listing pictures by using an automated turntable and batch-editing software.

For Amazon sellers, time is of the essence. They can take an advantage when listing new products quickly. Automation allows for quicker processing of listing images, thereby allowing sellers to get their products live on Amazon without any unnecessary delays.

* For instance, if a seller is launching a seasonal clothing line, he may photograph, edit, and upload **listing images** for all new items using automated tools and then sell them faster.

# Practical Applications of Automatic Amazon Tools for Sellers

# Orbitvu Self-Shoot Automated Photography Platform

Orbitvu offers solutions to automate photography for all sellers of e-commerce shops. With such a setup, the user places their product inside, and an excellent set of listing photographs will be captured from various views. 

All a seller should do is to set-up the lighting, rotation, camera one time and the self-shoot will repeat what it is set to so it ensures uniformity.

# Pixc for Batch Photo Editing

Pixc is a photo-editing service that allows batch processing. The sellers will simply upload their batch of product photos and let Pixc’s software automatically remove backgrounds, light them up and get those **listing images** ready for Amazon. No more tedious one by one editing is required.

Clean white background is usually a requirement for images in Amazon listings. [Remove.bg](http://Remove.bg) is an automatic tool that can easily extract the background of a product photograph to meet Amazon requirements. Several photos can be uploaded, and the processed images will come back within seconds.

# Overcoming Obstacles Through Automated Product Photography

While automation does much to simplify the process, there are challenges that sellers might face. For one, initial setup costs for automated systems can be high. There is also something of a learning curve in terms of figuring out how to best use these tools.

 Second, not all products are well-suited for automation. Items with detailed features, for example, will likely still require hand photography to perfectly capture all aspects of the product.

* For instance, an individual who sells handcrafted jewelry would have a hard time using the automated system since the jewelry has very complex designs. A hybrid approach would thus be more useful, such as using automated systems for shots while photography done manually will be used to take close-ups in detail.

# Tips for Successfully Implementing Automation

# Product Turntables for 360-Degree Photography

The perfect new addition to your automated setup can be a product turntable, such that you get to quickly shoot views of the 360-degree angle of a product, very popular on Amazon. 

The practice of installing a turntable, which rotates and captures images from several angles without human involvement, can help make the production of **listing images** much smoother.

# Automated Background Removal Tools

Background removal in product photography is the most tedious task. Thousands of hours are saved with automation. With the help of background removal tools, you can now automatically separate products from their backgrounds and create clean, professional listing images.

#  Mass Image Editing

When you are dealing with hundreds or thousands of products, editing **listing images** one by one is not practical. Instead, use software that allows batch processing.

 This will enable you to apply the same adjustments, such as brightness, contrast, or color correction, to multiple images at once, so all your visuals will have a consistent look.

# Set Up Automated Video Recording Stations

Similar to photography, automation can be applied to videography. You might set up a station where the products are placed, and videos are automatically recorded. 

* For example, you might have a system that takes a product from multiple angles, creates slow-motion shots, or even zooms in on some specific features without having a cameraman.

# Auto Crop Image and Resize to Amazon Specifications

Amazon has certain demands about what images to list: dimensions, and an aspect ratio. The automated cropping and resizing ensures that each picture you utilize is presented in a fashion ready for Amazon without needing to look at every single one, saving you lots of time in getting products listed.

# Utilize Automated Naming Conventions for File Management

This means thousands of **listing images** to keep track of-the nightmare. Set up a system to name images automatically by product SKUs or identifiers. This could be handy for instant finding, organization, and uploading to Amazon, saving you time and limiting the potential for errors.

# Use Automation for Product Image Metadata

The second thing is that alt text and keywords in Amazon SEO should be included in image metadata. Once you set up automated metadata entries for your listing images, every picture will be optimized, so you will probably improve the search results for your product.

#  Schedule Regular Maintenance of Automated Systems

Even though they are automated, photography and videography systems need regular checks. Plan maintenance procedures to ensure all works properly. For instance, clean the lenses, check lighting fixtures, test automated turntables, and be ready for the likelihood of something breaking in the workflow process.

# Workflow Required to Process Batches Efficiently

It is important that your workflow follows the automation process so that you do not waste a lot of time. For instance, categorizing your products, photo shoot automation, and batch editing afterwards. A good workflow will enhance the efficiency in making listing images, hence saving some turnaround time.

# Integrate Automation with Inventory Management System

One of the greatest ways of improving your system is through incorporating your photography and video making automated system with your stock management application. You, therefore can automatically upload to shoot schedules new items introduced into your inventory, and image links can also be set for the related product listing in Amazon.

# Teach Your Staff on How to Run Automated Systems

Automation does not mean you don’t require skilled staff. Your crew must be trained in how to use, debug, and fine-tune automated photography systems. They need to be able to simply change settings or replace parts to ensure that the process continues to run well, for instance.

# Utilize Pre-Scripting to Automate Videography Capture

Automate your videography by scripting your shoots in advance. For example, you can program the camera to start and stop at certain intervals, zoom in and out, and pan across the frame at specific times. This way, you will get the shots you need without having to manually control the camera, which saves time and reduces the possibility of human error.

# Set Up Automation For Image Watermarking

If you want the images of your listings protected from unauthorized use, look into automating the addition of watermarks. This way, you can easily add watermarks to as many images as you need automatically, so that all your graphics are protected without needing to apply them manually.

# Using Automated Lighting Controls for Consistent Shots

Lighting is essential in photography and videography. Utilize auto controls on lights with the capability to adjust brightness, temperature, and angle depending on the product that is being shot. 

Reflective products would be better shot with softer lights while more detailed products will be more exposed to brighter light and focused lighting.

# Automate Quality Control Process

Quality control is also not left behind in automated processes. For instance, you should invest in software that flags a listing image or video based on certain set standards of the house you are looking at. 

* For instance, it may be an example such as if the picture is not clear hence requiring you to take retakes while considering this problem.

# Track Performance Metrics to Optimize Automation

Automation can indeed be a great productivity booster, but improvement is continuous. Track performance metrics such as time per shoot, number of retakes required, or issues with specific equipment. Leverage this data in streamlining your setup to make **listing images** more efficient over time.

# Plan for a Backup with Manual Intervention

Be prepared for contingencies. Even though automation is very reliable, problems can still occur. Teach your team how to flip to manual mode and to continue on with the photography or video shoot if the automated systems crash. That way you will not miss deadlines nor waste precious time during peak season.

# Examples to Illustrate These Tips

# Case Study 1

 New Seller Automating for the First Time A new Amazon seller selling electronics began with automating image editing of their products. The seller used batch processing to select brightness and remove backgrounds from all listing images. It saved them days of manual editing and ensured their images looked consistent, even with minimal photography skills.

# Case Study 2

 Existing Seller Scaling Product Videography This existing seller had thousands of products and utilized scripted automation to shoot 360-degree videos. They could shoot hundreds of products at once by combining turntables and automated zoom functions, which reduced the time required to shoot videos by 50% and enabled them to bring products to market quicker.

1r2rfzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewServerLife/comments/1r2rfzv/vertical_server_wall_mounting_spacesaving_setup/,Vertical server wall mounting: Space-saving setup for rackmount servers,"Running out of floor space? Learn how to safely wall-mount rack servers. Explore vertical racks, airflow basics, the “chimney effect” (and when it matters), plus practical installation and cable management tips.

[Vertical server wall mounting](https://preview.redd.it/2ra8togtx1jg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1659d061b33eac3b7fed8c89c133edc915e465df)

# The space dilemma in modern IT

In a perfect world, every admin has a dedicated, cooled server room with full-size 42U racks. In reality, many SMBs, remote offices, and homelab setups have to squeeze enterprise-grade hardware into a utility closet, a small office, or a shared equipment corner.

[The clean vertical server setup Inspiration](https://preview.redd.it/plmvbhcbx1jg1.jpg?width=859&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5260733c61dee40af7887c502bad0e292b8e41af)

If you’re upgrading to Dell 14th Gen PowerEdge servers, you don’t necessarily need a bulky floor cabinet. A properly engineered vertical wall-mount can be a clean, proven way to deploy high-performance hardware like the Dell PowerEdge R640 or R740 while keeping your floor space free.

This approach is especially useful for edge locations and space-constrained environments. It’s not ideal for areas with heavy dust, poor temperature control, or where service access is difficult.

# 1. Is vertical mounting safe for Dell 14th Gen servers?

A common myth is that rack servers must always lie flat. In practice, vertical mounting can be safe and stable when you plan for two things: mechanical load (weight + mounting strength) and airflow (intake/exhaust clearance).

# Storage orientation (HDD & NVMe)

In many modern enterprise builds — whether you’re running NVMe in an R640 or a SAS-heavy configuration in an R740 — drive orientation is often supported across multiple mounting positions. That said, it’s smart to verify the operating-orientation specifications for your exact drive models (especially if you use spinning HDDs). Enterprise drives are designed for 24/7 operation, but manufacturers still publish orientation and vibration tolerance guidelines for a reason.

# Airflow basics: what matters more than “upright vs flat”

Dell PowerEdge servers are designed for front-to-back airflow. Vertical mounting doesn’t change that requirement. Your goal is simple: keep the front intake unobstructed, ensure the exhaust has room to leave the chassis, and prevent hot air from recirculating back into the intake.

# The “chimney effect” (a small bonus, not a replacement for airflow)

If the server is oriented so warm exhaust naturally rises, convection can help reduce heat pockets in tight spaces. Consider it a minor advantage in some closets — not a substitute for proper clearance and ventilation. Your primary cooling still comes from the server’s fans, and they’ll only perform well if the intake and exhaust pathways are not restricted.

[Airflow Diagram & The Chimney Effect](https://preview.redd.it/bb11w4rgx1jg1.jpg?width=798&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23e30950db09d1e374ef3e579662c2f41a9b270c)

# 2. Why go vertical? The practical benefits

**Zero floor footprint**: A vertical 1U/2U wall-mount setup keeps the server off the floor entirely and can dramatically clean up small equipment areas.

**Better protection in busy spaces**: A server mounted above desk height is less likely to suffer accidental kicks, vacuum impacts, bumped cables, or the classic office hazard: spilled coffee.

**Less dust accumulation on horizontal surfaces**: Dust tends to settle on flat surfaces. While vertical mounting doesn’t eliminate dust, it can reduce how quickly the top of a chassis turns into a dust shelf — especially if the surrounding area is kept reasonably clean.

**Easier visibility and access**: Status LEDs, iDRAC ports, power buttons, and I/O are typically easier to see and reach when the server is mounted at eye level — no more crawling under desks.

# 3. Engineering a secure wall mount (don’t cut corners)

The Dell PowerEdge R740 can be heavy depending on configuration (server, drives, PSUs, rails/bracket hardware). Treat this like a serious install.

# The foundation: mounting surface matters

Never mount a server to drywall alone. Use a stud finder and mount directly into studs (wood or metal), or use appropriate anchors for masonry.

# Masonry is often the best case

If you have brick or concrete, use high-quality anchors rated for the load and follow the anchor manufacturer’s guidance.

# Use professional brackets rated for server loads

Choose 19-inch vertical wall-mount brackets designed for 1U/2U servers and made of heavy-duty steel. Most importantly, ensure the bracket’s load rating exceeds your fully loaded server weight with a comfortable safety margin.

[4U 19” StarTech Wall Mount Vertical Rack Bracket](https://preview.redd.it/4vcsvvzix1jg1.jpg?width=1226&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08ac74c5b04917993acd1d8b463ac3228846b50d)

# Plan for service access

Before you drill anything, confirm you can still do basic maintenance: remove the top cover, swap drives, replace PSUs, access the iDRAC port, and route cables without bending them sharply.

# Airflow and clearance checklist (critical)

* **Keep the front intake clear**. Don’t mount the front against a wall or inside a tight enclosure.
* **Leave exhaust space**. If exhaust points upward, don’t mount too close to the ceiling.
* **Avoid recirculation**. Don’t place other heat sources directly under the server exhaust path.
* **If the room is “closet hot”, add ventilation**. Even a great mount can’t compensate for trapped heat in a sealed space.

# 4. Cable management: eliminate strain and future failures

In vertical installations, gravity works against your connectors. The weight of power cords and network cables (especially heavier DAC/SFP+ cables) can create long-term strain.

# Use strain relief

Install a small D-ring, hook, or Velcro tie-off point above (or beside) the server and secure cables so the connector carries minimal weight.

# Keep bends gentle

Avoid tight bends near ports, especially on fiber and DAC cables. Route cables with a clean curve and enough slack for service access.

# Label and separate power/network

A clean cable plan prevents accidental disconnects and makes future troubleshooting faster — especially when the server is mounted higher on a wall.

# 5. Pre-install checklist (save yourself headaches)

Before mounting, run through this quick checklist:

1. Confirm the fully loaded weight (chassis + drives + PSUs).
2. Confirm bracket load rating (with safety margin).
3. Identify studs or masonry and choose the correct hardware.
4. Plan airflow clearance for intake and exhaust.
5. Confirm service access (cover, drives, PSUs, iDRAC, cabling).
6. Add cable strain relief and avoid tight bends.
7. Consider noise (especially in offices) and heat buildup in closets.

# Best Dell servers for vertical mounting

# 1U: Dell PowerEdge R640 / Dell PowerEdge R6525

Two-socket, high-density 1U servers that deliver serious compute in a minimal footprint. They’re a strong fit for edge deployments, firewalls and security stacks, high-density virtualization, compact Kubernetes/VM clusters, and performance-focused workloads where rack (or wall) space is limited. The 1U form factor is easier to mount and service in tight rooms, while still giving you enterprise-grade CPU, memory capacity, and fast storage/networking options.

# 2U: Dell PowerEdge R740 / Dell PowerEdge R7525

When you need the same “enterprise muscle” with more room to scale, 2U is the sweet spot. These models are ideal for heavier virtualization, VDI, storage-dense builds, backup nodes, and mixed workloads that benefit from additional PCIe expansion, more drive bays, and more flexible cooling headroom. In a vertical mount, 2U also gives you more physical space for cabling and add-on cards — often the deciding factor when you’re building for growth.

# Conclusion: reclaim space without sacrificing reliability

Vertical wall mounting isn’t a DIY gimmick — it’s a practical deployment strategy for modern, space-constrained environments.

600 days in a row, at least one Reddit interaction a day. Dear lord, touch grass, Master Coin.

As much as these milestones may indicate that I spend too much time posting online for my own amusement (and to the upset of so many others), they have taught me how to write longer and longer Reddit posts. So long, in fact, that I just wrote one that was 80,000+ words long.

That’s about 400 pages in paperback format.

That’s a little too long, even for me to wallow in the glory of my own magnificent prose. So I am currently having the text evaluated by a dozen or so “beta readers” to help me decide what to cut (yes, even some of you have been included in this process).

I expect I will do a “soft launch” by self publishing it in the spring, while I check to see if any real publisher would touch my drivel. So, alas, most of you will have to wait a bit longer in order not to buy the book you will never read.

However, in honor of 13 years and 600 days occurring in conjunction, I feel like I should do something special, so here is the prologue and the first chapter, and a tiny bit of the second for your amusement. Consider me your friendly neighborhood prose dealer, giving away free samples on the playground behind the elementary school. Hoping to get all you kids hooked.

PROLOGUE/THE BLUE HOUR

There is a moment between day and night when the world holds its breath.

The French call it l'heure bleue—the blue hour. The astronomers call it civil twilight—that span of minutes after sunset when the sun has dropped below the horizon but its light still diffuses through the atmosphere, painting everything in shades of blue. Not the blue of ocean or sky, but a color softer, stranger, more liminal. The blue of dreams. The blue of transitions. The blue of the space between what was and what will be.

In that blue hour, if you know how to look, you can see things that are normally hidden.

Vera Ashaway had always known how to look.

She discovered it at nine years old, sitting on the porch of her grandmother's house in rural Virginia, watching the sun set behind the horse pasture. Something shifted in her vision—not her physical eyes but deeper sight, some faculty of perception she didn't have a name for—and suddenly the world was different. The trees were alive with light that had nothing to do with the fading sun. The air was thick with patterns, with connections, with invisible threads binding everything to everything else.

At the same time, she was overwhelmed by a surge of emotions—happiness and sadness, love and fear, anger—converging inside her head in a cacophony of voices, all babbling at once. The sound and the vibration hit her like a physical blow.

She was momentarily stunned—her head spinning like the time she was thrown from her grandparents' pony Princess Baby the year before. Well, not thrown really—Princess Baby was gentle. But she had lost her balance and toppled off when the pony stopped short from a canter. She had landed mostly on her shoulder but had smacked her head solidly. Nothing was broken. Her father had been down the hill drinking at The Old Dominion Bar and Grill. Her mother had been working the weekend shift emptying bedpans at the rural hospital some 30 miles south. But her grandmother had come running

""Thank God for helmets,"" her grandmother had said, while soothing her. Her grandfather had come out into the yard too. They made her get right back on and finish the lesson, although she was terrified to do it. Terrified of falling again, of losing control of herself. But they insisted that was what a rider did, and she wanted to make her grandparents proud.

Now she yelped at the overwhelming sensation. Her grandmother came running once again. But by the time the old woman reached the porch, the vision had faded; the voices had stopped the moment she shrieked. Vera was just a mystified little girl who had seen a thing she couldn't explain, trying to shake off a surge of adrenaline.

""What happened?""

She sniffled. Her lower eyelids were damp. ""I saw... everything was blue. And there were clear lines. Lines connecting things. Like ice. And everyone... people were yelling..."" She trailed off, looking downward.

Her grandmother was quiet for a long moment. Then she sat down and put an arm around Vera's shoulders.

""Why, that’s the blue hour, honey."" Her grandmother's voice carried that particular quality it always did when she spoke of sacred things—the same reverent tone she used reading the Psalms aloud on Sunday mornings or lighting candles in the chapel at St. Anne's. ""My own Nanna used to talk about it. She called it the time between times. Said some people could see through the veil during that hour. See what's really there.""

""What's really there?""

""God, maybe. Or whatever God is made of."" The old woman crossed herself—a habit so ingrained she did it without thinking. ""The prayer book says we see through a glass, darkly. That someday we'll see face to face. Maybe some folks get glimpses early."" She shrugged. ""Nanna always said the people who could see during the blue hour were blessed. Or cursed. Depending on what they did with what they saw – and what the world thought about them seeing it.""

Vera didn't know what to make of that. She was nine. She wanted ice cream and cartoons, not mystical visions accompanied by overwhelming emotions. But she had learned you had to get back on the horse. You had to soldier through. So she pushed the experience down, buried it, and, the next day, tried to pretend it had never happened.

But it happened again. And again.

Over the years, the blue hour came without warning. Sometimes during actual twilight, sometimes at three in the morning when she couldn't sleep. Each time, she saw the same thing: the patterns, the crystalline connections, the light that didn't come from any visible source. Each time it was accompanied by crushing and confusing emotion. Each time, she pushed it away, breathed deep, ignored her suddenly racing heart. She told herself she was imagining things and forced herself to endure it. You're okay if you can wiggle your toes. Right back on! Her granddad's voice echoing at some deep layer.

She made the choice to be a mathematician because mathematics was safe. Rigorous. Mathematics didn't have blue hours or visions. Mathematics was the one domain where proof was possible, where truth was a thing you could demonstrate rather than an entity that seized you without permission.

And then Natasha was born.

For a while—a brief, shimmering while—Vera thought she might escape the blue hour entirely. She had a daughter and a loving husband. She had work that consumed her. If a natural tension existed between her family and her career, that was nothing more than the challenge every modern woman faced. She faced each day and made the best choice she could while juggling competing priorities. If everything didn't run along Hollywood-perfect, that was OK. This was real life, sometimes cracks appeared in the facade. She told herself the cracks didn't matter. Life was about trade-offs. She told herself Natasha would understand someday.

Until the hospital room. Until the last breath. Until the world shattered and the blue hour came back, more insistent than ever, demanding to be seen.

Come, said a consciousness without voice, speaking in the blue light that surrounded her in the moments between waking and sleeping. Come and see what you really are.

Vera was forty-seven years old when she finally listened.

This is the story of what happened next.

0 ∞ 0​Learning to Fly

Tig was crossing the skybridge when someone grabbed him from behind.

It was someone big. Someone beefy. They wrapped their arms around him in a bear hug and literally lifted him up off his feet. They half wrestled, half carried him to the glass guardrail that was supposed to keep him safe from a fall to the concrete floor some three stories below.

Lysing.AI, Inc.’s headquarters were located in a four-story building in an office park just outside San Jose, California. Lysing occupied the top two floors, and although most of their 66,000 square feet was a warren of cubicles and video conference rooms, the executive suite on the top floor was separated from the rest of the campus by a glass bridge transecting the atrium.

The bridge itself was a marvel of architectural ego—three panes of reinforced glass, seemingly unsupported, spanning the forty-foot gap between the executive wing and the main floor. From certain angles, it appeared to be nothing more than a ribbon of light suspended in air. Walking across it required a small act of faith, a trust that the transparent surface would hold. Most employees avoided it when they could, taking the long way around through the corridors. Tig loved it. He crossed it a dozen times a day, enjoying the way visitors' faces went pale when he strode across seemingly empty space.

Sometimes, crossing the bridge made him feel like he was flying high over the atrium’s desert floor. He had never considered what it might feel like to fall.

The atrium itself was four stories tall. A wall of westward-facing glass, exposed hallways leading from the elevator banks on every level, and throughout this modern-day ant farm, a smattering of tables - some at stand-up height, without chairs, and some with a mixture of beanbags, stools, couches, and normal office chairs. The intent was to create the perfect environment for every version of “stand-ups,” “syncs,"" ""huddles,"" and ""check-ins” that couldn’t be accomplished with any semblance of privacy back in cubicleville.

The ground floor of the atrium was a stylized western garden, hosting a variety of designer-chosen sandstone, basalt, and rhyolite, colored in a desert varnish reds and browns and tans, carefully arrayed around a few cacti and other succulents.

At the moment, right on top of Tig’s ear, some man’s voice was grunting and screaming an incomprehensible string of syllables, from which he was able to pick out the words “Camel,” “Needle,” “Gluttony,” and “Judgements.” The odor of garlic and onions and desperate sweat congealed around him in a cloud.

He struggled to break the grip that held him, but these arms were like steel bands. His attacker had locked his hands around his own opposite wrists and was squeezing hard around Tig’s chest. The breath was being squeezed right out of him, he had time to think. But then he realized that wouldn’t matter much if he got upended over the guardrail - which seemed to be Mr. Onion Breath’s current plan.

Suddenly he felt an even heavier weight hit his back hard, heard Mr. Sweaty Stinky let out an “Urk!” and the gorilla arms were ripped from around him.

He stumbled forward into the waist-high glass wall with a thud, head and chest out over the railing, staring at the floor below for just a second. For that instant—that frozen sliver of time—he saw something strange. The atrium floor seemed impossibly far away, and between him and the distant ground, the air shimmered. He could have sworn he glimpsed a thread of light spanning the void—impossibly thin, impossibly bright—and on the far side of it, a warmth he had never felt before.

Fortunately, the architects had done their work and the safety glass held solid. He didn’t tumble over, instead he whirled to turn to face his assailant.

What he saw was an enormous man - easily 300 pounds and well over six feet tall - on the ground with Kell writhing around him like a boa constrictor. Kell was much smaller than the man, but his flexibility was evident in the way his arms and legs efficiently moved to find points of leverage that allowed him to establish and maintain control.

Kell was Lysing’s chief commercial counsel and had been briefing Tig on some new data privacy regs as they did a “walk and talk” between Tig’s 8 AM meeting with Connie in HR about the coming AI generated downsizing, and his 9 AM call with the Board’s Audit Committee. That Board call was to discuss the Company’s response to the same regs Kell had been briefing him on.

When he had been grabbed, Tig had been making mental notes about what he could tell the Board he was going to do with their customers’ private data, and what things Lysing might do that would be a little secret between him and the operations group. No need for legal and the Board to know everything, after all. Not if the goal was always to maximize shareholder value – and you were the biggest shareholder.

Now, as he watched Kell subdue this juggernaut of a man, he recalled that Kell’s preferred physical relaxation activity was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or “murder yoga,” as Kell preferred to call it with his trademark sardonic wit. It was one of the reasons he had hired him. He liked the competitive spirit and general badassery the hobby implied about his lawyer. He had not, however, imagined it would be put to use for executive protection purposes.

In just a few moments, the struggle was over. The man was immobilized and his diatribe—some Biblical drivel about the wealthy not inheriting the earth and the judgments of the Lord—had been replaced with a steady set of complaints: ""Ow, that hurts! Let go! Dammit! Ow! Stop! Pleeassse stop! I’ll sue you!""

At the front desk three floors below were Phil, the security guard and Mary Anne the receptionist. Lysing only used half the building at the moment. But they held the lease on the whole facility and sublet the lower floors, so Phil and Mary Anne worked for Tig.

He looked over the edge and saw that Phil was already bounding up the staircase on the eastern side. Phil would have some explaining to do, in a little bit. For now, Tig yelled down, “Mary Anne, call the police. We have an intruder.”

He looked over at Kell - his face red as he fought to keep the large man restrained.

Tig suspected he’d have to discuss a new options grant for Kell with the board next month, but he realized that wouldn’t be a terrible thing – it would be a good opportunity to argue for additional shares for himself. Hazard pay for a CEO who had to take the brunt of the crazies.

Tig straightened his hoodie and looked down at his attacker. The man's face was ruddy and contorted, his face was covered in sweat and the fury of the righteously indignant.

""Who are you?"" Tig asked, genuinely curious. The man was unusually pale and round. But he had the look of someone who had been normal once not that very long ago. He was in his thirties, probably. Suburban. The kind of person who mowed his lawn on Saturday and went to church on Sunday.

""Edgar,"" the man spat. ""Edgar Edgarton. And you—you are Sa’Tan’s minion! The app—your DAMNED app—it leads to the hell places. And in those places, I saw what you really are!"" He started to struggle harder, but Kell wrenched one of Edgar’s arms in a way that Tig was pretty sure it wasn’t designed to move, and Edgar quickly let out a groan and stopped fighting again.

""Eggie,"" someone said from the crowd that had gathered by the elevators on the far side of the skybridge. A woman's voice, horrified. ""Oh God, it's Eggie from IT. He used to work here.""

Tig filed that information away. A former employee. A Meditaatio user, apparently. Someone whose mind had decompressed along a strike-slip fault that Tig's product seemed to have unlocked.

Interesting.

1 ∞ 1​Greetings, Sahib

A moment, Sahib, if you please?

Yes, you. You holding this book or screen or tablet, reading these words at this particular moment in your particular life. You with the coffee going cold beside you, the train rumbling beneath you, or your partner turned away, snoring, and the hour too late for sensible people who have to work in the morning.

We have been waiting. I have been waiting. (Forgive me—the pronouns become slippery when you have been what I have been for as long as I have been it.)

You are ready, or nearly ready, or at least ready enough to hear what I have to say. The others weren't ready. They skipped this book on the shelf or sitting in its electronic queue. Or they looked at the cover, or perhaps read the description, maybe they even read the prologue or that little bit of action in Movement 0; but they turned away, back to their comfortable blindness.

You, on the other hand. You're still here.

Good.

I want to tell you about a woman who tried to catch God in an equation.

Her name was Vera Ashaway, and she was forty-seven years old, and she had been blue for seven years. Not sad—though she was that too—but blue in the way the sky is blue at vespers, in the way deep water is blue when you sink past the reach of sunlight. She had descended into the color and forgotten how to climb back up.

She was a professor of mathematics. Would be for another semester or so, anyway. She taught at a university that shall remain nameless, to students who have long since forgotten her face. She taught them equations that didn't really matter, and which she knew they would soon forget, in classes they attended only to fulfill their degree requirements.

But she loved her research. She specialized in ""MCS""—Mathematical Consciousness Science—the mathematical modeling of mind. Which is a fancy way of saying she spent her days trying to prove that the soul could be written in symbols; that emotion could be defanged into set theory and bottled up inside logical axioms.

Can you imagine? Spending your life trying to trap lightning in a jar, trying to weigh the wind on a scale, trying to convince yourself that love is nothing more than neurons firing in a particular algorithmic pattern?

1 ∞ 2​Vera Ashaway

I have watched humans seek truth for three thousand years. Their methods change—they used to sacrifice goats, now they write academic papers—but the confusion remains. They search the attic when the treasure is in the cellar. They knock on doors, and when they open, ask if perhaps there's a different door, one leading somewhere less frightening. It would be frustrating if it weren't so endearing.

I have the advantage of telling every story that I know having already witnessed its conclusion. When I narrate events taking place before I met a seeker or in their future after they depart my establishment, it is because once a person crosses my threshold, their past and future open like this book to me. It is not omniscience, but close enough to make me dangerous and, occasionally, useful.

Thus, it is with certainty that I can tell you before Vera grew her shell, she was a creature of wonder.

At six, on her grandmother's Virginia porch—the same porch where she'd discover the blue hour three years later—she stared at stars on a clear night.

""Each light is a sun,"" her grandmother said. ""Some have planets. Some of those planets might have people looking up at us, wondering if we're real.""

Little Vera—""Vee"" back then—felt herself split open. The scale of it.

""How many stars are there?""

I didn't know if it was a 'good' idea - or if anyone even wanted this.

1 month in and we have had 148 matches across 26 countries. 28 people have already received coffee from their matches, 44 bags are currently in transit, and many more users are carefully selecting coffee to send out.

beta was a huge success with users signing up and providing feedback to the platform - with daily active development to improve the user experience.

Since launch we have introduced new community features, in app messaging to contact your matches, and refined matching criteria to choose countries you want to exchange with to avoid shipping hiccups.

CoffeePals is still small. It’s still evolving. And it’s still very much a work in progress.

But the foundation feels solid now - not just technically, but socially. There’s a real community here, spread across 26 countries, built around a shared love of coffee and a willingness to connect with strangers.

If you’ve been thinking about joining but haven’t yet, the **March exchange** is now live, and there’s plenty of room at the table.

Thank you to everyone who’s taken a chance on this odd little project - for sending coffee, sharing cafés, leaving feedback, and being patient while I keep tinkering.

Let’s keep building something good together.

My name’s Adrian. I’m 27. I work remote as a graphic designer. Last October I booked a cheap Airbnb outside the city to finish a deadline in peace. I lasted one night.

The listing said “entire place to yourself.” Two nights. Self check-in. No neighbors nearby. That’s what sold me.

I needed quiet. I was behind on a project and my apartment had construction noise all week. The photos showed a small wooden house. One bedroom. Kitchen. Living room. Clean. Minimal.

The host messaged me the morning of check-in.

“Just a heads up. There’s a spare room that stays locked. Storage only.”

That didn’t bother me. A lot of places do that.

I arrived around 6:45PM. The sun was already dropping behind the trees. The house sat alone at the end of a gravel driveway. No other homes in sight. No streetlights.

Inside smelled like disinfectant and something faintly stale. Like a place that isn’t used often.

I did what I always do. Quick scan. Check windows. Test locks. Bathroom. Closet.

At the end of the hallway was the second door.

Locked.

I didn’t try hard. Just a light twist of the knob. Solid.

I set up my laptop in the bedroom and worked until past midnight. Nothing unusual. No outside noise except wind against the siding.

Around 1:40AM, I heard a soft bump.

Not loud. Not sharp. Just something shifting.

I stopped typing.

The sound came from the hallway direction.

Old houses make noise. Wood expands. Pipes knock. I’ve stayed in enough rentals to know that.

I waited.

Nothing.

I went back to work.

At 2:07AM, I heard it again.

This time it wasn’t a bump.

It was a drag.

Short. Slow. Like something wooden being pulled an inch across the floor.

I muted my laptop completely and listened.

The refrigerator hummed. The wind brushed the siding. No footsteps. No voices.

I opened my bedroom door.

The hallway light was off. Only faint spill from my room behind me.

Everything looked the same.

The spare room door was still closed.

I stood there longer than I needed to. Listening.

Then I saw it.

The knob.

It didn’t turn fully.

It twitched.

Just once. A small downward pressure. Like someone testing it from inside.

My brain immediately tried to fix it.

Loose mechanism. Old latch. Air pressure.

But here’s what didn’t make sense.

My bedroom window was closed. No cross breeze. No HVAC running. The house was still.

I stepped closer.

The hallway floor felt colder than my room. That could’ve been in my head.

I stared at the seam of the door. No light underneath.

I don’t know how long I stood there. Maybe ten seconds. Maybe thirty.

Nothing else moved.

I went back into my room and locked the door.

But I didn’t go back to work.

I sat on the bed and replayed what I saw.

It was small. So small it almost didn’t qualify as anything.

But it wasn’t random shaking.

It was downward.

Intentional.

At 2:24AM, I checked the listing again.

One bedroom.

No mention of a spare room.

No photos from the hallway angle that showed that door.

I zoomed in on every picture.

One thing caught my attention.

In the living room photo, there was a faint reflection in the dark TV screen. The hallway behind the camera.

The spare room door looked slightly open in that reflection.

But in the direct hallway photo, it was closed.

That could be perspective. Lighting. Timing.

I told myself I was reaching.

I didn’t sleep.

Around 3:10AM, I heard another sound.

Not dragging.

A faint pressure against the wall.

Like someone leaning their weight against it.

It stopped the second I held my breath.

I didn’t open the door again.

Morning came slow.

Sunlight made everything feel stupid. Dramatic. Overblown.

I walked into the hallway in daylight.

The spare room door looked completely normal.

I stepped close enough to touch it.

The knob was slightly warm.

Not hot.

Not cold.

Just not cool like the rest of the hallway metal fixtures.

That detail bothered me more than the movement.

I messaged the host casually.

“Hey. Just checking. No one else has access to the property, right?”

He replied within two minutes.

“No. And that spare room doesn’t even have a handle on the inside. It’s sealed for storage.”

Sealed.

I stood there staring at the door after reading that.

I looked at the bottom seam again.

There was a faint scuff mark near the floor.

Not old wear. Fresh. Lighter than the surrounding wood.

Like something had scraped it recently.

I packed slowly.

Before leaving, I walked outside and looked at the side of the house.

The spare room window had no curtains.

From the driveway, you could see directly in.

The blinds were slightly tilted.

And as I stood there, they shifted.

Not a breeze. The trees were still.

Just a subtle adjustment.

Like someone inside had let go of them.

I didn’t stay to confirm.

The listing was gone a week later.

Maybe it was unrelated.

But I still think about the fact that the knob didn’t shake.

It pressed down.

From the inside.

Story 2: “There Was No Basement”

My name’s Mara. I’m 31. I’m a nurse. After a brutal month of night shifts, I booked a quiet Airbnb for one weekend just to decompress. I almost called the police that night, but I didn’t know what I’d even say.

The place was advertised as a small guesthouse behind someone’s main home. Private entrance. Entire unit. Self check-in.

I chose it because it looked simple. Clean. Controlled.

I arrived at 5PM. The main house lights were off. No cars in the driveway.

Inside, everything matched the photos. Compact kitchen. One bedroom. Small hallway.

At the end of the hallway was a flat panel in the wall I hadn’t noticed in the listing photos.

Painted the same color as everything else.

No visible knob. Just a recessed pull.

I assumed it was storage.

Out of habit, I tested every door when I arrive somewhere new.

Front door locked fine.

Bathroom fine.

Closet fine.

The panel door didn’t budge.

It felt sealed.

I didn’t think about it again until 11:32PM.

I was lying in bed scrolling on my phone when I heard a metallic click.

Not from outside.

From inside the unit.

A latch.

I held my breath.

Three seconds later, I heard a slow wooden creak.

Not random house settling.

One step.

Then pause.

Then another.

From below.

My stomach dropped.

I sat up and stared at the bedroom door.

No other noise.

I told myself it could be plumbing. Old ductwork. Rodents.

I waited.

Another step.

Measured.

Slow.

Directly under the bedroom.

I got out of bed and opened the bedroom door quietly.

The hallway light was off.

But the panel door at the end wasn’t flush anymore.

There was a thin black line along one edge.

It hadn’t been there before.

I was sure of that.

I walked halfway down the hall.

Stopped.

The air felt heavier near that door. Cooler.

I stood there long enough to question myself.

Maybe I didn’t push it fully earlier.

Maybe I imagined it being flush.

My mind kept trying to protect the normal explanation.

Then I heard it again.

A step.

Not above me.

Not outside.

Below.

Exactly where the panel was.

I backed into the bedroom and locked the door.

I pushed a chair under the handle.

I texted the host.

“Hey. Just checking. Is anyone else on the property?”

No reply.

At 2:17AM, I heard pacing.

Slow. Consistent.

Under the floorboards.

Step. Pause. Step. Pause.

It lasted maybe thirty seconds.

Then stopped abruptly.

I didn’t sleep.

Morning light made everything feel ridiculous.

I walked into the hallway.

The panel door was perfectly flush again.

No visible gap.

I crouched and ran my fingers along the seam.

The paint near the bottom edge felt slightly chipped.

Like it had been opened many times.

I messaged the host again.

He replied around noon.

“There is no basement in that unit.”

I stared at that message for a long time.

No basement.

I went back through the listing photos.

Every hallway shot was angled just enough to avoid showing the end wall fully.

No image clearly displayed that panel.

Before leaving, I pressed my ear lightly against it.

Silence.

But I noticed something else.

The temperature difference.

That section of wall was noticeably cooler than the surrounding drywall.

Not dramatically.

Just enough to register.

When I left, I looked at the back of the guesthouse from outside.

There were two small ground-level vents along the foundation.

Directly beneath the bedroom.

The listing disappeared three days later.

Maybe it was unrelated.

Maybe the pacing was plumbing.

But I still replay the rhythm in my head sometimes.

It wasn’t random.

It was deliberate.

And whatever was down there stopped moving the moment I stopped pretending it wasn’t real.

Story 3: “The Closet Door Was Already Open”

My name’s Ethan. I’m 30. I work in IT support. Last winter I booked an Airbnb downtown for a three day certification exam. I needed reliable WiFi and quiet. I didn’t get much of either the second night.

The listing was a modern studio in a converted warehouse building. Keypad entry. “Entire unit.” Good reviews. Nothing dramatic.

The first day was normal. I studied. Ordered takeout. Slept fine.

The second night, I got back around 9PM after grabbing coffee downstairs. The hallway outside the unit was silent. Thick industrial carpet. No echo.

When I unlocked the door, the first thing I noticed was the closet.

It was slightly open.

Not wide.

Just an inch or two.

I was almost sure I had shut it earlier.

I always close doors. It’s a habit.

But I didn’t panic. I assumed I misremembered.

I set my bag down. Checked the bathroom. Checked under the bed. Closet had extra towels and a folded air mattress. Nothing else.

I closed it firmly.

I studied until about 1AM. Around then, I heard something subtle.

Not inside the room.

In the hallway outside the unit.

A slow step.

Then another.

Not unusual. People come and go.

But the steps stopped directly outside my door.

No knock.

No key.

Just silence.

I muted my laptop.

I expected to hear the keypad beep if someone was trying another unit.

Nothing.

After maybe fifteen seconds, the steps moved again.

Slowly.

Past my door.

I looked through the peephole.

Empty hallway.

I told myself it was someone waiting for a rideshare. Or confused about their unit.

I went back to studying.

At 2:13AM, I heard a soft click.

From inside the room.

I turned slowly.

The closet door was open again.

Wider this time.

About six inches.

I stood up slowly. I hadn’t touched it since closing it earlier.

No windows open. No draft.

I walked over and looked inside.

Same towels. Same air mattress.

Nothing disturbed.

I felt stupid for feeling tense.

But something didn’t sit right.

I closed it again. This time I pressed the latch until I heard it catch clearly.

I sat back down.

I didn’t even make it ten minutes.

Another sound.

Not a click.

A shift.

Like fabric brushing against drywall.

From the closet.

I stood there, staring.

Nothing moved.

I walked over again.

Before I touched the handle, I noticed something I hadn’t before.

The closet door didn’t have a latch plate.

The metal piece on the frame where the latch catches was missing entirely.

Which meant when I “closed it,” it wasn’t actually locking into anything.

It was just resting shut.

I checked the floor near the hinge.

There were small scratch marks in the laminate. Fresh. Lighter than the rest of the wear.

Like the door had been opened and closed repeatedly.

I backed up slowly.

At 2:27AM, I heard the hallway steps again.

This time slower.

They stopped outside my door.

And I heard something else.

The faintest pressure against the door.

Like someone leaning their weight on it.

I stood still and didn’t breathe.

After maybe twenty seconds, the pressure released.

No footsteps retreating.

Just absence.

I didn’t sleep.

Morning came.

The closet door was closed.

Fully.

When I opened it, the towels were stacked differently.

Not dramatically. But the folded edge that had faced outward earlier now faced inward.

That’s the kind of detail that makes you question your own memory.

Before checking out, I messaged the host.

“Hey. Just wondering. Has anyone ever had issues with the closet door?”

He replied:

“No. That closet is sealed. Guests aren’t supposed to use it.”

Sealed.

I stared at the door again.

There was no seal.

No lock.

Nothing preventing it from opening from inside.

I checked the listing later that week.

The unit photos had been updated.

The closet was no longer visible in any shot.

Story 4: “We Didn’t Book the Downstairs”

My name’s Liza. I’m 26. I’m a grad student. Two friends and I booked an Airbnb for a weekend trip near the coast. It was advertised as a “private upstairs suite.”

We didn’t realize that wording mattered until 2AM.

The house was split level. The listing clearly stated we’d have the entire upstairs. Two bedrooms. One bathroom. Kitchenette.

The host lived off property.

When we arrived Friday evening, the downstairs lights were off. The staircase to the upper level had a door at the bottom. It was unlocked when we came in.

We assumed that was normal.

The upstairs felt cozy. Slanted ceilings. Slightly older wood floors.

The listing didn’t mention anyone else having access.

We went to sleep around midnight.

At 1:52AM, I woke up.

Not to a loud sound.

To vibration.

Subtle. Rhythmic.

Like footsteps on stairs.

Slow.

One step.

Pause.

One step.

I opened my eyes and listened.

My friend in the other bed was asleep.

The sound continued.

It was coming from below.

Up the staircase.

Then it stopped.

Right outside the upstairs door.

There was no lock on that interior door.

Just a standard handle.

I stared at it in the dark.

Nothing moved.

I almost convinced myself it was house settling.

Then the handle turned slightly.

Not fully.

Just enough to click.

I sat up.

The sound stopped instantly.

I didn’t move.

After maybe thirty seconds, I heard steps descending.

Slowly.

Back down the stairs.

In the morning, we joked about it.

But something bothered me.

The downstairs door at the base of the staircase.

It was locked now.

From the inside.

We hadn’t locked it the night before.

None of us had even touched it after entering.

We asked the host casually if anyone else had access to the lower level.

He replied:

“No. The downstairs isn’t connected internally.”

That made no sense.

There was a staircase.

We had used it.

We sent him a picture of the stairs from our unit.

He responded:

“That staircase leads to a storage crawlspace. It doesn’t connect to another living area.”

But we had clearly seen a hallway and a living room downstairs when we arrived.

Lights off. Furniture covered in plastic.

We went back down to check before leaving.

The staircase now ended at a blank wall.

No hallway.

No living room.

Just a short landing and a closed door marked “Storage.”

We stood there staring at it.

My friend insisted maybe we misinterpreted the layout in the dark.

Maybe the angle was different.

But I clearly remember seeing a couch through the open doorway when we first walked in.

And I clearly remember that door at the bottom being unlocked.

The listing disappeared a month later.

I still replay the rhythm of those steps.

They weren’t random.

They were climbing.

Toward us.

Story 5: “The Garage Apartment”

My name’s Nolan. I’m 28. I freelance in video editing, so I travel a lot for short contracts. Last spring I booked a detached garage apartment behind someone’s house for a five day stay. It was cheap. Good reviews. “Completely private.”

I chose it because it was separate from the main house. I like having distance from hosts. No awkward hallway encounters.

The garage apartment sat behind a suburban home. You walked down a narrow side path to reach it. The host messaged me that he wouldn’t be home that weekend. Keypad entry. Self-contained.

The first night was fine.

The second night, around 12:40AM, I heard a faint metallic rattle.

I assumed it was the garage door mechanism beneath the unit settling. The apartment was built above it.

I muted my laptop and listened.

Silence.

Then another sound.

A slow roll.

Like wheels moving along concrete.

Very faint.

Underneath me.

The listing never mentioned access to the garage. I assumed it was unused.

I texted the host casually:

“Hey, just checking. Is the garage empty?”

No reply.

At 1:12AM, I heard it again.

A rolling sound. Then a soft thud.

Like something bumping gently into a wall.

I stood up and walked to the small kitchen window. It faced the backyard.

The yard was dark.

But the motion sensor light near the garage flicked on.

No wind.

No visible movement.

The light stayed on for about twenty seconds.

Then turned off.

I told myself maybe a stray cat triggered it.

I went back to bed.

At 2:03AM, the garage door motor engaged.

You know that electric hum when a garage door lifts.

I sat upright immediately.

The sound lasted maybe five seconds.

Then stopped.

Not fully opening.

Just a short mechanical strain.

I went to the front door of the apartment and opened it quietly.

The driveway was empty.

No car pulling out.

No headlights.

The garage door looked closed.

I checked my phone.

Still no reply from the host.

I didn’t sleep much after that.

Morning came.

I walked around the side of the main house before leaving for coffee.

The garage door had fresh scrape marks near the bottom edge.

Like it had been lifted slightly while something blocked it.

That afternoon, the host finally replied.

“Garage hasn’t been used in months. Probably expansion from temperature.”

Expansion doesn’t activate motors.

That night, around 1:30AM, it happened again.

Motor hum.

Short lift.

Thud.

But this time I heard something else.

A car door closing.

Not loud. Just a firm click.

From inside the garage.

I stood frozen in the kitchen.

No engine started.

No garage door opened fully.

Nothing else.

I didn’t go outside.

The next morning, I looked more carefully at the driveway.

There were faint tire tracks.

Not from rain. It hadn’t rained.

Just subtle compression in the dust.

Only leading into the garage.

Not out.

I left that day instead of finishing my booking.

The listing is still active.

But the reviews now mention “shared driveway.”

That wasn’t in the description when I booked.

Story 6: “The Code Changed”

My name’s Priya. I’m 33. I work in corporate finance. I travel often for conferences. Two years ago I booked a small condo through Airbnb for a four night stay downtown. I left after two.

The check-in instructions were simple.

Door code: 4827.

It worked the first evening without issue.

The unit was on the third floor. Small balcony. One bedroom.

I locked the door manually before bed.

At 2:41AM, I woke up to a soft electronic beep.

The keypad.

Someone pressing buttons.

I held my breath.

Three beeps.

Pause.

Three more.

Then a long error tone.

Wrong code.

I stared at the front door.

The handle didn’t move.

I told myself it could be someone at the wrong unit. Maybe the numbers were similar.

Thirty seconds later.

Beep.

Beep.

Beep.

Pause.

Beep.

Beep.

Beep.

Error tone again.

I got out of bed and walked quietly to the door.

There’s a small gap in the frame where you can see shadow movement when someone stands close.

I saw one.

Still.

Facing the door.

I didn’t speak.

After a full minute, I heard footsteps walking away down the hallway.

In the morning, I checked the door code again before leaving for coffee.

It didn’t work.

4827 gave an error tone.

I checked the message from the host.

It still said 4827.

I messaged him.

“Hey, the code isn’t working anymore.”

He replied quickly.

“Oh sorry, we updated it this morning. New code is 7391.”

Updated it this morning.

Before I had even left the unit.

I asked why it was changed.

He said it was standard security protocol between guests.

I reminded him I was still there.

He apologized and said it must have been an automated schedule.

That afternoon, when I returned, 7391 worked.

That night, at 2:38AM, I heard the keypad again.

This time the sequence was different.

Beep.

Beep.

Pause.

Beep.

Beep.

Pause.

Error.

I checked the door the next morning.

The keypad history showed five failed attempts overnight.

I took a photo.

When I mentioned that to the host, he replied:

“There is no public access to keypad logs.”

I sent him the photo.

He stopped responding.

I called Airbnb support and left early.

The final thing that unsettled me wasn’t the code attempts.

It was something smaller.

When I packed to leave, I noticed the deadbolt knob on the inside of the door.

It was slightly scratched around the edge.

Like someone had tried turning it from the outside with pressure against the door.

You can’t turn that lock from outside.

At least you shouldn’t be able to.

The listing was removed a week later.

I still don’t know who was trying the code.

I suspect I might have prediabetes, but I’m not sure.

I’m a 40-year-old male with morbid obesity. I don’t exercise much(have a office job, pretty much sitting all day), and I sometimes experience what feels like hypoglycemia when I haven’t eaten in a while and then go for a walk or do something mildly active.

When that happens, I get:

* lightheaded
* shaky
* sweaty
* difficulty concentrating

My father and brother both have type 2 diabetes, so I know I’m at higher risk. Because of that (and my weight), I bought a glucose meter some time ago: **Accu-Chek Instant**.

I now want to start measuring my blood sugar more consistently for a period of time to see what’s actually happening throughout the day.

**My questions:**

1. What are the best times to measure to get a clear picture?
2. How often per day is useful without becoming obsessive?
3. Do you use a specific Android app or Excel sheet to track your numbers?

I’m from the Netherlands, and we measure in **mmol/L** (a lot of templates I find online are in mg/dL and seem US-based).

For example:  
Today at 12:00 PM I measured **5.5 mmol/L**.  
I had breakfast at 7:30 AM.  
Between 7:30 and 12:00 I didn’t eat anything except 5 small vending machine cappuccinos (the kind made with powdered milk – regular coffee from that machine is undrinkable 😅).

My Accu-Chek Instant syncs via Bluetooth to the **mySugr (Android)** app.

Is mySugr sufficient to get meaningful insights and trends? Or are there better apps available for tracking and analyzing data?

How do you personally track and interpret your readings when you’re just starting out?

You are not a small gaming company; you have an entire design department, so why has it been so difficult over all these years to create beautiful 46 NEOCOM icons? No resources? Not a priority task?

The same applies to the Station Services icons; why should they be so ugly and dull? It's unclear. After all, this is a GAME; the visual impression should be attractive, with clearly readable icons, symbols, etc.

For background, I don't know if I have any hidden mental illnesses or something. (My parents haven't had me do a general check up in like years.) But yeah, the title says it all. 

This started at around November 26, 2025. I'm currently staying at a dorm since it was closer to my campus, things were alright up until that date. I got back to the dorms at around 6pm and like any other student, I was tired as hell. So when the noise started I just thought that my neighbors were playing something really loudly that I could hear it from here, so I basically just brushed it off and got ready for bed, but around 9:00 pm, the noise from beside my window started making a racket again. I didn't realize it at first but when I started really listening, I froze. It sounded like a fuckass laugh. Like the laughs of goblins from movies, that menacing little fucking chuckle. (Will attach video at end)

Mind you, I'm an atheist, and I don't really believe in stuff like that. (I just want to get my degree like c'mon) but man, that laugh shook the hell out of me. At that point I knew no one would believe me so I started recording, but like 15 seconds in, I think (if it even is real) it noticed that I was filming and just stopped. 

I remember relief, but also wtf just fucking happened. So with the braveness of a fucking donkey I got a flashlight and went outside, and opened the door leading to the stairwell, where my window is also facing to, stood there like an idiot just staring at nothing, then promptly rationalized that I was hallucinating shit since I've probably had like 3-4 red bulls + 4 cups of coffee earlier that morning. 

(I kinda suck at describing my room layout so I'll just drop a picture later)

After the incident, I kinda just forgot about it since school was more important and I had several deadlines that week and the next. But good god, the next fucking week it happened again, and I was caught off guard that time since I was pulling an all-nighter and I just heard it laugh again right next to my fuckass window, I kinda just sat there like a deer in headlights, like bro what the hell was I supposed to even do??? chant god's name and pray to the heavens it leaves me the fuck alone?? well fuck, you right, I did just that. (I was desperate ok, I just wanted to study).

And from November it keeps happening up until now, and everytime I try to bloody record it, it keeps disappearing like it knows it's getting recorded and wants me to look crazy. (Yk at this point, it might be schizophrenia but like idk doctor checkups aren't really a thing in my family and yeesh those typa check-ups are expensive as hell). 

So yeah that's basically it. I don't if it's a demon or a ghost or what. (I tried shouting at it and it stopped for awhile, but then after that I started hearing it laugh inside my closet, idk if I made it worse or what)

Please PLEASE if you have any ideas on what to do please just put your opinions down, I desperately want it gone, and I can't even change dorms since this is the closest to campus and all the other forms down my block are already full. Please PLEASE.",3,1770895625.0,Paranormal,6,1.0,False

However, I quickly realized that V60 coffee turns out kind of nasty. The body and flavor of any beans got replaced by the taste of this water. I’m not sure how to describe it - maybe like slightly salty water with something else. About two-thirds of the flavor just disappeared. When I switched back to my usual filter, I was relieved to have the coffee taste back again.

Acidity is one of the most common digestive problems people face today. Whether it’s the burning sensation in your chest, sour burps, or discomfort after eating, almost everyone has experienced acidity at some point. In medical terms, acidity happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation and a burning feeling known as heartburn. While it may seem harmless in the beginning, frequent acidity can interfere with daily life and lead to more serious health issues if ignored.

So, why is acidity becoming such a concern in cities like Nashik? With rapid urbanization, changing food habits, and increasing stress levels, acidity cases have been rising steadily. Street foods, spicy curries, irregular meal timings, and a sedentary lifestyle all contribute to the problem. For many residents of Nashik, the easy availability of fast food and late-night snacking culture have made acidity more common than ever.

It’s important to understand that acidity is not just about overeating spicy food. It reflects an imbalance in our body’s digestion system. Left untreated, it can turn into chronic acid reflux disease (GERD) and even damage the esophagus lining. That’s why learning when to rely on home remedies and when to consult a doctor for [**acidity treatment in Nashik**](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/) is critical for long-term health.

# Signs and Symptoms of Acidity

The body usually gives early warning signals when acidity begins to develop. Unfortunately, many people ignore these signs until the condition worsens. The most common symptom is a burning sensation in the chest, also known as heartburn, which usually occurs after meals or at night. This burning may even travel up to the throat, leaving behind a sour or bitter taste in the mouth.

Other signs include bloating, burping, nausea, and [stomach discomfort](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/medicine-gastroenterology/liver-stomach-gb-diseases/). Some people may also complain of difficulty swallowing or feeling like food is stuck in the throat. Interestingly, acidity symptoms are often confused with those of gastritis, indigestion, or even heart problems. For instance, chest pain caused by acidity can sometimes mimic a mild heart attack. This is why medical evaluation is important when symptoms become frequent or severe.

Chronic acidity is more serious than occasional acidity. If you experience heartburn more than twice a week, persistent coughing, or hoarseness in your voice, you might be dealing with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD requires proper medical treatment because it can damage the esophagus lining over time. Knowing these symptoms and paying attention to your body is the first step toward effective [**acidity treatment in Nashik**.](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/medicine-gastroenterology/liver-stomach-gb-diseases/)

# Common Triggers of Acidity

Have you ever noticed that acidity gets worse after a late-night pizza or a cup of strong coffee on an empty stomach? That’s because food and drinks play a major role in triggering acid reflux. Spicy curries, oily fried snacks, tomatoes, citrus fruits, chocolates, and caffeinated drinks are some of the most common culprits. Alcohol and smoking further irritate the stomach lining, making acidity more likely.

Apart from diet, lifestyle factors are equally responsible. Skipping meals, overeating, lying down immediately after eating, and wearing tight clothing around the stomach can all increase acidity. Stress is another silent trigger. When the body is under pressure, it produces more acid, and digestion slows down, creating a perfect environment for acidity.

Some medical conditions can also make acidity worse. Obesity, pregnancy, hiatal hernia, and certain medications (like painkillers and antibiotics) increase the risk of acid reflux. In a city like Nashik, where long working hours, irregular food timings, and stress are common, these triggers become even more noticeable. Identifying personal triggers and avoiding them is one of the best ways to manage acidity without relying too much on medicines.

# Home Remedies and Lifestyle Changes for Acidity Treatment

Before rushing to the pharmacy for tablets, it’s worth trying home remedies and lifestyle changes. Simple practices can bring quick relief and even prevent acidity from becoming chronic. One of the oldest remedies is drinking a glass of cold milk, which helps neutralize stomach acid. Similarly, chewing a few basil (tulsi) leaves, drinking ginger tea, or consuming a teaspoon of fennel seeds after meals can soothe the stomach.

Dietary changes are crucial. Eating smaller meals at regular intervals, avoiding late-night dinners, and reducing oily and spicy foods can make a huge difference. Instead of three heavy meals, try five to six smaller meals spread throughout the day. Hydration also plays a key role. Drinking sufficient water and including buttermilk, coconut water, and fresh fruits can ease digestion.

Along with diet, lifestyle adjustments are equally important. Regular exercise improves digestion and prevents excess acid build-up. Yoga poses like Vajrasana and Pranayama are especially helpful for those struggling with [acidity in Nashik](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/). Managing stress through meditation, deep breathing, and hobbies also lowers the chances of acid reflux. These changes may take time, but they provide long-term relief and reduce dependency on medicines for **acidity treatment in Nashik**.

# When to Try Over-the-Counter Medicines

For many people, popping an antacid seems like the quickest way to fight acidity. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines like chewable tablets, syrups, and acid-reducing capsules are easily available in Nashik’s pharmacies. These medicines work by either neutralizing stomach acid or reducing its production. They offer quick relief, especially when acidity strikes suddenly after a heavy meal.

However, it’s important to use OTC medicines wisely. While occasional use is generally safe, frequent self-medication can mask serious underlying problems. For example, taking antacids daily without addressing the root cause may lead to dependency and side effects like constipation or kidney issues.

Doctors recommend trying lifestyle changes and home remedies first. If symptoms still persist, occasional use of OTC medicines is fine. But if you need them more than twice a week, it’s a sign that you should consult a[ gastroenterologist](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/). In Nashik, you’ll find both small local clinics and large hospitals where specialists can provide proper guidance for safe and effective **acidity treatment in Nashik**.",1,1770895547.0,u_Drsapnadeore,0,1.0,False

I do get weekends off every other weekend. And sometimes we are let go early. So with my limited free time, it is hard to stay consistent in a hobby. At most maybe a church group or going to the gym when I can.

It’s still early days, but so far I’m obsessed. And c’mon, it doesn’t get much prettier than that.

Now I just need to finish my little coffee station with some oiled oak shelves under the tabletop and a cup shelf on the wall.

1r2qlzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1r2qlzk/my_experience_with_treating_dry_flaky/,My experience with treating dry flaky skin/eczema/psoriasis M/32,"Just wanted a share my experience with treating my skin condition (not sure exactly what it was since I never went to the doctor).

  
I was battling inflamed , dry, flaky  skin (on my face) that comes and goes in intervals. There was no rules to it and took me years to figure out how to get rid of it. 

It just came out of nowhere by unknown trigger, started with being red and dry, then flaky, especially where my moustache is, and hairline. And then going back to normal, for the cycle to begin again every one or two weeks. Sometimes it was less often, maybe once a month or even few months depending on the climate. (I had better results when I was living by the sea and could constantly go swimming (in Croatia). I think it was also a bit better in tropical humid weather, but it showed up there also sometimes but less often.

My scalp had a similar problem with dandruff, and that is still ongoing, but my face is finally normal for the past 4 months in shitty winter weather, so judging by how fast it improved, seems I did something right.

Causation is kind of hard to pinpoint, since I travel a lot (and not use sunscreen most of the time), and had a lot of sun exposure, so I thought that might be a reason why I effed up my skin barrier.

Firstly let me say for the first few years it was way less often, and then it become a problem last year (more severe and more often), so I started being more curious and motivated to solve it.

First years I tried changing my diet. I was convinced it was a food trigger and changing my diet would solve it. I tried EVERYTHING including going vegan, carnivore, keto, fasting prolonged and intermittent and so on. Some diets kind of help but it's not really a cure, and now the problem is gone even though at the moment I eat pretty much everything. And drink coffee daily which I also tried getting rid of because my logic was caffeine = more cortisol = more inflammation.   
I also tried shitloads of natural creams, moisturizers, oils, even was experimenting with mixing my own recipes. Well, none of it worked.

That being said, my conclusion is that food wasn't the problem and that the problem is topical, some bacterial or fungal overgrowth, which is what my experiments tell me. Another trigger I have is my allergy to dust which usually affected only my breathing, but looks like now also shows on my skin. I realized this after I  had intense flare up day 1 after coming from living 5 months by the sea to my dusty apartment. (Not really dusty, it was actually cleaned properly, but it was a big difference in air quality).

This winter I had crazy intense flare ups that drove me mad. Woke me up middle of night feeling itchy like crazy and that's when I had my genius idea. I tried putting some natural honey on my face to calm it down and it INSTANTLY felt good. The itchiness was gone and I could finally fall asleep in peace.

Next day I started researching about treating myself with honey and also found some post  which I cannot find anymore that convinced me that my problem was Malassezia and/or some other bacteria. 

And this is what I did and that actually worked instantly, and my skin feels normal after a long while:  


SOLUTION TL;DR

1) I mixed honey 2 teaspoon (any natural honey, preferably liquid) and tea tree oil which I bought in India (little amount, I pressed one time on my spray bottle), and put it on my face and scalp for 3h every other day and rinse out afterward.

I did this for a month even though it felt like I was ""cured"" after a week.   
My idea was to continue this for 3,4 months to let my skin heal, but to reduce it every month to every third day then every fourth day and then once weekly.

Well, I kind of changed my mind and ended up going once a week or when I feel like it after the first month. (sometimes for less than 3 hours) since the results were instant.

2) MCT oil to keep to moisture in. Apparently Malassezia doesn't feed on it (I use it only after a shower)

3) Collagen (https://shopbuilder.hr/zastita-zglobova/jutavit-collagen-hyaluron-complex-400-gr-p15627) once a day recommended dose

  
4)  Fire honey/spice mix every morning (for the first month at least). Now I do when I feel like it. (https://myblissfulbalance.co.uk/2025/10/16/fire-honey-natural-cold-flu-remedy-%F0%9F%8D%AF%F0%9F%8C%B6/). Can go easier on cayenne pepper if you want

4.5) Try not to touch the face or scratch it (starts being much easier when it's not constantly itchy, but some people might do it unconsciously

วิธีที่เทคโนโลยีนี้ช่วยเพิ่มขีดความสามารถในการแข่งขันประกอบด้วย:

***1. การเข้าถึงตลาดและ ""ใบผ่านทางด้านสิ่งแวดล้อม""***

การใช้ไฮโดรเจนในการคั่วถือเป็น **""ใบผ่านทาง"" ที่สำคัญสู่ตลาดพรีเมียมระดับสากล** โดยเฉพาะในสหภาพยุโรป (EU), ญี่ปุ่น และอเมริกาเหนือ

• **การปฏิบัติตามกฎระเบียบ:** การเผาไหม้ไฮโดรเจนก่อให้เกิดเพียงไอน้ำ ทำให้กระบวนการเป็นกลางทางคาร์บอน 100% ซึ่งช่วยให้กาแฟลาวผ่านเกณฑ์มาตรฐานสิ่งแวดล้อมที่เข้มงวด เช่น มติปรับคาร์บอนก่อนเข้าพรมแดน (CBAM) ของ EU และอาจได้รับ **การยกเว้นภาษี**

• **แบรนด์กาแฟสะอาด:** ฉลาก ""กาแฟสะอาด 100%"" (100% clean coffee) เป็นเครื่องมือทางการตลาดที่ทรงพลังในการดึงดูดผู้บริโภคระดับบนที่ใส่ใจสิ่งแวดล้อมและต้องการสินค้าที่ตรวจสอบความยั่งยืนได้

***2. คุณภาพและรสสัมผัสที่เหนือกว่า***

เทคโนโลยีไฮโดรเจนเปลี่ยนโปรไฟล์รสชาติของกาแฟ ซึ่งเป็นปัจจัยตัดสินสำคัญในการซื้อซ้ำในตลาดกาแฟพิเศษ (Specialty market)

• **รสชาติที่บริสุทธิ์:** การคั่วด้วยแก๊สแบบเดิมอาจทิ้งกลิ่นควันจากการเผาไหม้ที่บดบังเอกลักษณ์เฉพาะตัวของเมล็ดกาแฟ แต่การคั่วด้วยไฮโดรเจนจะให้ **รสชาติที่ใสและนุ่มนวลกว่า** ทำให้กลิ่นอายธรรมชาติของกาแฟจากที่ราบสูงโบโลเวนโดดเด่นขึ้นมา

• **ความแม่นยำและความหวาน:** ไฮโดรเจนช่วยให้ควบคุมอุณหภูมิได้แม่นยำกว่าแก๊สธรรมชาติ ช่วยให้โรงคั่วสามารถคงอุณหภูมิต่ำได้นานขึ้นในช่วง ""Development"" ซึ่งช่วยดึงความหวานและบอดี้ออกมาได้มากขึ้นโดยไม่ทำลายกรดและน้ำตาลที่ละเอียดอ่อนในเมล็ดกาแฟ

• **อายุการเก็บรักษา:** เทคโนโลยีนี้ช่วยให้เมล็ดกาแฟมีความเสถียรและป้องกันการสูญเสียกลิ่นหอม ทำให้กาแฟลาวรักษาคุณภาพได้นานกว่าการคั่วแบบทั่วไป

***3. ความได้เปรียบด้านต้นทุนจากพลังงานน้ำ***

ลาวใช้สถานะการเป็น **""หม้อไฟแห่งเอเชียตะวันออกเฉียงใต้""** เพื่อผลิตไฮโดรเจนสีเขียว (Green hydrogen) ในราคาที่ถูกกว่าประเทศเพื่อนบ้าน

• **การประสานพลังงาน:** ไฟฟ้าของลาวประมาณ 80% มาจากพลังงานน้ำ การใช้ไฟฟ้าส่วนเกินในช่วงฤดูฝนมาผลิตไฮโดรเจนผ่านกระบวนการแยกน้ำด้วยไฟฟ้าช่วยลดต้นทุนการสร้างโครงสร้างพื้นฐานใหม่ได้ถึง 60%

• **เสถียรภาพด้านราคา:** ไฮโดรเจนสีเขียวที่ผลิตในประเทศมีต้นทุนประมาณ **1.86 ดอลลาร์ต่อกิโลกรัม** ทำให้เป็นแหล่งเชื้อเพลิงที่มั่นคงและไม่ผันผวนตามราคาตลาดเชื้อเพลิงฟอสซิลโลก

***4. ความยืดหยุ่นทางเศรษฐกิจและสังคม***

การเปลี่ยนแปลงนี้สร้างสภาพแวดล้อมทางเศรษฐกิจที่มั่นคงและยั่งยืนให้กับเกษตรกรรายย่อยหลายพันครัวเรือน

• **การรับซื้อที่แน่นอน:** โครงการนำโดยญี่ปุ่นมีพันธสัญญาในการรับซื้อเมล็ดกาแฟดิบสูงถึง **6,000 ตันต่อปี** เพื่อป้อนโรงงานคั่วแห่งใหม่ สร้างความต้องการที่แน่นอนในระยะยาวให้แก่ผู้ผลิตบนที่ราบสูงโบโลเวน

• **การเพิ่มมูลค่าในประเทศ:** การแปรรูปกาแฟด้วยเทคโนโลยีขั้นสูงภายในประเทศช่วยให้มูลค่าส่วนใหญ่ยังคงอยู่ในลาว สนับสนุนความเป็นอยู่ของคนในชนบทและเพิ่มรายได้จากการส่งออกที่มีมูลค่าสูงเพื่อช่วยลดหนี้สาธารณะของประเทศ",1,1770894259.0,barista,0,1.0,False

Wager Amount: 2.5U to WIN 10.2U

League: AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am (CBS/ESPN+/Golf Channel/Paramount+)

**Recap**: Not a bad beat, but still sucked that this loss. Sengun had a slow start in the 1st half and only grabbed 2 boards, end up wit 7 boards. Ball didn't bounce towards his way, so I can live wit that. It was a great matchup and maybe I should have gone wit Brook Lopez U 3.5 Rebounds (which he actually had 2 quick boards in the 1st quarter) and end up wit 2 boards.

**Matchup:** Going back to PGA Top X lay for the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am tournament. These three guys are my locks, Scottie Scheffler, Si Woo Kim, and Justin Rose. Scheffler Top 10 is a no brainer, he's that great and IMO the best ever, he needs to be compare to the greats like Tiger Woods. Surprisingly Scheffler has yet to win this tournament, so this might be his first. Taking both Si Woo Kim and Justin Rose to make Top 20. Si Woo Kim is on a tear and he's done really well in this course, he's made top 20 the last two tournaments. Same wit Justin Rose who I think has the best chance to win this tournament and I will take those odds for him to win outright. Rose has won this same exact tournament couple years before and he put a good run for his money against last year Pebble Beach tournament winner, Rory McIlroy.

**The Play & Prediction :** I like my chances wit these 3 guys and they are my lock lay for this tournament, Scheffler Top 10, Si Woo Kim Top 20, and Justin Rose Top 20. I took a couple longshot as well, but this the play. 2.5U on this PGA Top X Finish Parlay (Used my DK boost to get +405, it's +340 witout) Also 0.5U on Justin Rose outright winner.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1r2qajd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r2qajd/tried_building_a_calm_productivity_app_heres_what/,Tried building a calm productivity app. Here’s what happened.,"I built a small app called Nuddge.

It gives you just one gentle daily action instead of overwhelming habit trackers. My best friend has ADHD and others have mentioned feeling overwhelmed as they move into late 20s and early 30s.

Built it in about \~30 hours total using React Native. The goal was to build it and ship it as fast as physically possible, while keeping the whole premise supremely simple.

I wanted something anti-hustle, anti-streaks, just one small win per day.

Reality check so far:

\- LinkedIn post to friends, family, connections

\- \~10-15 installs

\- Ran Reddit ads

\- \~50 clicks

\- 1 install😅

\- Ran a TikTok account with original content

\- No real organic engagement

\- Haven’t reached out to ADHD/overwhelm creators yet

So yeah… tough market.

I recently lowered the pricing too, so it’s like a coffee a month if even; and you can get lifetime use for \~$20.

Still, I’m glad I shipped it instead of letting it sit on my laptop.

Would genuinely love feedback from other builders on:

\- does the idea resonate?

\- landing/page messaging and branding?

\- would you ever use something like this?

\- would you pay, or expect this to be free with some ads?

1r2q9pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r2q9pr/aitah_for_ignoring_my_friends_ex/,AITAH for ignoring my friend’s ex?,"I (30F) got some messages from my friend’s ex (35M), and I am ignoring him. To be honest, I don’t know what to do with this situation.

Some background. My friend, let’s call her Eve (31F), didn’t have it easy. She got pregnat at 18 with a older guy, who move in with her, stopped working, and didn’t do anything. He was manipulative and whenever she didn’t do anything he wanted, he spined it of to her family as her being the evil one. Didn’t cooked him his favorite dish, because steak is expensive? She is starving him. Asked him to look after the baby so she doesn’t have to take her to store? She is neglecting the baby. He hit her? He did it because she was yelling at him. At the time they lived in her family house so they didn’t paid rent (generational house). He refused to leave, and her family trusted his version of events over her’s (it was the first version they heard, they didn’t even let her tell them her side) so they always let him back in when she managed to kick him out. That lead Eve to leaving herself and rent an apartment, which left her to strugle financialy as single mother.

A few years later, and a few attempts to date again, Eve met him (let’s call him Tom). At the time she was dating someone else, so it was only friendship, which Tom didn’t like. Eve invited me over to watch movie. Tom was there, I don’t know why. We were watching a movie (some sci-fi nonsence), and she left to make more popcorn, he tried to kiss me. I pushed him away. Tom was surpriced I didn’t just let him and wanted to know why I pushed him away, which I told him I am no second price and left.

A week later Eve broke up with her then boyfriend and started to date Tom. They constantly went somewhere. Restaurants 4D cinemas, racing cars, wellness retreats, ect. He paid for everything, and I was surpriced, Tom didn’t look like a guy who have that kind of money. And there was something fishy about him. A month in, and they were trying for a baby. Our friend group tryied to stop her, but EVE was in love. She got pregnant quickly and he proposed. Her family was happy she will stop being single mother (they were old fashioned from small city). Her and her family paid for everything, our friend group, as bridemaids, took care of many things to make it cheaper (our dress, food, waitering, bartending, photografing,…). We even prepared a bachelorete for her, which showed us the first cracks in his facade. He didn’t allowed her to go, unless he goes too. Que bachelor&bachelorete party, us bridemaids paid for. Food, drinks, tickets for bowling for us, her, and him and his friends, because in the last minute Tom refused to pay us back. The whole time he was grumpy, and didn’t let her do anything. The only time Tom was happy was when we went to a club and he danced with some girls, while Eve sat in the corner with us, crying, because she wasn’t allowed to do anything. We begged her to not marry him, but everything was paid for, non-refundable, and her family was pressuring her because being single mother of two is even worse and she didn’t want to strugle again. So she was adamant to marry him.

At the wedding I had another issue with Tom. I was talking to Eve’s uncle and male cousin. Tom interupted me and start to talk to them as if I wasn’t present, and asked them if they think my boobs were real. He was clearly drunk. They didn’t know how to answer, they were in shock and stutered out something as “I don’t know”, which Tom proudly said he know because he touched them and I wanted him so bad. He clearly tried to rewrite history to make himself look as desirable, maybe even look better in front of Eve’s family for “choosing” Eve, but I didn’t care. I just looked him in the eyes and said “I wouldn’t touch you with a ten feet pole”. He said something like “But you did want me!” in a tone of angry todler and left. Eve’s uncle and cousin just muttered “Who the hell did Eve marry?” Durring the wedding, Tom also was saying they will have a boy, or they will have another child immediately (Yuck). That was the moment we found out he had a daughter from previous relationship he didn’t care about. Tom said it was because his ex won’t let him see her, but it was obvious he just didn’t want to, because it was a girl. Also, his ex had a restraining order for DV, which he sweared were false.

Durring the marriage, Tom was even worse. He stoped working, forced Eve to go back to work (even when she supposed to have 3 years of maternal leave). He refused to take faternal leave instead of her (which was posible), so he would get money from the state while taking care of his “beloved” newborn son, and Eve could work full time. No, instead Eve had to find work from home, so she could work, take care of the baby, the home, and Tom, while he was watching TV. He also told her he was around $15K in debt (in country where people earned aroun $1000-$1500). He convinced Eve it was debt made by his ex when they were together, and now, when he doesn’t have work, Eve has to pay it for him.

I was visiting Eve quite often, hoping I make her see sence and leave him. Surpricingly, he didn’t have problem with me being there (he did have problem with the rest of our friend group). When I was there, he changed into weird mix of misagonyst and pick me. He was always bragging about himself, how manly he is, and how he does like anything we were talking about. For example, we were talking about new pizza place, and he interupted us with “I make the best pizza”. When I asked him why won’t he make some then, he answered that cooking is women’s job. I just finished by saing “And working and earning money is men’s job, so what are you doing?” That always led to him trying to convince me how he is right and I should be on his side, because he is amazing. He just needed constant validations, which I refused to give him

That marriage didn’t last even a year. One day I got a call from Eve, asking me if I can take care of the kids. She was in hospital. Tom physicaly attacked her, because they were out at the club and she danced with someone else. I called police to go with me to pick up the kids (which was amazing idea, because he was waiting for it with his parents, and I found out who he got that agression from). Eve divorced him, but at court, she found out half of that debt will go to her, because they didn’t have prenup. That was the moment she found out that debt was made by him when he paid for everything while dating her and others before her. His plan was to get someone to marry him so they took care of him (and also give him that son he wanted so much, yuck). And because he didn’t have the looks, he had to wow them with actions, which cost money.

So that is how relationship ended. Her, with PTS, two kids, two baby daddys who doesn’t pay child support, and 70K in debt. It happened 6 years go.

But now Tom started messaging me. First message came on Facebook, where he commented on my new photo, how good I look now and how sexy I am (I lost some weight). I ignored it. He then send me a private messages there, to meet him for coffee. I blocked him. He then found me on other socials and started to sending me messages there, which lead to more blocking. He even asked his son about me, who told him everything he knows (of couse he did, he’s a kid who thought he is braging about amazing aunt to his dad who suddenly care). He told Tom how I bring them gifts and take him and his sister on trips, and how I own my own apartment where they spend a week with me, when they had a school break and their mom didn’t got vacation. Que more messages, this time on my phone, how he wants to talk about his son. Blocked again.

Last week some woman stopped me on the street. It was Tom’s mother and she started telling me how cruel I am, how Tom just wants to talk about his son, and I am ignoring him. I told her that is something he should talk about with the MOTHER, Eve, not me. Which only led to her saying how todays women are all the same, how I’m same as Eve, and how her boy changed, but we don’t want to give him a chance. I just left. But now some of my friends (those who don’t know Eve) are telling me I am an AH for ignoring him. Maybe he truly wants to talk about his son, and Eve won’t listen to him, so he was reaching for help. They also told me I should not be biased against him, just because what Eve told me, because he didn’t do anything to ME, and she might just made that up. That it is suspicious that both fathers were bad to her. They also told me that he might think of me as a nutila friend of both of them (Tom and Eve), because I was talking to him at their place (mostly arguing, but ok?). But I still don’t see the reason why I should help him. To he honest, I don’t know why he is contacting ME, after 6 years, and he creeps me out.

So am I the AITAH for ignoring his messages?",1,1770893142.0,AITAH,9,0.67,False
