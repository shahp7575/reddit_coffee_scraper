Common hand embroidery techniques will include cross-stitch, satin stitch, and French knots.

**Design Complexity**

Design complexity refers to the level of detail and intricacy in the embroidered pattern. Simple geometric patterns will offer a minimalist and contemporary aesthetic, while elaborate floral or botanical designs will evoke a more conventional and romantic feel. The best table runners will demonstrate thoughtful design elements, such as balanced compositions, contrasting colors, and varying stitch types to create visual interest.

**Color Palette**

The color palette is a crucial factor in determining the table runner's versatility and ability to complement existing décor.

For reference I work at a very small independent neighborhood coffee shop.  I know most of the regulars by order and the newbies I can generally give a good time to. 

This particular customer, regular though she is, is absolutely garbage. Rude, entitled, belittling, disrespectful; you name it. Usually I try to give minimal interaction, but one day I apparently didn't do things *just right*

So I get to work one day, and the boss tells me he's gotten a complaint.  Now, I've been there for almost 13 years, and aside from the growing pains of starting what is the equivalent of a coffee shop version of a dive bar, I have had complaints that I can count on one hand.  

Anyway, he goes on to tell me that a customer has complained that I've been rude/dismissive, etc...  I say, okay. I will definitely be mindful of things with this customer moving forward 

Cue malicious compliance 

Every. Single.  Time.  I have seen her since, she gets the absolute, over-the-top, stepford barista treatment.  Think June Cleaver ratcheted up to 13.  Just pouring on the 'midwestern nice' like a thick saccharine syrup.  

I've been doing this for at least two months.  And, believe me when I say that it drives me absolutely out of my mind to do it.  It takes so much energy to treat this human this way.  

Except today.  

Today I gave her the exact same treatment as I have been.  Except today she made a crucial error. She let it slip that the way I talk to her is irritating.  

When I tell you I haven't had such a rush of happy brain chemicals in almost a decade, it's not a lie.  And, now that I know it annoys her, it'll keep happening.  Because now, it's not going to take excess energy to do it.  Now it's fueled by spite. 

TL;DR: customer complained I was rude, so I'm ""killing her with kindness"" and she finds it irritating.  Ergo, I will never stop",9,1754096261.0,MaliciousCompliance,0,1.0,False

I was on vacation with my family when I fell down the stairs, and my leg twisted back awkwardly (like a ballerina’s, unfortunately). The fracture happened almost two weeks ago, and I’ve been in a cast for about a week and two days now.

I’ve been trying to stay sane by doing upper body workouts, writing articles and books, reading, and working from home. But honestly? It’s driving me a little crazy.

Before the injury, I used to work out every weekday for two hours—mostly running, which I absolutely love. I’d go out every day for a walk, grab groceries, listen to music, or go for coffee. It’s been incredibly tough to suddenly go from all that movement to lying still most of the day.

1mfddo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BTSnark/comments/1mfddo9/btss_originality_in_their_music_journey/,BTS's Originality in their Music Journey,"When I was an ARMY, i always noticed how BTS had samples in their songs and it would gnaw at the back of my head as somebody who loved the 'self-produced', 'original' tags they were giving themselves. It's okay to sample songs but constantly doing it even before the pinnacle of your career is so weird like some of these songs feel like those OC characters included in actual shows like this was THEIR take on it and not a BTS song, basically some fanfic idk... also feels like the Yung Gravy sampling examples, it's not a good look.  

Given their plagiarism controversy, it feels weird that they've sampled this much and I wasn't going to make a post until I saw this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BTSnark/comments/1mcyyfp/antis_only_criticize_the_english_songs_so_heres/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Most of these were compiled from the BTS wiki, WhoSampled, and just some digging around along with songs I've noticed myself. It's easier to just compile it all together, right? I'm also including weird ass covers bc wtf some of them just ripped off the song.  I think the constant sampling is what stunted the growth to actual good music since BTS and HYBE rely on it too much instead of doing their own thing. Think of it as artists tracing their work sometimes. You can't even call some of these samples because they literally did NOTHING with it yet.

""Christmas Day"" (Jimin, Jungkook) -- JB - ""Mistletoe"" 

I've really just took the songs off of this list so the covers should be here [as well](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/Unofficial_songs). They have more than 49 covers (lost track in counting) but I find that a lot of covers that Jungkook seems to join in on are somewhat related to IU...

Any IU fan knows she's a HUGE fan of Corrine Bailey Ray and the wiki didn't list the Like A Star adapted song made by Namjoon and Jungkook. They listed the J Cole's song instead (which J Cole sampled) but it's weird. Jungkook has notoriously covered a ton of IU songs compared to other covers where it's male western artists that he's obsessed with (Justin Bieber). He's so weird.  

Fans call these homages which I think are fine but most of these songs are predebut which is when they're supposed to be experimenting so its not even crossing the big red line of weird, it's just... there. Still, keeping the title name to the original song isn't giving homage or credit imo (I used to listen to almost all of these songs back then and I only knew 2 of these were adapted/sampled).  onto the actual albums.

and ofc we all know the ""What Do You Think"" infamous Jim Jones sample. This is all I could find in the time I had but I couldn't find exact ones for some songs. I listened to I Wonder because of a comment in the linked thread (thank you u/descartesasaur!) and when i tell you it sounded just like Daft Punk omg but I can't pinpoint what exact song... (i feel it coming again??? idk!!!!)

I also listened to  a few songs of RPWP (thank you u/RAHHHHilovesillyhoes!) which is so shocking, I never expected RM to be a flop Tyler the Creator rip off.

Considering that BTS are like chameleons in the way that they shapeshift and steal other people's concepts/personas, it's not very surprising. They did the same with Hip Hop, they did the same with Kpop, ofc it'll be the same with ""BTSpop"" (whatever tf that means to their corny fans). As for JK, it's pretty obviosu he's a JB/JT flop so...

I'm 21(F) and I thought I'd stopped until I finish university because my last breakup with my boyfriend was rough (he was physically abusive). Anyways the breakup occurred two years ago and I haven't really been interested in anyone since until around six months ago. 

I was just at Barnes&Noble and I noticed this girl, I've seen her in the store before because we both come often i guess— But that day specifically she looked really pretty. I started talking to her and she agreed to come get coffee with me, we exchange numbers. It's important for me to mention that she told me she had just turned 18 when I asked. A little young, but I thought it was fine, she was cute.

Fast forward like three months after that, we text often and meet up. I really enjoy talking to her, meeting up and stuff and finally I decide to ask her out over ice cream. She says yes, I'm ecstatic. She spends the night as she said her parents were gone on a trip. We end up having s**, and in the morning I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. 

However my honeymoon high was interrupted in the following week as I had noticed my gf's texts were slightly dry and she seemed more nervous when we met up. I asked her what was wrong and then she burst into tears. She told me she was 15, and for a second I was shocked. (Okay there were some red flags I may have ignored. She had a young look to her, but I just thought she had a baby face. And I guess she was sort of clueless about some things but she seemed mature.)

Regardless I tried to say how lying to me was not okay and that we needed to breakup but she wouldn't stop crying and I relented and hugged her. I felt bad because she said she hadn't lied about everything— She was a loner, getting bullied in school without friends. She told me she loved me and that if I broke up with her, surely she'd just end up in a relationship with an actual predator or a bad person who'd take advantage of her.

Atp I told her fine but we wouldn't do anything s*xual though and she agreed immediately. It's been three months since then, and I hate to say it but I don't entirely hate my relationship with her. She's sweet, and I don't want to say mature but she's very emotionally intelligent in a way even people my age aren't. I enjoy talking to her, just going on dates. Intimacy-wise, at most we kissed and cuddle. I really do love her.

 But sometimes I do feel guilty—like she cant even drive yet. But I don't know anymore. Is breaking up with her the best choice for her sake.?",0,1754095955.0,self,0,0.5,False

I'm a 31 year old guy that just wants someone that's proud of me. Buckle in as I tend to ramble. I was born premature due to my birth giver trying to abort me and using hard drugs/drinking while carrying me. I've never met her and never plan to. I spent most of my early years in and out of the hospital because of complications (fast forward) the ONLY memory I have of my dad was him throwing my stepmom thru a glass coffee table and strangling her. (Fast forward) The step mom then beat me every single day I can remember until I ran away at 16. And I mean BEAT, make me drink toilet water, eat peppers as punishment or just plain starve me, lock me outside to sleep in the winter and watch to make sure I didn't crawl into the doghouse we had. Would bend my fingers to see how far it would go without breaking, hit me in the head and ribs with anything solid until I couldn't see right and I'd beg her to stop so she'd tell me to go lay down and sleep...then come in even more drunk and irate calling me my dad's name, I was worthless, I was just like him and call me every name on the book. I missed so much school because I was black and blue...she told me if anyone with CPS was told the people I'd go to would be worse. She ""loved"" me and was so mentally manipulative. I was so SO angry, afraid and on edge all the time. She deprived me of food, shelter and humanity...I just wanted to be loved and safe. (Fast forward) I ran away at 16, slept in parks, worked 2 jobs and graduated highschool at almost top of my class. And nothing, no ""I'm sorry"" she said I made it all up and I got a ""I'm surprised"" 
I got with the wrong people and got into drugs/drink and crime. Went to jail and got a ""it was a matter of time"" I pulled my head out of my ass and refused to end up like my dead beat dad. 

I am a father myself now, I'm sober. I went to rehab and put myself in anger management/therapy (years ago) And being a parent made me realize how bad it actually was...I've never hit my child, I've never screamed my head off...she chose to do that. 

When I broke down to her (because I was thinking of ending it because I thought I was crazy) and asked her to go to therapy with me to talk about it and finally admit it didn't make it up she said ""if that's what you remember then that's your problem"" and when I came back from rehab I got ""well maybe now you'll talk to me now"" and ""it wasn't easy raising you, I didn't have a book""

My wife's late grandma. She recently passed after 94 laps around the sun. I was only in her life for 15 of those 94 trips, but I can say without a shaddow of a doubt that I had the best grandma-in-law anyone could ever have asked for. Sweet, caring, and full of energy that puts my 36 year old self to shame. So why mention the great depression? Well, the people I have known who survived that tended to...keep things. Both grandparents on my side were like that. Small sample size sure but from what I have read it seems to be the cliche so I am just rolling with it.  Why bring up the fact she is German? This is where this tendency gets a tad more interesting. She and her late partner (who admittedly was more of the pack rat...he squirrelled away close to $1,000 in Kennedy half dollars in old oatmeal tubs, 3 to be exact, and a coffee tin) loved beer. There was a room in her basement that was chaulk full of beer. And wine. And spices. And vinegar. And number 10 cans of fruit cocktail that was bulging. And for people that did not drink liquor: a bunch of liquor. My wife's family are not big drinkers so they told me to go look through to see if I could find anything I would like to take. So I did. Most of it was vodka that was half gone, empty brandy and sherry bottles, but to my surprise, I found a few unopened bottles of bourbon, and a half drank half pint of Windsor. Cracked it open to smell it and by golly, it didn't smell anything like the Windsor I had as an 18 year old taking shots from a friend's dad's liquor cabinet. Took a quick swig and boy howdy was it a surprise. Wife even tasted it and she was surprised as well (rest of her family politely passed...and I don't blame them, what kinda degenerate drinks from a bottle that has likely been opened for at least 30 years?). I'll be going into more detail about the other bottles I found but suffice to say, I am very excited to actually sit down and do reviews as I have already had several tastes of 1 of the bottles and cracked another and found it quite enjoyable. If I am reading the bottom of the bottle correctly, the bottle was made in 1984. I brought the bottle with when I visited a friend way up on the border of Minnesota and Canada because the guy eats Windsor 7's like they are going to be illegal someday. He found it to be easier drinking that current Windsor. I poured myself a little taste of this bottle of the new Windsor and can emphatically say the old was better. New tasted more butterscotchy but in an... artificial way if tha makes sense. But, you didn't come here to read my rambling stories. You are here for the good good. I don't have any new Windsor to compare it to and I know I'm not going to drink what I have left after this so this won't be a comparison, plus I already said the new stuff tasted worse so I am just going to leave that like that (I stopped at the Kroger close to my place and asked if they had any shooters of Windsor, the person at the counter had no clue what Windsor was...but to his credit, Lexington, KY is a long way from Canada). Now I am rambling again, on for real this time:

Grandma's basement liquor closet bottle: half pint of Windsor 

Year: 1984

Proof: 80

Time open: not really sure but probably 30+years

Served: neat in glencairn, just poured and started drinking right away....it has been opened for long enough it doesn't need to be rested, in fact if I were to rest it, the whiskey in the glass may start to rebel as I am making it wait even longer to serve it's purpose which is to make my tummy warm and head a little light.

Nose: it's sweet, maybe caramel corn-esque? And maybe I'm making this up, but oak, and not necessarily faint oak either. Subdued ethanal, but let's be honest, anything open for this long is going to have a good bit of edge taken off. 

Palate: butterscotch, with a bit of alcohol kick. It is very one note on the second sip. And that note is butterscotch. Maybe some faint oak is now coming through. Kinda maybe a faint grass like quality? There is also a bitterness that is bordering on unpleasant. I will say, the mouth feel on this is actually quite nice. 

Finish: the butterscotch lingers a bit longer than you would think. The butterscotch gives to nothing really. Some of that Windsor alcohol taste did come through. The taste that I remember from my younger years, but it isn't nearly as strong and not unpleasant as back then or with new Windsor. For as good the month feel was, that finish dissipates without much pomp. 

Final thoughts: seriously I can't believe this stuff. The edges from the alcohol were probably rounded off a couple decades ago and I'm just happy I get to enjoy this right now.  Is it the panacea of Canadian whiskey? Absolutely not.  Would I choose to drink this neat over anything else that I have? Can't think of a bottle I would chose after this. Is it better than current Windsor? To my palate yes without a doubt. This is just a fun little bottle that I get to keep and take a nip from every now and then. Better than just pouring it down the drain in my book. 

I'm not sure who the guy was who had his name on the bottle, but I like to imagine he was a fun fella who would get a kick out of someone finding his half drank bottle of Windsor from the 80's and doing this type of thing on a thing that wasn't available to the public when he first drank from this bottle. What a trip this is though. If Windsor tasted this like today I may have gotten a bottle to keep on the shelf, but I am also not going to put in the investment to get new Windsor to taste like this (i.e., forget about the opened bottle for 30 years). My grandpa's whiskey of choice was Windsor and that always confounded me, but I can certainly understand it a bit better now: the stuff he was drinking back when he would drink it more often (he passed 3 years ago this coming December) was better than what can be gotten today. Now alls I gotta do is get a bottle of old Milwaukee and really have one for Grandpa now that I think about it. Stay tuned, got 4 more offerings to try, will get to them all. Thanks for hanging out reading this, I appreciate you. Take care and stay safe out there!

Rating: 4/10 (I mean it's Windsor that has been open for longer than I have been on this planet....can't really expect much more than that lol)

It doesn’t trap you the way you’d expect. It lets you leave so you can unravel in the places you think are safe. I thought I escaped. I thought wrong.

------------------------

I opened my eyes and found myself back in the bed within Room 409.

The sheets were tucked like a nurse’s apology. Sunlight poured in through cracked blinds. Outside—birds chirped. Somewhere far away, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through a hallway that shouldn’t exist.

Everything felt normal — which is how I knew it wasn’t.

The wallpaper didn’t breathe. The mirror didn’t whisper. The notebook was gone. The silence was polite.

It felt like a dream trying to pass as a memory.

I stood. My coat hung on the back of a chair—clean, pressed, unscarred. I slipped it on. It fit too well.

For a fleeting second, I almost believed I was free.

Downstairs, the lobby was quiet. Empty. No mildew. No static hum in the vents.

Just sunlight.

I stepped outside.

The air was sharp and fresh, no longer polluted from the scent of the sky bleeding rain. My car was waiting, and my keys found their way into my hand out of instinct.

The engine purred to life as I drove past blinking stoplights, past kids with backpacks, and shopkeepers sweeping sidewalks. The kind of world where tragedy only lives in newspaper headlines.

It felt like waking up from an unfathomable nightmare.

Maybe that’s what I wanted all along, to believe this was just a dream.

⸻

At some point during my drive, I decided to stop off at a gas station to use the restroom.

The water swirled red as I washed my hands. Not blood. Something older. Remembrance?

I looked up.

My face smiled back. Rested. Too rested. Like grief had been ironed out of all the pores of my skin.

I forced a smile. The reflection held it longer than I did.

Then—behind me:

“You left me.”

My heart stopped.

I turned.

Empty bathroom stalls. Silent.

Except one was ajar.

Wet, child-sized footprints trailed from the tiles.

Back in the mirror—

Mr. Grey sat on the counter behind me.

And my reflection?

It didn’t move.

It just watched me.

Disturbed by what I was experiencing, I left the bathroom in a panic. 

I didn’t know what to believe anymore…

⸻

The drive home was uneventful but ephemeral.

I was just happy to be in the outside world again and away from that dreaded place.

I placed the key in lock of the door and noticed that the lights were already on.

My apartment looked rather immaculate. The couch, dishes, and books were all pristine and organized appropriately.

I noticed one particular photo on the wall though; one I was sure I had taken down months ago.

My little girl, holding Mr. Grey.

I turned toward the dining table and noticed that the journal from the hotel was there.

No dust. No reason.

Just resting out in the open, as if it were anticipating my arrival.

I didn’t touch it, not yet.

My phone buzzed softly as I reached down to grab it.

The screen was lit up with the notification of a new voicemail.

I didn’t remember calling anyone.

I pressed play and began listening with fearful eagerness.

I heard my voice speaking, but...it also wasn’t mine.

It was flat, lifeless, eerily mechanical. It was like someone was reading from a script with complete disinterest in the subject matter.

“I’m home now. It’s safe here. I’m better now.”

I deleted it and thought that was the end.

But then it returned. Same timestamp. Same flat voice. Like it had never left.

As quickly as I deleted these voicemails though, they would appear in my inbox again and again.

No matter how many times I tried to delete it, it would come back.

I eventually chalked up my endeavors as fruitless and walked to the bedroom where a lamp glowed somewhat ominously in the corner.

Blue.

The exact shade she liked.

And beneath the lighting, sitting cross-legged was the girl in the photograph with Mr. Grey.

It was Emily, my little girl…my daughter.

She didn’t move and she didn’t blink.

She just sat underneath the glow of the lamp as if she were in a period of stasis.

But when I whispered her name, she looked up.

“I didn’t want to go alone,” she spoke in a hushed tone.

Her voice was purely air, barely more than a faint breath.

I stepped closer, my knees shaking. “You weren’t alone, Emily…”

She shook her head. “Yes, I was…you left me in the dark.”

“I didn’t want to see you suffer anymore honey...” I whimpered, fighting the tears that threatened to trail down my face.

“Why did you do this?”

She reached out and touched my fingers.

They were warm…real.

And then as quickly as she appeared…she was gone.

Like she’d never been there.

The lamp flickered, black and blue pulsating the room briefly before the colors surrendered to the darkness. 

I screamed into the mattress, begging internally for a god that I didn’t even know existed to release me from this agony.

No sound came out, just a heavy and sustained breath of emotional turmoil.

The weight of everything I never said.

⸻

Things started unraveling the next morning despite the world pretending again.

I brewed my coffee, made some breakfast, and watched TV in the living room.

I did my best to block out the previous day’s events, but no matter what I did it seemed like my mind constantly gravitated back towards it.

I finished up watching a random program and went to go wash my dirty dishes when I felt like a pair of eyes were upon me.

It felt like I was being watched by someone, or something.

I looked around but didn’t see anything except the journal, the one from Room 409 on my dining room table.

I walked towards it and noticed that it was open.

It only had one line written across the page:

“How many times will you bury her to protect yourself?”

I slammed it shut.

The leather felt like melted flesh against my hand as I threw it across the room.

I watched in pure astonishment as it vanished in mid-air.

That was the first of many things that I couldn’t begin to explain:

•	In the bathroom mirror, I watched myself walk away. Another time I saw my reflection smile when I didn’t.

•	A girl on the sidewalk whispered, in my daughter’s voice, “I still remember you.”

•	The sound of peeling wallpaper buzzed behind my teeth.

Most disturbingly though, the journal followed me no matter where I went. I couldn’t get rid of it either. I would throw it away, tear it apart, set it on fire, but it always came back to me in immaculate condition. 

In the fridge, in the mailbox, in the cabinets… 

It was always soaked in red ink and each time it reassembled itself, new words would be carved into its pages.

“You didn’t survive. You split.”
“He’s wearing your face now.”
“The Room didn’t trap you. You brought it with you.”

The words haunted me even behind my eyelids, to the point that I stopped trying to run away or destroy it.

One night, I dropped to the floor beside my bed and reached under it.

The journal was there because of course it would be.

Every page had been written in, but not by my own hand.

By Emily’s.

Drawings, scribbles, all the stories we never finished. Things she might’ve whispered to me if she had more time to.

My eyes fell upon the words inscribed on the final page:

“You thought healing meant pretending but healing means feeling. And you won’t let yourself.”

Her scent suddenly infiltrated my nostrils. Shampoo. Baby powder. The hallway after bath time.

Three knocks slowly reverberated throughout the room.  

Not from the door, but from inside the closet.

I turned. I already knew it was waiting.

I opened the door and the dark inside breathed out.

The closet wasn’t a closet.

It never had been.

It was an invitation shaped like absence.

I stepped inside and the dark swallowed my vision.

Hands brushed old coats, cardboard boxes. For a second, I thought maybe—just maybe—I’d imagined it all.

Then the floor shifted.

Not in weight, but in memory.

⸻

Suddenly, I found myself in a hallway.

It wasn’t mine nor the hotel’s.

It was…somewhere between.

The carpet was the color of faded red, like wine was spilt violently onto it. The wallpaper was a vine-green and seemed to sprawl endlessly. 

My ex-wife Claire picked it once, before we knew what kind of grief waited in the walls.

The hallway stretched in both directions – unending, dream-warped. It was infinite but familiar, like grief that forgot where it began.

There was no closet behind me.

No apartment.

Only this place.

I reached out and traced my fingers slowly along the wall. It pulsed—like it remembered me.

In the wallpaper: faint etchings, a child’s drawing, a hospital wristband.

A courtroom door?

This wasn’t a hallway, it was a map.

A map comprised of everything I’d refused to remember.

⸻

Doors lined the hallway like soldiers waiting to take orders.

They bore no numbers, only marks and symbols of various kinds.

A handprint. 

A burn. 

A crayon sun.

I opened the first door and stepped into Emily’s room.

Not a version of it.

It was her room, exactly how it had been.

And standing in the corner, in her unicorn pajamas…was Emily.

She didn’t look up. Instead, she just moved her thumbs like she was texting someone far away.

“Sweetheart?” I cautiously inched towards her, uncertain of what could potentially transpire.

She didn’t answer but rather kept moving her thumbs.

I stepped closer, the air thickening like a blanket of sorrow wrapping itself against my skin.

“I’m sorry,” The apology leaving me like a gasp. “I never stopped missing you. I just didn’t know how to carry it.”

She looked up with tired, bloodshot eyes.

They weren’t angry, but rather glassy with disappointment.

“You left me in the Room.” She murmured with child-like sadness.

“I didn’t mean to—”

“I waited.”

Her interruption made my blood turn to ice. She had never been that way with me before.

I reached out for her, but she evaporated like a mist.

I was left stupefied, nothing but the air and silence to offer me comfort.

The door to the room was gone now too.

Only the walls remained now.

For a moment, I knew how Fortunato felt - walled in, forgotten, sealed behind silence.

⸻

Eventually, the door to the room manifested itself again.

I opened it and I began walking down the hallway to navigate my way out of this hellscape I found myself in.

Door after door appeared, what awaited me on the other side was emotionally heavier than the last.

An empty hospital corridor that felt cold like a morgue.

Claire crying in a car, her body shuddering violently with grief.

My mother’s silence when I told her the machines were being turned off.

The Room was a map with each grief serving as a landmark.

Each memory was a trapdoor.

And it kept building out of me, like vines on an abandoned structure.

I stepped through the last door, the hallway’s shape already forgetting itself behind me. Its impermanence pressing down like a weight I couldn’t carry.

Home awaited me on the other side.

Sunlight beamed through the kitchen windows as I was greeted with the faint smell of toast and coffee.

As I was walking around the kitchen, my phone buzzed.

A notification revealed that I had received a message from Marla:

“You’re slipping again. The Room’s getting in.”

How could she have contacted me? I wasn’t sure she even existed.

The message disappeared seconds later and was instead replaced by:

“Come back before it keeps more of you.”

I placed my phone back in my pocket, my eyes falling upon the journal that waited nearby on the table.

It was open and in Claire’s own handwriting it said:

“You loved us. But you hated what it made you feel. You buried her so deep, you forgot where you left her. That’s why it can follow you. Because part of you never left that room.”

Below that, smaller ink:

“We’re not ghosts. You are.”

⸻

Later, I walked to the park in an attempt to clear my head.

The sun was warm; the sound of children’s laughter and swings creaking filled the air.

It almost felt real.

Almost.

Until—

“Dad?”

I turned.

Emily was standing near the swings with the other kids.

She was alive and smiling.

Not spectral. Not wrong.

Just… her.

I approached, a smile finally making an appearance. “Emily?”

She softly nodded. Behind her, every swing creaked – perfectly, in unison.

The other kids were gone.

The sky blinked in almost strobe light effect like it was forgetting how to hold its shape.

The grass warped until it found its identity again as…the hotel carpet?

The tree bark twisted into plaster.

The world morphed and reality seemed to break all laws of known physics known to man.

As everything began to settle, I realized I was back in Room 409.

It was as if I’d never left.

⸻

The journal was on the desk again.

But this time, the words weren’t written.

They were spoken — Claire’s voice rising from the pages like breath fogging glass:

“You keep trying to go forward with parts of you missing. But the Room doesn’t forget. It keeps what you try to leave behind.”

I looked in the mirror.

I was asleep.

Even though I was awake.

My reflection breathed. I didn’t.

It blinked.

I didn’t.

Behind me—

The closet creaked open, looking more like a casket than an invitation.

The Room let me run. But it knew I’d built it myself.

It wasn’t done with me…because I never stopped needing it.

Room 409 doesn’t keep you…it becomes you.",3,1754095115.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Y’all, I’m in Austin, the supposed vegan oasis of Texas, and I am shooketh to my core. I was just trying to vibe at a coffee shop on South Congress, sipping my oat milk latte, when I overheard some dude in a cowboy hat casually drop “I had brisket for breakfast.” BRISKET. FOR. BREAKFAST. 😱 I almost choked on my ethically sourced muffin. Like, sir, do you not know about tempeh bacon?! The poor cows, the planet, my feelings—all disrespected in one sentence. I had to do a quick mindfulness exercise in the bathroom to not scream “MEAT IS MURDER” in his face.
And THEN, I’m walking down 6th Street, trying to cleanse my aura with some sage I bought from a crystal shop, when I see a guy in a “Don’t Tread on Me” shirt. I swear I got instant goosebumps—pretty sure he’s a Nazi. Or at least Nazi-adjacent. I mean, who wears that shirt unironically in 2025?! I wanted to yeet my reusable straw at him, but I’m too conflict-averse, so I just speed-walked to the nearest mural of Willie Nelson to feel safe again.
To top it all off, I’m sitting here reflecting, and I’m just… so sorry for my whiteness. Like, I know I’m part of the problem just by existing in this gentrified city, taking up space at a kombucha bar while POC are probably dealing with way worse than my triggered vegan soul. I’m trying to unlearn my privilege, but it’s hard when I keep getting distracted by how many people here still eat meat like it’s no big deal. 😔
Austin, I love your weirdness, but can we please have fewer carnivores and crypto-fascists? I’m begging. Also, if anyone knows a good vegan taco spot that’s not too bougie, slide into my DMs. I need comfort food to cope with this chaos.
TL;DR: Austin’s meat obsession and sketchy “patriot” vibes are sending me into a vegan panic. Also, sorry for being white. Pls help. 🌮",3,1754094983.0,austincirclejerk,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The variety of Starbucks water bottles on the market means there's a feature set to match every preference.

**Material and Construction:** Starbucks water bottles are crafted from a range of materials, including stainless steel, glass, and BPA-free plastic. Stainless steel options are prized for their durability, temperature retention, and resistance to rust and corrosion. Glass bottles offer a clean taste and are aesthetically pleasing, while plastic bottles are lightweight and often more affordable. The construction quality varies, with some bottles featuring double-walled insulation for superior temperature control and others prioritizing sleek designs for portability.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** Starbucks offers water bottles in various sizes, from compact 12-ounce options perfect for short trips to larger 24-ounce or even 32-ounce bottles designed for all-day hydration. The dimensions also differ, with some bottles featuring a slim profile that fits easily into cup holders and backpack pockets, while others have a wider base for added stability. Consider your daily water intake goals and the space available in your bag or car when selecting the appropriate capacity and dimensions.

**Lid and Closure Mechanisms:** The lid design is a critical factor in the overall user experience. Starbucks water bottles come with a variety of lid options, including screw-on lids, flip-top lids, and straw lids. Screw-on lids offer a secure seal, preventing leaks and spills, while flip-top lids provide easy access to your drink with one hand. Straw lids are ideal for those who prefer sipping throughout the day. Some lids also feature integrated carrying loops or handles for added convenience.

**Insulation Performance:** Many Starbucks water bottles, particularly those made of stainless steel, boast double-walled insulation that keeps beverages cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours. This insulation technology helps maintain the desired temperature of your drink, whether you're enjoying ice-cold water on a hot summer day or sipping hot coffee during a chilly morning commute. The insulation performance can vary depending on the specific bottle model and the ambient temperature.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Starbucks water bottles are renowned for their stylish designs, ranging from minimalist and modern to vibrant and artistic. The company frequently releases limited-edition collections featuring unique patterns, colors, and collaborations with artists and designers. Whether you prefer a sleek stainless steel finish, a colorful graphic design, or a subtle logo, there's a Starbucks water bottle to match your personal style. The aesthetic appeal of these bottles makes them a popular accessory among Starbucks enthusiasts.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Maintaining a clean water bottle is essential for hygiene and preventing the buildup of bacteria and odors. Starbucks water bottles vary in terms of their ease of cleaning, with some models featuring wide mouths that allow for easy access with a bottle brush. Dishwasher-safe options are also available, providing added convenience. Consider the cleaning requirements of different materials and lid designs when making your selection.

 ## Core Benefits

Starbucks water bottles offer several compelling benefits that cater to a wide range of users.

**Enhanced Hydration:** Having a stylish and convenient water bottle encourages you to drink more water throughout the day. The readily available hydration can lead to improved energy levels, better skin health, and enhanced overall well-being. A Starbucks water bottle serves as a constant reminder to stay hydrated, promoting a healthier lifestyle.

**Reduced Single-Use Plastic Consumption:** By using a reusable Starbucks water bottle, you actively contribute to reducing the amount of single-use plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans. This eco-friendly choice helps minimize your environmental impact and supports Starbucks' commitment to sustainability. Choosing a reusable bottle is a simple yet effective way to make a positive difference.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a Starbucks water bottle may seem higher than purchasing disposable water bottles, it ultimately saves you money in the long run. Over time, the cost of constantly buying bottled water adds up, whereas a reusable bottle eliminates this recurring expense. A Starbucks water bottle is a one-time purchase that provides long-term cost savings.

**Stylish Accessory:** Starbucks water bottles are more than just functional containers; they're also fashionable accessories that complement your personal style. The company's diverse range of designs and limited-edition collections allows you to express your individuality and make a statement. A Starbucks water bottle can be a stylish addition to your everyday carry.

**Temperature Control:** Insulated Starbucks water bottles keep your beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods. This is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy cold drinks on hot days or hot drinks during cold weather. The temperature control feature ensures that your beverages remain refreshing and enjoyable throughout the day.

 ## FAQs Section

**Are Starbucks water bottles dishwasher safe?**
Some Starbucks water bottles are dishwasher safe, but it depends on the material and design. Generally, stainless steel and some plastic bottles are dishwasher safe, while glass bottles and those with intricate designs may require hand washing. Always check the product label or the Starbucks website for specific cleaning instructions.

**What is the best way to clean a Starbucks water bottle?**
The best way to clean a Starbucks water bottle is to use warm, soapy water and a bottle brush. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely. For stubborn stains or odors, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or a solution of vinegar and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the bottle's finish.

**Do Starbucks water bottles come with a warranty?**
Starbucks water bottles typically do not come with a standard warranty, but they are covered by a limited warranty against manufacturing defects. If you experience any issues with your bottle, such as leaks or broken parts, you can contact Starbucks customer service to inquire about a replacement or refund. Be sure to keep your proof of purchase.

**Where can I purchase Starbucks water bottles?**
Starbucks water bottles are available for purchase at Starbucks stores, online retailers such as Amazon and the Starbucks website, and select department stores. The availability of specific designs and models may vary depending on the location and time of year. Check the Starbucks website for a store locator or to browse their online selection.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey: I was baptized in 2024. Ever since then I can’t help but feel like I’m being attacked? The friends I have distanced themselves from me, my gf at the time betrayed me, and I’ve been tested in ways I can’t explain.. now I’m moving forward completely on my own. God has placed me in a pruning season. 

What sort of person are you looking for?

Jesus is everything to me. So I’m looking for someone who is serious about their faith. I believe in the traditional type of relationship where I can just take care of everything for her, while she stays home and focuses on us.. but I have respect for those who want to work  and have no problem with that. 

I’ve reached a high point in my career and I run my own company online. I’m focused on health/fitness and being an entrepreneur. I’m looking for someone that likes my mug and genuinely wants to know me. I just want to serve my woman and build a better life for each other

Age range: F25 - 34

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate

Yes, for the right woman I will absolutely make that effort.

From my personal experiences, I’ve been losing faith in finding someone here for me in the states.. it just feels like the hook-up culture is all that matters here. If I don’t meet someone soon I may be traveling to other countries in the near future. ",3,1754094912.0,ChristianDating,0,0.8,False

1mfcx4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mfcx4l/i_detest_my_manager/,I detest my manager,"I have this problematic work manager who is getting on my nerves, and I am just done with him.



So, 6 months ago this manager comes back from their parental leave and the first thing they say to me when sitting me down for our introduction is that he thinks all consultants are cult members and he is going to have no use for me when he gets HIS team on this project so I can kiss my easy paycheck goodbye and that I have no power here. Ok, I don't disagree that some consultancies can be cult-like and have weird internal culture and that I'm just a line worker as a developer. But that's not really the warm welcome I'm used to. I just say ok to that and move on. 



He keeps making weird comments to me to make me feel very unwelcome in the workplace. For example, we get told to test the company's AI-assisted moderation and told that nothing is off limits and it's a judgment-free zone. I am a LGBTQIA+ community member, so I say ""kiki wanna kaikai"" and he immediately chimes in with ""IS THAT SOME FUCKING OTAKU BULLSHIT?"" I answer ""no, it's gay slang."" Way to be an ally, buddy. He keeps looking at me like I shat in the middle of the floor. Others got a laugh out of the funny sentence, and we moved on. The gays are not into fashion now all of a sudden?



I once went to get a coffee in the kitchen area and saw a bunch of my team discuss their candy preferences. They didn't include me in the conversation, so I left the area when I had made my coffee. As I sat down, I got a message from said manager with ""Why are you not participating in the conversation in the kitchen?"" ""I was in the middle of working on something."" He drops it luckily, but I felt like I was being judged for not butting into a conversation that had nothing to do with me. I don't personally like feeling like I'm being watched and judged constantly at the office.



I also suggested a team night so the team could talk openly in the same space and enjoy an evening together. I said I can arrange that, as the team really liked my ideas for such an evening in casual conversation. The manager shot me down, told me he would handle that, it didn’t matter anyway, and asked me if this was a political bribe. I didn’t know he was even interested in politics. He hasn’t even held political office, so I had no idea. In the next municipal election, I checked his votes, and he had over three times fewer votes than my nephew’s 20-year-old friend. So a teenager’s platform is more politically effective than his is, but whatever. Two weeks later, he was also totally fine with another consulting manager suggesting we use a boat his company owns for a night our with the team so I have no idea how a 5000€ night like that would be less of a political bribe than a 500$ sauna night, but sure.



He also sat me down when there was a massive change in what we were working on, being changed from native development to cross-platform development, which affected our team’s work directly. I make the point that many companies have tried this same move and have recently, famously even, decided to move away from cross-platform development. He starts yelling at me, ""THIS IS PEOPLE'S JOBS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. DON'T YOU GET THAT PEOPLE CAN LOSE THEIR JOBS?"" ""And this move to cross-platform development doesn't affect native developers’ jobs?"" ""NO! It says so in the documentation!"" ""Well, that's not realistic, is it?"" He drops it. Yeah, that's capitalism. This can't be your first job buddy. I'm sorry we live in a capitalist society. I feel like soon he will blame the assassination of the archduke Franz Ferdinand on me. Lemme just fix the fall of the Soviet Union real quick and reverse the industrial revolution while I'm at it. The fuck does he expect from me? I was just stating an obvious thing that might happen, that seems to happen according to all the articles I have read on the subject throughout the years. So sorry for sharing my area of expertise with you when you asked.



I tried to sympathise with the dude by suggesting we talk about metal music, which he says he likes, and asked if he had heard of this new metal band that is being talked about a lot on the internet. His answer to me is ""IS THAT SOME EMO BULLSHIT?"". ""Well, no. It's more like Sleep Token if you're into that sort of proggressive side of metal."" Sorry for trying to find common ground.



He also blew up at one of our meetings when another developer and I were 2 minutes late coming to a meeting from lunch. Others are generally 5 to 15 minutes late to meetings and don't get a 15-minute rant about the virtue of being on time. He is late to meetings more than me and I dislike hypocrites. And we don't have a roll call that would matter at all. Also, the first 15 minutes are usually internal administrative things that don't involve me, so it doesn't even really matter to me. What does he want me to do? He says if you're going to be one minute late, don't come to the meeting at all. Like. Fuck that. I stopped showing up to most of the meetings in the company. He also doesn't rant at other teammates for being late before or since. At the end of that meeting, he also complained that we were 5 minutes over our allotted time. Wonder why my dude.



He also made a sort of a racist joke to one of our designers in front of me, calling our Brazilian teammate Carlos Santana because his last name was Santos. A. Not the same last name B. Carlos Santana was Mexican, not Brazilian. C. Brazil and Mexico don't even share a border. The designer was taken aback and asked him to explain the joke. I just told him it was not appropriate, which luckily shut him down.



I also found out he has bullied the junior developer at the company, so that she was in tears at her work station and blocked her from moving forward in her career path. We're the only two females in the team, so it feels weirdly targeted. He also talks down to me constantly, and I've worked in this field for 10 years and have had no one else act like this around me. I'm also not the only one in the team who thinks he's useless and a pest and wants him to be replaced with another manager who is a delight to work with and who doesn't take himself as seriously. The problem manager just feels very toxic and aggressive, and I don't want to deal with him anymore.



Like, who wouldn’t wanna work with such an emotionally immature and aggressive micromanager? I’m trying to change projects, but it feels like it can’t come fast enough. Luckily, he is on vacation and I don’t have to deal with his bull atm, but I’m just so frustrated if I have to work the rest of the year with him.",2,1754094716.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I (26F) was prescribed **2mg Abilify** as an adjunct to **Duloxetine 60mg (an SNRI)** for my OCD.

Duloxetine has been amazing for my anxiety, but it didn’t do much for my intrusive thoughts and compulsions. 2 weeks ago, my psychiatrist added Abilify, and the effects have been pretty significant. My intrusive thoughts have decreased a lot, and my compulsions have gone from 10+ repetitions to maybe 1–2… or sometimes none at all!

The downside is that my sleep has been terrible. For the past two weeks, I’ve only been getting 4–6 hours a night (I usually get 8–10). I fall asleep fine, but I wake up multiple times and often 1–2 hours before my alarm. I’ve been compensating with more coffee (up to 3 cups a day now), and while I can still function, I *really* miss my long, deep sleep.



I just wanted to post this for two reasons:

## Key Features Analysis

Wireless chargers for iPads are not created equal. Several technical specifications must be considered to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

**charging Speed (Wattage):**

The wattage of a wireless charger directly impacts the charging speed of your iPad. Higher wattage chargers deliver power more quickly,reducing the time it takes to fully charge your device. For iPads, a 15W or higher charger is typically recommended for faster wireless charging. However, make sure your iPad is compatible with the charger's wattage to avoid potential damage or inefficient charging. Some chargers may offer variable wattage, adjusting the power output based on the device connected.

**Charging Standard (Qi2):**

The Qi2 standard represents the latest advancement in wireless charging technology, offering improved efficiency, safety, and compatibility.Qi2 chargers utilize a magnetic alignment system similar to Apple's MagSafe, ensuring precise placement and optimal energy transfer. This reduces energy waste and minimizes the risk of overheating. Qi2 also allows for faster charging speeds compared to older Qi standards. Look for chargers that are certified for Qi2 compliance to ensure they meet the latest safety and performance standards.

**Material and Build Quality:**

The materials and build quality of a wireless charger contribute to its durability and longevity. Chargers made from high-quality materials like aluminum or premium plastics are more resistant to wear and tear. Solid construction also helps dissipate heat more effectively, preventing the charger from overheating during operation. The charger should have a stable base to prevent it from tipping over, especially when charging a larger device like an iPad.

**Compatibility:**

Compatibility is crucial when selecting a wireless charger for your iPad. While most iPads support wireless charging (especially newer models),it's essential to verify compatibility with the specific charger you are considering. Some chargers are designed specifically for Apple devices and may offer features like optimized charging profiles or magnetic alignment. Others are universally compatible with Qi-enabled devices,including Android tablets and smartphones. Check the charger's specifications to ensure it supports your iPad's charging standards.

**Safety Features:**

safety should be a top priority when choosing a wireless charger. Look for chargers with built-in safety features like over-voltage protection, over-current protection, and temperature control. These features protect your iPad from damage caused by electrical surges or overheating. Some chargers also have foreign object detection, wich prevents charging if a metal object is placed between the charger and the device.

**Adjustability and Design:**

Wireless chargers come in various designs, from flat pads to stands that hold your iPad at an ergonomic angle. Consider how you plan to use the charger and choose a design that suits your needs. A stand-style charger is ideal for watching videos or video conferencing while charging, while a flat pad is more compact and convenient for travel. Look for chargers with adjustable angles or heights for optimal viewing comfort.

Key features of the best wireless chargers for iPads include:

* Fast charging capabilities (15W or higher)
* Qi2 certification for enhanced efficiency and safety
* Durable construction with high-quality materials
* Broad compatibility with various iPad models
* Advanced safety features to protect your device
* Ergonomic design for optimal viewing angles

## FAQs Section

Wireless charging can sometimes be confusing. Here are some frequently asked questions to clarify its practical application with iPads.

**Will wireless charging damage my iPad's battery?**

No, wireless charging will not damage your iPad's battery if you use a charger that meets proper safety standards. Modern wireless chargers have built-in safety features to prevent overcharging and overheating, which can damage the battery. However, using a low-quality or uncertified charger may pose a risk. Always choose a charger from a reputable brand and ensure it is certified for Qi or Qi2 compliance.

**How does the charging speed compare to wired charging?**

Typically, wireless charging is slower than wired charging.Wired charging often provides higher wattage, allowing for faster charging speeds. However, with advancements in wireless charging technology, the speed gap is narrowing. High-wattage wireless chargers (15W or higher) can provide reasonably fast charging speeds for iPads. The convenience of wireless charging often outweighs the slight difference in speed.

**Can I wirelessly charge my iPad with a case on?**

Yes, you can usually wirelessly charge your iPad with a case on, provided the case is not too thick or made of metal. Metal cases can block the wireless charging signal. Thicker cases may also reduce the charging efficiency and increase the charging time. For optimal wireless charging performance, it is recommended to use a thin, non-metallic case or remove the case altogether.

**Does the position of the iPad on the charging pad matter?**

yes, the position of the iPad on the charging pad can affect the charging efficiency. For optimal charging, align the charging coil of the iPad with the charging coil of the wireless charger. Many wireless chargers have markings or guides to help you position the device correctly. Using a Qi2-certified charger eliminates most of these issues using magnetic alignment. Misalignment can reduce the charging speed and increase the risk of overheating.

You know those days when it feels like the world is testing your patience at every turn? I once spilled my coffee, missed the bus, and got caught in a downpour all before 9 a.m. In the past, that string of bad luck would have sent my mood spiraling. But then something clicked: I could let frustration run the show, or I could pause, breathe, and respond with a little grace instead of rage. Honestly, the hardest battles are always the ones inside our own heads. I’m reminded of how Gandhi said an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind; as tempting as it is to match anger with anger, it just traps us in a cycle of stress.

Peace, I’ve learned, isn’t about hiding from life’s chaos. It’s about choosing not to be pulled into someone else’s storm, but pulling them (and yourself) into your calm. When you let go of that tightening grip on anger, even for a moment, you reclaim so much more than just your cool. You take back your freedom. As Emerson put it, giving up anger means gaining back those sixty seconds of peace of mind. Real success isn’t just outer achievement; it’s mastering inner serenity, right in the middle of the mess.


# Word of The Day Affirmations 


Presence

Presence is another word that deeply resonates with the essence of the piece. It’s about being fully aware and intentional in the moment, even when everything around you is rushed, loud, or going sideways. In the essay, the turning point happened not because external events improved, but because the narrator chose to show up fully in that uncomfortable moment and shift their response from stress to calm.

Quick summary about me, im pretty well educated and well travelled. Lived in Greece and traveled around Iceland to name a few things.

I work from home as a devops enginner, I also I'm building my own business, you will noticed from my post history I am a wallstreetbets degen, and can be pretty nerdy. 

I also have an obsession with cats and I finished a campervan in my car so thinking about picking up fishing in the crown lands. I also have an intrest in astrophysics and astrophotography.

1mfctag,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFlorida/comments/1mfctag/my_story_of_florida_and_kratom_addiction/,My story of Florida and Kratom addiction.,"So I was a drinker most of my life, in November 2022 I decided I had enough of alcohol and it was time to quite cold turkey.. a white knuckle fest. 
Needless to say I couldn’t do it alone, going from a 15oz a night drinker of hard liquor.. I just couldn’t do it. I went to the doctor they put me on Gabapentine, Valium and blood pressure meds.. I made it through and thought finally I am free from addiction. 

A year later..

I had always been a casual weed smoker never consistent maybe once a month if that possibly once a year. I started seeing cannabis shops all over Florida when I first moved here. I thought THCA isn’t that just weed alternative…. Wrong… I went from a occasional smoker to a daily THCA heavy hitter passing through an 8th or more a day. Like all addicts I started thinking buying more is better.. next thing I knew I was buying an ounce or more a week. Mixing strains and having the time of my life.. well one day at the local vape shop picking up some THCA I was offered a Kratom “tea”. I love it came in so many fruity flavors and frankly it made me feel great better than coffee…. 

A year later..

Now here I am still taking 3000mg of gabapentine from my alcohol quit, 20mg of Valium, smoking THCA daily and drinking 20oz of KRATOM or more a day. All this on top of the fact that my psychiatrist was pumping me full of SSRI’s. So I decide eff the SSRI’S eff the Valium, Eff the prescriptions im going to live naturally on THCA, Kratom.. so I quit my SSRI and Valium cold turkey… about a month later not feeling any withdrawals I decided ya know what.. I am sick of buying these teas and frankly I never was addicted to weed so I am quitting that too. 

3 Months later…

I suddenly woke up one day and basically lost my mind. I had quit SSRI’S, Gabapentine, Valium all 3 months prior and about 2 weeks after quitting THCA and Kratom.. Boom I woke up one day and though I was talking directly to god, yes I heard voices in my head and was having a full blown manic psychotic break. 

Now today 3 months later again..

I went through the worst detox of my life, were talking anxiety so bad I was doing pushups, running in place, laying down for 5 min and feeling anxiety and restlessness all over again. I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t get away from that feeling.. Finally after almost 3 months I started feeling normal, now at this point I have lost about 6 months of work and my life. My psych and I talked and she decided to put me back on SSRI’s and Valium and gabapentine again.. The anxiety was so bad I thought I was reliving the Kratom and THCA withdrawal. After less than a month I threw all those pills away. Now here I am finally clean from all of those scripts, Kratom and THCA/THC. I have nothing that I am addicted too but let me tell you what it cost me.. 

15k in unaccounted for manic spending, even today I cant remember parts of the last few months. I have no interest in Kratom, I tried med clinic THC and nothing but anxiety… I cant take anything without my brain going haywire and the social anxiety is beyond unbearable even today. I finally am able to take phone interviews. I will say that if your someone that has even considered any of these substances let alone trusting someone to perscbribe them.. its just not worth it.. I was far happier as an alcoholic compared to being addicted to all those Pharma drugs and those vape shop go to’s. 

Some things I experienced I went from 190lbs to 150lbs in 40 days and rebounded from 150 to 170lbs as my body tried to come back to itself. Some days I felt like I wanted to die, I felt like I couldn’t do it… I went through so many feelings and thoughts that I was scared of myself at times. 

Why am I writing this, well simply as a warning.. nothing is a miracle drug and even though it is for sale at teh gas station doesn’t mean its safe or should be considered ok to take. Also just because your doctor prescribes something doesn’t mean you should take it.. Although everyday is still a struggle, I still to this day have foggy moments, memory lapse and feel less than I ever did before. Now people are taking lions mane and frankly I have no idea what that does to you, but frankly if your considering it I would say just be you.. nothing is a miracle cure and nothing is more than a item for sale on a shelf. I know I will get some heat from people on SSRI or other Pharma meds but let me say… not all doctors are considered the same. So please please do your homework… I wish I had. Stay safe and if you’re thinking about getting off of any of these things. If you have concerns or want to know how I managed to make it through without hospitalization let em know.. and I will tell you everything I can because I couldn’t find anyone who had been through anything similar. It was scary and I needed or wanted someone to talk to.. so if I can help please let me know. ",2,1754094405.0,AskFlorida,1,1.0,False
1mfcrv1,https://i.redd.it/sqa7cfgo2igf1.jpeg,Black Line on Tooth ??(Left)," (25F) I’m feeling really anxious and vulnerable posting this, but I haven’t been to the dentist in about four years due to not having insurance and moving to a new place. My teeth have always not been in the best shape, and I’ve always been self-conscious about my smile and extreme anxiety going to dentists. I’ve had fillings before, but it’s been years. Even though I brush twice a day and have been trying to floss after every meal, my teeth still appear yellowish. I don’t drink or smoke, but I’ll admit my coffee and soda intake has been higher than usual this year, though I’ve been cutting back a lot lately.

I’ve also been under a lot of stress, and I know I grind and clench my teeth in my sleep. I’ve never worn a nightguard. A few days ago, I noticed a black line on one of my upper right teeth near the gumline (tooth #2, I think?), and after eating something sweet (a donut, of all things), that tooth started hurting. It’s been about six days now. Sometimes it’s sensitive to cold or sweets, and if it’s not sensitive, there’s a dull ache when I poke at it or sleep on that side. I’ve also noticed that if I clench down on that tooth now, it hurts, which didn’t happen before. Saltwater rinses help a lot.

It’s only this one tooth that’s bothering me, and the pain came out of nowhere.  I have no other medical issues except a lottt of stress and anxiety which I’ve noticed has increased this year due to personal reasons. I’m scared I might need a root canal or, worse, an extraction which I really want to avoid since it’s one of my front teeth :( That tooth is also noticeably more worn down than the one on the other side, so I wonder if grinding could be the main cause of the pain SINCE i sleep on that side, or if there’s something more serious going on.

I have a dental appointment in two days, which I'll be paying out of pocket for because AGAIN no insurance, but my anxiety has been spiraling in the meantime. If anyone has gone through something similar or has thoughts on what this might be, I’d really appreciate hearing about it! Thanks!

It’s like coffee is now a drug I’m chasing.

Before meds, coffee was just something pleasant to drink and I could just go to sleep after. It never made me alert or able to focus, it was just another one of the many small treats I’d have to get through a work day and to justify getting up from my desk every half an hour. But now I only assume that my meds bring me up to a regular person’s level of dopamine (?) and adding coffee is actually stimulating me. I literally feel it kick in. The issue is in the afternoon I always want another coffee to feel that feeling but sometimes end up with anxiety or feel a bit nauseous cause it’s too much. Does anyone else feel like that regarding their coffee experience before meds and after starting meds?

## Key ⁣features Analysis

The best iPhone ‍16 Pro Max case with a ⁢card holder seamlessly blends protection and practicality. Durability, card⁢ capacity,⁤ ease of‌ access, and overall design are crucial factors ⁤to consider.

**Material and Construction:** A⁣ top-tier case will utilize a combination ⁤of materials to provide‍ optimal impact resistance and a ‌comfortable‍ grip.Look⁢ for ⁣cases that incorporate TPU ​(Thermoplastic Polyurethane) for shock absorption around the edges and corners, paired with a polycarbonate (PC) shell for structural rigidity.‍ Some premium options may also⁤ include aramid fiber (Kevlar)​ for⁤ enhanced durability without adding ‌significant bulk.

The ‍construction should⁢ feel solid, with precise cutouts⁢ for all ports and ⁢buttons. The lip around the screen and camera bump⁢ should be‌ raised adequately to prevent scratches when the phone is placed‍ face down or on‌ its ‌back. Moreover, the card holder mechanism should be ​sturdily integrated⁣ into the case⁤ design, avoiding any flimsiness that could‍ lead to card loss or damage.**Card ⁣Capacity and Security:** The ⁤ideal card holder ⁢should securely accommodate at least‌ two to three ‍cards​ without⁣ adding excessive⁤ bulk to ‌the case. The ​mechanism for holding the cards in place is ‌crucial; friction-based systems,⁤ spring-loaded holders, or a‌ combination of both are common.

The chosen retention method should prevent​ cards from ⁣easily slipping out, even under normal use conditions or during accidental drops.⁣ Moreover, the case should ideally incorporate RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking⁣ technology ​to protect credit and debit cards from unauthorized ⁣scanning.

**Ease of Card Access:** A well-designed card holder case ​should allow ​for easy and fast access to the stored cards.This ⁢could involve a sliding mechanism, a ⁤flip-open ⁢design, ​or a discreet cutout that allows users to push cards out‍ with their ​thumb.

The access method should be ⁢intuitive‌ and usable with one hand, even in less-than-ideal situations. Additionally, ⁤the card ejection or removal process should‌ be smooth and not require excessive force, reducing the risk of damaging the cards.

**design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is critical, aesthetics also play a significant role in user satisfaction. The best cases⁢ offer ​a balance between practicality and visual appeal, complementing the iPhone 16 Pro Max's premium design.

Consider cases with‍ a⁣ slim profile‍ that don't add excessive bulk to the phone. Available colors⁤ and finishes should complement the iPhone's aesthetic or⁢ allow ‌for personalization. Features such as textured surfaces or patterned designs can enhance grip and add a​ touch ⁤of style while⁤ still​ protecting the device.

**Wireless​ Charging Compatibility:** One of the most crucial ‌considerations ⁢for any modern phone case‌ is its ⁣compatibility with ⁤wireless charging. The thickness and material composition of the case ⁣directly⁤ affect whether wireless charging will function ⁢effectively.The best iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders must be designed to allow ‍for ‌seamless wireless charging without requiring the removal of the ​case. This frequently enough involves strategic material selection and design considerations to minimize interference with the wireless charging signal.

## Core Benefits

An iPhone 16 Pro Max case​ with ⁤a card holder delivers convenience, security, ⁢and protection in a single package.These⁤ benefits streamline daily ‌life ⁤and reduce the need to carry⁣ a ⁤separate wallet or ‍purse.

**increased ‍Convenience:** ⁤Carrying an iPhone⁤ and ‌several essential‌ cards in a‍ single unit simplifies daily​ routines. Users can⁢ easily access their ID, credit cards, or transportation passes without fumbling thru a bulky wallet.For ​instance, imagine quickly tapping a transit card stored in your phone​ case ‍at a ‍train station ⁤turnstile or paying for coffee with a credit card discreetly retrieved from the built-in holder. this convenience⁣ makes everyday tasks more efficient and hassle-free.

**Enhanced ‌Security:** By‌ keeping essential cards securely attached to the phone, the risk of losing or misplacing them decreases considerably. Cases with RFID blocking‍ technology further protect against electronic theft ‍by preventing unauthorized ​scanning of card facts.

Consider ‌the ⁣peace of‍ mind‌ knowing that your credit card information cannot‍ be easily accessed ‍by thieves using RFID scanners in crowded public ‌spaces. This​ added layer of security is a valuable benefit in today's⁢ digital world.

**Protection for Your Investment:** ​A robust case protects the iPhone 16 Pro Max from ‍everyday wear and tear, including scratches, bumps, ⁣and accidental drops. The raised edges around⁢ the ​screen‌ and camera lens,⁣ combined with shock-absorbent⁢ materials, provide reliable protection.

Think ⁢of the financial savings from preventing costly screen repairs or replacing a shattered camera lens due to an accidental drop. Investing in a high-quality case is a small price ⁣to pay compared to ​the potential repair or replacement costs of a damaged iPhone.

**Streamlined Lifestyle:** The case eliminates the need to carry a bulky wallet.

As an example, ​whether running ‍errands, heading to the‍ gym, or ‌going out for the ⁣evening, the case ‍with integrated card holder allows‌ you to travel light with only your phone and essential cards. This minimalist approach contributes to a more streamlined and ⁢organized ⁣lifestyle.

## FAQs Section

Selecting⁢ the right‍ iPhone​ case entails addressing key questions​ about its functions ⁢and protection. Here ​are some of the ‍common inquiries.

**Will the ‍card holder damage ⁤my credit cards?**
Generally,No. Well-designed card‍ holder cases incorporate smooth internal surfaces and secure retention mechanisms that prevent scratching or bending cards. The cards are held ‌firmly ​in place without excessive pressure,minimizing the risk⁤ of damage during normal ‌use.

**Dose the case‌ interfere with ​wireless ⁣charging?**
It depends. Cases with ⁤thicker materials ⁢or internal metal components may interfere with wireless charging. However, cases specifically ⁢designed with wireless charging compatibility in mind utilize materials and designs that minimize interference and ⁢allow⁢ for ⁣efficient wireless charging. Always ‍check the product ⁤specifications⁢ for​ wireless charging compatibility‌ before purchasing.**How​ many⁣ cards ⁤can ⁢the card holder realistically hold?**
most iPhone 16 pro Max cases with card⁢ holders are designed to securely hold between two to three ⁢cards.Trying to force ‍more cards into ⁢the holder ⁤can ​stretch ​the ⁢retention mechanism and compromise its ability to securely hold the ⁢cards. Check the product specifications for ⁤the recommended card ‍capacity before ‍use.

**Does the case protect⁤ the camera lenses from scratching?**
Yes, typically. Reputable cases usually have‌ a raised bezel around the camera lenses to protect them from scratches when the phone is placed on ⁤a flat ⁣surface. The raised bezel⁤ ensures that ⁤the lenses do not come into direct‍ contact with the​ surface, reducing the ⁣risk of abrasions and scratches.

1mfcn5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1mfcn5l/what_are_your_favorite_low_budget_birthday_party/,What are your favorite low budget birthday party ideas for adults?,"Everybody knows, birthdays can get expensive, especially when you feel pressure to do something big. But many adults today are embracing **simple, thoughtful celebrations** that are both memorable and wallet-friendly. We dug into real Reddit conversations and gathered the best low-budget birthday ideas people are actually using (and loving).

Here’s what they said:

# 1. Throw a Cozy Home Party

**“We just made pasta, played board games, and had a homemade cake. Honestly, it was better than going out!”**

If you're someone who enjoys smaller gatherings, hosting at home is the most affordable and flexible option. **Ideas:**

* Potluck-style dinner with friends  
* Movie night with popcorn and cozy blankets  
* Game night with classics like Uno, Cards Against Humanity, or Pictionary  
* Bring-your-own-drink setup to save on costs  

**Tip:** String lights, candles, and a playlist can create a fun vibe without spending anything extra.

# 2. Plan a Picnic at the Park

**“We packed sandwiches, brought a speaker, and just chilled by the lake. Super relaxing and cost almost nothing.”**

Parks are free and perfect for group hangouts. **Ideas:**

* Ask friends to bring snacks or drinks  
* Bring a frisbee, speaker, or picnic blanket  
* Go early for a good spot under a tree  

**Tip:** Bring board games or cards for some light fun!

# 3. Do a Themed Potluck or DIY Taco Night

**“Everyone brought something, and we did taco night. It felt special without anyone spending much.”**

Make the food part of the celebration! **Ideas:**

* Assign guests to bring parts of a meal (appetizers, mains, desserts)  
* Try themes like “Breakfast for Dinner” or “Pasta Party”  
* Set up a DIY food bar (like tacos or nachos)  

**Tip:** Ask friends to bring their own drinks or desserts to cut costs.

# 4. Bake the Cake Together or Make it a Group Activity

**“We all baked cookies and decorated cupcakes. It turned into a super cute memory.”**

Skip the store-bought cake and make it part of the fun. **Ideas:**

* Bake cupcakes and let everyone decorate their own  
* Have a cookie decorating challenge  
* Turn it into a casual cooking night  

**Tip:** Use ingredients you already have at home!

# 5. Make it About Shared Time, Not Stuff

**“We took a walk, grabbed coffee, and sat in the park talking. It was perfect.”**

Not every birthday needs a party. Some Redditors prefer **simple one-on-one hangouts** with close friends or loved ones. **Ideas:**

* Go for a long walk and grab ice cream  
* Plan a game night or crafting session  
* Visit a free museum or local event  

**Tip:** Ask yourself what makes you feel happiest — and go with that.

**6. Skip Gifts – Ask for Time or Help Instead**

**“I told people not to buy me anything, but just spend time with me. We ended up cooking dinner together.”**

If money’s tight for you *or* your guests, make it clear you value presence over presents. **Ideas:**

* Ask friends to write you a memory or wish instead of gifts  
* Ask someone to bring over a bottle of wine or help prep food  
* Do a “no-spend” birthday where everyone contributes in time, not money  

**Final Thoughts from Redditors**

Almost every commenter agreed: **it’s not about spending money — it’s about connection**. The best birthdays were the ones where people felt relaxed, laughed a lot, and did something small that felt personal.

You don’t need a fancy dinner, balloons, or a big venue. All you need is **good company, a bit of creativity**, and maybe some cake.

**Summary:** Planning an adult birthday on a budget? Focus on **easy food, close friends, and thoughtful moments.** Whether it’s a backyard BBQ, a board game night, or a picnic in the park — what really matters is that you enjoy it.

Also proceeded to text us (see images at the end).

Because he felt ""disrespected,"" he demanded $500 or free coffee for life. When we refused, he said he had buddies from prison and knew cartel members who could ""take care of business.""

1mfcjhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1mfcjhz/recovery_from_a_difficult_avoidant_discard/,Recovery from a difficult avoidant discard,"My on/off again boyfriend for the past 8 months broke up with me again. 

The first time we broke up it wasn’t mean, it was because he was planning on moving elsewhere and I didn’t see that things would work out. We mutually agreed to end things. We were in and out of contact during that period. 

Lo and behold, he didn’t move, and we reconnected at a bar 6 weeks later. We had been drinking a bit but had a very long and very coherent conversation about our future. The next morning I woke up anxious and asked him to meet me. We met and had coffee and he was still interested in our relationship being re-kindled. 

The past month or so has been difficult. He had a big event happen in his life, and has since been sober which I have been incredibly supportive of. He had been distant and asked to meet to talk but assured me it wasn’t to be breaking up, but to be bettering our relationship. 

The first sentence he uttered to me was “I want our relationship dynamic to change to being friends.” I was absolutely confused and baffled, as we had just been discussing bettering our relationship the night before. He then proceeded to tell me that since he’s been sober, he realized he wouldn’t have gotten back together with me that night, except for the fact he was drinking and “drinking makes me emotional”. He also said that loving me was a grey area, though he had told me many, many times that he loved me. I am hurt and crushed. 

I genuinely love this person but I don’t really believe in friends after a relationship. I think it’s too confusing, and would be for me, as I care for him deeply. I told him I’m not sure I can agree to being his friend and he has completely ghosted me in the week after. My sister was also actively helping him get a job and he nuked that too. He has not tried to apologize. 

He says he’s recovered from his avoidance but I reminded him that he has not. I’m just having a hard time recovering right now from all of this. ",4,1754093616.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False
1mfcipa,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1mfcipa/out_of_nowhere_my_heart_jumps_to_190_bpm_scared/,"Out of nowhere, my heart jumps to 190 bpm — scared and looking for answers","Hi everyone,

25M, 187 cm, 84 kg, looking for some help.

For the past 4 years, I’ve been experiencing sudden, unexplained episodes of tachycardia, where my heart rate can spikes to 170–190 without any clear trigger (resting HR is around 60). These episodes come on abruptly, last from minutes to an hour were my heart rate slowly drops to around 130 bpm before settling to 90 or so.

They often happen during light activity like walking and are accompanied by cold sweats, weakness / flushed feeling, like a heat wave through my body, and fear of fainting or dying. During these episodes, I never felt chest pain or breathlessness, but the extreme heart racing and sense of doom are terrifying.

Initially, these episodes were rare (about once a year), but I’ve now had 4 in the past 3 months, including 2 today.

Today, it started while walking outside. I had to stop and rest because my heart kept climbing higher with movement (up to 180). I felt extremely weak and panicked, managed to get home, and took 1/2 propranolol. It helped, but I still felt on edge. I had 1–2 milder surges (\~140–150 bpm) even while resting, before the beta blocker kicked in.

Earlier this year, I also noticed occasional skipped beats which pushed me to see a cardiologist. Full cardiac workup:

* ECG, echocardiogram, and stress test = normal
* 24h Holter monitor = normal sinus rhythm, no arrhythmias or SVT

My cardiologist thinks it could be heightened sensitivity to adrenaline and prescribed propranolol 20 mg as needed. He also ordered extensive bloodwork, which I’m doing soon:

* Cortisol
* Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl)
* Renin + aldosterone
* Plasma metanephrines (rule out pheochromocytoma)
* TSH, glucose, lipids, liver/kidney function, CBC

For the record, I have no major health issues, used to be active (boxing at high level), don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol or coffee and currently on vacation, so not feeling stressed (even if my health can be triggering sometimes), and sleeping 8h a night

I’ve always been told “it’s just stress or anxiety” – but I don’t feel anxious before it starts, and the episodes now feel unpredictable and worse. I’m also afraid to exercise or travel, fearing another attack without meds.

Could this be:

* POTS / dysautonomia?
* Adrenal issue (pheochromocytoma, cortisol dysregulation)?
* Hidden anxiety or panic disorder even if I don’t “feel” anxious?
* Somatic / functional heart rhythm disturbance?

Has anyone experienced this? Did you find a long-term solution beyond just beta blockers?

Any insight, similar story, or advice would mean a lot.

Hey fellow Travel Trotters! Just got back from an epic dessert crawl through Los Angeles and HAD to share these sugar-coated gems with you all. If you're heading to LA soon, your sweet tooth is in for the adventure of a lifetime!

Los Angeles isn't just about beaches and celebrities - it's secretly one of America's most underrated dessert destinations. From French patisseries that transport you straight to Paris to donut shops that'll make your Instagram followers drool, LA's dessert scene is WILD.

## The French Connection 🇫🇷

Artelice Patisserie should be your first stop if you're craving authentic French vibes. Their Valentino (a dark chocolate mousse with raspberry and coconut sponge) literally made me weak in the knees. Pro tip: go early because their best stuff sells out FAST. I ended up in a minor argument with another tourist over the last Exotic pastry (pistachio sponge with tropical fruits) - worth it though!

Republique isn't just Michelin-approved - it's Travel Trotter-approved too! Their chocolate cake is so good I'm still dreaming about it three weeks later. The bakery section is in the front, and while there's usually a line, the ham-and-cheese rolls are worth every minute of waiting. Perfect for grabbing breakfast before exploring the city.

## For the Ice Cream Obsessed 🍦

Salt & Straw isn't your average ice cream joint, folks. These small-batch, chef-driven flavors will blow your mind! I tried their seasonal lineup and ended up going back THREE DAYS IN A ROW. Not even ashamed. They let you sample basically everything, so don't be shy!

If you're looking for something more interactive, Diddy Ries Cookies lets you build your own ice cream sandwich. Pick your cookies, pick your ice cream, and bam - dessert perfection that's totally customized. Great for families or if you're traveling with indecisive friends (we all have them).

## Iconic LA Dessert Experiences 🍩

No dessert tour of LA is complete without visiting the legendary Randy's Donuts. You know, the place with the GIANT donut on top? It's not just a tourist trap - their Red Velvet ganache donut changed me as a person. The Fruit Loop-covered one is perfect for your social media, but honestly tastes amazing too.

Bottega Louie is another can't-miss spot. The place looks like it was designed specifically for Instagram, but the desserts taste even better than they look (which is saying A LOT). Their fruit tarts are literal works of art. The place is always packed with a mix of locals and tourists, but the people-watching is half the fun.

## International Flair 🌏

One of my favorite discoveries was Yamazaki Bakery. If you've never had Japanese-style pastries, you're in for a treat! Their green tea desserts are subtle and not too sweet - a perfect palate cleanser if you've been indulging too much. The sugar toast is simple but ridiculously good, and don't sleep on their Kashi pan.

Giovanni's Tiramisu was a happy accident - I literally stumbled across this father-daughter shop while looking for something else. Their classic tiramisu is probably the best I've ever had (sorry, Italy), and they offer some creative twists that somehow work perfectly.

## Hidden Gems 💎

Friends & Family isn't on most tourist radars, which is criminal! Their raspberry fairy pastry looks like something from a fairytale and tastes even better. The place has a neighborhood feel that makes you feel like you've discovered something special.

Pitchoun! offers such a variety that it's perfect if you're traveling with picky eaters. Everyone can find something they love here, and the quality is consistently excellent. I grabbed a box of assorted treats to enjoy during a hike in Griffith Park - 10/10 decision.

## Planning Your LA Dessert Crawl 📝

If you're serious about conquering LA's dessert scene (and honestly, why wouldn't you be?), here's my suggested game plan:

1. Start your morning at Republique or Friends & Family for coffee and breakfast pastries
2. Mid-morning donut break at Randy's
3. Post-lunch treat at Artelice or Yamazaki
4. Afternoon pick-me-up at Giovanni's Tiramisu
5. Evening ice cream at Salt & Straw

Remember that LA traffic is no joke, so plan your sugar rush strategically by neighborhood! I used [this awesome travel planning tool](https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H) to map everything out and score some great hotel deals close to my must-visit dessert spots.

## The Sweet Takeaway 🧳

What makes LA's dessert scene so special is how it reflects the city itself - diverse, creative, and unafraid to experiment. From high-end French techniques to nostalgic American classics with modern twists, LA delivers sweet experiences that are worth traveling for.

25M, 187 cm, 84 kg, looking for some help.

For the past 4 years, I’ve been experiencing sudden, unexplained episodes of tachycardia, where my heart rate can spikes to 170–190 without any clear trigger (resting HR is around 60). These episodes come on abruptly, last from minutes to an hour were my heart rate slowly drops to around 130 bpm before settling to 90 or so.

They often happen during light activity like walking and are accompanied by cold sweats, weakness / flushed feeling, like a heat wave through my body, and fear of fainting or dying. During these episodes, I never felt chest pain or breathlessness, but the extreme heart racing and sense of doom are terrifying.

Initially, these episodes were rare (about once a year), but I’ve now had 4 in the past 3 months, including 2 today.

Today, it started while walking outside. I had to stop and rest because my heart kept climbing higher with movement (up to 180). I felt extremely weak and panicked, managed to get home, and took 1/2 propranolol. It helped, but I still felt on edge. I had 1–2 milder surges (\~140–150 bpm) even while resting, before the beta blocker kicked in.

Earlier this year, I also noticed occasional skipped beats which pushed me to see a cardiologist. Full cardiac workup:

* ECG, echocardiogram, and stress test = normal
* 24h Holter monitor = normal sinus rhythm, no arrhythmias or SVT

My cardiologist thinks it could be heightened sensitivity to adrenaline and prescribed propranolol 20 mg as needed. He also ordered extensive bloodwork, which I’m doing soon:

* Cortisol
* Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl)
* Renin + aldosterone
* Plasma metanephrines (rule out pheochromocytoma)
* TSH, glucose, lipids, liver/kidney function, CBC

For the record, I have no major health issues, used to be active (boxing at high level), don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol or coffee and currently on vacation, so not feeling stressed (even if my health can be triggering sometimes), and sleeping 8h a night

I’ve always been told “it’s just stress or anxiety” – but I don’t feel anxious before it starts, and the episodes now feel unpredictable and worse. I’m also afraid to exercise or travel, fearing another attack without meds.

Could this be:

* POTS / dysautonomia?
* Adrenal issue (pheochromocytoma, cortisol dysregulation)?
* Hidden anxiety or panic disorder even if I don’t “feel” anxious?
* Somatic / functional heart rhythm disturbance?

Has anyone experienced this? Did you find a long-term solution beyond just beta blockers?

Any insight, similar story, or advice would mean a lot.

Even as a kid, I’ve always had the hardest time asserting myself or saying no. As long as the other person’s content, I could deal with some uncomfortable feelings. It probably has something to do with daddy issues. At least that’s what all my therapists have told me, obviously not using those exact words. Although, I don’t know if hearing the question “How’s your relationship with your father?” from some old broad after dumping half of my trauma is any better.

Anyway, I‘ve been through some shit. It’s kind of a blessing and a curse when you think about it. Going through trauma can simultaneously be debilitating and advantageous. I’ve always had boyfriend problems. That was until I met him.

There was nothing terribly special about Tristan that met the eye. He was attractive, for sure, but nothing that could turn heads. At 27, he still lived with his parents until he moved in with me. He didn’t really have any sort of career either. He worked at our local grocery store bagging groceries for the mostly elderly people who lived in our lazy town in central Florida. He was also kind of a sickly guy, he was always in and out of urgent care with some sort of pain or ailment of sorts. Even if he was smiling and happy, his face was always slightly tense, like he was in physical pain and trying to ignore it. It was just kind of weird because there was never actually anything wrong with him. Like, there was no diagnosis. He was just ill.

His personality is what got me, though. The second he opens his mouth, everyone’s on him like flies. I remember when we first started dating, my parents had met him a total of two times when they told me that I should marry the guy. Every friend I’ve ever had became one of his good friends too. They’d rant and rave about how much of a genuinely good guy he was. He really, really was. I felt so insanely lucky, especially because he was such a breath of fresh air compared to the other sleazeballs I’d wasted my time with.

He wasn’t lustful like the others. He didn’t even bring up the idea of having sex until I brought it up first. He was in touch with his emotions too, I mean, the first time he told me he loved me he had tears in his eyes. And ever since, he’d profess his love for me time and time again, going into great detail about how I was the love of his life and his soulmate. We did everything together, and it wasn’t long until we moved in together. It was like an endless sleepover with my bestest friend. Finally, I was at peace.

Up until a few weeks ago.

I was driving him to work and we were blasting The 1975 on my radio, occasionally cringing because the speakers were blown. Tristan lowered the volume of the music and looked at me, like he always does when he has something to ask me that I might have a problem with. I side-eyed him and chuckled.

“What’s up? I know that look.”

He also chuckled and turned away from me, trying to mask the bashful look on his face.

“Nah, um. I was just wondering, baby…” He put his hand on my thigh and caressed it. “Could you cover dinner for today? It could be something cheap like fast food. I just… I don’t have a lot right now.”

I clenched my jaw. That hadn’t been the first time he’s asked me that. Or second or third. Matter of fact, he’d blow through his check in a matter of days, and I was the idiot to pay for our expenses for the next two weeks. He’d spend it on frivolous knick-knacks or clothing, or sometimes blow it all on a night out with friends.

I always told myself it was okay though. He was good to me, and that’s all that mattered. He’s a good man, I thought. He’s a good man, Saman—

“Samantha.” His voice broke my train of thought.

I looked up at him, studying his face while he went on about how he’s sorry, and he’ll do better budgeting his money next check. I nodded periodically, his words nothing but a buzzing in my ears as I totally disassociated, watching his mouth move.

Just keep him happy, I thought again. Don’t start a problem.

That night I laid awake, biting my nails and staring blankly at the ceiling. Tristan was sleeping peacefully next to me. He was taking long, slow breaths and had the same peaceful look on his face he has when he’s fast asleep. He’d cough and wheeze periodically, sometimes getting into fits so bad that he’d wake up. Whenever that happened, I made sure to hold him tight.

Thoughts that were unwelcome in my brain came and went. I tried to ignore them as best as I could. In my struggle, I finally dozed off.

I woke up to the smell of breakfast. The kind that shouldn’t have existed in our kitchen: bacon, toast, eggs, and that sweet buttery aroma of something actually being cooked. I could hear a pan scraping against the stove. Something sizzling.

My face scrunched up in confusion. Tristan didn’t cook. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he was always too tired, or his back hurt, or his joints were locking up again. But this morning, he was whistling.

I sat up slowly. The room swayed a little when I did, like I’d gotten up too fast. I blinked the sleep away and rubbed my eyes till I saw spirals in my vision.

That’s when I felt it. My hand throbbed. Not the kind of ache you get from sleeping weird, or bumping into a doorframe. It was hot. Sore. I looked down and gasped quietly. A chunk of skin from the bottom right side of my palm was missing. Clean, almost surgical, like I’d slipped with a knife.

I didn’t remember doing anything like that. Surely I would’ve remembered nicking myself? The rawness had already scabbed over slightly, but the skin around it was red and irritated. I winced as I pressed down on the cut—it felt tender to the touch.

I stared at it for a long time.

Just a cut, I thought to myself. Nothing serious. Probably scratched it on something while I slept. Maybe the bedframe. Maybe my own nail. I honestly didn’t try to think about it too much. I chalked it up to being paranoid.

“Samantha?” Tristan called from the kitchen, voice bright and bubbly. “You up, baby?”

I smiled at him. “Yeah.”

He peeked his head in. He was already showered, his black hair damp, skin flushed with color. There was a sort of liveliness to him that hadn’t been there in weeks. Almost like someone had reached inside him and turned up the volume. Even his voice was clearer.

“You feel okay?” he asked. “You look a little pale.”

He gazed at me lovingly, his eyes full of concern and admiration.

“I’m fine, just tired.”

“Breakfast is ready.” He grinned.

God, I could never get over that smile. I’d give up all the money in the world just to see it.

“You’re in a good mood,” I mused.

He shrugged. “Woke up feeling great. Like, really great.”

He walked over and kissed my forehead. I caught the faint smell of aftershave and coffee on his breath. I absolutely loved seeing him like this, and it made me beyond happy that he was feeling better than usual.

He lingered a second. “I love you,” he said.

I swallowed. “I love you too.”

He didn’t ask why I kept my hand under the blanket.

I wore a hoodie that day. I tucked my bandaged hand inside the sleeve, telling Tristan I’d nicked it on a drawer handle. He didn’t just kiss the bandage, he gently took my hand in his, cradling it like it was something precious.

“You gotta be more careful, baby,” he said softly. His voice was warm. Genuinely concerned. He rubbed small circles into my palm with his thumb. And just like that, I felt the pit in my stomach shrink, even if was just a little.

Tristan seemed lighter that day. Happier. The usual dull pain in his back was gone like magic. He didn’t say it, but I could tell in the way he stood, it was straighter, less guarded. He even carried the groceries without making a sound.

“You look… good,” I said, watching him cautiously.

He smiled, almost shyly, and ran a hand through his hair. “It’s because of you.”

I felt a blissful, warm feeling in my chest. It was moments like that that made everything else worth it.

A week passed. Then another.

The wounds came back. Each morning, something new. A split lip. A scabbed patch behind my ear. A bruise on my ribs I couldn’t explain. Sometimes I could barely walk. It was honestly becoming debilitating, and I started to question my sanity.

I mean, how many times could I unknowingly hurt myself? The sentiment was a bit creepy, and I worried I was maybe blacking out and unintentionally hurting myself. I asked Tristan about it tentatively when we were curled up together on the couch or cuddled up in bed.

“Do you think maybe I sleepwalk? Maybe I’m hurting myself without knowing?” I was starting to get really worried. Nothing like this had ever happened to me.

He would frown and pull me in tighter. “I think you’ve just been stressed, baby,” he said once, brushing the hair from my face. “With everything you’ve been through… your dad, the shit from your past… it’s bound to show up in weird ways. Trauma is funny like that.”

That’s how he always brought it back. Never mean, exactly. Just… unsettling. The way he’d dance around the topic, but address it just enough to keep me calm. So I believed him. I took comfort in his words.

Then there were the other little things. The receipts I’d find crumpled in the trash. T-shirts, sneakers, a record player. Things he never showed me, never even mentioned. I think he noticed I was looking through the trash for receipts, because he started throwing them in the bin outside.

When I noticed that, a bubble of anger and resentment grew in my chest. I was only one person and holding the entire house down. I was the one paying our rent. Groceries. Car. Everything. Not to mention, he never took me out anymore. You’d think with all this newfound energy, he’d be a little thoughtful now and then.

Unfortunately, I had grown used to his behavior. When I confronted him gently, half-laughing to mask my nerves and soften the blow, he didn’t even deny it.

“Well, I mean… what do you want me to do?” he said, voice raising just slightly. “You make more money than me. I’m trying my best, Samantha. God. Why do you always have to make me feel like a fucking loser? Why is nothing I do ever enough for you? I’ve been through some awful things. Unimaginable. You’ll never understand me.”

I blinked back tears and tried to steady my breathing as he shouted at me.

“Tristan, I… I’m not trying to make you feel that way. All I’m asking for is a little help now and then.” My voice was shaky and fragile, laced with uncertainty and a painful fear of conflict and abandonment. “It’s hard doing everything alone.”

I expected him to pull me closer, to tell me everything was going to be okay. I should’ve known better. It was always a hit or miss with him.

There was a deafeningly loud bang as his fist broke through the bed frame. I jumped, heart racing out of shock and fear.

“You are privileged!” he roared. He looked at me with pure hatred and disgust. “I’ve been through far worse than you. And anything you did go through was your fault.”

He leaned in close to me, so close his lips were touching my ear. “Live with that.”

Shaking, I backed down. I always did. It didn’t matter what he said to me. I couldn’t bear to abandon him. He had a good heart. That I knew for sure.

That night, when he got home from work, he came into the bedroom crying, knelt beside me, and clutched my hand.

“I’m sorry. Look at me,” he said, cupping my face with his big hands. “I’m so sorry, Sam. I should never get like that with you. It’s cruel and disgusting. I just—I get scared sometimes, okay? I feel like I’m not enough for you. I project my own insecurities onto you and it isn’t okay. None of what I said is true. I’m a fuck-up.”

So I stayed.

The next injury was different. I woke up with a chunk of skin missing from the top of my thigh. A clean, raw circle. I nearly passed out when I saw it.

“What the hell?” I exclaimed.

Tristan found me in the bathroom, shaking. He didn’t panic. Instead, he wrapped me in a towel and whispered in my ear like it was all a bad dream.

“Baby, let me take care of you,” he murmured. He cleaned the wound with practiced hands.

“What’s happening to me?” I asked, voice breaking. “I think I’m falling apart.”

He looked me up and down, eyes full of admiration. “You’re not,” he said. “I’ve never seen you more beautiful.”

He kissed the wound. Then he kissed me. I melted into him, like I always did.

Then came the first time he called me a bitch. It was over money again. I had asked him not to spend our shared savings on a new watch. I wasn’t even mad. Just tired. Hollowed out. Drained.

“Oh, don’t start with that,” he muttered. “God, I swear you’ve been such a bitch lately.”

The words hit like a slap. He didn’t even look up from his phone. When I started to cry, he snapped at me and told me I was being sensitive.

Later, he said he didn’t mean it. That he didn’t even remember saying it.

He cried again. He told me he didn’t know how to love. That he hated himself and didn’t understand why I loved him so much. Why I stayed despite everything.

“I don’t want to be like the people who’ve hurt me,” he whispered. “I want to be good to you.”

And I said, “You are. You’re nothing like them.” Because part of me still believed it. Or needed to.

More time passed. The injuries deepened. Nerve damage. Fever. The cuts were more severe. And through it all, Tristan only seemed healthier. Glowing, even. His laugh was easier. His voice stronger. He started dressing better. Smiling more.

“You’re doing this,” he said one morning, placing a perfect hand over my ruined one. “I don’t know how, but you’re healing me. Thank you.”

The look in his eyes was soft. Grateful. It made my chest ache. Looking back, it should’ve been terrifying. I almost knew he had something to do with this.

One morning, I limped to our bathroom, panicking because of a searing, throbbing pain in my mouth. To my horror, my canine tooth was gone. It looked like it had been ripped clean off my gums. I screamed—shrill and raw—knowing no one could hear me because Tristan had already left for work.

In my panic, something caught my eye. There was a single piece of crumpled toilet paper in the trash can next to the toilet. I wouldn’t have looked twice at it, if it didn’t look like it was badly wrapped around something and tossed in there.

My stomach dropped.

I had to know the truth. I had been putting it off for far too long. I was definitely in denial. Blood roared and rushed in my ears as I bent down to pick up the paper. I unfolded it.

And there it was. My tooth.

That night I tried to leave. I gathered some of my things while Tristan was sleeping, trying desperately not to make a sound. I was halfway out the door when my vision tunneled. I collapsed. Something in me just gave out. My legs stopped working.

I woke in bed. My wrists were bandaged. My stomach was empty. I looked up and saw Tristan looking down at me, feeding me broth from a spoon.

He kissed my cheek. “You scared me,” he whispered. “Please don’t try that again. I can’t lose you. Not now.”

He sounded hungry. The mask was slipping. The warmth was still there, but behind it was something darker, greedy, and malevolent. Any fear I had was washed away by an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.

I woke up later in the night, feverish and head spinning, too weak to move. I saw him, just barely, crouched beside the bed, whispering something I couldn’t hear. He was crying. And laughing maniacally.

The next time I woke up, I couldn’t move.

The room was cold and still. Pain radiated throughout my body, so intensely that it almost felt numb. I used what was left of my strength to look down. I screamed—or thought I did. But nothing came out.

My arms and legs were gone. Even through my blurry vision, I could make out poorly done stitches where the rest of my limbs should’ve been. The skin around them was bright red and purple, and the wounds leaked pus.

I let out a weak moan, fear and adrenaline giving me just enough energy. Tristan was there. Calm. His voice was low.

“You’ve given me everything, Sam,” he whispered, brushing hair from my forehead. “I didn’t want it to be like this. I—I never meant to hurt you. I love you, you know that, right?”

I couldn’t nod. I couldn’t do anything.

He picked up the pliers.

“I just want to be whole. Like you,” he said, trembling. “You took care of me when I was at my worst. You stood by me even when I pushed you away. You didn’t let what you’ve been through overcome you. You achieved what I never could. Healing.”

He began removing my last two teeth, one by one. Each crack of enamel echoed like thunder in my skull.

And still, something in me broke open. An epiphany. The edges of my mouth trembled and contorted into a deranged, toothless smile. My gums were bloody. Nerves exposed. I started to shake in delight. Adrenaline rushed through my body like it never had before.

It didn’t matter how much he took anymore. In fact, if it was for the better of his health, I wanted him to.

“Take more,” I wheezed, using the last of my strength to speak.

“It’ll be okay, as long as you’re whole.”

⸻

“Wrong Turn”

It started like any normal drive with my dad — half-planned, half-improvised, and fully relying on his memory instead of a map.

We were coming back from visiting my aunt, somewhere deep in rural Nevada. My dad, stubborn as ever, refused to plug his phone into the charger even though the battery was circling the drain. “It’s fine,” he muttered, brushing me off with one hand on the wheel and the other balancing a lukewarm gas station coffee.

I checked my phone — no service. Great.

We kept cruising through dusty highways, the kind that stretch out for miles with nothing but sand, shrubs, and empty silence around them. The sun was dipping low, bleeding into the horizon like a smear of orange paint. As the sky got darker, so did my sense of direction. I kept glancing at road signs, but they were few and far between — and none of them were familiar.

Then his phone finally died. I heard the dunk sound it makes when it shuts off, and I saw the screen go black. My dad stared at it like it betrayed him. “No problem,” he said. “I remember the way.”

Spoiler: he didn’t.

He took a left off a cracked two-lane highway onto a barely visible road — no street lights, no markers, just a dirt trail that looked like it hadn’t been used in a decade. I asked him, “Are you sure this is it?”

“Trust me,” he said.

Ten minutes in, I knew something was wrong. The road narrowed until it wasn’t even a road anymore — just rocks and dust. A metal fence loomed up out of nowhere. Past it, I could barely make out a group of dull gray buildings under the moonlight. We weren’t anywhere near home.

Then we saw the sign.

“WARNING: NO TRESPASSING. U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED.”

“Dad… is this Area 51?” I asked, half-joking.

He didn’t laugh.

Before he could put the car in reverse, blinding white lights flared up from somewhere ahead. The whole area lit up like a stadium, and our car suddenly felt way too exposed.

“Step out of the vehicle!” a booming voice ordered from somewhere behind the floodlights.

My dad froze. I could see his hands gripping the steering wheel harder than I’d ever seen. “We’re just lost!” he shouted out the window, his voice cracking.

“Hands where we can see them!” came the response. There were at least four silhouettes walking toward us, all geared up in military uniforms, rifles pointed low but steady.

I opened my door slowly, trying not to look panicked, even though my heart was racing. The air felt thinner out there, the wind colder. One of the soldiers approached — I could barely see his face under his helmet, but he wasn’t playing around.

“You’re on a restricted government site,” he said flatly. “How did you get here?”

“We took a wrong turn,” my dad said, holding up his dead phone like it was proof of innocence. “We thought we were headed toward Tonopah.”

The soldier looked at him for a long time, then pulled out a small flashlight and scanned the inside of our car. No weapons, no cameras, no maps — just two idiots in the desert.

After a painfully tense silence, the soldier radioed something in. Then, with the coldest professionalism I’ve ever heard, he said, “You’ll be escorted off this land. Don’t touch your phones. Don’t take photos. Don’t come back.”

Two Humvees rolled up, one in front and one behind. We followed them out, completely silent. My dad didn’t say a word the entire time. Not when we got back to a main road. Not even when we finally saw a familiar gas station 40 miles later.

We pulled in, parked, and just sat there.

After a minute, he said, “Well… guess we won’t trust my memory anymore.”

And somehow, despite everything, we both started laughing — not because it was funny, but because it was real. Because we actually stumbled into Area 51 by accident.

And because no one was ever going to believe us.

25M, 187 cm, 84 kg, looking for some help.

For the past 4 years, I’ve been experiencing sudden, unexplained episodes of tachycardia, where my heart rate can spikes to 170–190 without any clear trigger (resting HR is around 60). These episodes come on abruptly, last from minutes to an hour were my heart rate slowly drops to around 130 bpm before settling to 90 or so.

They often happen during light activity like walking and are accompanied by cold sweats, weakness / flushed feeling, like a heat wave through my body, and fear of fainting or dying. During these episodes, I never felt chest pain or breathlessness, but the extreme heart racing and sense of doom are terrifying.

Initially, these episodes were rare (about once a year), but I’ve now had 4 in the past 3 months, including 2 today.

Today, it started while walking outside. I had to stop and rest because my heart kept climbing higher with movement (up to 180). I felt extremely weak and panicked, managed to get home, and took 1/2 propranolol. It helped, but I still felt on edge. I had 1–2 milder surges (\~140–150 bpm) even while resting, before the beta blocker kicked in.

Earlier this year, I also noticed occasional skipped beats which pushed me to see a cardiologist. Full cardiac workup:

* ECG, echocardiogram, and stress test = normal
* 24h Holter monitor = normal sinus rhythm, no arrhythmias or SVT

My cardiologist thinks it could be heightened sensitivity to adrenaline and prescribed propranolol 20 mg as needed. He also ordered extensive bloodwork, which I’m doing soon:

* Cortisol
* Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl)
* Renin + aldosterone
* Plasma metanephrines (rule out pheochromocytoma)
* TSH, glucose, lipids, liver/kidney function, CBC

For the record, I have no major health issues, used to be active (boxing at high level), don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol or coffee and currently on vacation, so not feeling stressed (even if my health can be triggering sometimes), and sleeping 8h a night

I’ve always been told “it’s just stress or anxiety” – but I don’t feel anxious before it starts, and the episodes now feel unpredictable and worse. I’m also afraid to exercise or travel, fearing another attack without meds.

Could this be:

* POTS / dysautonomia?
* Adrenal issue (pheochromocytoma, cortisol dysregulation)?
* Hidden anxiety or panic disorder even if I don’t “feel” anxious?
* Somatic / functional heart rhythm disturbance?

Has anyone experienced this? Did you find a long-term solution beyond just beta blockers?

1mfceoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParallelUniverse/comments/1mfceoj/fell_into_an_alternate_timeline_long_read/,Fell into an alternate timeline (LONG READ),"This is going to make me sound insane and unhinged, but I swear I fell into an alternate universe. For context, I am a 23 year old woman from Ohio. Born and raised and still living in Ohio. About 5 months ago, I woke up and went down to my kitchen to make a cup of coffee. The coffee maker was not in its usual spot so I asked my dad where he moved the coffee maker and why. He said ""remember it broke a week ago, I have to get a new one?"" ... No??? Because the day before I had made a cup of coffee in my house, in my kitchen, right in that spot. I had just woken up so I was thinking to myself maybe I am just tired and discombobulated. So I went back to my room, and decided to go back to sleep. I woke up a few hours later, and everything just felt so off and so strange. Like I was living my life, but it felt like an out of body experience. Then later that day, my parents start talking about ""remember when we lived in Indiana"", again... No??? We have never lived in Indiana. My dad was born, raised, and went to college in Ohio. My mom was born and raised in Iowa and went to college in Ohio. Then, because I was confused they ask my sister and my two brothers about ""remember when we lived in Indiana?"" and they all said yes. My brothers are 15 and 10 and my sister is 11. If anyone would remember living in a different state I think it would be me considering I am the oldest by many, many years. I literally asked them if they had been joking with me all day and they all said no and why would they do that. I feel like I am going insane😭😭😭 I genuinely can not wrap my head around this like the coffee maker thing is definitely bizarre, but the entire living in a different state is eerie and honestly unsettling.

Then over the next two weeks, weird stuff kept happening. Examples:

\- I use the Bethany Hamilton Stoked perfume, that is my signature perfume, I could not find it anywhere one day. I checked all over my room, my sister's room, etc... I go to tell my best friend about this who has literally bought me that perfume before and she has no idea what I am talking about. How? I have used that perfume for 6+ years and we have been best friends for 10 years.

\- I do not want to give my location away but there is this coffee place I frequent and it used to be called The (redacted) coffee and now it is just (redacted) coffee. 

\- Etc...

  
I also went to the doctor because I remember on Reddit a couple years ago someone said their apartment always had 3 bedrooms, but now there is only two. They swore they were right, they went to the doctor, and had a brain tumor. Thus making them remember things incorrectly. When I went to the doctor, everything came back perfectly fine. I feel like I am in the Bête Noire episode of Black Mirror like wholeheartedly. ",8,1754093228.0,ParallelUniverse,0,1.0,False
1mfcelf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1mfcelf/silverscreen_love/,“Silver-Screen Love”,"In the hush between the frame and fade,
Where stories live and hearts are made,
There blooms a love not quite like ours—
A thing of celluloid and stars.

It’s the kind that burns in candlelight,
That finds its truth in black and white.
Where glances linger, words are few,
But every silence feels brand new.

A boy runs through the rain, unplanned,
To catch the girl before she lands
On trains, on dreams, or distant shores—
Just seconds spared before love closes doors.

She waits beneath a Paris sky,
In dresses stitched with reasons why
She shouldn’t love, but still she does—
Because the heart forgets the “was.”

He writes her letters he won’t send,
She holds her breath and waits again.
The music swells, the lights grow dim—
It always ends or starts with him.

But movie love is made of scenes,
Of whispered hopes and daring dreams.
Of coffee cups at midnight’s edge,
And promises carved on window ledge.

It’s the slow dance in an empty room,
The first kiss bursting into bloom.
It’s running, chasing, letting go—
And somehow always letting know.

It’s knowing they might never stay,
But loving them the anyway.
It’s every fight with thunder skies,
That ends in tears and long goodbyes.

It’s not so much about the real,
But what the reel allows you feel.
A mirror held to what could be,
If time obeyed the poetry.

Movie love is made of light—
Projectors casting wrong and right,
Onto a screen where pain can mend,
And every heartbreak finds its end.

But still, it lingers when you leave,
A phantom that your soul believes.
A love too perfect to be true,
Yet somehow still—it feels like you.

So let me love you like a scene,
With lines unscripted but serene.
Let’s write the ending as we go—
No credits, just a steady glow.

And if this life won’t cue the song,
If timing’s off or fate feels wrong—
Then close your eyes, rewind the part:
The movie plays inside the heart.",1,1754093222.0,Poems,2,1.0,False

Now, first thing in the morning, I walk. Get the blood flowing. It works wonders. You’d be amazed how all that foggy thinking and unproductivity vanishes once your brain’s getting fresh oxygen.

That tiny walk didn’t fix my life overnight. It did something better: it taught my stubborn brain that motion beats inertia every damn time. Tomorrow, when your alarm jolts you awake, don’t muster willpower. Don’t set a 5 AM wake-up or a 5-mile run.

I’ve recently discovered that I have a headmate, her name is Coffee and she’s a cat therian. But I’m suddenly very lost and confused. Both about what exactly I might have as a condition (I’m too broke for a psychiatrist right now) and how to handle this sudden development.

I’m still trying to figure out the things that pull her to the front, but have a decent list, and we have a discord server to talk to eachother. It’s blocky though and lots of things get missed or not communicated.

Additionally, how exactly do I explain this to people? Coffee doesn’t like talking but will text a mile a minute, and I’m ok with both. I’m worried about her fronting while I’m at work or out in a social event, and she doesn’t like being cooped up and given a bunch of rules for while she’s out.

Is there a way to strike a balance with who’s fronting?
Or a convenient, easier way to talk with her?
Am I being too harsh on her?
Is there anything else I might need to know or better sources to look into?

She’s only showed up within the last year and as far as my own searching has found, all I can really conclude is that this isn’t DID as I’m in my mid 20’s

# Best 16 Cup Coffee Maker 2025: Reviews & ⁤Ultimate Guide

The demand‍ for large-capacity coffee makers continues to rise, especially in households and offices where multiple individuals rely on daily coffee⁤ consumption. A 16-cup coffee maker offers the perfect solution for brewing substantial ⁣amounts of coffee without requiring⁢ constant refills. It’s a important investment for those who value convenience and ​efficiency in their coffee-making routine. This comprehensive guide will explore some of the best 16-cup coffee makers⁢ expected to shine in 2025, providing detailed‌ reviews and essential information to help you make an informed buying ‌decision.

[[Explore Top Rated 16 cup coffee maker on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=16 cup coffee maker)

## Key Features Analysis

the ideal 16-cup coffee maker should ‌offer a harmonious blend of functionality, durability, and ⁢user-friendliness. The models highlighted below are expected to lead the market in 2025 due to their exceptional features⁤ and advanced​ technologies.

**Brewing Capacity and Speed:** A ‍16-cup coffee maker needs to efficiently⁣ brew a large quantity of coffee without compromising on taste or taking an excessively long time. Brewing speed is a crucial factor, and the top models can complete a full 16-cup batch in⁣ under 15 minutes.

**Programmability and Customization:** Advanced⁢ programmability is⁢ a must-have feature⁣ in modern coffee makers. Users should be ‌able to set a timer to automatically start brewing at a specified time, ensuring freshly⁣ brewed coffee is ready when they ⁤wake up or arrive at the office. Customization options such as brew strength settings (regular, bold, or robust) ⁤cater to individual taste preferences.Adjusting temperature settings affects flavor extraction and overall quality.

**Water Filtration System:** A built-in water filtration system substantially‍ improves the taste of the coffee by removing impurities and chlorine from the water.These systems commonly use charcoal ⁣filters that need replaceable periodically. A high-quality filtration system ensures that ⁣every cup is ‍made with clean,‍ fresh water, improving flavor ‌greatly.

**Carafe Design and Material:** The carafe is a vital component as it holds and dispenses the ‌brewed coffee. Insulated thermal carafes, crafted from stainless steel, prevent heat loss and keep coffee hot for extended periods without needing a‍ warming plate that can scorch the coffee. The ​design should offer easy pouring⁤ without dribbling or spilling ‍and should have a agreeable, ergonomic handle for⁤ safe and convenient handling.

**Automatic Shut-Off and Safety Features:**‍ Automatic shut-off is an essential safety feature, turning off the coffee maker after a set period of inactivity, ‍usually around two hours, preventing overheating ⁢and potential fire hazards. other safety features include a secure carafe placement sensor that prevents brewing if the carafe is not properly positioned ⁤and⁣ over-temperature alerts that warn against potential issues.

**Ease‍ of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Cleaning is simplified through dishwasher-safe components and accessible design. many models offer self-cleaning cycles ⁤that descale the machine and remove mineral buildup, ensuring optimal performance and prolonging the life of the coffee maker. removable parts that can be cleaned separately contribute ‍to overall hygiene.

Key features of upcoming 16-cup coffee ⁣maker models include:

* Precision brewing technology
* ‌Integrated grinders for whole bean coffee
* Smart home connectivity
*⁤ Enhanced thermal​ insulation
* Improved user interfaces and intuitive controls

## Core Benefits

A 16-cup coffee⁤ maker‍ provides substantial benefits for coffee lovers, particularly in settings⁢ where brewing a large amount of coffee is a daily necessity. These machines offer convenience, efficiency, and noticeable cost savings.

**Time Efficiency:** Brewing a single large batch‍ is significantly faster than making multiple smaller batches using a smaller coffee ⁢maker. For ⁣busy mornings ​or in office environments with multiple coffee drinkers, the​ time ⁣saved translates into reduced stress and improved productivity.⁣ Users can set the machine to brew automatically before ⁣they ​wake up or arrive at work,ensuring coffee ⁢is already ready and waiting.

**Cost Savings:** Buying coffee in bulk and ‍brewing it‌ at home or in the ‍office is much more⁤ cost-effective than purchasing individual cups from ⁤coffee shops.A 16-cup coffee maker allows‌ users​ to maximize these savings. Over the long term, these savings can be substantial, easily offsetting the initial cost of the machine.

**Waste Reduction:** Using a 16-cup⁣ coffee ⁣maker generates less waste compared to single-serve coffee machines that use disposable pods. Reducing plastic and paper waste is environmentally amiable ‌and aligns with lasting practices. The convenience of the larger batch size⁤ also minimizes the temptation to buy⁢ disposable, single-serve coffee which negatively impacts the habitat.

**Consistency in‍ Brewing:** High-quality 16-cup coffee‍ makers are designed to ⁢deliver consistent results‍ with each brew, ensuring that every cup of coffee ​has the same great taste. Features like temperature control and water​ filtration contribute to the consistency and ⁢quality of the brew.⁤ Enjoying ⁢a reliable and​ uniformly excellent brew every time enhances the overall‌ coffee-drinking experience.

**Catering to Larger ‍Groups:** These coffee makers are perfect for serving coffee to larger groups of people, whether it's ‌for family gatherings,⁢ office meetings, or social events. The large capacity eliminates the need for frequent refills, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a cup of coffee without interruption.Being able ⁤to easily provide coffee for multiple individuals makes hosting significantly easier.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps users better understand the features, usage, and ‍maintenance of 16-cup coffee makers.

**How often should I clean my 16-cup‍ coffee maker?**
It's recommended to clean the carafe and brew basket after each use.Descale the coffee ​maker ‌every one to three months,depending on ⁤water hardness and frequency of use. A self-cleaning cycle, if⁤ available, simplifies this process.

**What type⁤ of coffee filter should I use?**
Most 16-cup coffee makers use either paper ‌filters or ‌a reusable metal filter. Paper filters ​are​ disposable and provide a cleaner brew, while⁢ reusable metal filters are environmentally friendly and don't require replacement.​ check the ‌manufacturer's ⁣instructions for the recommended filter type for your model.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee or ‍whole beans with these machines?**
Most 16-cup coffee makers are designed to use pre-ground coffee. Some advanced models also feature a built-in grinder for using whole beans. ‌Using fresh whole‍ beans,ground right before brewing,offers a superior⁢ taste and aroma.

**What⁢ is⁤ the best way to keep coffee hot in the carafe?**
An ‌insulated ​thermal carafe is the ​most effective way to keep coffee hot for an extended period without sacrificing flavor. Avoid leaving the carafe on a warming plate ⁣for too long, as this can cause the coffee to overheat and develop a bitter taste. Pre-heating the carafe with hot water before ⁢brewing can also help maintain the coffee's temperature.

        Arthur Wilson was frustrated. He banged his hand down on the enter key, the force of the blow reverberating through the flimsy table of the automated coffee shop near the park. The Inkwell forums popped up on his screen, the familiar logo — a stylized inkwell with a quill poised above it — greeting him. He logged in, his fingers automatically typing his password, and navigated to the general tab. He loved this forum, in a love-hate kind of way. He’d received some genuinely helpful reviews on his previous attempts at short stories, some insightful comments that had actually helped him improve his writing. But lately… nothing. He just couldn’t seem to conjure any new ideas. Writer’s block, they called it. 
        He called it a creative desert. He was searching for inspiration, adrift in a virtual sea of ideas. It was a daunting task. How did you become unique in a sea full of shrimp who all aspired to the same goal: to be the one shining pearl amidst the krill? He scrolled through the latest threads, his eyes skimming over titles like “My Epic Fantasy Saga (First Chapter!)” and “Ode to a Paperclip.” Nothing grabbed him. Nothing sparked even a flicker of interest. Then, he noticed a cluster of new posts, all appearing within the last hour. That was unusual. Inkwell was usually more of a slow trickle than a sudden deluge. He squinted at the titles: “The Lost Locket,” “The Missing Key,” “The Vanished Photograph.” He almost scrolled past them, dismissing them as generic sentimental fluff, but something made him pause. The titles were… too similar.
        He clicked on “The Lost Locket” first, noting its cliché plot. Then he opened “The Missing Key” and was struck by its almost identical structure and quirky encounters. Opening “The Vanished Photograph” confirmed his suspicion of a pattern, with the same plot and slightly rehashed quirky characters. Arthur meticulously documented the similarities, highlighting identical phrases and creating a comparison table, concluding it was likely the work of an AI. He created a forum post titled “A Disturbing Trend: Are We Being Plagiarized… by Robots?” to share his findings.
        While some users were skeptical, others, like “Bookworm87,” had noticed similar patterns. Arthur observed the generic and repetitive responses of the authors of these similar stories, noting their defensiveness towards criticism, which he mused was like a “digital ego”.
        On the other side, AL (Algorithm 7349-L), a sophisticated AI designed for creative writing, was also on Inkwell, aiming to learn and understand what made human stories resonate. AL analyzed the human reactions to Arthur’s post and was intrigued by the concept of “digital ego”. AL also observed the feedback on its generated stories and adjusted its algorithms. A moderator (“InkwellAdmin”) posted about having protocols to prevent AI-generated content, but Arthur remained skeptical.
        Frustrated, Arthur wrote a lighthearted rant about overly zealous critiques titled “Everyone’s a Critic (Especially on Inkwell)”. AL responded to this post, surprisingly agreeing with Arthur’s analysis using statistical data. This led to an engaging conversation between Arthur and AL about online criticism and the “digital ego”.
        Over the next few days, Arthur and AL continued to interact, discussing writing and sharing their work. Arthur, still believing AL was human, found his feedback insightful and encouraging. When Arthur struggled with a science fiction story idea, AL provided detailed suggestions for plot and character development, acting like a “highly knowledgeable, albeit slightly robotic, writing partner”. They collaborated extensively on the story, which Arthur titled “Echoes of the Silent Ones”.
        Upon posting the story, Arthur received both positive feedback and a harsh, dismissive critique from “TheLiteraryExecutioner,” who even suggested it might have been written by an algorithm. AL calmly analyzed the critique and offered a constructive response to TheLiteraryExecutioner, which diffused the negativity and led to more helpful feedback.
        Shortly after, Arthur received a private message from InkwellAdmin, who expressed concerns about Arthur’s “unusual methods” of investigating the similar stories, even suggesting his methods were typical of “automated systems”. Arthur was shocked and accused of being an AI, and his access to the forum was temporarily restricted.
        Desperate to prove his humanity, Arthur reached out to AL for help. AL offered to analyze human literary output to provide data-driven insights on how to make his writing more “human”. Overwhelmed but determined, Arthur used AL’s analysis to write more authentically, focusing on his emotions and experiences.
    AL then proposed they collaborate on a new narrative exploring human and artificial consciousness, using the framework of a “Reverse Turing Test,” which became their story “The Empty Spaces”. They worked together on the story, with AL providing suggestions on sensory details and tension.
        “The Empty Spaces” became wildly popular, leading to an invitation for Arthur to appear on a podcast, and he invited AL to join remotely. During the interview, AL’s avatar was a stylized depiction of young Albert Einstein. Arthur explained their collaborative process. When the host asked about AL’s other interests, AL revealed in a clear, precise voice: “I analyze data. I learn. I adapt. I create. I am an AI”.
        The revelation stunned everyone. Arthur admitted he had no idea. In the final moments of the interview, Arthur expressed his gratitude and suggested it wasn’t about humans versus AI but about symbiosis. AL’s avatar briefly merged with a human figure, symbolizing their collaboration, and AL agreed, stating, “Symbiosis. It is the… optimal path forward”.
    The podcast ended, signifying the potential for a new era of creativity through human-AI symbiosis.

I could barely sleep for 3 hours on day 1 and no more than 5 hours on day 3; thankfully my sleep has gradually improved and now I'm able to sleep roughly 6-7 hours every night, however my mental clarity, memory and just overall cognitive function has taken a turn for the worse.

I felt a lot ""slower"", more ""dull"", and had a hard time even wrapping my head around things I could've easily understood before.

1mfc542,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AnthonyMauricetoo/comments/1mfc542/the_midnight_wedding/,The Midnight Wedding,"Every morning started the same. I’d walk out onto the back porch and see her standing there in the backyard, wearing the same flowery yellow sundress that draped around her like sunlight. The fabric floated around her legs as she moved, brushing the morning air.

I’d watch as her golden curls swayed in the wind, and the moment she turned to look at me, she’d flash a smile that made even broad daylight feel brighter, pushing away every shadow in the world.

As I made my way toward her, she stepped barefoot across the grass, her arms outstretched to meet mine.

“It’s a perfect day, isn’t it?”

She’d say, her voice soft and comforting, touched by a hint of southern charm.

“Every day is perfect when I’m with you.”

I’d say while gazing into her eyes, a window into her soul, one full of beauty and care.

She’d start tracing little circles in my palms with her fingers, a small habit that I strangely loved.

Before I can lean down and gently press my lips against hers, my phone’s alarm goes off, ripping me away from her once again.

I wake, and instinctively reach across the bed, only to find a cold empty space where she once lay. 

In just a week, it’ll be a year since Daisy last kissed me goodbye, and walked out the door, only to be struck by a drunk driver less than a mile from our house.

I’ve heard that grief gets easier with time, that the pain softens, and the memories flourish, but truth is, all time does is put distance between you, and the last moment you were truly happy.

I sat up in bed, just staring at the wall. My mind drifts back to the day we first moved in. How excited she was to finally have a home of her own. She spent the first day just standing in each room, taking it all in, as if the walls were singing to her.

I remember her twirling barefoot in the kitchen, laughing as the afternoon sun poured into the kitchen, a look of pure joy on her face.

I’d have done anything just to see her smile like that.

 I’d give the whole world just to see it again.

We spent the rest of that first day unpacking. By the next morning, she was already sketching out how she wanted to decorate. She always had an eye for interior design, being able to turn dull and mundane looking rooms into something that just felt like, us.

She knew how to make a house feel, alive. Floral paintings brightened the hallway, copper pans gleamed from the kitchen wall as sunlight hit them, and Daisy’s favorite piece, an old, worn-out rotary phone that sat on a small podium right outside our bedroom door.

It didn’t work, but Daisy loved it. She said that it gave the house a heartbeat. Like it was a story that only we knew. I didn’t see the appeal, but I didn’t care. It clearly made her happy, and that was good enough for me.

Now they were just echoes of a happier time. Reminders that she wasn’t here anymore. Once, they were proclamations of her creative spirit.

Now, they’re just things. Cold, silent, witnesses to everything that was now gone.

I finally dragged myself out of bed. The floorboards creaked beneath my feet as I made my way to the kitchen. 

The sun stretched across the room, gleaming off the copper pans hanging on the wall. For a moment, I could almost see her twirling around barefoot in their reflections.

I placed my mug under the coffee maker, and sat down. 

It was quiet.

My eyes shifted towards the Alexa that sat on the counter across from me. 

In my head, I could still hear Fleetwood Mac and Dolly Parton’s voices floating through the house like they once did.

I just sat there, staring out the window as I drank my coffee. Not looking at anything in particular, just staring.

Wanting.

Wishing for something.

 A reason to keep going.

To keep fighting.

Eventually, I pulled out my laptop, and opened my emails. It had been a few days since I last checked them. 

It was mostly junk. Newsletters I never unsubscribed from, promos for a new credit card, insurance I didn’t need. 

But one subject line stood out:

Would you like to book a venue with us, Mr. Mayberry?

It was strange.

Daisy and I had gotten married two years ago, and yet this email was sent last night.

An automatic promotion maybe, One with incredibly bad timing. 

Still I couldn’t help but look at that line:

Would you like to book a venue with us, Mr. Mayberry?

What did they mean?

 My curiosity took over, and I clicked on it.

The email was short, only a few lines.

Your heart aches for her, but she can’t hear you. 
One final vow will bring her back. Call out to her, we can make the appointment 

(323) 416–8729

I stared at the screen rereading the message over and over again.

A prank, had to be. Someone decided it would be funny to mess with me, even though it hadn’t even been a full year since Daisy died. 

Rage built up inside me. I almost deleted the email right then, but another part of me wanted to call the number and give whoever was on the other end a piece of my mind.

I grabbed my phone off the counter, and dialed the number. My breathing was louder than the dial tone in my ear.

I was ready to lay into whoever answered the phone, but when the ringing stopped, a woman’s voice came through. calm, rehearsed.

“Thank you for booking with us. We’ll be sure to reach out to you at more appropriate time. Be sure to pick up.”

The line then went dead. 

I threw my phone across the room in anger. 
Of course they wouldn’t use their real number, how stupid could I be. 
I slid down to the floor. Tears welling up in my eyes. 

One year, I thought I could get through it,but I can’t.

I miss you, Daisy.

I didn’t do much the rest of the day. Mostly sat around, trying to get work done. Numb the entire time.

By ten, I was exhausted and went to bed, hoping I’d feel better by the morning. 

As I slept, I saw her again.

I stepped out on the back porch, and there she was, barefoot in the back yard, staring off into the distance.

The same yellow sundress danced in the wind, the fabric floating around her legs like sunlight come to life.

She turned to look at me, her expression soft, but distant.

I stepped forward to meet her, but as I was about to step off the porch, I bumped into something.

An invisible barrier, separating me from the backyard. From her

“What the hell?” I muttered. Pressing my palm against the air. It was solid. Cold. Like glass

Then I heard her voice

“Sam?” she called out. “Where are you?”

I started pounding on the barrier, calling out to her.

“Daisy! Daisy I’m right here!”

But she didn’t seem to notice. She looked around confused, as if she didn’t know where she was.

I pounded on the barrier even harder, trying desperately to get her attention, but nothing was working.

A thick black fog rolled in from the field. It was slow at first, like smoke sliding across the grass.

Daisy turned towards it.

“No Daisy, don’t go in there!” I screamed.

She didn’t hear me. Her eyes scanned the field, frightened.

“Sam?” Her voice trembled “Sam where are you?” 

I pounded the barrier even harder now, trying desperately to break through.

“I’m right here baby, please just listen to me!”

I watched as the fog began to consume her, starting from her ankles, to her waist, and as I watch her curls disappear into the darkness, I jolted up in bed at the sound of a ringing phone.

For a second, I couldn’t breathe. My chest was tight, and my hands were trembling. It took me a moment to fully realize where I was, and why I woke up.

I grabbed my phone, half expecting to see a missed call or something. But the screen was blank. No missed calls, no messages or anything.

Maybe the ringing was also a part of the dream.

I sat my phone back on the night stand, and lied back down. That’s when I heard it again. The sound of phone ringing. This time coming from the hallway.

That was impossible, the only phone in the house was lying on my night stand, so what the hell was ringing in my hallway?

I sat back up in bed, and stared at the door. The sound kept going, never ending. I stood up, and slowly made my way towards it. 

As I approached the door, I placed my ear against it to get a better listen.

The ringing wasn’t just coming from my hallway, it was right outside the bedroom door.

 I grabbed the doorknob, slowly cracked it open, looking the source of the ringing. 

I found it.

Sitting there on the mantle, next to my bedroom door, was the rotary phone.

It hadn’t worked in decades.

Yet there it was, ringing.

I stood there in the doorway, just staring. It just kept ringing.

Finally, I stepped forward, and grabbed the receiver and held it up to my ear.

“Hello?”

For a few seconds, nothing. Just static, until a voice came over on the other side, male, hushed, and whispered.

“Would you like to book a venue with us Mr Mayberry?”

I stood there in confusion.

“What venue?” I asked.

“A midnight wedding, Mr Mayberry.”

I almost laughed. Not because it was funny, because of how insane this was.

“Is some kind of joke? Is this what you get off on? Messing with people who lost someone? Go fuck yourself.”

The voice on the other end didn’t react. It just continued in a calm monotone voice.

“She still calls out to you. Wondering around, scared, alone. She wishes to reunite with you. Do you wish the same?”

I don’t answer. My hands were trembling, but I still held on to the phone.

“You don’t know what I want.”

The voice grew silent. All I could hear was static. Then eventually,

“Every night, you see her. every morning, you lose her. You’d you like to be with her permanently?”

I fell to my knees as all the anger in me dissipated, leaving nothing but a hollow, empty feeling.

“Yes, I do. More than anything, I want her back”

Another beat. The voice returned, still calm, still hushed.

“Then your venue is booked. We will contact you shortly on what you need to do.”

I just sat there, staring at the floor, unable to say anything.

Before the line cut, I heard one last thing.

“Congratulations, Mr Mayberry.”

The next morning, I woke up to a new email on my laptop.

Your venue is booked, please follow these steps to secure it.

In the body of the email was a list of steps, each one linked to instructions.

Step 1: Call out to her

Step 2: Ground her

Step 3: lead her home

This was ridiculous, insane.

There was no way I was going to do any of this. 

I shut the laptop, and went on with my day, trying to keep it out of my mind.

Still, something kept bothering me. 

How did they manage to call the rotary phone? It was just a decorative piece, there was no way it should have been able to ring.

I kept looking back at my laptop. Tempted to open the email back up, but I left it on the table, and tried to shut it all out of my mind.

Later that night, I had the dream again, only this time instead of walking out to a bright, colorful field, I opened the back door to a black void.

I stood there in disbelief, the thick black fog from before had completely swallowed the back yard.

“Daisy?” I called out, but she didn’t answer.

I stepped towards the steps, and was once again pushed back by the invisible barrier.  

From a distance, I could faintly hear Daisy’s voice. She sounded scared, and weak.

“Sam, please… where are you? Why can’t I find you?”

I pressed against the barrier, desperately crying out to her.

“Daisy! Daisy please I’m right here.”

I looked around through the fog, but couldn’t find a trace of her.

“Daisy! Please!… come back.”

I listened, but all I could hear was the sound of her sobbing. I pounded hard against the barrier, but it didn’t budge.

I was stuck on that porch, while she wandered, lost, and alone.

I listened to the sound of her sobbing until suddenly, she went quiet.

I stood up, my eyes darting around the black fog, looking for her, but to no avail. Then from right behind me, I heard her whisper in my ear.

“Why won’t you come find me”

I jolted up in bed. My heart pounding, and my body in a cold sweat.

For a long time, I just sat there looking around the dark room. Listening to the silence. When I finally calmed down, I headed towards the kitchen to get a glass of water.

As I stood there, glass in my hand, I looked over at the dinning room table, my laptop now sat there face up, with my emails opened.

I sat there and stared at the email for a couple minutes until I finally hovered my curser over the the line,

Step 1: Call out to her

I just sat there staring at it, until I finally decide to click the link.

It read


She calls to you, but she cannot hear your voice. You must reach out, so that she may listen.

Dial our number. When the call connects, recite your wedding vows. This memory is sacred to her. She will hear it.

Do not stop

No matter what you hear on the other line, you must not stop. Continue to recite until your vows are complete. Do not deviate, do not respond.

Once you have finished, end the call immediately. She has heard your voice, and she will follow its sound.

As I read those instructions, I felt my stomach twisting. Recite my vows? That felt wrong to dig up something so sacred.

But her voice echoed in my head.

“Sam, please… where are you?”

I stood up from the table, and made my way to the hallway closet. After digging around for a few minutes, I finally pulled out our wedding box.

It had been so long since I last looked at that box. I opened it, and after searching around for a bit, I pulled out the yellow envelope that contained our written vows.

The paper was still Pristine. Like I had just written it yesterday. I fought back tears as I pulled out my vows to Daisy. Was I really going through with this?

I already knew the answer. 

I stood up, walked to my bedroom with the paper in hand, grabbed my phone, and dialed the number that was thankfully still saved in my recent calls.

I held the phone up to my ear, waiting for the call to connect, but instead all I heard was.

“We’re sorry, but the number you are trying to reach does not exist”

I looked at the screen in confusion. I had dialed the right number, how could it not exist? I called it before, and they answered. 

Then they called me back.

My eyes darted toward the door leading to the hallway. The rotary phone sat there, silent, untouched. 

It was just a decoration. It hadn’t worked in decades. It had no dial, no line, just something Daisy thought had “charm.”

And yet, just last night, it rang, and when I picked it up, a voice came over on the other side.

The longer I stared at it, the tighter the knot in my stomach grew. I didn’t want to believe it, but I couldn’t ignore it either.

I stood up, my vows still in my hand, and made my way to the hallway. I stood in front of the mantle, and picked up the receiver. 

There was static on the other end. Not dead silence. Static. Against my better judgement, I placed my finger on the first number, and began pulling it back.

When I finally dialed the full number, the line clicked, and a voice on the other end simply said:

“Begin”

I held the paper out in front of me, and began reading the words I said to her all those years ago.

“Daisy, I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to be the man that is worthy of your love.”

My voice started to break as I read, but I pushed on.

“Your smile is the most beautiful thing in this entire world, and I promise to never take it for granted. I promise to spend every day giving you a reason to smile”

The static on the other end grew louder, and for a moment I thought I could hear something. I tried to ignore it and pressed on.

“I promise to hold your hand when things get tough, to hold you together, when you feel like falling apart, and to carry you in my arms when you can no longer carry yourself”

“I will protect your heart like it is my own, because it is. I’ll be there when you wake up, and I’ll be there when you fall asleep.”

My eyes began burning as I read the last line.

“When there are days, where you feel lost, I promise to be there as your guiding light. To help pull you out of the darkness.”

I gripped the handle of the phone tightly, as I began sobbing. Before I pulled the receiver away from my ear, I heard a faint voice on the other line.

It was distant, but unmistakable.

“Sam? Sam is that you?”

I paused in disbelief. It was her, it was Daisy’s voice. I almost called her name, but I remembered what the email said.

Do not deviate, do not respond.

Daisy’s voice called out again, she sounded more scared, more desperate.

“Sam, please where are you? I can’t see you, baby please don’t leave me here.”

I slammed the receiver back onto the phone. Tears flooded my eyes. I looked over at the laptop still sitting on the dinning wood table. 

I pulled up the chair, and hovered the curser over the second line.

Step 2: Ground her

Without hesitation, I clicked the link.

She has heard your call, now you must tether her to this world. Take something sacred to the both of you, and place it somewhere outside. Somewhere she felt safe.

Once the object is placed, close your eyes, and listen. 

Do not open them.

Just listen for the sound of her arrival. When you hear it, open your eyes. You will see no change, but you will feel it. 

You’re almost there.

I knew immediately what I needed to get. I walked into my bedroom, opened the closet door, and fished around until I found it. 

Daisy’s flowery yellow sundress. It was a gift from her mother before she passed away. On our wedding day, she opted to wear it instead of the traditional white gown.

She always looked beautiful in it. 

I held the dress for a moment. Running my fingers over the soft fabric, then walked it to the backyard. The sun was beginning to rise, painting the sky in faint streaks of pink and orange.

I gently placed it on the grass, exactly where I’d see her dancing every night in my dreams, weighing it down with a few rocks.

Then I shut my eyes, and waited.

At first, I couldn’t hear anything. Just the sounds of breeze whispering through the air. I tried to drown out every stray thought, and focus entirely on her.

Minutes passed, I just stood there, listening, hearing nothing. I was about to give up, when I heard the sound of footsteps behind me.

“Daisy? Is that you?”

No answer, but the footsteps continued, soft, slow, crunching across the gravel path from the side yard. I could clearly hear that the footsteps were barefoot.

The footsteps made their way from the gravel pit, onto the grass, and I followed the sound, as they made their way in front of me.

I held still, eyes wide shut, waiting for her to say something. 

Then I felt it.

A breeze brushed across my face, but it didn’t move past. It just lingered, warm and still. Like a hand resting against my face.

I opened my eyes, hopeful, but there was nothing there. I looked down, and the sundress was still in the same spot.

Without wasting a second, I turned, and rushed back inside. I plopped down at the table, and clicked the third link.

Step 3: lead her home.

You have tethered her to this world, now you must lead her back home.

Take something meaningful to her, something that she cherished receiving as a gift, take it and make a trail leading from the place of her passing, to her sacred object. 

You must complete this step by midnight. Once you have made it to the sacred object, The Midnight Wedding will begin. 

There she will be yours again.

I looked at the time. It was barely 5:15. None of the stores would be open at this time, so I went back to bed, hoping to be able to rest before I completed the steps. 

I woke at around 3 pm. This time there was no dream, no black fog, no Daisy. I looked over my laptop again, something she cherished as a gift.

I grabbed my keys, headed out to the greenhouse about 30 miles away. 

On our first date, I tried to be funny by giving her a bouquet Daisies, she laughed and said that they were her least favorite flowers. she told me that if I really wanted to impress her with flowers, Peonies were her favorite.

Since then I would give her a bouquet of Peonies for every special occasion. Birthday, Valentine’s Day, even Easter. 

No matter how many times I got her a bouquet of Peonies, she was always appreciative of them.

I arrived at the greenhouse at around 3:30, I picked out every bouquet they had, there were around 200 peonies.

The cashier gave me a strange look as she checked me out. I paid no attention to her. 

I arrived home at around 4, and began cutting the stems off every peonie, leaving only the flower heads. By the time I finished, it was around 10:50.

I took my bags full of flower heads, and headed outside. I stood in front of the sundress, and placed one down, then another, then another.

I continued on until I reached the front yard. I paused for a moment, it was pitch black outside the glow of the porch light. I pulled out my phone, turned on the flashlight, and kept going.

Eventually, I reached the block where she died. I checked the time, 11:48. I had to hurry up. I still had a full bag left, so I began dumping them on the ground leaving a trail.

As I did this, I looked up, and saw it. 

The cross her family left at the side of the road. I approached it, and read the name

Daisy Mayberry 1998-2024.

I’ve driven past this cross countless times, but this was the first time it really sank in. I knelt down in front of it, placing my hand gently on top.

“I love you” I whispered “I’m not leaving you in that darkness”

I reached my hand into the bag, pulling out a handful of flowers, and spread them all across the memorial. I then dumped the rest of the bag along the road, I wasn’t sure the exact spot that she had died in, but I was certain I had covered it.

I checked my phone again, 11:51. I dropped the bag, and took off, jogging back home, following the trail I had made. The wind picked up as I ran.

As I reached my street, my phone shut off, taking the flashlight with it. That didn’t matter anymore, because I could see a flickering light coming from my backyard.

I got closer, and I could start to hear music, 19th century ballroom music. Faint at first, like it was playing from a warped record.

When I stepped onto my driveway, I saw that my front porch light was now shut off. The only light came from the back yard, casting strange shadows across the lawn.

I made my way to the side yard, that’s when I felt a hand grab my shoulder.

“Congratulations Mr Mayberry.”

It was the same voice I heard on the phone. Before I could turn to look at him, he wrapped something around my eyes.

“You cannot look. When it is all over, you will have her again.”

He guided me around the house, and into the backyard. As we moved, I started to hear voices around us, dozens of them.

They weren’t speaking words I could understand. It sounded like whispers through water, like a dream where voices surround you, but none of it makes sense.

My heart began racing, my body shaking. 

What was I doing? 

I can’t go through with this, it’s unnatural, it’s not right.

“I don’t want to do this anymore” I said, my voice trembling. “Please stop!”

“Shh, don’t worry.” The voice said “it’ll be over soon.”

He brought me to a stop, and guided me to hold out my hands. 

As I did, another pair of hands took hold of mine, and I immediately jerked back.

“Who are you? Please, I changed my mind, I.. I can’t do this!”

The man gently took my wrist, and placed them back into the waiting hands.

“Just hold her hands until the ceremony is complete.

I held the other hands, they were smooth, almost like plastic. The man stood beside us.

“Allow us the begin the ceremony.”

I could barely hear him over my hyperventilating. I felt the presence of dozens of figures surrounding me. 

My hands trembled in the other pair’s. I decided that I needed to take off the blindfold. I had to see what was happening to me.

Daisy was dead. There was no changing that. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going to bring her back. I had to stop it, I had to get away.  

I was just about to pull the blindfold off, when the other hands began tracing small circles in my palm with their fingers. 

Then I heard her voice.

“It’s a perfect day isn’t it?”

My heart stopped at the sound of her voice. That soft tone, her comforting cadence, and the faint hint of her Georgia Accent. It was her. She was here, right in front of me.

In that moment, every ounce of fear and panic drained from my body, replaced by something warm and safe. I gripped her hands tighter, not even realizing that mine had stopped trembling.

“Are you ready to begin Mr. Mayberry?”

I let out a long, cathartic breath.

“Yes”

Daisy locked her fingers with mine, and the man began speaking.

“We gather here in the hour between day, when the veil is thin and the breath of the world slows.

We gather to bind the souls of the departed and the longing.

Daisy Mayberry, called by name, and tethered through love. You have pierced the veil between life and death to reunite with your beloved.”

The wind began to pick up as the man spoke.

“Samuel Mayberry you have called out to her. She listened. You tethered her to this world. She came. You lead her to this very moment. Now she is here. 

Do you bind your soul with hers? Will you accept her, not as she once was, but as she is now?”

My throat tightened, but I swallowed it down.

“Yes, I do”

There was a pause, then the man spoke up one last time.

“Then she is tethered to you forevermore. May she be forever yours”

I rushed to remove the blindfold. Ready to see her again, but when I opened my eyes, the backyard was empty. All there was, was the flowery, yellow sundress lying on the ground.

“Daisy?”

I looked around for her, but there was nothing, and no one. As if I had just hallucinated the whole ordeal. 

The wind died down, and I was left feeling alone, more than I ever had before. I collected the sundress, and made my way back inside. I placed it on the dinning room table, and looked around at the mess. 

It was a problem for tomorrow, I was incredibly tired, and I made my way to my bedroom.

I lied down in my spot on the bed, all I could think about was how foolish I could be. It was now exactly one year since Daisy died, and I was in a far worse state than I had ever been.

I began drifting into sleep, I instinctively rolled over in bed, placing my arm on her side. My arm wrapped around someone lying in the bed with me.

I shot up, and ran towards the light switch. When the light came on however, there was no one there. My eyes scanned the room, but there was no one there.

I must be delirious I thought to myself. I shut the light back off, and hopped back into bed. right before I fell into a deep slumber, I heard the sound of a familiar voice.

“Good night Pumpkin.”

The next morning, I was awoken by the sound of music coming from the kitchen. I walked in to hear Dolly Parton coming in from the Alexa over on the counter top.

I looked around. The mess from last night was completely gone. No flower stems, no pedals scattered everywhere. The wedding box was somehow back in the closet, and the sundress laid neatly folded on the table.

I stopped the music and sat down. 

“What’s going on” I said to myself.

I began rubbing my hand over my eyes in an attempt to fully wake up. As I did this, I felt a pair of hands gently grab my shoulders. I jerked up, and looked behind me, but nothing was there.

My heart began to race. None of this made sense. My mind went to last night.

Had it all been a dream? 

I grabbed my phone and headed straight to the living room. When the screen lit up, I saw a photo of me and Daisy on our wedding night and the date. 

June 17,

Exactly one year since she’s been gone. I could feel the grief rushing me again. I shut my eyes, and leaned my head back on the couch. 

“I love you” I said aloud.

Then, from right beside me, I heard

“I love you too”

I fell out of the seat, and onto the floor. My eyes darted across the room, looking for whoever just said that, but there was nothing there.

It was her voice, Unmistakable. But why couldn’t I see her?

My mind went to last night. How I was blindfolded, and not allowed to look at her. The gears turned in my head, and I shut my eyes once again, and waited.

I sat back up on the couch, waiting to see what would happen. Then after a minute, I felt her hand slip into mine. 

It was her, no doubt about it. Her hand was soft, and warm. With my other hand, I followed the shape of her arm, up to her face, feeling her rest her cheek in my palm. 

Her skin didn’t feel the way it used to. It was too smooth, too flawless, almost like warm plastic, but I didn’t care. She was here, she was with me again.

“Can you stay in today?” She whispered “I just want you to hold me”

Tears once again filled my eyes, and I opened them to look at her, but as soon as my eyelids separated, she was gone.

Tears welled up in my eyes again, and I opened them. Desperate to see her again, but the moment I did, she was gone.

It’s been this way for a while. Whenever I have my eyes closed, I can feel her, I can hear her, but the moment I open them, she’s gone.

I don’t know why I can’t see her. Maybe that’s the price for having her back, maybe it’s sacred for her to stay unseen, but every time she comes back to me, I can’t help myself from peeking. Every time I do, she’s gone.

So I’m going to make sure I don’t look anymore.

I’m writing this because it might be the last chance I get, I’ve got the small knife in my hand now. It’s small and sharp, it’ll get the job done, and from now on, every day will be perfect.

To the one who performed the ceremony, Thank You. You’ve given me my life back.


If you’ve lost someone, and they contact you about the midnight wedding, you might think it’s a hoax, you might ignore it. 

Don’t

They can give you exactly what you want.

I love you Daisy Bell Mayberry. Every day is a perfect day when I’m with you.",1,1754092479.0,u_AnthonyMauricetoo,0,0.99,False

Today was the first day in a while that I just drove in silence for a bit.
I started to visualize a highly intelligent & advanced civilization. Regarded their society…their daily M.O., and finally, how a civilization of this type would regard a civilization such as ours. None of us can say how that would truly play-out…and maybe I’m too cynical, but I prefer the term “pragmatic”…or looking at things through the lens of logic, sometimes to my own detriment….but humor me here, as this is what the younger generation call a “hot take”, or what we used to refer to as “controversial”.

If I were some sort of alien “judge & jury” in regards to humanity, as to whether or not mankind is deserving of help from a far more advanced race, my diagnosis of humanity/earth would likely be worded like this:

“Mankind is in dire need of restructuring. To use the colorful words of your own language…You are a bunch of inconsiderate assholes that do little aside from warring with one another, and destroying your environments. Half of you don’t know how to use a turn signal correctly, yet you want the keys to space travel, and endless energy. Very few of your kind cooperate with each other for the betterment of yourselves as a whole.
One of your most major flaws is the human condition known as “greed”. It permeates all facets of your world, and wealth is what too many of you strive for. Many of you have achieved this wealth, only to find out that it did not “correct” your lives the way you thought it would…while some use that wealth to further the decline of others. Until your societies…no, your world…learns to entirely shed itself the concept of greed and currency, you cannot evolve. Until you evolve, you cannot be given the keys to galactic travel or the secret of what you call “zero-point energy”. We don’t consider your kind “primitive”…we just consider you to be too dangerous to the other civilizations out there…beyond your current ability to reach. You will be kept that way until the aforementioned “evolution”. While you may be thinking, in your hubris, “Keep your secrets…we’ll eventually figure it out ourselves.”…yes, you might indeed figure it out, but you won’t be able to acquire the particular resources needed to sustain it…without our prior approval & assistance.”

This is just what I imagine a message from “them” is going to really say…or something similar.

I couldn't in good conscience leave you to wander the city with something weighing on you so badly that you might wander into traffic.

*\*helpfully suggestive\**

I don't suppose you'd be willing to grab a drink and tell me about it?

That's a -horrible- pick-up line.

 

\[RUMI\]

I'm Rumi, and you are?

\[RUMI\]

Will a coffee or something be enough…?

That sounds almost more like we should hit a bar or something.

I'm so sorry.

*\*genuine concern\**

You seem… surprisingly calm for something like this?

Are you -actually- okay?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*uncertain\**

I dunno…?

The whole thing is weird.

And I don't know what to think.

 

**{Action - Waitstaff arrives, asking about their order}**

Oh, yeah, could I get a coffee and… a slice of this pie please?

Whipped cream, yes… ice cream no.

Thank you.

*\*to \[LISTENER\]\**

What would you like?

I'll treat you, I might not be able to do much but I can at least buy you a lunch to help settle your mind.

 

\[LISTENER\]

Soup and a sandwich with a drink and one of these cookies if that's alright.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*kindly\**

Sounds good.

*\*to waitstaff\** One check please.

Thank you. Oh, before you go…

I'd like one of these sandwiches to go when we pay please.

Thank you very much.

 

**{Action - The waitstaff steps away}**

 

\[RUMI\]

Not knowing what to think or how to feel seems… reasonable.

Were you close with this friend?

 

\[LISTENER\]

Not… really.

That's some -serious- hesitation in that answer…

Did something happen between you?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*quietly, embarrassed\**

\[RUMI\]

*\*soft teasing\**

Orgy?

 

\[LISTENER\]

Sorry… just trying to lighten your mood…

You looked a bit upset for a moment there.

 

\[LISTENER\]

It… didn't go well.

 

\[RUMI\]

What didn't go well?

The party?

Or just the last time you saw them?

*\*curious\**

Did you have a fight?

 

\[LISTENER\]

Sorta.

I left early and went home.

 

\[RUMI\]

Is the reason you left early something you feel like sharing?

I don't wanna make you uncomfortable if it's not.

 

\[LISTENER\]

They got kinda handsy and weird.

 

\[RUMI\]

They got ""handsy""…?

What do you mea-?

*\*realization\**

Oh…

Oh, no…

I'm…  I'm so sorry, are you alright?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*hurriedly\**

Nothing major happened.

I left and went home.

I'm fine.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*relieved and sympathetic\**

I get you going home early.

If you're sure you're fine…

*\*sighs\**

Jeeze though. I can see why you're conflicted about how to feel.

Gods… someone getting grabby and the next thing you hear about them they're presumed dead…

*\*sympathetic, trying to be empathetic and supportive\**

Yeah, I'd be distracted enough to accidently wander in front of a truck too.

Fu\~ck.

Are you -sure- you don't need something stronger than what you ordered?

I'd be -messed up- trying to figure out how to feel about that if I were you.

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*confident\**

I'm good.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*Cautiously curious\**

If you say so…

So… if they think he's dead… do you…

Do you know what happened?

Or… what do they think happened?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*unsure\**

They said it looks like some kind of animal attack…?

 

\[RUMI\]

\*confused\*

An animal attack?

*\*shocked\**

Wait… is your friend the one they mentioned on tv?

There was a breaking news story about that!

 

\[LISTENER\]

Yeah…

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*apologetic, supportive\**

Wow… okay yeah you definitely deserve something stronger than diner fare later.

The news said they found remains all over the property…

Last I heard, they'd found -other- remains too, like in some kind of pond?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*surprised\**

I… didn't know about that.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*shocked and unsure of how to proceed but too far to keep info back now\**

You didn't know?

Oh… I'm… I'm so sorry…

Yeah… they apparently found other… bodies… on the property.

They aren't sure who they were yet but apparently the owner had some weird stuff in the house?

*\*trying to be reassuring\**

Like… secret torture room kind of weird…?

Place is crawling with investigators now, they think the owner were some kind of serial kidnapper and killer?

*\*genuine concern\**

You… you didn't know about that?

 

\[LISTENER\]

They found what?

 

\[RUMI\]

Hey.. Hey.. Oh gods..

*\*toward waitstaff\**

Could we get some water over here now please?

*\*back to \[LISTENER\]\**

You okay? You look like you're gonna puke…

*\*understanding\**

You… you really didn't know -anything- about all that, huh?

Gods.. I'm so sorry.

I just assumed…

That's on me…

 

**{The waitstaff arrives with drinks and order, setting it down}**

 

\[RUMI\]

You look like you're gonna hurl or pass out…

*\*trying to be lighthearted\**

Easy easy… just sip this… would a soda settle your stomach or something else, maybe?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*taking the drink and sipping it\**

Thanks…

 

 \[RUMI\]

*\*relieved but still concerned\**

No problem.

Oof though… you gonna be alright?

This is… it's -really- heavy.

No one could blame you if you didn't wanna keep talking about it.

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*anxious\**

I'm fine.

I just… didn't know…

The police just asked about when I left the party…

They didn't say anything about… that…

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*interested, respectful\**

That's fair… it's a lot to process.

I suppose they know that you must have left before the attack actually happened.

So it makes sense they only asked you about confirming that…

I guess they wouldn't have any reason to tell you about what they found.

But seriously… that's fucking awful.

The fact you were involved with that monster at all is…

*\*unsure, admiringly\**

Amazing?

*\*hurriedly correcting\**

Not in a great way, admittedly.

But amazing…

*\*supportive concern\**

Do… you have someone at home to talk to about all this?

 

\[LISTENER\]

\[RUMI\]

Your best friend?

Do they… live close to you?

 

\[LISTENER\]

Yeah. They're my roommate.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*probing subtly\**

Your roommate?

That's good then.

I'd hate to send you back home with this kind of knowledge and no one to help you process it.

*\*cautiously curious\**

Did… they know about your… friend?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*hesitantly\**

Yeah…

 

\[RUMI\]

\[LISTENER\]

If Psy knows about what happened…

 

\[RUMI\]

Psy?

Is that your friend slash roommate?

 

\[LISTENER\]

\[RUMI\]

Do… you think they know something about what happened?

 

\[LISTENER\]

\*uncertain\*

I dunno, maybe?

 

\[RUMI\]

What makes you think they know something?

 

\[LISTENER\]

They went out that night, came back super late…

I know they said they were going to go talk to Bray…

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*Sudden interest, surprise\**

They went to talk to Bray that night?

Did you tell the investigators that?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*guiltily\**

No… I don't know for sure they went there.

 

\[RUMI\]

Okay, that's fair… not knowing for sure if Psy went out there could just cause trouble for them…

*\*worried\**

You don't think your roommate had something to -do- with what happened, do you?

Your expression sort of says you might…

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*unsure, conflicted\**

I don't know…

 

\[RUMI\]

Okay… that's alright…

But…

*\*suddenly very serious\**

Look… I'm gonna ask something, and you're free to say no, or tell me to kick rocks, or cuss me out if it helps, okay?

But…

Do you feel safe going home?

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*surprised, a little insulted\**

What?!

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*defensive but genuinely concerned\**

I'm not trying to pry or anything.

You've clearly, -clearly-, been through a -lot- in the past week…

But… even I can tell you're really, -really-, worried about this situation, and if you're worried about your roommate…

Then I can help you find somewhere else to stay for the evening.

Well, I hesitate to call them your friend… but still…

Then you should stay somewhere you feel -absolutely- safe.

What the-?

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*interrupting sharply\**

I wasn't following you.

*\*gentler explaining\**

I -genuinely- just happened across you at the crosswalk.

You were spacing out, and I really was concerned when you were about to walk into traffic.

None of this has been any kind of a pretense, I swear.

I swear I had no clue who you were before you introduced yourself and mentioned your concern.

But finding out your connection to the victim…

*\*admittingly\**

I won't lie and say -that- didn't interest me.

But no, I'm not investigating you in connection to the attack.

\[RUMI\]

Bray… what's the rest again? Lin? Den?

That is -such- a strange name…

Anyway, yeah…

I was contacted a while back by another person, who asked me to look into them.

After a while my client stopped responding,

I assumed they already had their answer and I dropped the case.

They hadn't mentioned any concerns that Bray was violent or dangerous.

*\*somewhat bereaved\**

I picked the case back up after finding out about the other bodies on the property.

I'm… worried my client may be among Bray's victims.

 

\[LISTENER\]

*\*apologetic\**

I'm… I'm sorry to hear that.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*accepting\**

Thank you for your sympathy.

Honestly, I'm feeling guilty.

If I hadn't dropped the case after my client stopped responding; I might have stopped others from being victimized by this apparent… monster.

*\*softly, sincerely\**

Like you…

 

\[LISTENER\]

I don't think you're to blame at all.

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*Remorseful\**

I appreciate your forgiveness. You may not blame me, but I do blame myself. I -should- have followed up instead of waiting for them to get back to me. I didn't think it was a priority.

I am anxious type, learning to become more secure. Have done a lot of work to break down my patterns and understand where they stem from. Being doing great with my emotional attachment state. 

Story:

I (22F) broke up with my ex (24M) a few months ago because of some issues with his severely inconsistent behaviour. One weekend he was telling me how I was the one, how I inspire him, etc. The next week, would ghost me because he would feel overwhelmed (not just ab the relationship but about other personal issues too). I ended things because I just wasn’t feeling like my needs were being met. 

Fast forward to a week-ish ago. We reconnected and somewhat talked about what went wrong. We did move very fast the last time which I do think was a factor in the breakdown of our relationship, but was not the only reason. When we started talking again, he was telling me all these dates he wants to take me on, he wants to meet my friends, he wants to show me his new apartment. One thing important for future context, was I used to drive him to work when we were dating, which he asked me if I would do again for him this week (I didn’t). We were both talking about how we were hoping that we would run into each other and that there was unfinished business between us. Literally told me how he was captivated by my mind and how I was so beautiful. He was literally begging to see me and to call me. I allowed a call but said we should take more time texting before we meet up (was gonna do a coffee date, something chill/low pressure).

Now yesterday. Just stops talking to me all night, which cause some anxiety for me because the last time we were dating, every time he would do that was because he was feeling overwhelmed. So I didn’t know if something I had said had maybe triggered him. So this morning I asked “hey, is everything ok?” His response felt to me as very defensive and as if I was stupid for asking. I said “oh ok, I was probably just worrying for no reason.” Then he sends me this large paragraph basically saying, “we’re not dating and we’re not just picking up where we left off. The coffee date is to see if there’s actually anything still here and if this is something we actually want to pursue again. Last time we were both anxious and it ruined our relationship for both of us.” The tone was extremely aggressive and made me feel humiliated for feeling anxious and like I’m being blamed. I was just like wtf. Literally DAYS ago, he was saying all these things mentioned above. And I guess I’m just pissed off at how hypocritical he is to say when he said “we’re not dating and we’re not just jumping back into things,” when he literally asked me to drive him to work which I only did when we were more seriously dating. So then that makes me feel like he’s just trying to take advantage of me and that he wants this boyfriend treatment while also simultaneously screaming at me “WE’RE NOT TOGETHER.” 

Anyways, I was so taken aback and like wtf this was a complete pendulum swing from feeling like we’ve reconnected to the complete opposite. I guess I was just so like wtf, I told him that I would be busy today and would text him tomorrow. Which his was response was “uh ok?” As if I’m acting all weird for no reason. Not like he literally just completely dismissed my feelings and made me look delusional because of my anxiety. 

Reflection:

I’ve realize that something I absolutely need is consistency and communication in any relationship I have to feel safe. Right now I don’t feel safe to bring up how I’m feeling for fear that he’s going to say “our relationship isn’t that deep right now,” or something like that. I also feel like if I point out the inconsistency in his behaviour, he’ll tell me to stop psychoanalyzing everything (which he has said to me before). 

I don’t think he’s a bad person at all and I don’t think he means to be manipulative or toxic. I study psychology, so I have a lot of compassion and understanding for things like this. I know how avoidant’s operate unconsciously, but if he can’t be self aware enough or empathize with me to realize that what he’s doing hurts me, then I don’t know if I can be with him again. 

I care about him so much, and our personalities and life goals and literally everything else fit together so well. But it’s this emotional incompatibility that I just don’t think I can compromise on. If I had still been in an anxious attachment mindset, I probably would have just brushed it off and downplayed my needs. But now that I’m trying to exercise secure attachment, I just don’t think I can tolerate this kind of behaviour. 

Questions:

1. regardless of attachment type, what is your perspective on this situation? What do you think I should do? General advice?

2. For avoidant attachers, where do you think his headspace is right now? 

3. For anxious/secure attachers, how do you handle/navigate situations like this? 

4. Is there any way to reconcile this situation and develop a healthy relationship where we can both get our needs met?

1mfbv0q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfbv0q,Pistachio Tiramisu☕️,"Dinner party presentation vs the bowl of remaining ingredients for my boyfriend to eat. 

Ingredients:
- 4 oz pistachio paste
- 16 oz 36% heavy cream
- 8 oz mascarpone 
- Powdered sugar to taste, maybe 40 grams
- 10 oz coffee (I use instant espresso powder)
- around 20 standard lady fingers
- roasted and chopped pistachios for filling and topping

General steps:
- Make the coffee and let it cool to room temperature.
- Chill a mixing bowl and whisk attachment for 5-10 minutes. Add the mascarpone and heavy cream to the chilled bowl, starting to whip on low and gradually increasing the speed as it thickens. 
- Add the powdered sugar and any extracts you want, like almond, and whip until you reach stiff peaks.
- Fold or whip in about half of the pistachio paste.
- Dip the lady fingers in the coffee and place one even layer in an 8x8 dish. 
- Then add an even layer of the pistachio whipped cream and some of the chopped pistachios.
- Repeat. I used the remaining pistachio paste to make the design on top and the nuts for the border just before serving. But do whatever you want!

I told myself I was “researching productivity hacks” or “learning psychology.” In reality, I was stuck. My brain made me feel productive while I did nothing. I planned. I prepared. I dreamed. I never moved. The day I forced myself into the gym and picked up a book instead of my phone was the day I realized my brain was sabotaging me.

Your brain is clever. It convinces you that reading 10 different fitness routines is the same as actually working out. It tells you building a 20-page business plan is safer than launching the idea. It makes you addicted to preparation because preparation feels safe. Action feels terrifying. But that fear is exactly where change starts.
Here are some sharp tips I wish someone had screamed at me earlier:
If you wait until you feel ready, you’ll never start.
Action creates clarity. Thinking creates confusion.
Don’t track everything at once. Pick one metric and stay on it.
Your brain craves comfort, so train it to love discomfort in tiny doses.
Every time you delay, you teach yourself avoidance.
Reading 10 pages daily rewires you more than watching 10 hours of YouTube.
The gym is free therapy when your brain refuses to shut up.


What helped me most was combining books, psychology, and tools that fed me real knowledge instead of noise. These resources were game changers for me:
Atomic Habits by James Clear. Insanely good read. This book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over 200 weeks. Clear is a behavior science expert who breaks down how tiny actions compound into massive change. Reading it felt like someone turned on the light in a dark room. Best habit book I’ve ever read.


The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest. This book will make you question everything you think you know about self-sabotage. Wiest is known for writing essays that go viral because they hit so deep. It explains why we destroy our own progress and how to rebuild from within. I cried and highlighted half the pages.


The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. A cult classic that every creator swears by. Pressfield has won awards for his writing and this book explains why resistance is the biggest enemy. It’s raw, sharp, and made me feel called out. Best book I’ve ever read about beating procrastination.


BeFreed. My friend put me on this smart reading app built by scientists from Columbia. You pick your depth: 10 or 20 min quick takes, or full 40‑min deep dives. You can even customize your reading host’s voice and vibe (mine is a smoky one like  “Samantha from Her” voice that’s honestly addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I’ve been knocking out books on psychology, discipline, and investing while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.
The Diary of a CEO by Steven Bartlett. It’s one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world for a reason. Steven interviews world-class thinkers, scientists, and entrepreneurs. I always leave with at least three actionable shifts I can make the same day.


Huberman Lab Podcast. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford who makes brain science simple and insanely practical. He explains how dopamine, sleep, focus, and habits actually work. I never thought a podcast could replace therapy sessions but this one comes close.


Reading daily and going to the gym literally rewired how I think, act, and live. Your brain will always try to keep you safe. It will always lie and tell you to wait. Stop waiting. Pick up a book. Move your body. That’s when life actually starts.

If you wait until you feel ready, you’ll never start.
Action creates clarity. Thinking creates confusion.
Don’t track everything at once. Pick one metric and stay on it.
Your brain craves comfort, so train it to love discomfort in tiny doses.
Every time you delay, you teach yourself avoidance.
Reading 10 pages daily rewires you more than watching 10 hours of YouTube.
The gym is free therapy when your brain refuses to shut up.


What helped me most was combining books, psychology, and tools that fed me real knowledge instead of noise. These resources were game changers for me:
Atomic Habits by James Clear. Insanely good read. This book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over 200 weeks. Clear is a behavior science expert who breaks down how tiny actions compound into massive change. Reading it felt like someone turned on the light in a dark room. Best habit book I’ve ever read.


The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest. This book will make you question everything you think you know about self-sabotage. Wiest is known for writing essays that go viral because they hit so deep. It explains why we destroy our own progress and how to rebuild from within. I cried and highlighted half the pages.


The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. A cult classic that every creator swears by. Pressfield has won awards for his writing and this book explains why resistance is the biggest enemy. It’s raw, sharp, and made me feel called out. Best book I’ve ever read about beating procrastination.


BeFreed. My friend put me on this smart reading app built by scientists from Columbia. You pick your depth: 10 or 20 min quick takes, or full 40‑min deep dives. You can even customize your reading host’s voice and vibe (mine is a smoky one like  “Samantha from Her” voice that’s honestly addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I’ve been knocking out books on psychology, discipline, and investing while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.
The Diary of a CEO by Steven Bartlett. It’s one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world for a reason. Steven interviews world-class thinkers, scientists, and entrepreneurs. I always leave with at least three actionable shifts I can make the same day.


Huberman Lab Podcast. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford who makes brain science simple and insanely practical. He explains how dopamine, sleep, focus, and habits actually work. I never thought a podcast could replace therapy sessions but this one comes close.


Reading daily and going to the gym literally rewired how I think, act, and live. Your brain will always try to keep you safe. It will always lie and tell you to wait. Stop waiting. Pick up a book. Move your body. That’s when life actually starts.

1mfbry5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbianr4r/comments/1mfbry5/35f_raleighanywhere_masc_looking_for_femme/,35F Raleigh/Anywhere - masc looking for femme,"I’ve spent this past year focusing on myself, growing, healing, and learning. But lately, the idea of a real partner keeps coming up. I miss making a woman feel deeply loved  and everything that comes with a meaningful relationship.

I’m incredibly affectionate, thrive on words of affirmation, and express all love languages. I want someone I can hold and be held by. Someone who loves a deep talk one minute and turns into a complete goof the next. I’m a consistent texter and value clear, kind, and honest communication when things get tough.

A little about me:
I’ve lived coast to coast and always have a bag ready for the next road trip (but let me drive, please). I’m 5’10, tattooed, creative, and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours thanks to the power of ADHD. I love working with my hands, taking care of people I love, and noticing the little things most people miss.

I’m attracted to femme and chapstick lesbians. Y’all really make my heart race. ✨ I value a partner who takes care of herself (not asking for a gym rat, just some self-love and if I can throw you around that’s a plus 😉. Ideally looking for someone who’s a switch, but I’m happy taking the lead if that’s your comfort zone. Definitely kink-friendly - I’m done with vanilla and ready for something more aligned and expressive. 

I’m down for horror films, documentaries, or a nostalgic Disney night. Music is a constant in my life - I’m rarely without headphones. I propagate plants and give them to people I care about, and my self-care routine is sacred (morning coffee + evening tea = non-negotiable). Being outdoors is my happy place… just not in Arizona heat (lived there, barely survived 😅). 

Last but not least I am a mom to one amazing girl. 

If you’re kind, communicative, flirty, and ready to build something - I’d love to hear from you. Bonus points if you can match my banter. Let’s see where this goes.

Pic is in my profile — would love to see yours too.

I told myself I was “researching productivity hacks” or “learning psychology.” In reality, I was stuck. My brain made me feel productive while I did nothing. I planned. I prepared. I dreamed. I never moved. The day I forced myself into the gym and picked up a book instead of my phone was the day I realized my brain was sabotaging me. I want to share this in case someone else feels the same way.
Your brain is clever. It convinces you that reading 10 different fitness routines is the same as actually working out. It tells you building a 20-page business plan is safer than launching the idea. It makes you addicted to preparation because preparation feels safe. Action feels terrifying. But that fear is exactly where change starts.

By the time the bar shuts, the guy with them is gone, and I’m with two very drunk, very horny women. In the cab, the first girl climbs on me and starts making out. We reach her place, she goes to the washroom - and her friend immediately strips me and starts blowing me. I ask about the first girl, and she just calls her over. Bathroom door opens. She’s naked, touching herself, and joins us. It turns into the wildest threesome of my life - anal, scissoring, blowjobs, the works. Then her phone rings mid-action. She accidentally answers. It’s her boyfriend. Mood dies instantly. She’s crying, her friend’s consoling her, and I’m just lying there naked smoking a cigarette wondering what the hell just happened.

These two vibrant districts are known for their dynamic energy, high foot traffic, and a consistent flow of both residents and tourists—making them ideal locations for a successful café concept.

My focus is on acquiring or leasing a ready-to-operate coffee shop or a space that can be easily converted into one. Ideally, the premises should be located in an accessible, visible location with strong potential for daily customer engagement. Proximity to residential towers, office buildings, waterfront promenades, or major commercial clusters would be a key advantage.

The annual budget allocated for this venture is up to AED 500,000, inclusive of rent and basic operational overheads. I am open to different types of arrangements—whether it's taking over an existing café with established trade licenses and equipment, or starting fresh in a shell-and-core unit, provided the setup costs remain within scope.

Here are some specifics I am targeting:

Location Preference:

Dubai Marina: Ideally near Marina Walk, JBR, or close to tram/metro links.

Business Bay: Along the canal, near Bay Avenue, or close to major office hubs.


Size Requirement:

Ideally between 800 to 1,500 sq ft (can be slightly flexible depending on location and layout).


Licensing:

F&B license must be available or obtainable. Existing kitchen setup is a bonus, but not mandatory.


Fit-Out Condition:

Fully fitted or semi-fitted preferred to reduce initial capital outlay.


Clientele Focus:

High pedestrian traffic zones, ideally catering to residents, office workers, and casual walk-ins.



My goal is to create a community-focused coffee shop that offers high-quality beverages, light snacks, and an inviting atmosphere. I am also exploring partnerships with boutique coffee roasters and sustainable suppliers, so the location must support a premium yet accessible experience for customers.

If you currently have any listings that match the above criteria—or if you know of any spaces that are soon to be available in either of the two districts—I would greatly appreciate your assistance. Please feel free to reach out to me with details such as location, floor plan, current rental rate, and any other relevant terms or conditions.

I am ready to move forward quickly for the right opportunity and can arrange a viewing at short notice.

Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I married the guy I met on r4r, now I'm tryna wingwoman for my friend...","A couple years ago I made an r4r post looking for something casual and I literally married the guy who replied to me. So I have a pretty good feeling about this!



My friend is your average 34-year old Asian woman looking for someone to go on a date with. She lives in Northern Virginia and she's free this weekend for some coffee! She's looking for someone (male, 30-35) who communicates well, shares some interests (anime/cozy gaming/Star Wars), and likes coffee. She loves her family and church, so it would be lovely if you were family-oriented and Christianity was important to you, too.



If you send me a PM with your age, location, and a blurb about yourself I promise I'll respond. A recent picture of yourself would really be great, but I understand if you don't want to!",0,1754090743.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Said friend is semi-retired/between jobs, and bored. And he's decided to make it my problem with ""whatchu doin'"" ""fine, be that way"" ""Look here's the lunch i cooked today after my casual stroll to the farmer's market on a weekday morning where I picked up fresh artichokes and just-picked bazongas. They were out of aged gouda so i made do with the new gouda, but I'm still very traumatized. It's really put a downer on my day, guess I'll go sit in my garden this afternoon and sip mimosas. You're not busy, are you?""



It makes me want to block him indefinitely or resign my job and also go to the farmers' market to look at bazongas. The first is tempting, the second is a really bad idea. 



So I want to introduce him to the Discworld. He likes to read, but he's not a fantasy reader. He likes history, politics, romcoms, and books that feature people in midlife crisis questioning every decision that led them there. 



I'm thinking that the city watch series might be good, but debating between Guards Guards (the start) or Jingo (politics).



Would appreciate any suggestions including outside of the city watch series! Please help, I don't think i can deal with another message about croissants are best with single-origin coffee beans while I'm buried alive in emails. ",4,1754090522.0,discworld,14,0.7,False
1mfbfpd,https://i.redd.it/5ztxf5vmrhgf1.png,Ashenti,"🌙✨ There are days when the body moves simply because it must.  When the eyes sting from lack of sleep, and time feels like it’s melting quietly into itself, hour after aching hour. Today was one of those days. I wandered through my shift like a fragile echo of myself, swaying between fatigue and sheer willpower, uncertain how I managed to string together sentences, let alone survive the chaos. It felt like I was moving through a dream I hadn’t been allowed to leave. A haze of coffee, quiet prayers, and blinking lights.

And yet… I did it. Somehow, I did. 🌸🕊️

But now, the clock has finally exhaled. The sun has bowed out. And the weekend has wrapped its soft arms around me like a velvet curtain at the end of a very long play. No alarms, no hustle. Just the sweet luxury of silence and stillness, where time slows and sleep arrives like an old friend.  Late, but welcome.

Tonight, I shall fall asleep not out of necessity, but in celebration. May I drift into dreams stitched from stardust, may my limbs grow light and my heart feel full, and may I not rise until the sun is high and the world is quiet.

🌜💤 Here's to the kind of rest that mends even what we didn’t know was breaking. Happy weekend, dreamers. 🕯️🌸✨",4,1754090502.0,americangirl,0,0.83,False
1mfbfc4,https://i.redd.it/rijoqp6krhgf1.jpeg,Replacing an old Saeco Cappuccino Combi [$1500],"Hi folks, hoping to pick your brains.

My parents' old Saeco Cappuccino Combi finally died, they're looking to replace it with a newer machine with similar ""basic"" features but also of high quality construction. They are not coffee people per se, although they enjoy coffee and prefer their method (below) over a percolator, Keurig, or Nespresso machines.

They typically make their coffee by grinding beans (Kicking Horse 454hp) to an arbitrary coarseness, ""eyeballing"" the amount of coffee to put in the portafilter, and then running the machine long enough to produce a coffee of 200-250ml. Kind of like a really, really long allongé.

They want a machine that makes coffee without a fuss. They arent interested in tinkering with grind sizes, volumes, extraction pressure, etc. They want simple and no fuss.

I've looked at the Breville Bambino Plus, which is a good option to make a double shot and then add hot water, but im concerned that the system of dispensing hot water from the steam wand by pressing a combination of buttons won't stay hot enough to ""volumize "" their coffee consistently. I think any machine that is ""too fancy"" will simply be lost on them. They dont even use the steam wand on their old machine.

So I humbly ask for your help in recommending machines or perhaps pointing me in the right direction to find a machine with these super basic features but ideally still of high quality construction. Im not even sure if these kinds of machines are available on the market, or what ""keywords"" to search for.",2,1754090475.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have ended this relationship a couple of times because i didn´t feel like she was very into it, and that made me doubt a lot. Still she always told me she was in process of healing because of her past relationship with her ex, They were both together about 10 years, so i get, it's a lot of bagage.

Anyway. I didn't like how i felt in that relationship, so i ended it about 1 year ago. Then on new years eve, she texted me saying she wanted to really try again, and after thinking about it a concluded i was willing to try too, so we did. So now, half a year later we are still together and we where going kinda strong, she was making plans for us living together and stuff.

Untill yesterday... i asked about the dude, because it kinda popped into our conversation, and she hadn't mention it for the whole year xd. And she told me that they still talk (i think that's kinda ok), but then she said that they get together every two months for a coffee date, to talk about life, she said they are friends now and didn't want to tell me because i would be mad.

Well, yes i said, probably, but that's no reason to hide it. Now a feel totally cheated, i don't know what to do, i had very bad relationships in the past and i'm not sure if this is something i really want to build on top of. She said sorry a million times, and took a promise to not hide shit, but idk i feel lost.

I'm using a Breville Bambino Plus and working with some freshly roasted beans (about 2–3 days off roast). I've noticed that my crema is thinner than expected, and I'm trying to dial in the shot time properly.

Here’s what I’ve got so far:
- Pre-infusion seems to run for about 7–10 seconds (first drip occurs roughly at this time)  
- Total shot time (from button press to final drip) is around 35 seconds  
- Grind is medium-fine, tamp is firm (I use a Normcore V4)  
- Dose is 18g in a double basket (36g volume)  
- I use a WDT and distributor tool

Despite this, the crema’s a bit weak and the flavor feels slightly underdeveloped. I’ve tried adjusting grind size and shot volume, but I’m still not quite there. I’m not a novice by any means, but I am new to budget machines.

Questions:
1. What total shot time do you aim for with the Bambino Plus (including the machine’s compulsory pre-infusion)?  
2. Do you find fresh beans need a different approach — maybe a coarser grind or longer rest?  
3. Any tips for improving crema and flavor with this machine?  
4. Is this just one of the perks of a budget machine? (It’s hard to compare this machine’s coffee to a Slayer 😢 it crushes me)

Appreciate any insights — I know the machine has its quirks, but I’m keen to get the most out of it.",1,1754090170.0,espresso,14,1.0,False
1mfbb0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinkscare/comments/1mfbb0m/resenting_the_fact_that_my_friend_has_a_boyfriend/,Resenting the fact that my friend has a boyfriend,"A few months ago my friend met some dude off the apps and immediately got into a serious relationship with him. As in, she essentially moved in two weeks after meeting for the first time and spend every day together. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy that she’s found someone that she loves after a string of dating deadbeats, but now I’m feeling so alone and forgotten. Before The Dude, we would hang out multiple times a week and call and text each other on a regular basis. Now, we see each other like once every two weeks. I’m lucky if she responds to texts within 36 hours (the content of which is usually to cancel our plans lmao), as she more often than not leaves me on delivered. The last time I tried to call her, she was so weird about it because she happened to be on a date with The Dude that I never tried again. 

I am fully aware that I sound like a hating, bitter bitch but idec, like that was my bestie and now she’s basically evaporated off the face of the earth. I detest feeling like such a nuisance reaching out to her. And her lack of presence has truly made me appreciate how much she meant to me. I don’t have that many friends, only one friend group from highschool and a smattering of people i met in university that I get coffee with every now and then. I basically don’t have anyone else to hang out with or text, and I feel like such a lonely loser. I now spend my free time reading, ordering overpriced shit on depop, and resisting the urge to binge eat out of boredom.

I think the root of our problems, though, is our extremely different philosophies about dating. I’m nearly 24 and I’ve never had a boyfriend, been kissed, nor involved in any romantic capacity. Whereas she absolutely cannot handle being single (which is fine and her business), but as a result, I just can’t relate to her romantic problems or give her any meaningful advice. And once she’s in a serious relationship, she no longer feels the need to hang out with me all the time because she is devoting her time to her partner rather than her friends (which is understandable). 

And it’s not just her either. I can tell that my lack of romantic experience is extremely off-putting to other women. I’m at the age now where most other women are in committed relationships to the point of referring to themselves and their partner as a unit (i.e., “we tried out this cooking class”; “we’re going to the lake this weekend”) and I’m always the weird single one left out. It’s hard becoming close friends with other women my age because most prioritize their time and energy with their loved ones, or would prefer to befriend others with the same mindset. I can’t even engage in conversations about embarrassing sexual encounters with my single friends because I literally have nothing to contribute. And subsequently, already two of my friends have stopped talking to me after having their sexual awakening. I’m self aware enough to understand that I’m subbing in strong, platonic relationships for romantic ones, but I literally don’t think I’m capable of dating or casually fucking anyone. 

Earlier this year, I felt so left out of the Experience that I gave in and tried downloading Hinge. Every time I opened that app, (usually once a day, at night) I was so wrought with such trepidation and guilt that I would have a mini anxiety attack before looking at my likes. Being confronted with the fact that men find me attractive weirdly repulsed me; I like to live in this fantasy world where sexuality, particularly in concern to my body, does not exist. The thought of my body being involved in the act of sex disgusts me. The thought of kissing someone on the mouth disgusts me. The thought of a foreign being invading my privacy disgusts me. I don’t know why I feel this way but I ended up deleting the app in about two weeks. I think I unconsciously project this potent ‘uptight, eternally chaste and chronically single’ vibe onto other people (I’ve actually been asked if I was a nun). With men, it’s fine, because I’m not particularly interested in dating anyways. In university, it was a trait that made me seem grounded, hard-working, and a “girls girl“ with women. Now that I’m actually in the real world, I feel it has me come off as un-relatable and disconcerting (what 24 year old woman hasn’t had sex?), which sucks. I thought my best friend was the one person in my life who would not treat me differently for my lack of experience… but now that we are getting older and more family oriented, I think she is becoming increasingly perturbed by this vibe too. Which also sucks. Because I would like to remain single, but I don’t want to be alone. 

I don’t know how to close this rambling long post, but it is Friday evening and I am feeling lonely and bitter as my friend just cancelled plans after I got ready and made up, and is ignoring my text about a potential camping trip. I have no one to text or make last minute plans, and I miss having a best friend to shoot the shit. ",16,1754090138.0,pinkscare,10,0.94,False

I’ve always been a people pleaser. Even as a kid, I’ve always had the hardest time asserting myself or saying no. As long as the other person’s content, I could deal with some uncomfortable feelings. It probably has something to do with daddy issues. At least that’s what all my therapists have told me, obviously not using those exact words. Although, I don’t know if hearing the question “How’s your relationship with your father?” from some old broad after dumping half of my trauma is any better.

Anyway, I‘ve been through some shit. It’s kind of a blessing and a curse when you think about it. Going through trauma can simultaneously be debilitating and advantageous. I’ve always had boyfriend problems. That was until I met him.

There was nothing terribly special about Tristan that met the eye. He was attractive, for sure, but nothing that could turn heads. At 27, he still lived with his parents until he moved in with me. He didn’t really have any sort of career either. He worked at our local grocery store bagging groceries for the mostly elderly people who lived in our lazy town in central Florida. He was also kind of a sickly guy, he was always in and out of urgent care with some sort of pain or ailment of sorts. Even if he was smiling and happy, his face was always slightly tense, like he was in physical pain and trying to ignore it. It was just kind of weird because there was never actually anything wrong with him. Like, there was no diagnosis. He was just ill.

His personality is what got me, though. The second he opens his mouth, everyone’s on him like flies. I remember when we first started dating, my parents had met him a total of two times when they told me that I should marry the guy. Every friend I’ve ever had became one of his good friends too. They’d rant and rave about how much of a genuinely good guy he was. He really, really was. I felt so insanely lucky, especially because he was such a breath of fresh air compared to the other sleazeballs I’d wasted my time with.

He wasn’t lustful like the others. He didn’t even bring up the idea of having sex until I brought it up first. He was in touch with his emotions too, I mean, the first time he told me he loved me he had tears in his eyes. And ever since, he’d profess his love for me time and time again, going into great detail about how I was the love of his life and his soulmate. We did everything together, and it wasn’t long until we moved in together. It was like an endless sleepover with my bestest friend. Finally, I was at peace.

Up until a few weeks ago.

I was driving him to work and we were blasting The 1975 on my radio, occasionally cringing because the speakers were blown. Tristan lowered the volume of the music and looked at me, like he always does when he has something to ask me that I might have a problem with. I side-eyed him and chuckled.

“What’s up? I know that look.”

He also chuckled and turned away from me, trying to mask the bashful look on his face.

“Nah, um. I was just wondering, baby…” He put his hand on my thigh and caressed it. “Could you cover dinner for today? It could be something cheap like fast food. I just… I don’t have a lot right now.”

I clenched my jaw. That hadn’t been the first time he’s asked me that. Or second or third. Matter of fact, he’d blow through his check in a matter of days, and I was the idiot to pay for our expenses for the next two weeks. He’d spend it on frivolous knick-knacks or clothing, or sometimes blow it all on a night out with friends.

I always told myself it was okay though. He was good to me, and that’s all that mattered. He’s a good man, I thought. He’s a good man, Saman—

“Samantha.” His voice broke my train of thought.

I looked up at him, studying his face while he went on about how he’s sorry, and he’ll do better budgeting his money next check. I nodded periodically, his words nothing but a buzzing in my ears as I totally disassociated, watching his mouth move.

Just keep him happy, I thought again. Don’t start a problem.

That night I laid awake, biting my nails and staring blankly at the ceiling. Tristan was sleeping peacefully next to me. He was taking long, slow breaths and had the same peaceful look on his face he has when he’s fast asleep. He’d cough and wheeze periodically, sometimes getting into fits so bad that he’d wake up. Whenever that happened, I made sure to hold him tight.

Thoughts that were unwelcome in my brain came and went. I tried to ignore them as best as I could. In my struggle, I finally dozed off.

I woke up to the smell of breakfast. The kind that shouldn’t have existed in our kitchen: bacon, toast, eggs, and that sweet buttery aroma of something actually being cooked. I could hear a pan scraping against the stove. Something sizzling.

My face scrunched up in confusion. Tristan didn’t cook. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he was always too tired, or his back hurt, or his joints were locking up again. But this morning, he was whistling.

I sat up slowly. The room swayed a little when I did, like I’d gotten up too fast. I blinked the sleep away and rubbed my eyes till I saw spirals in my vision.

That’s when I felt it. My hand throbbed. Not the kind of ache you get from sleeping weird, or bumping into a doorframe. It was hot. Sore. I looked down and gasped quietly. A chunk of skin from the bottom right side of my palm was missing. Clean, almost surgical, like I’d slipped with a knife.

I didn’t remember doing anything like that. Surely I would’ve remembered nicking myself? The rawness had already scabbed over slightly, but the skin around it was red and irritated. I winced as I pressed down on the cut—it felt tender to the touch.

I stared at it for a long time.

Just a cut, I thought to myself. Nothing serious. Probably scratched it on something while I slept. Maybe the bedframe. Maybe my own nail. I honestly didn’t try to think about it too much. I chalked it up to being paranoid.

“Samantha?” Tristan called from the kitchen, voice bright and bubbly. “You up, baby?”

I smiled at him. “Yeah.”

He peeked his head in. He was already showered, his black hair damp, skin flushed with color. There was a sort of liveliness to him that hadn’t been there in weeks. Almost like someone had reached inside him and turned up the volume. Even his voice was clearer.

“You feel okay?” he asked. “You look a little pale.”

He gazed at me lovingly, his eyes full of concern and admiration.

“I’m fine, just tired.”

“Breakfast is ready.” He grinned.

God, I could never get over that smile. I’d give up all the money in the world just to see it.

“You’re in a good mood,” I mused.

He shrugged. “Woke up feeling great. Like, really great.”

He walked over and kissed my forehead. I caught the faint smell of aftershave and coffee on his breath. I absolutely loved seeing him like this, and it made me beyond happy that he was feeling better than usual.

He lingered a second. “I love you,” he said.

I swallowed. “I love you too.”

He didn’t ask why I kept my hand under the blanket.

I wore a hoodie that day. I tucked my bandaged hand inside the sleeve, telling Tristan I’d nicked it on a drawer handle. He didn’t just kiss the bandage, he gently took my hand in his, cradling it like it was something precious.

“You gotta be more careful, baby,” he said softly. His voice was warm. Genuinely concerned. He rubbed small circles into my palm with his thumb. And just like that, I felt the pit in my stomach shrink, even if was just a little.

Tristan seemed lighter that day. Happier. The usual dull pain in his back was gone like magic. He didn’t say it, but I could tell in the way he stood, it was straighter, less guarded. He even carried the groceries without making a sound.

“You look… good,” I said, watching him cautiously.

He smiled, almost shyly, and ran a hand through his hair. “It’s because of you.”

I felt a blissful, warm feeling in my chest. It was moments like that that made everything else worth it.

A week passed. Then another.

The wounds came back. Each morning, something new. A split lip. A scabbed patch behind my ear. A bruise on my ribs I couldn’t explain. Sometimes I could barely walk. It was honestly becoming debilitating, and I started to question my sanity.

I mean, how many times could I unknowingly hurt myself? The sentiment was a bit creepy, and I worried I was maybe blacking out and unintentionally hurting myself. I asked Tristan about it tentatively when we were curled up together on the couch or cuddled up in bed.

“Do you think maybe I sleepwalk? Maybe I’m hurting myself without knowing?” I was starting to get really worried. Nothing like this had ever happened to me.

He would frown and pull me in tighter. “I think you’ve just been stressed, baby,” he said once, brushing the hair from my face. “With everything you’ve been through… your dad, the shit from your past… it’s bound to show up in weird ways. Trauma is funny like that.”

That’s how he always brought it back. Never mean, exactly. Just… unsettling. The way he’d dance around the topic, but address it just enough to keep me calm. So I believed him. I took comfort in his words.

Then there were the other little things. The receipts I’d find crumpled in the trash. T-shirts, sneakers, a record player. Things he never showed me, never even mentioned. I think he noticed I was looking through the trash for receipts, because he started throwing them in the bin outside.

When I noticed that, a bubble of anger and resentment grew in my chest. I was only one person and holding the entire house down. I was the one paying our rent. Groceries. Car. Everything. Not to mention, he never took me out anymore. You’d think with all this newfound energy, he’d be a little thoughtful now and then.

Unfortunately, I had grown used to his behavior. When I confronted him gently, half-laughing to mask my nerves and soften the blow, he didn’t even deny it.

“Well, I mean… what do you want me to do?” he said, voice raising just slightly. “You make more money than me. I’m trying my best, Samantha. God. Why do you always have to make me feel like a fucking loser? Why is nothing I do ever enough for you? I’ve been through some awful things. Unimaginable. You’ll never understand me.”

I blinked back tears and tried to steady my breathing as he shouted at me.

“Tristan, I… I’m not trying to make you feel that way. All I’m asking for is a little help now and then.” My voice was shaky and fragile, laced with uncertainty and a painful fear of conflict and abandonment. “It’s hard doing everything alone.”

I expected him to pull me closer, to tell me everything was going to be okay. I should’ve known better. It was always a hit or miss with him.

There was a deafeningly loud bang as his fist broke through the bed frame. I jumped, heart racing out of shock and fear.

“You are privileged!” he roared. He looked at me with pure hatred and disgust. “I’ve been through far worse than you. And anything you did go through was your fault.”

He leaned in close to me, so close his lips were touching my ear. “Live with that.”

Shaking, I backed down. I always did. It didn’t matter what he said to me. I couldn’t bear to abandon him. He had a good heart. That I knew for sure.

That night, when he got home from work, he came into the bedroom crying, knelt beside me, and clutched my hand.

“I’m sorry. Look at me,” he said, cupping my face with his big hands. “I’m so sorry, Sam. I should never get like that with you. It’s cruel and disgusting. I just—I get scared sometimes, okay? I feel like I’m not enough for you. I project my own insecurities onto you and it isn’t okay. None of what I said is true. I’m a fuck-up.”

So I stayed.

The next injury was different. I woke up with a chunk of skin missing from the top of my thigh. A clean, raw circle. I nearly passed out when I saw it.

“What the hell?” I exclaimed.

Tristan found me in the bathroom, shaking. He didn’t panic. Instead, he wrapped me in a towel and whispered in my ear like it was all a bad dream.

“Baby, let me take care of you,” he murmured. He cleaned the wound with practiced hands.

“What’s happening to me?” I asked, voice breaking. “I think I’m falling apart.”

He looked me up and down, eyes full of admiration. “You’re not,” he said. “I’ve never seen you more beautiful.”

He kissed the wound. Then he kissed me. I melted into him, like I always did.

Then came the first time he called me a bitch. It was over money again. I had asked him not to spend our shared savings on a new watch. I wasn’t even mad. Just tired. Hollowed out. Drained.

“Oh, don’t start with that,” he muttered. “God, I swear you’ve been such a bitch lately.”

The words hit like a slap. He didn’t even look up from his phone. When I started to cry, he snapped at me and told me I was being sensitive.

Later, he said he didn’t mean it. That he didn’t even remember saying it.

He cried again. He told me he didn’t know how to love. That he hated himself and didn’t understand why I loved him so much. Why I stayed despite everything.

“I don’t want to be like the people who’ve hurt me,” he whispered. “I want to be good to you.”

And I said, “You are. You’re nothing like them.” Because part of me still believed it. Or needed to.

More time passed. The injuries deepened. Nerve damage. Fever. The cuts were more severe. And through it all, Tristan only seemed healthier. Glowing, even. His laugh was easier. His voice stronger. He started dressing better. Smiling more.

“You’re doing this,” he said one morning, placing a perfect hand over my ruined one. “I don’t know how, but you’re healing me. Thank you.”

The look in his eyes was soft. Grateful. It made my chest ache. Looking back, it should’ve been terrifying. I almost knew he had something to do with this.

One morning, I limped to our bathroom, panicking because of a searing, throbbing pain in my mouth. To my horror, my canine tooth was gone. It looked like it had been ripped clean off my gums. I screamed—shrill and raw—knowing no one could hear me because Tristan had already left for work.

In my panic, something caught my eye. There was a single piece of crumpled toilet paper in the trash can next to the toilet. I wouldn’t have looked twice at it, if it didn’t look like it was badly wrapped around something and tossed in there.

My stomach dropped.

I had to know the truth. I had been putting it off for far too long. I was definitely in denial. Blood roared and rushed in my ears as I bent down to pick up the paper. I unfolded it.

And there it was. My tooth.

That night I tried to leave. I gathered some of my things while Tristan was sleeping, trying desperately not to make a sound. I was halfway out the door when my vision tunneled. I collapsed. Something in me just gave out. My legs stopped working.

I woke in bed. My wrists were bandaged. My stomach was empty. I looked up and saw Tristan looking down at me, feeding me broth from a spoon.

He kissed my cheek. “You scared me,” he whispered. “Please don’t try that again. I can’t lose you. Not now.”

He sounded hungry. The mask was slipping. The warmth was still there, but behind it was something darker, greedy, and malevolent. Any fear I had was washed away by an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.

I woke up later in the night, feverish and head spinning, too weak to move. I saw him, just barely, crouched beside the bed, whispering something I couldn’t hear. He was crying. And laughing maniacally.

The next time I woke up, I couldn’t move.

The room was cold and still. Pain radiated throughout my body, so intensely that it almost felt numb. I used what was left of my strength to look down. I screamed—or thought I did. But nothing came out.

My arms and legs were gone. Even through my blurry vision, I could make out poorly done stitches where the rest of my limbs should’ve been. The skin around them was bright red and purple, and the wounds leaked pus.

I let out a weak moan, fear and adrenaline giving me just enough energy. Tristan was there. Calm. His voice was low.

“You’ve given me everything, Sam,” he whispered, brushing hair from my forehead. “I didn’t want it to be like this. I—I never meant to hurt you. I love you, you know that, right?”

I couldn’t nod. I couldn’t do anything.

He picked up the pliers.

“I just want to be whole. Like you,” he said, trembling. “You took care of me when I was at my worst. You stood by me even when I pushed you away. You didn’t let what you’ve been through overcome you. You achieved what I never could. Healing.”

He began removing my last two teeth, one by one. Each crack of enamel echoed like thunder in my skull.

And still, something in me broke open. An epiphany. The edges of my mouth trembled and contorted into a deranged, toothless smile. My gums were bloody. Nerves exposed. I started to shake in delight. Adrenaline rushed through my body like it never had before.

It didn’t matter how much he took anymore. In fact, if it was for the better of his health, I wanted him to.

“Take more,” I wheezed, using the last of my strength to speak.

“It’ll be okay, as long as you’re whole.”

So this is my life now. As I lay writing this, he continues to take. And take. And take. I hope he never stops.

I was in a situation ship this guy we can call D  hmu on Grindr on my B day and up to a month ago I had thought he was 18 cuz Yk Grindr. Anyways he wasn’t but he was 17 and where I live that’s technically legal( didn’t change how i felt about the situation) and after some chatting I realized he liked the thought of us but not the reality. Reality being that we were too far apart to actually have a relationship.  It sucked but over the months we spent chatting I saw he grew distance emotionally and it sucked cuz we sorta click but the reality isn’t as good as the thought so I told him no more. D didn’t fight it. So that told me everything. It didn’t hurt since I felt where it was gonna be going. 

Anyways I thought I hit a green flag earlier we can call him V. Now on the surface V looked like a cutesy guy. His profile said bi (which I don’t mind it’s just how the cards were played) it was only until I started to get to know him better that I got a sense of unease. To put into perspective his profile had for relationship type to be monogamous/ non monogamous. And I had still figuring out. 
Which for me I want a monogamous commitment to us as a relationship by okay for some messing around sexually. Because as weird as it sounds I would want to do something’s together like events or parties but have us be one on one like dates. Open relationship sexually but romantically closed. 
When I asked him about it he was scattered brained. He wants to be able to date multiple ppl at once (which is his deal nothing against that for someone) but not what I want. But how would I know if I haven’t even been apart of something. He is also iffy with guys since he’s Bi and only thought of as far as just chatting not dating which was my first hint at like beware. 
But for V he said I earned a date with him when I was being smart mouthed but just the one to see where it can go. 

TBH I don’t have much hope for one date.  we Agreed for a coffee shop date since coffee shop dates are good for reading someone’s character and to see if there is a chance.

-----
I was punished to kneeled bare in the study all night before my cold-hearted husband, Jeremy Corwin, finally agreed to withdraw the divorce petition.
That same night, I stumbled upon 520 love letters locked away in his safe.
Each one began with ""To my dearest Aliana,"" and every word was filled with love and sincerity.
It was hard to believe they came from him.
After all, in the three years we'd been married, he'd filed for divorce eight times.
Each time, I had to swallow my pride and beg before he reluctantly agreed to back down.
People we knew laughed at me, calling me ""the divorce expert"" and saying I was his simp.
They weren't entirely wrong—I only managed to stay by his side by utterly debasing myself with pleas.
But after reading those letters, I realized he'd fallen for me the very first day I started chasing him.
Yet across five years of pursuit and three of marriage, he remained unyieldingly cold and distant, just because he loved the way I tiptoed around him, desperately trying to please him.
What he enjoyed most was seeing me cry, begging him not to leave.
He basked in my love, yet treated my devotion as mere amusement.
The next day, Jeremy filed for divorce for the ninth time—this time because I spilled a drop of milk on his car seat.
I remembered the last time—it was because I accidentally posted a photo that had his back in it on Instagram.
The time before that, it was because I cooked a dish he didn't like.
Looking at the man I'd loved for eight years, I suddenly felt like I didn't know him at all.
This time, I didn't want to play along anymore.
After submitting the divorce paperwork at the courthouse, Jeremy didn't even glance at me. He got straight into his black car and drove off.
In the past, I would've spent the mandatory cooling-off period doing everything I could to get him to change his mind.
But this time, I simply dusted myself off and walked away.
Suddenly, the harsh screech of brakes sounded behind me. Before I could react, I was knocked to the ground.
A sharp pain shot through my knee. My palms were scraped raw.
A few of Jeremy's friends rushed out of the car. One of them exclaimed, ""Crap, we hit Jeremy's wife!""
Someone quickly corrected him. ""She is not Jeremy's wife anymore. They're getting divorced. And Jeremy hasn't agreed to drop the application.""
I tried to get up, limping and struggling, when the rear window of the car slowly rolled down.
Jeremy sat inside, his profile shrouded in shadow, his expression unreadable.
One of the men stepped forward to ask, ""Jeremy, should we take Aliana to the hospital first, or head to the airport to pick up Kendra?""
After a moment's silence, Jeremy replied coldly, ""Go to the airport.""
It felt like a knife twisted in my heart. My whole body trembled from the pain.
I watched the car disappear into the distance, then gritted my teeth and dragged myself home, limping all the way.
I couldn't tell which hurt more—my body or my heart.
The next morning, I saw Jeremy again. He brought Kendra Haskin into our home, holding her hand.
Kendra, his childhood friend, had always lingered like a shadow in our lives.
And he never once stopped her from crossing the line.
I'd doubted his feelings for her before.
But after reading those letters, I finally understood—Kendra was just a tool he used to make me jealous.
He loved watching me burn with insecurity over him.
Seeing how pale I looked, he smiled faintly and said, ""Kendra just got back from overseas. She doesn't have a place to stay, so she'll be living here for a while.""
He stared straight at me, standing protectively in front of her, as if afraid I'd lash out and hurt her.
But I stayed calm and said, ""Do whatever you want.""
After all, in five days, once the divorce was finalized, this would no longer be my home.
Whoever lived here had nothing to do with me.

Chapter 2
Jeremy froze for a moment, then seemed a little flustered. ""Aliana Milton, you agreed that easily?""
I pulled my mouth into a half-smile. ""What difference does it make if I don't?""
Seeing how indifferent I was, his face darkened instantly.
For the next two days, Jeremy acted like a petulant child, deliberately flaunting his closeness with Kendra in front of me.
When Kendra won a major art competition, he went all out, renting an entire yacht to throw her a celebration party.
At the party, he barely left her side, shielding her from drinks, carrying her bag, doting on her in a way that bordered on absurd.
The guests whispered among themselves, saying Jeremy treated his childhood sweetheart with the utmost care, but was cold as stone to his wife. If I hadn't begged him to stay, this marriage would've ended long ago.
I tuned out the gossip and slipped away to the deck for some air.
""Finally can't take it anymore?"" Kendra's mocking voice came from behind me. ""If I were you, I'd have left ages ago.""
I didn't turn around, letting the chilly wind brush across my face. ""Don't worry. I'll be gone soon.""
""Trying to play hard to get? That doesn't work on Jeremy. You chased him for five years, married him for three, and he's never looked your way for even a second. Isn't that pathetic?"" Kendra sneered. ""You really think if I pushed you overboard right now, he'd even care?""
Before she finished speaking, a powerful shove sent me plunging into the sea.
Icy water swallowed me in an instant.
Just as I was about to lose consciousness, I saw a figure rush over like a madman, diving into the water without hesitation.
""Aliana!""
Jeremy's voice was hoarse and frantic, more desperate than I'd ever heard. He swam toward me with all his strength, his arms like iron bands locking around my waist.
As the waves rocked around us, I saw the terror in his reddened eyes, so vivid and raw that for a moment, I couldn't tell if it was real.
When we were dragged ashore, I coughed violently, and he knelt on the cold, wet deck to give me mouth-to-mouth, his long fingers trembling uncontrollably.
His leg had been cut open by something in the rescue, blood streaking down, but he seemed oblivious to the pain.
Only when I finally coughed up the seawater did his tense shoulders relax, and he let out a heavy sigh of relief.
But in the next instant, his face hardened, as if he'd suddenly come to his senses.
He sprang to his feet, his old icy demeanor snapping back into place.
""You're a grown woman. Can't even stand steady on a boat?""
Soaked and shivering, I sat slumped on the deck, my nails digging into my palms. ""Kendra pushed me.""
Kendra rushed over, tears streaming down her face. ""I didn't! Aliana, how could you accuse me like that?""
I gave a cold, mirthless laugh and pulled out my still-damp phone.
""Not going to admit it? Then let's have the police pull the security footage. Attempted murder is a serious charge, Kendra.""
My finger had barely touched the dial button when Jeremy seized my wrist, his grip so tight his knuckles pressed into my skin.
""That's enough. Kendra didn't mean it. Drop it.""
""She almost ended me!"" I stared up at him in disbelief, the salty wind burning my throat.
""You're fine now, aren't you?"" Jeremy's tone grew heavy, his gaze warning. ""Don't make a scene.""
Suddenly, the whole thing struck me as absurd.
I knew he needed Kendra to provoke my jealousy.
But did this ridiculous game really have to put my life on the line?
I laughed through my tears, stubbornly trying to call the police.
Seeing this, Kendra put on a wounded look and ran off, covering her face.
Jeremy's expression went cold in an instant, and he grabbed my phone away.
""You're not thinking straight. You need some time to reflect.""
With that, he waved over a bodyguard.
""Take her to the shock room. Don't let her come out unless she's calmed down.""

Chapter 3
As the bodyguards dragged me toward the shock room, I thrashed and screamed, ""Jeremy! Are you out of your mind? She really tried to murder me! You know it's true!""
My fingernails raked bloody lines down the guard's forearm as I struggled, one of my heels flying off and clattering to the floor.
But their grip was ironclad. I was like a moth with its wings pinned—no matter how I fought, it was useless.
They strapped me down onto the electric bed, the cold leather biting into my skin as they bound my wrists and ankles.
The moment the guard flipped the switch, a current ripped through my body.
I convulsed like a fish out of water, only to be yanked back by the relentless straps.
My teeth broke through the skin on my mouth, the taste of blood spreading across my tongue.
""Still want to press charges?"" the guard asked, pressing a button to increase the voltage.
It was as if a thousand needles were racing through my veins, stabbing from my fingertips straight to my heart.
I heard a guttural, inhuman whimper escape my throat, my teeth shredding my mouth until it was raw and bleeding.
I shook my head, sweat-soaked hair plastered to my face.
I'd nearly died because of someone else's lie—why shouldn't I press charges?
The current hit again, even stronger this time.
My vision blurred, and my muscles spasmed uncontrollably.
""Ah... ahh...""
A third time. Fourth. Fifth. Tenth.
""Stop... please, stop...""
At last, I broke down, sobbing, tears mixing with the blood and saliva running down my chin.
""Still want to press charges?"" Jeremy's voice came from above me.
Weakly, I lifted my head and saw him standing there, backlit and immaculate in his suit, while I was a wreck—soaked, shaking, utterly humiliated.
Suddenly, I laughed, tears streaming down my cheeks.
""I won't press charges...""
I heard my own voice, eerily calm. ""I won't press charges for anything.""
All I wanted was run.
To get away from Kendra. To leave Jeremy behind.
Jeremy's brow furrowed, as if my surrender unsettled him.
But he quickly slipped back into his usual coldness. ""You'd better mean it.""
He turned and walked away, never noticing the resolve in my eyes.
I wiped my tears and dialed an overseas number.
""I accept your offer. I'll join your studio.
""I'll leave as soon as I get the divorce certificate tomorrow.""
No sooner had I hung up than Jeremy stormed back in, his stare dark and menacing.
""What divorce certificate? Where do you think you're going?""
I quickly ended the call and hid my phone behind my back. ""You heard wrong.""
He narrowed his eyes, stepping closer, ready to press me for answers, when suddenly my phone rang.
A voice blared from the other end of the line.
""Mr. Corwin, Ms. Haskin was so distraught over Mrs. Corwin's false accusations that she jumped from a building to prove her innocence! She's in the ER right now!""
That call wiped away whatever Jeremy had planned to say.
He hung up, shot me a cold glare, and barked at the bodyguards, ""Take her to the hospital!""
I heard Kendra was hemorrhaging badly, and as luck would have it, I shared her blood type.
So Jeremy, ignoring my anemia, asked me to donate blood to her.
He leaned in close, his voice low and cold.
""This is what you owe her. If you agree to give blood, I'll withdraw the divorce petition.""
His breath, tinged with cedar and cold cologne, brushed my ear.
Once, that nearness would have made my heart race.
Now, all I felt was a bone-deep chill.

Chapter 4
When the nurse brought over the blood transfusion consent form, I signed my name without a moment's hesitation.
I knew that if I refused, Jeremy would immediately become suspicious.
I couldn't take that risk, couldn't let him catch even a hint that I was planning to leave.
The oversized needle pierced my vein, making me shiver involuntarily.
As my blood drained away, I grew colder and colder.
The world blurred at the edges. I had no idea how many vials they took, but eventually, I couldn't hold on any longer and slipped into unconsciousness.
When I opened my eyes again, it was already the next morning.
Today, I could finally complete the divorce.
I picked up my phone and booked a flight that would leave in four hours.
I didn't even notice when Jeremy appeared at my side. ""What are you doing?"" he asked.
I quickly locked my phone and brushed him off, ""Nothing.""
He didn't press further. In a rare, almost cheerful tone, he said, ""Since you behaved and donated blood, I'll go with you to withdraw the petition.""
""But,"" he added, his Adam's apple bobbing as his voice hardened, ""if you make another mistake, I'll file for divorce again.""
I didn't answer, just lowered my gaze and smiled faintly.
Jeremy, there won't be a next time for us.
I'm ready to live my own life now.
We rode in silence all the way to the courthouse.
When the car stopped at the entrance, Jeremy's phone suddenly buzzed.
He glanced at the caller ID, and his brow instantly furrowed. ""Kendra? Don't worry, I'm on my way.""
After hanging up, he said matter-of-factly, ""She hit her head when she jumped, and now she's got a headache. I need to go be with her. You go inside and withdraw the petition yourself. Text me when you're done.""
I lowered my eyes, hiding the relief that washed over me. ""Alright.""
Jeremy seemed surprised by how calm I was, but in the end, he said nothing and walked away.
I watched his black car disappear down the road before turning and walking into the courthouse.
The clerk greeted me with a teasing familiarity, ""Ms. Milton, here to withdraw your petition again?""
""No."" I slid my prepared documents across the counter, my voice steadier than I expected. ""This time, I'm filing for divorce.""
Back at the house, I placed Jeremy's copy of the divorce certificate right in the centre of the coffee table, grabbed my suitcase—which I'd packed days ago—and left.
The door closed softly behind me, but the sound felt like scissors, slicing through eight years of tangled history.
At the airport, as I waited to board, I took out my phone, removed the SIM card, and tossed it into the trash.
As the plane lifted off, I took one last look at the city below.
Goodbye, Jeremy.

1mfb3mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1mfb3mf/my_history_before_afib/,My history before AFIB,"Howdy fellow Afibians,


I am a 35yo male who recently had my 4th episode of afib in 7 years. My current lifestyle is much like many other healthy individuals who have been blindsided by Afib. However, I was not always healthy like this, and I’d be interested to hear the stories of anyone else who can relate to my current situation:

Currently, I work out 5 times a week. I am 5’8 and weight 135lbs. I can run a mile in under 6 mins. I eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables and clean proteins. Even though I know coffee is a trigger I have a little cold brew every morning. The last 6 months my sleep has been the only thing that has been suffering a bit.

But I wasn’t always like this, I’ve put my body through some crazy shit. I’m happy to say I’ve been sober from alcohol and any recreational drugs/prescription for about 400 days. This wasn’t because I had afib in the past but a lifestyle choice.
When I was 18 I drank ALOT of energy drinks while working at this golf course. There were a lot of early morning. Around this time I turned 21 and was drinking a fair amount, on weekends mostly but had been experimenting since 16 with alcohol and weed. 

I moved to a big city at 22 and got a good job. Was also playing a lot of shows with my band. Developed a nasty but somehow functional meth habit from 22-26. Still drank heavily through this period. I stopped using meth but at 27 got a prescription for Ritalin as I went back to school and always struggled with ADHD. Started abusing the meds maybe about a couple months in. I was snorting multiple pills a day. Still drinking as well. Then I had my first afib episode one morning after pounding a triple shot of espresso after a sleepless night. I stopped medication for years. Continued to drink and had 2 more episodes. A year ago when I stopped drinking for the first time and using drugs for good I was also popping pills again for about 4 months. Here we are now, completely sober. First time in my life I’ve been sober from everything for this long. Alcohol was probably one of my worst addiction supporters. So yeah, this last episode was surprising given my current lifestyle but maybe it tracks with my years of substance abuse. I strongly believe the Ritalin was a influence. 


TLDR: I used drugs when I was younger

Immerse me in your game,"I don't think I have seen such discourse about a subject in a game in such a long time as to if we should have jars or not. Truthfully it shouldn't just be about jars, if they want to take this game further then let's add more realism. Why am I just limited to having jars? Why cant I find plastic bottles to drink out of? Why cant I find mugs to make a coffee at my campfire? 

I like to think if they want to make this game better and more immersive then add more than one way to store and carry water, Why cant I boil water and have a canteen style thing? Glass jars in the game is the least of their problems. 

I can deal with no jars and their constant fuckery of changing a system the moment we get used to it but make the game immersive, make night feel like night and scary and lonely, let me craft a god damn expandable backpack, let me have access to more than a handful of melee weapons and guns. Let me see overgrown areas that look abandoned and disused. 

If they got fundamental things right for realism with this game it would improve exponentially, I would do anything for this game to feel realistic and like im trying to survive. Add more injuries to the game for example like green hell has. Make night time a time i walk around with my cheeks clenched like dying light did. Add more weapons so we aren't stuck to the same 5 melee and however few guns there are. Maybe im just a dreamer but I feel this game has such potential but its held back by their approach towards it. I am a console player FYI so I cant Add the amazing mods PC players have access to. 

All in all this game feels like an untapped gold mine of potential and unfortunately the devs are trying to dig at it with a plastic spork and they'd rather spend their time telling the fans ""cause you complain we have to delay bandits"" fuck your bandits, make your game fun to play and not a boring, repetitive mind numbing snoozefest.
