Basically, there's a girl that works at the dispensary I frequent and every time I go there, no matter if I use the drive through or walk in or order ahead, she goes out of the way to make sure she is *always* the one who checks me out. We always end up chatting and joking with each other for a bit, she is always giving me free stuff and is VERY heavy on the eye contact. Normally I'd have no issue shooting my shot if I have even the slightest inkling that a girl might be interested  in me, but my two problems here are whether she is actually being flirty with me or I'm looking too much into it, and also if I do decide to ask her if she'd want to maybe get some coffee sometime, it feels wrong to ask her that while she is working, almost like I'm cornering her, and I don't want to put that kind of stress on her. Thoughts, opinions, comments or concerns?

Should also mention, we are about the same age (late 20s), both bigger people, and while I am not certain she is single, she has hinted she is, and I do know she isn't married.

My spontaneous-arousal count (in a lab that doesn't search for RERAs, but they really are RERAs and not spontaneous arousals) during my first sleep study was 313 in 7 hours and a half (44.7 index), and my RERA count in another sleep study (WatchPAT, an at-home one) was 172. I was also found to have complete tongue-base collapse during a DISE last summer. I'm currently sleeping with a custom-made MAD device and a positional belt, which help me feel a little less shitty, but they don't fix my problem (I also tried APAP optimized with OSCAR for a month and a half last year, with EPR = 3, and it did nothing for me). I use Ritalin and a lot of coffee to stay awake. I also underwent bilateral turbinate reduction with the same surgeon who performed my DISE. That surgeon told me to do tongue-focused myofunctional therapy, so I'll have to see if that helps.

I'm a college student and, even though I've had this for years and I've managed to take my life back and push through my degree (although I'll graduate 2 years later than my friends), I've had a rough time getting used to the idea that I just may never find ""the treatment/surgery/cure"" to fix my UARS, but I think it's the right mindset to have after many failed trials. I am relatively disciplined in my studying, or at least I try to be. 

I wanted to ask you guys in similar situations about certain studying strategies and habits that help you push through and maximize your efficiency. ",1,1767183523.0,UARS,1,1.0,False

1q0bn2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1q0bn2r/zosia_playing_5d_chess_spoilers/,“Zosia” Playing 5D Chess [Spoilers(?)],"So I just finished watching the “I love mango ice cream” scene, and came to the subreddit to see if anyone had already discussed my theory. After a skim of a couple queries, I decided to post it myself. 

I think the Zosia we know is simply a manifestation of the Hive’s desire to see the biological imperative through. “Duh, we know this,” you’re probably saying. People have been bringing up Zosia’s head injury. In the same way Helen downloaded in, but passed away, I think Zosia’s body was able to opt into the signal but her memories aren’t there. She’s fully an “NPC” for the Hive. Adaptable. I digress.

Have you considered the whole mango ice cream thing is a lie? That, it isn’t her background at all? Just the framing of the conversation, the way they’ve tried every angle before settling on establishing some hyper realism stepford wives solution via Zosia’s body. Of course, the hive would know Zosia’s true “favorite food” (unless she wasn’t able to be downloaded in), but why share that when you can share a tailored, heartfelt story. 

Plus that story just sounded old, if that makes sense. I can’t confirm past a minor amount of googling, but playing it back makes it sound like the story of a polish youth post WWII. Particularly this era: 

“1989-1993: After World War II, Poland became a Soviet satellite state, the People's Republic of Poland. In 1989, communist rule was overthrown and Poland transitioned to a democratic Third Polish Republic, regaining full sovereignty. The last Soviet (formally Russian) troops did not leave Poland until September 1993.” 
-Google

I’m deriving this from the phrases, “brand new, first voyage,” “…now I know,” “just after the country opened up,” “new flavors of mint, coffee, peach” like cmon now it’s screaming at us. 

This is a fake, semi-grand, semi-pitiful story to sell Carol a false reality and make her feel safe. This is to tie Zosia’s character further in with Chloe’s obviously abusive mother. The therapy talk they pass around in every major dialogue is another huge sign. “All right, all cards on the table”. This is all giving very much narcissist mother, scapegoat daughter. The way Zosia struggles with the “we” thing but not really. I could go on. Just wanted to present this. Their relationship is borderline emotional incest but I’m not gonna go there just yet because I don’t want to scare folks off lmfaooooo. ",0,1767183233.0,pluribustv,2,0.5,False

I’ll start with what we do know. The sea stretches on for miles, and when the cameras show the sun, it glitters a powerful turquoise, the kind you never think you’ll see in real life. It’s not spooky and abandoned with half-rotting houses and boarded-up windows, just a bit tired and rough around the edges. It’s teeming with people, hustling along the narrow streets, popping in and out of shops, impatiently ushering children past the gates like a long-suffering sheepdog rounding up lambs. There’s cars that I recognise, faces that I remember – eventually, they stop feeling like a novelty and just start being friends, y’know? After a long, stressful day, it’s nice to watch Mrs Nelson amble along, carefully selecting the food she needs to feed her family for the week, scrutinising the labels to make sure she’s getting the pasta sauce with the least sugar.

(Hey, I never said my life was interesting. And besides, it’s not like my family cares about what I’m eating).

There’s one I particularly like: a girl that sits on the beach and paints. I don’t know how she does it – she either lives really close by or drags that easel down to the rocky seashore every few days. She looks so thoughtful as she paints, her short, dark hair whipping about her face, framed against the sea that stretches endlessly over the horizon. It doesn’t matter if it’s the dead of winter or blazing hot midsummer, she’s always there at least twice a week. I wish I could see what she’s painting, but the camera angles are all wrong for that. But the cameras aren’t the weird thing about Westbrook.

The weird thing about Westbrook is that missing people show up there.

Let me backtrack and explain a bit so I don’t sound like either a stalker or a total lunatic. I’m part of an online community that watches live camera feeds. Before you think badly of me, our group never watches personal feeds in someone’s home – these are all in public, shared spaces. Think of places like Times Square, or King’s Cross Station. We’ve actually done some good with it before – we caught a store getting robbed from the camera across the road, and since this was a particularly well known, unsecured CCTV camera, we called the police and got the guy caught. That’s not the case with Westbrook.

For a start, we’ve got no clue where Westbrook actually is. A coastal town that uses the English language, and we’ve taken a leap and said it’s probably somewhere in the UK, because some of the shops we can see don’t exist overseas – and believe me, we’ve done our research. The weather changes so often, it’s pretty difficult to pin down what climate it’s in. There’ll be rolling fog for hours, and then the clock will tick forward a minute and it’s blazingly sunny. Snow in August, people sunbathing in November – it’s fucking weird, that’s what it is. And that’s why we watch.

We’re split in half, our little community. There’s about a hundred of us, and I know that no one has bad intentions. For some, they’re just bored, and they leave the cams running in the background while they’re doing the ironing or cooking dinner. There’s some housebound people, confined to chairs or hospital beds because of various disabilities, and this is their chance to see the world when their bodies or minds won’t let them. Lilith says it makes her feel less alone, like she’s sitting in a bustling coffee shop without her agoraphobia getting in the way.

There are a handful of artists that use it for inspiration – sketching, writing, poetry, whatever, and Thursdays are the days they spam the chat with their work, filling in these people’s lives like a paint-by-numbers book. That’s how the people on the feeds get their names, because for some reason, the Westbrook cameras don’t have any sound. They don’t have voices, so we have to give them some, spinning a life of laughter and words and stories out of nothing more than a grainy camera feed and an overactive imagination. Besides, there’s only so many men you can dub “Hat Man,” or “Green Coat Guy,” before it gets confusing, so now we just call him Jeff.

There’s the other half who watch because it’s interesting, and they take it very seriously; I’m one of those. We’re dedicated to solving the mystery of what the hell Westbrook actually is. The name of the town doesn’t appear on any map, and it doesn’t appear to have a newspaper; the only reason we know it’s an English-speaking country is because the signs and brands we can make out are in English, but try zooming in on a licence plate or a letter on someone’s doormat, and you just can’t do it. The zoom won’t go far enough, or the feed fritzes out, an intangible blur that’s like trying to catch smoke, like the town itself is fading in and out.

Once in a while, someone turns up a new one: a dimly lit library that only has romance novels on the shelves, a charity shop that’s always been deserted – you’ll find them on the Dark Web, stray Reddit posts, old blog posts that haven’t been updated since 1994. There’s no pattern, no central site; it just shows up one day and waits until someone finds it. It only lets you see what it wants you to see.

I joined these guys a year ago, desperate to escape the crushing boredom where my life had been put on hold. I don’t remember where I found it – one of the message boards I lurk on, where someone had posted the link to a specific forum for this kind of stuff. Since I had nothing better to do, I clicked it, and here we are. It started as shitposting at first, dicking about on the popular cams like Central London and New York, but then I stumbled upon Westbrook. Hours upon hours of theorising, mystery solving, internet sleuthing; it was fun, a distraction, though I wasn’t certain it was real. I figured it was some roleplaying thing.

Then stuff started to get… odd.

The camera I’d chosen to monitor today was the town park. There were a few kids kicking a football in the background, my mind filling in the banter that they would normally be trading back and forth, yelling names that were getting more and more ridiculous. It was about midday, so you got the usual office workers escaping their magnolia boxes for lunch, but they’d never actually ate anything. Sure, they’d buy stuff in the shops (like Mrs Nelson and her pasta) but they’d never touch it, just put it in front of them and leave it there, still in the wrapper, like they’d only been given half the script and didn’t know how to do the rest.

There were lots of things like that in Westbrook,like how their lights were always on, day or night. Only two types of cars drove through town: Aston Martins (that PinkSpark on the forums insisted were the 1963 models) and crappy Volvos that looked like they came off the local estate. Kids were never in school. On Thursdays at noon, the camera facing a suburban alleyway would turn on, just like clockwork, and blink off ten minutes later.

Today, there was an unfamiliar woman sitting on a bench, holding a book in her hands though never turning a page.

Her name was Harriet Morden, age 34, and she’d been missing for the last eighteen months. I knew this because the one thing my mother had been, before all of this, was a true crime junkie. She used to watch all those late-night specials you get on TV and one night I joined her. The program was going over a recent missing persons case. Harriet Morden had upped and disappeared a year and a half ago, and had only been reported missing after she’d failed to pick up her four-year-old daughter from nursery that evening. I hadn’t given her a second thought, and now here she was, on a grainy camera feed in Westbrook, smiling vacantly and staring into space, the book forever still and silent in her hands.

That’s the last time I can remember feeling safe and whole. It was the last time I remember Lee being tangible and real, where I could just walk upstairs and there he’d be, snoring like an idiot and I’d have to thump the wall that connected our bedrooms so he’d shut up.

A few months after that, everything fell apart. I’d never made the connection until now, so I suppose I have Harriet Morden to thank for that.

So yes, I noticed. But I’m ashamed to say I didn’t do anything. I let the minutes tick past as Harriet stayed frozen in her position, smiling and pretending to read. I shakily took a few screenshots, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off her, just in case she flickered out of existence again. Her daughter would be about six now. Would she even still remember her mother? Or had someone told her that Mummy was dead, when I could see her, alive and well in Westbrook?

I didn’t know what to do. I still don’t. Judge me if you like, I don’t care. But I stayed there until Harriet closed her book and walked out of view, out of the park and back towards the main street. I flipped to a couple of the other cameras, but by the time the page loaded, she was gone, swallowed up into the town, flesh and blood warped into stone and mortar. My hands were shaking as I opened another tab, searched her name and pulled up a news article, comparing my screenshots side by side. It was definitely the same woman, in the exact same clothes she’d disappeared in, sitting on a bench in a little park on the edge of the world.

What the hell do you do in that situation? If anyone can give me an answer, I’d love to hear it, and don’t say “Just go to the police, Alex!” because if I’d rocked up there with a few fuzzy screenshots and Harriet’s name, I’d be locked up in a police cell, a psychiatric ward, or both. Let me remind you, we have no idea where Westbrook is. Hell, our creative writing thread came up with the name just so we’d have something to call it – the camera feed page is just a preview window with no name or anything to click.

There’s one thing I did do, though; I clicked into the “Mysteries of Westbrook,” forum, and shoved the screenshots into a new thread called “New lady in town, any thoughts?” There wasn’t a huge lot of interest, because Westbrook got loads of new people showing up and leaving all the time, but it did introduce me to Danni.

Danni, aka Thimrekal, had been active on the boards for at least four years, and posted often enough that I recognised her name. She vaguely recognised Harriet from somewhere, and so we got talking. We became fast friends after that, mapping out how far Harriet could have gotten from her hometown without a car, whether her marriage was in trouble, why on earth she’d just leave her kid behind. She didn’t know Alex but she did know Sederith, which was the me that was cool and suave and knew all the right things to say, not the pudgy kid with glasses who came back to an empty house every night because his mum didn’t get home until 3am. The fluorescent lights of the office were more appealing than that of our cosy living room that was always one person too small.

It moved from trading theories to trading, well… anything. TV shows, anime, hell, even tossing stupid memes back and forth to get a laugh. We didn’t bother with the threads anymore, just keeping a permanent chat box open, and it was nice, y’know? Like having a real friend to talk to, one who didn’t know about Dad or Lee or anything else shitty that was going on in my life. No pitying looks or hushed whispers of “Poor boy, he must be struggling with everything going on.”

I still hate that. Being a Poor Thing™. Just because my life has turned into something royally fucked up doesn’t mean I’m not a person anymore. You ever tried talking to a counsellor who has no goddamn idea what to say to you? Or have a whole classroom refuse to look you in the eye?

So yeah, not really any friends or anyone else I could talk to, and that chat box was the closest thing I had. And that’s the way I thought it was going to stay. So last week, I was walking my usual route home from school, and I saw a cute dog outside the corner shop. I took a photo, sent it to her, something stupid like “Super rare doggo, 13/10.” Didn’t really think about it. I got a response about two minutes later, and it was nothing like what I expected.

“I need to talk to you. Please. It’s urgent.”

“Sure. Fire away,” I typed back, and was startled when I got a fervent “NO,” back in return. “I need to talk out loud. To a friend. Please. I’m begging you.”

And you can’t just turn down that kind of request, can you? So that’s how, fifteen minutes later, I found myself sat in my room with the door locked (not that either of my parents were home anyway) face to face (screen to screen?) with Thimrekal. Aka Danni Price. Aka a tall blonde girl with her hair scraped up into a messy, frantic bun; big, round glasses, and brown eyes that were currently swollen a blotchy red and filled with tears that were steadily trickling down her face.

‘Sed?’

‘Uh, yeah. Hi. You can call me Alex, though, if you want. I know Sederith’s a bit of a mouthful.’

She choked out a laugh, the tears clogging her throat setting off a coughing fit. ‘Right. Then I’m – I’m Danni. Not Danielle or Daniella, just Danni. Useless fucking Danni.’

‘Whoa, whoa. You’re not useless,’ I protested, because as weird as this was, she was still my only friend. ‘ I know I probably can’t do a lot, not from here but… tell me what’s wrong.’

Looking back at it now, I knew it was selfish. I was repeating everything I wished I had the chance to say to Lee, because that’s the kind of stuff that kept me up at night. Had he been hurting like this and I just hadn’t noticed, while he was in the room next to me every night? Could I have done something to help, even if I was just his dumbass kid brother? I’d never know now. But maybe this was the universe giving me a second chance.

A screenshot appeared in the chat box, and I opened it up. It was a little better quality than mine, and it was enough to be able to clearly make out the person’s face. A blonde woman sitting in a café, a mug in front of her that I knew by now was certain to be empty, staring out the window at the lifeless promenade. The only remotely interesting thing about her was that her clothes looked totally out of place for the snowy day outside. She was sitting there in a pair of heels and a short black dress, with no jacket or anything to fight back against the bitter cold. She was okay looking. Pretty enough. but there was something about her that was oddly familiar.

‘Isn’t this the new one the writing chat is getting excited about?’ I asked, flipping back through the pages of my memories until something stuck. ‘Showed up this morning?’

Danni nodded, shoving her hair back with a nervous hand.

‘So what’s the big deal about her? Did something happen?’

She sniffed, scrubbing her hand across her face, before motioning for me to wait and turning away from the camera. Impatient, I slouched down in my seat until she came back into view, clutching something in white-knuckled hands, and held it up for me to see.

It was a family photo in a wooden frame. A man in his early forties, short auburn hair starting to grey, and a woman about the same age who was the spitting image of Danni. Danni herself was standing in front of the pair, and next to her was an older girl, in her early twenties as opposed to Danni’s mid-teens, with braided blonde hair and a wide smile. I glanced back at the screenshot, connecting the dots.

Oh.

‘Her name is Maxine.’ Danni’s soft voice broke through my reverie, the picture frame starting to shake as she lowered it out of view, her dark eyes wide behind the glass. ‘She’s–she’s my big sister.’

‘And what the hell is your big sister doing in Westbrook?’

That was me just playing my part, rattling off the script like a good little actor, in the vague hope that I would be wrong, that it really was just a game, that maybe her sister had died or something and Danni was grieving. It was all getting too much, all this hope, all these maybes, all this downright weird shit. I just wanted an escape, that was all. Away from broken fathers and workaholic mothers and a Lee-shaped hole in the house.

But reality is what it is. There’s no escaping it. You just might be able to bend the rules a little.

Danni was still watching me.

‘I don’t know,’ she said quietly. ‘She’s been missing for six months. Went to a birthday party one Friday night, and never came home. She got out of the taxi her friends were sharing, and between the top of our road and our house, she vanished.’

‘And she’s wound up in Westbrook?’

‘I have no idea. The police just thought she disappeared into thin air; they searched everywhere along that stretch of road.’ She took her glasses off, wiping them on her sleeve. ‘And there’s no CCTV, no nothing. It was a thirty second walk, and either someone took her, or… I don’t know. Westbrook got her. Somehow.’

‘What are you going to do?’

‘Keep tracking her. Keep looking. We’ve got a whole load of people working on coordinates, somebody must be able to work out where it is. But at least – at least I know she’s alive. My parents have practically given up looking, said she must have just run off with some guy and just doesn’t want to come home, but Maxine would never do that!’ Her voice was rapidly growing louder, the barely constrained wail raising into a crescendo. ‘She promised that we’d leave together, you know? She wouldn’t just abandon me. I know she wouldn’t-‘

Danni froze as a door slammed in the background, a man’s voice roaring her name, bouncing through the house and hurtling into her room. His tone sent a sick chill down my spine, and I barely had the chance to speak before Danni whispered a hasty ‘Got to go,’ and closed the window, leaving with nothing but Maxine’s pixelated face, smiling vacantly at me on the desktop.

What was I supposed to do? This was Harriet all over again. I should probably tell an adult, but on reflection, most of the adults in my life were fucking useless – what was my mother going to do, business forecast the kidnappers until they confessed out of sheer boredom? And Dad? Might as well just forget about him. Last I heard he was on some trip to Bali, finding himself and meditating under waterfalls, probably in bed with a different woman every night and doing his best to replace the son he’d lost.

So I did what I always did – pushed it away and tried to forget. Spent most of the evening staring at the Westbrook cams, waiting for something interesting to happen, waiting for the chime from Discord to inform me that Danni had come back online. Everyone was always leaving, it felt like.

The skies gradually grew dark, and instead of people muffled up in winter wear, they were now walking around in shorts and t-shirts, which to be honest was the least of Westbrook’s weird shit. I haven’t told you about the sky turning every colour of the rainbow, the birds flying backwards, or the animals that would just pop into view out of nowhere, standing stock still for hours before disappearing again. That had become an everyday occurrence, which led to multiple posts of “Fox Watching” all over the boards. I liked to watch the beach, sometimes, just to sit and look at the silent waves rolling in and out, foamy fingers combing through the gritty hair of the seabed, pulsing and constant. Kind of meditative, to tell you the truth. Hell, maybe I could understand what Dad saw in all those waterfalls.

The clock ticked over a minute. The waves crashed onto the beach, over and over, washing the slate clean. The camera flickered, just for a second; again, nothing unusual. We had a running joke that it was aliens.

And that’s when Lee appeared, standing ankle deep in the surf, staring straight at the camera like he knew I was there.

I started so violently I actually fell out of my chair like it was a fucking cartoon, sending my glasses skittering across the floor and into the skirting board. My head rang from the impact, and I scrabbled to my feet, lumbering over to my glasses and shoving them back onto my face. I crashed back into my seat to stare at the screen again, praying simultaneously that I had and hadn’t just seen what I’d thought I had.

My brother was still there in the waves, looking up at the camera with a faint smile on his face, raising one hand in greeting. He looked… normal. No wounds, not like he’d been living rough, just the stubbly beard he’d always had, and the weirdest thing was, he was in his work uniform, the exact same one he’d been wearing the last time I’d seen him. No way would he ever put the damn thing on again if he had a choice – he hated that stupid polo shirt and the uncomfortable trousers.

He looked the exact same as he did a year ago when he walked out the door and never came home. No one tells you that after a month or two, the police pretty much give up. Who really cares about the son of your average lower middle class family, right? If we were rich, maybe, but no one seemed to give a shit about the guy who went missing from a small town an hour south of London in a supermarket uniform and only a tenner in cash. No one cared to look properly, to really, truly look. Danni had said it best – the cops had just thought he’d run away, had his head turned by some pretty girl and was now living in some bedsit in Shoreditch. somewhere in the back of my head, I expect I had too.

Now I knew better.

His face brightened as he somehow saw me at the screen again, and he said something. Two syllables, and I knew that he was saying my name, trying to let me know he was okay, but goddammit, that wasn’t good enough! A year. A whole fucking year of worrying and stressing and crying myself sick when no one was looking. Just seeing him on camera was nowhere near good enough.

I couldn’t help it. I lost it.

‘LEE! What the-where are you, Lee- ‘

I flailed around for something to hit, like I could will my incorporeal brother back into existence in my dingy bedroom, slam my fists against his chest to make him realise just how much he’d hurt us, ripped a hole in the flimsy sham that was our family, like a house that had collapsed in on itself because you’d demolished one of the support beams. Lee was the one who made us laugh, quick with some stupid comment that hit the mark, a well-timed joke to break the tension. Without him, the world had just faded into grey, because no one could ever make Dad laugh like Lee could.

He’d never broken eye contact the whole time, even through the blurry fog of the tears that had started to pool behind my glasses. He looked calm, peaceful, a smile dancing around his lips like all big brothers have when they’ve got a secret they aren’t telling.

He mouthed something else, too quick for me to catch, and I shook my head.

‘I can’t-I can’t hear you, Lee, what do you want me to- ‘

A chat box flashed up in my line of vision, just to the left of the screen, but I didn’t move, didn’t want to take my eyes off Lee in case he faded like a mirage.

‘I don’t understand-tell me, okay, just tell me!’

The chat box flashed again, and Lee raised his arm and pointed, so my eyes followed, tracking the wind and waves until I finally came to rest on the message box.

It wasn’t much. Just “Find me,” followed by a string of numbers.

I stared at them, thoughts moving at light speed, before turning back at the grey beach. Lee was gone. The chat box stayed though, thank God, and it was only then I realised what the numbers were.

Co-ordinates.

He’d been 26 when he vanished last year. Had been saving like mad to buy his own place so he’d been working every extra shift he could get at work, even volunteering to do the late ones because you got a slight bump in pay. We were all so used to him going in and out at all hours of the night, no one noticed until about three in the afternoon that he wasn’t in his room. All his work mates had said they’d seen him leave and he was acting normal as ever. One of them had spotted him not ten minutes from home and stopped him to have a chat. But somehow, he’d never made it back. I was half starting to believe that he’d just got sick of us and upped and left, because that was easier than imagining something like this.

That night, I posted a quick update on the boards, telling them where I was going and what I was doing, because you can’t be too careful, right? It was simple enough.

“New guy. Mid-20s. He’s my brother, and I’m going to rescue him.”

1q0bjox,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1q0bjox/my_son_asked_me_to_stop_being_his_father_and_i/,My son asked me to stop being his father. And I agreed,"This happened in the early 2000s. I make a point of placing it in time because that completely changes how it should be read. Back then, I earned about 20,000 dollars a month. By Brazilian standards at the time, that was a huge salary. I worked a lot, lived tired, often got home late at night, and still believed I was doing the right thing.

When I separated from my son’s mother, custody stayed with her. Child support was set, but I paid 10,000 dollars a month because I wanted to, not because anyone forced me to. The judge was surprised by the amount and asked twice if I was sure. I was. I believed my son should have comfort. I never paid late, never complained, never used it as leverage. Half of what I earned went to that household, and I adjusted my life around that.

Beyond the money, I was present. I picked my son up. We went out together. I took him fishing. We woke up early, stopped at a roadside bakery, I drank black coffee, he chose a soda. At home, we played video games together—PS1, Nintendo 64, later PS2. Entire afternoons playing, arguing over the controller, laughing. Sometimes he fell asleep on the couch with the controller in his hand. To me, that was being a father.

For a long time, I thought everything was fine.

Then his mother began a relationship with another man, who became his stepfather. At first, things stayed normal. Over time, my son began to change. He came back from visits different, quieter, responding less. Small things, but constant.

He started repeating things that didn’t come from him. That I wasn’t a good man. That I was a bad father. That the stepfather was a real man. He didn’t say it angrily; he said it like someone repeating something he had heard many times.

That narrative was constant inside their house. His mother and stepfather shaped how my son saw the world and how he saw me. The stepfather had agency over how my son’s life should be because he directly influenced the mother, and the mother decided everything. I began to realize that my presence was being tolerated, not desired.

When my son was 11, his mother asked to talk. She said it was something serious. I remember sitting in the car for a few minutes before going up, taking deep breaths. That was when I heard that my son no longer wanted my last name.

Shortly after, I heard it from his own mouth.

He said he no longer wanted me to be his father. He said he didn’t feel like my son. He said he felt more like the stepfather’s son. He said he was ashamed of my name. He said I was a bad father. He spoke while looking down, fidgeting with his fingers, but without hesitation.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t yell. I didn’t try to convince him. It gave me a tightness in my stomach, a physical sensation, as if the air had become heavy. I thought about arguing, about listing everything I did, but I understood that it wouldn’t matter. I forced myself to respect what was being said.

When adoption was mentioned, I agreed.

The process was slow, bureaucratic, exhausting. Crowded courthouses, paperwork, lines. I signed my name more times than I can remember. There was a hearing in which a clerk called my son by his old last name, and his mother corrected it immediately, even before any final decision. That stayed with me.

Psychologists, social workers, hearings. They asked him if he wanted it. He confirmed. He confirmed that he wanted to be adopted by the stepfather and that he no longer wanted me to be his father. The mother confirmed. The stepfather confirmed. I signed.

From that moment on, I ceased to be a father in the eyes of the law.

My name was removed from the record. Child support ended. The 10,000 dollars a month stopped existing. The following month, I looked at my bank statement and felt a strange emptiness, not relief.

After that, problems began on their side.

Without the child support money, the lifestyle couldn’t be sustained. Trips ended. Bills started falling behind. Credit cards were maxed out. Before long, constant arguments began inside their house. I heard through others that the mother openly complained about the adoption, saying she hadn’t imagined I would actually stop paying, that she thought it would be only “on paper.” On more than one occasion, she made it clear that she regretted losing the child support.

During that period, my son tried to call a few times. The calls went straight to voicemail. I didn’t answer, but I listened to the messages. There was one where I picked up the phone and almost called back, but stopped.

In the first message, he was crying. Crying, apologizing, saying he had said things he didn’t really understand.

In the second, he talked about what had happened at school. He mentioned a fight with a classmate. He said they told him that I didn’t want him anymore, that I had abandoned him. His voice broke in the middle of sentences.

In the third, he said the atmosphere at home was heavy. That tensions were high. That the stepfather had argued with him. He didn’t go into details, but you could hear fear in his voice. After that, I stayed awake all night.

I listened to all of those messages.

I didn’t respond to any of them.

Some time later, the school called me.

The mother had forgotten to update the contact information. My name and number were still listed as the responsible contact. They tried to reach her, but she didn’t answer. The stepfather wasn’t registered. The only available contact was me.

When I arrived at the school, my hands were sweating. I saw my son sitting in the coordinator’s office. Part of his face was swollen. That tied a knot in my chest that took time to hide.

The coordinator explained what had happened. She said the other student had been provoking my son for days. That morning, it had crossed the line. She said the boy repeatedly told my son that he had been abandoned by his own father, that I had discarded him like trash because of the change of last name.

My son couldn’t take it and attacked him.

Both were suspended.

When he saw me there, he was surprised. His look made it clear that he hadn’t expected me to show up.

After the conversation, I took him to my apartment. The drive was silent. He tried to apologize again. He said he hadn’t understood that it wouldn’t be reversible. He asked if it could be fixed, if it could be undone.

I explained that adoption isn’t symbolic. That when the process is finished, there’s no going back. I said that now the ones who decided his future were his mother and stepfather.

I told him something no one had ever explained to him. I said that the trips, the comfort, and the lifestyle came from the child support money. That half of what I earned, at a time when that salary was something out of this world, went to that household. That it was easy to call me a bad father while living off my money.

I said that he had learned that biological parents can be terrible people. I said that my own father and mother didn’t like me. That even so, he had been lucky. Because one of his biological parents loved him. And he chose to discard that parent.

He cried. I told him to stop. I said that now it was about moving forward. That some choices have consequences that can’t be undone later.

I took him back home the same day. I felt bad for days afterward, but I moved on. I had no further contact, even when my son tried to reach me.

Years later, I learned that he got involved with drugs and tried to take his own life. Recently, I learned that he died two years ago from cancer. Life in addiction weakened him.

When I found out, I didn’t feel anger or relief. Just an enormous emptiness. The feeling that teaching a child to reject someone who loves them creates a hole that no one can fill afterward. It’s a shame. I hope my son’s soul is saved.

For fun, I also threw together a quick Python script to scan through a huge chunk of posts on here and surface the most frequently mentioned, actually successful ideas. After cleaning it up a bit, this is what consistently rose to the top:

1. Online Surveys: Tons of market research companies will pay for your opinions through online surveys you can do from your couch. It’s not going to replace a job, but filling out surveys during downtime can bring in small amounts of extra cash or gift cards. To start, make accounts on a few legit survey sites so they can send you questionnaires that fit your profile. There are plenty of reputable platforms that are free to join and regularly send out paid surveys.
2. Microtasking (Crowdsourced Tasks): Microtask sites host lots of bite-sized online jobs that anyone can do for pay—things like tagging images, checking data for errors, or doing short moderation tasks. You get paid per task, and you don’t need previous experience. Getting rolling is literally just signing up on a microtask platform and choosing from the task list. Popular options include Amazon Mechanical Turk and Clickworker, where you can jump in and complete quick tasks whenever you have spare time.
3. Website and App Testing: Companies will pay normal users to poke around their websites or apps and share honest feedback on what’s confusing or broken. You basically click through, test features, and talk through your thoughts while recording your screen and audio. To get started, register on usability testing sites (like UserTesting or uTest), then complete a sample test with a mic and your computer. Most short tests pay a flat rate (often around $10 for 15–20 minutes, with longer ones paying more), and you can accept them whenever they fit into your schedule.
4. Freelance Writing: If you can put together a clear, decent paragraph, freelance writing can be a very accessible side gig that doesn’t cost anything to start. Online businesses and blogs always need written stuff—articles, product descriptions, newsletters, etc. Put together a couple of writing samples (even posts on your own blog or Medium count) and then set up a profile on freelance marketplaces. Sites like Upwork and Fiverr let you pitch for writing jobs and connect with clients who pay by the article or project.
5. Virtual Assistant: A lot of solo founders and small businesses want remote help with everyday admin, which is why virtual assistant work is so common. Tasks can include managing inboxes, setting appointments, updating spreadsheets, or posting on social media. Think about what you’re already good at (organization, clear emails, basic Excel/Google Sheets) and highlight that in your profile on freelancing sites. You can find VA work through Upwork, here on Reddit, or by searching “remote virtual assistant” on regular job boards (Indeed, etc.). You can usually stack a couple of clients around your main job.
6. Data Entry: Data entry is one of the more straightforward online jobs that’s in big demand right now. It’s mostly typing information into spreadsheets or databases, or copying text from PDFs into a cleaner format. You don’t need special training, just decent typing skills and attention to detail. Look for data entry listings on freelance platforms or sign up for microtask sites that include this type of work. For example, you might land longer part-time projects on Upwork, or take on smaller one-off data tasks through Amazon MTurk or Clickworker.
7. Transcription and Captioning: Transcription means listening to audio (interviews, meetings, podcasts, videos) and typing out what’s being said. If you’re a solid typist and can focus on audio without zoning out, it’s a legit at-home side hustle. Most transcription sites will ask you to do a quick test so they can check your accuracy and grammar. Once you’re in, you pick audio files to transcribe whenever you’ve got time. Beginner-friendly options include Rev or TranscribeMe, which pay per audio minute or per project.
8. Online Tutoring: If you’re strong in a school subject or comfortable teaching English or another language, online tutoring lets you get paid to help students from home. Everyone from middle schoolers to adults needs help with math, science, languages, test prep, etc. Step one is deciding which subjects you’re confident in; then apply to tutoring platforms, where you’ll usually fill out an application and maybe do a short quiz or demo lesson. TutorMe, Chegg Tutors, Wyzant, etc., match tutors with students, and there are also platforms focused on English conversation (like VIPKid for kids overseas, though they have specific requirements). You set your availability and get paid per session over video chat.
9. Remote Customer Service Representative: A lot of companies hire remote, part-time support reps to deal with customer questions and basic issues, and many of those roles don’t require much beyond clear communication and a decent internet connection. You’ll usually be answering calls, responding to emails, or handling chat support. Employers typically provide training on their tools and products. To find these, search for titles like “remote customer service” or “work from home call center” on job boards. Sites like Indeed or FlexJobs often have entry-level postings where you can apply directly and then work set or semi-flexible shifts from home.
10. Search Engine Evaluator (Web Rater): Search engine evaluators help companies refine their search algorithms by rating how relevant and helpful search results or ads are. You get a query, a page of results or a feed, plus detailed guidelines, and you score how well everything matches up. No formal background needed—just being comfortable online and willing to read through the instructions. You usually have to pass a qualification exam first. Companies like Appen and TELUS International frequently contract remote raters for this type of work. The pay is often in the mid-teens per hour and the schedule is pretty flexible as long as you hit their minimum hours.

On top of all that, I personally also mess around with Mistplay on my phone when I’m totally brain-dead—playing random mobile games there racks up points that I redeem for small gift cards (usually Amazon), which I just treat as bonus coffee money rather than a real side hustle.

At first and she was super supportive, but today it got weird. We were getting a coffee and she started asking what kind of girls I liked. I explained and she was like...confused? She went on to explain that I don't present as a lesbian and that she doesn't understand why I would want to date a woman that looks like a man. Which, at that point I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I can understand how a femme/masc relationship might be confusing to the outside population...like it's a stretch but I'm trying to be the bigger person and educate. I'm also black so education comes with the territory (that being said, she is also a POC). 

Then she comes out with it: she's confused because I'm not attracted to her. She starts asking what she could change, what is it about her that I'm not attracted to? She tries telling me she could wear boy clothes or boxer briefs??

I'm the one now confused...for obvious reasons. I explain to her I have a girlfriend and I can see that she is, for lack of a better word, disappointed? Not that I am not available, but that I'm attracted to someone that she believes she's more attractive than. 

She woman counts calories, lives at the gym, has men constantly asking her out, is in the latest fashion, straightens her hair every single morning and always has a designer outfit paired with perfect make up. I try to explain to her that all those aspects...are why I don't find her attractive. That non of that is appealing to me. She tries to switch it up and tells me about how at home she's very casual. I'm still confused. 

Mind you, this woman is married and I don't know what she told her husband but apparently he was concerned I would put the moves on his wife.

Sir, no thank you and absolutely fucking not. I got home and promptly muted our online conversation.

He had become a daily visitor before I started working there. He was very flirtatious and charming towards me and at first I reciprocated with playfulness. Eventually I started noticing how he’d stare at me from the waiting line and when I’d catch him staring he would hold my gaze. He started acting very kind and gentle and significantly dropped the charmer act.
After a while I started catching feelings for him. At first I panicked because I get terrified when I catch feelings but then I accepted them. I noticed how we both started beaming and softening at the sight of each other. It became very clear that we both caught feelings. Suddenly he stopped showing up for half a year. He had never asked my name or number of anything personal about me. I started feeling dumb for catching feelings and didn’t expect him to return.He returns after half a year and softened at the sight of me the way he used to before he left but this time I didn’t reciprocate. When I saw him enter I was very neutral and calm, not even surprised he was back. He noticed that immediately and couldn’t meet my eyes when he greeted me. As I was doing his order we were both quiet . The friend he was there with suddenly made a compliment about how amazing the people that work in this place are while looking at me and he himself then switched to flirtatious mode again, agreed with his friend and held eye contact w me. I showed no reaction to his flirtatious attempts and as he was mixing his coffee he kept stealing repeated glances towards me but I refused to look at him. He showed up another time alone and my shift was just over and as I exchanged my shift w my coworker I simply went to take my stuff and leave without greeting or looking at him. 
He completely stopped showing up after that. 
It’s 1.5 years since and yesterday I ran into him on the street. I kept looking at him thinking we were gonna greet each other. He only held his gaze down at the ground never looked up for a single second even as we walked very close past each other. 2 months later I ran into him again and he again acted the same way.

 Gone but not Forgotten. 

“Good morning, baby,” I said softly. “We’re going for a ride today. Time to wake up.”

I made her coffee and breakfast in bed—buckwheat waffles with a hint of peanut butter, topped with homemade whipped cream infused with chocolate and almond. I separated Loganberries, one by one, and sprinkled the bright little jewels across her plate. She smiled that sleepy smile that always made me forget how tired I was.

We left the house around ten, both of us restless and ready. I had a plan—she didn’t know it yet.

We headed south on I-5, the wind cool and sharp against our jackets. We crossed the bridge into Oregon, rode toward Tillamook, and stopped for lunch in a little café in Astoria. We talked about nothing and everything, like we always did. She laughed, eyes bright, hair wild from the wind.

By three, we made it to Tillamook. She’d never been to the cheese factory before, and she loved it—the smell of the vats, the sight of the 30-pound blocks moving along the line. We wandered, took pictures, bought ice cream, and sat on the curb outside like two kids with nowhere else to be.

Then I glanced at my watch. 5:00 p.m. Time to move.

We rode the coast down to Depoe Bay, reaching it at 6:41. Eleven minutes to spare. I parked facing the ocean, the same stone guardrail I’d leaned against as a kid. The sun was just beginning its slow dive into the water.

My hands were shaking. The GoPro was running. She still had no idea.

We stood together watching the sky catch fire—gold bleeding into orange, orange into red. When the sun hit halfway below the horizon, I turned to her. For a second, I forgot how to breathe.

Then I dropped to one knee.

She looked confused at first, then it clicked. Her eyes widened, and I found my voice.

“Natasha,” I said, “I’d be honored if I could call you my wife. Will you marry me?”

Tears welled in her eyes. She smiled—the kind of smile that stays with you long after it’s gone—and lifted me by the chin.

“Yes,” she whispered, and kissed me.

We held each other as the sun finished its fall. The world went quiet except for the sound of the waves. And in that moment, everything—every mile, every mistake, every prayer—had led right there.",1,1767182337.0,grief,1,1.0,False

2. Because after sexting he told me he wanted to take a dump. 

3. Because he shared his birthday with my dad and had a similar spectacle frame as my dad too. 

4. Because I sprained my ankle and he was calling me while I was in pain. (He didn’t know, and he apologized for disturbing me later. But I started associating his phone calls with the pain in my ankle.)

5. I was sleep-deprived because of a deadline at work once. He started mansplaining about the harmful effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 

6. He told me he didn’t know how to swim or drive.

7. He only had one close friend and no hobbies. 

8. He kept referring to COVID as CONVID. (COVID era had a lot of these random rejections. I guess I was just talking to guys for a dopamine chase and was bored and stir-crazy while sitting at home.) 

9. His twin brother’s then-girlfriend (now-wife) was too pretty, and I was insecure. 

10. (This one’s by my sister, not me) Because he got sick and vomited on her desk just before a final exam. 

11. (This one’s by my bestie, not me) Because he neglected to open the door for her while she had a coffee mug in one hand and her clutch in the other. 

12. (Another one by bestie) Because his uncle had been her patient once, and his aunt and cousins etc. seemed too argumentative at her hospital.

We asked my MIL to stop by once to feed the cat. That was it. Feed cat. Leave. Simple, right?

We get home last night and immediately notice *something is off*. The cat is fine. But the house smells like vinegar and cinnamon. Weird combo.

Turns out MIL decided to “help” while we were gone.

Here’s what she did:

* Reorganized every kitchen cabinet based on “what makes sense to her”
* Threw out spices that were “expired” (including ones we bought last month)
* Replaced our dish soap with her preferred brand because “yours is full of chemicals”
* Left a handwritten note explaining how she improved the flow of the kitchen
* Washed and *rearranged* our underwear because she “had extra time”

I’m not exaggerating when I say I can’t find anything. Plates are where the baking sheets used to be. Coffee mugs are split between three cabinets. The cat food is now in a decorative jar labeled “Fur Baby Fuel.”

When my spouse called her, she was genuinely confused about why we weren’t grateful. She said, “I treated your home like my own.”

That sentence has been echoing in my head ever since.

My spouse is annoyed but thinks it’s not worth a fight. I, on the other hand, feel like someone crawled inside my life and rearranged it while smiling.

It started in a crowded bookstore in Pune about three years ago. She was reaching for a technical manual on the top shelf, and I happened to be standing right there. We didn’t have a cinematic ""meet-cute""—just a brief conversation about the book that spilled over into a quick tea at a nearby stall. She was sharp, grounded, and had a way of looking at you that made you feel like you were the only person in the room.

We didn’t rush. For the first few months, we were just two people who liked each other’s company. She was an architect, always sketching in the margins of her notebooks. I was focused on my career, my gym routine, and my weekend treks. Our relationship grew in the quiet spaces: late-night drives through the empty Sahyadri hills, sharing Maggi at 2 AM, and learning each other’s coffee orders by heart.

There was a rhythm to us. No grand gestures, just the comfort of knowing she was there. We spent weekends visiting old forts or just sitting in silence at a library. We learned the architecture of each other's lives—her fear of failure, my stubbornness, our shared love for old indie music.

By the second year, it felt permanent. I took her to my sister’s wedding in Jaipur. She wore a saree for the first time, looking slightly out of place but laughing through the chaos of my extended family. Seeing her navigate the noise and the relatives with such grace made something click. I realized I didn't want to navigate the rest of my life without that specific kind of calm.

I started planning. I took on extra freelance projects and stopped ordering in. Every bit of savings went into a small, velvet-lined box. It wasn't about the rock; it was about the promise.

I chose a weekend in Mahabaleshwar. The monsoon was just ending, leaving the hills draped in thick, white mist and the scent of damp earth. We stayed at a small heritage cottage. She seemed a bit distant, her phone buzzing more than usual, but I figured it was just the stress of her latest project.

On the second evening, we walked to a secluded point overlooking the valley. The fog was rolling in, turning the world into a soft, grey blur. It felt like we were the only two people left on earth.

I took a deep breath, knelt on the damp grass, and asked the question.

The silence that followed wasn't peaceful. It was heavy. She didn’t cry. She didn't look shocked. She just looked tired.

She said she couldn't.

She told me that her firm had finally approved her transfer to their London headquarters—a goal she’d been working toward since before we met. She’d received the confirmation a month ago but hadn't found the ""right time"" to break the news. She wasn't just leaving for a project; she was moving permanently. She didn't want a long-distance marriage, and she knew I wasn't ready to leave my life here behind.

She told me she loved me, but she loved the person she was becoming in that career more. She said that saying ""yes"" would eventually turn into resentment, and she respected me too much for that.

The drive back to Pune was the longest four hours of my life. We didn't argue. We just talked about the logistics of the breakup like it was a business merger. It was the most heartbreakingly civil thing I’ve ever experienced.

I returned the ring the next Tuesday. The jeweler was sympathetic, though I didn't tell him the story. With that money, I booked a ticket to Vietnam—a place she had always wanted to go, but I went alone.

I’m sitting in a small cafe in Hanoi now, watching the motorbikes swarm through the streets like a school of fish. I’m drinking egg coffee, something she would have hated.

The ""no"" didn't break me, though it felt like it would for a while. It just redefined the boundaries of my life. I learned that you can do everything right and still have the story end differently than you planned.

**How do you start again?**

You start by realizing that the ""no"" wasn't a rejection of your worth, but a clarification of your path. You start by taking the energy you were pouring into a ""we"" and redirecting it back into ""me."" You travel, you eat new things, you sit in the silence until it doesn't feel lonely anymore—it just feels like space for whatever comes next.",1,1767181728.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

So this year my coffee game got a little out of hand… in a good way! I ended up with a mix of beans from all over. Ordered some from Dak Coffee Roasters in Amsterdam, got some Thai single-origin beans from a friend who visited Thailand,some local roasters gifted me bags and couple of steeped bag boxes from relatives, from two different roasters.

The problem? I don’t drink that much coffee maybe 250g a month, 500g at most – but somehow I’ve ended up with around 2kg of coffee.

I’ve frozen beans before, and I know that works, but I’m curious if anyone has other tips or strategies for storing coffee long-term without sacrificing flavor. Does anyone have experience with separating beans into smaller batches, vacuum sealing, or other methods to make sure the coffee stays fresh for months?

Would love to hear your strategies!

__________________ 
PARTIAL CLOSURE OF THE T2 TRAM LINE STARTING DECEMBER 31. 

During the night between December 30 and December 31, a fire broke out under one of the bridges crossed by the T2 tram line, which connects the airport with the city center (and vice versa).  

To assess the damage and carry out structural safety checks, tram service has been suspended in the area of the bridge. A shuttle bus service has been put in place to maintain the connection between the two sections of the line.  

This means the following:  

TRAVELING FROM THE AIRPORT:  

- Take the tram as usual, but get off at REGIONE TOSCANA.  

- Wait for and board the shuttle bus, which follows the tram route and serves the usual stops, until REDI.  

- Get off the bus at REDI and walk about 100 meters to the tram stop (if you walk along the tracks, be careful, as trams may use part of the closed section to maneuver).  

- Board the tram at REDI, which will take you to the city center (main station area and then San Marco).  
  

TRAVELING FROM FLORENCE CITY CENTER:  
 
- Please note that trams heading toward the airport will not display “Peretola Aeroporto” on the front, but T2 REDI instead.  

- Take the tram from the city center as usual and stay on until REDI.  

- At REDI, get off the tram and walk along the tracks (there is a narrow pedestrian path, but be careful of trams turning around) to the bus stop at the beginning of Viale Corsica.  

- Board the shuttle bus, which follows the tram line, and ride it to REGIONE TOSCANA.  
 
- Get off at REGIONE TOSCANA (everyone will), then walk back about 50 meters to the tram stop.  

- Board the tram, which will take you to the airport.  

Since it is the holiday season and New Year’s Eve, this is unfortunately a very inconvenient time for such an incident. Many people will be catching flights over the next few days, so allow extra travel time: the shuttle bus transfer will add at least 10 minutes to your journey.  
  
If this was useful, and you feel like offering me a festive coffee, you can do so through the link on my profile (where you can find a bunch of useful stuff for your Florence stay). 
Cheers!

CHIUSURA PARZIALE DELLA LINEA TRAM T2 A PARTIRE DAL 31 DICEMBRE. 

Nella notte tra il 30 e il 31 dicembre è scoppiato un incendio sotto uno dei ponti attraversati dalla linea tramviaria T2, che collega l’aeroporto al centro città (e viceversa).
Per valutare i danni ed effettuare verifiche sulla sicurezza strutturale, il servizio tramviario è stato interrotto nella zona del ponte. È stato quindi attivato un servizio di bus sostitutivi per garantire il collegamento tra le due parti della linea.  

Questo comporta quanto segue:  

IN ARRIVO DALL’AEROPORTO:  

- Prendere il tram normalmente e scendere a REGIONE TOSCANA.  

- Attendere e salire sul bus sostitutivo, che segue il percorso del tram e serve le fermate abituali, fino a REDI.  

- Scendere dal bus a REDI e camminare per circa 100 metri fino alla fermata del tram (se si cammina lungo i binari, fare attenzione perché i tram possono utilizzare parte del tratto chiuso per le manovre).  

- Salire sul tram a REDI, che porta verso il centro città (zona stazione e poi San Marco).  
  

IN ARRIVO DAL CENTRO DI FIRENZE:  

- Attenzione: i tram diretti verso l’aeroporto non avranno la scritta “Peretola Aeroporto” sul frontale, ma T2 REDI.  

- Prendere il tram dal centro come di consueto e rimanere a bordo fino a REDI.  

- A REDI, scendere dal tram e camminare lungo i binari (c’è un passaggio pedonale stretto, ma fare attenzione ai tram in manovra) fino alla fermata del bus all’inizio di Viale Corsica.  

- Salire sul bus sostitutivo, che segue il percorso del tram, fino a REGIONE TOSCANA.  

- Scendere a REGIONE TOSCANA (scenderanno tutti) e tornare indietro a piedi per circa 50 metri fino alla fermata del tram.  

- Salire sul tram, che porterà direttamente all’aeroporto.  

Dato che siamo nel periodo delle festività e a ridosso di Capodanno, questo è purtroppo un momento particolarmente scomodo per un incidente di questo tipo. Molte persone dovranno prendere voli nei prossimi giorni, quindi calcolate tempo extra: il servizio di bus sostitutivi aggiungerà almeno 10 minuti al tempo di percorrenza.

1q0b42u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0b42u,Seeking information about Innovv's CarPlay functionality,"Hey everyone! I recently joined the 1250GSA club! Got a question about the Innovv brand for motorcycle CarPlay.



This was my secret Christmas gift to myself 🎄—before this, I was always buying secondhand bikes, but now I can finally get all the gear to go with my bike. I absolutely love it; it’s really beautiful! 😍 During Christmas, I went to a Christmas cabin with some friends for coffee , and I couldn't stop showing off my new bike. Everyone was super happy for me!

Before I got this one, I had a secondhand bike with a Chigee AIO-5. I’ve been using it, but it hasn’t been great for me. I’m using an Android phone, and there’s been a lot of disconnection issues. I tried contacting their customer service, but there hasn’t been much progress, and I’ve seen a lot of people in Facebook groups having the same problem. Since the Chigee is pretty expensive 💸, I kept using it until last week.



This week, I grabbed the Innovv N2 NAV (I’m not sure if that’s the exact name, it’s what’s written on the box) , and so far, I’m pretty impressed! The screen is huge, which is definitely my favorite part 😎. The Android connection seems to be stable now, but I haven’t tested everything else yet. The screen is a little darker compared to my BMW 1250GSA dashboard, though. The customer service is on holiday, so I’m not sure if it’s just me or if everyone is dealing with the same issue.



Would love to hear your thoughts on the screen brightness for this model if anyone has experience with it! Thanks in advance! 🙏",3,1767181339.0,bmwmotorrad,0,1.0,False

The cups have fairly balanced flavor, just muted. I also haven't noticed any sweetness or fuller body people claim to get.

I've been following tips like grinding courser, preheating thoroughly, lower agitation etc. it's not my first rodeo.

My wife and I live over in Sun City Hilton Head and finally pulled the trigger on enclosing our back patio a couple months ago.

We ended up going with Sunspace Bluffton after a couple neighbors said good things about them. They came out quick, showed us the WeatherMaster window options that slide up for screens or down to close it off completely. Install took just a few days, crew was clean and respectful, and now it feels like we added a whole extra room. We’re out there every morning with coffee and in the evenings watching football without sweating through our shirts.

Definitely worth it for us, but curious – has anyone else around Bluffton or Sun City done a patio enclosure or sunroom lately?

  I'm working on some AI tooling and realized it could solve something that's always annoyed me: searching through hours of footage and doing repetitive tasks across clips.

  basically the idea is two parts:

  ## 1. in-video search (across your whole library)

  - ""find every frame where someone's holding a coffee cup""
  - ""show me all the outdoor shots""
  - **product placement detection** - automatically tags brands, logos, products. useful for brand deals, compliance, or just organizing

  ## 2. workflows you can build and run

  this is the part I'm most curious about. imagine setting up a little pipeline like:

  - ""scan all my videos → find scenes with talking → extract those clips → transcribe them → dump into a folder""
  - ""find every logo appearance → blur them → export clean versions""
  - ""detect all product placements → generate a report with timestamps and brands""

  you'd build these once, then run them whenever. the heavy lifting happens on remote servers so your machine isn't chugging for hours.

  kind of like photoshop actions but for video analysis/processing, and it runs in the cloud.

  ---

  **questions:**

  1. would you actually use custom workflows? or is ""just search"" enough
  2. what repetitive video tasks do you hate doing manually?
  3. anyone tried anything like this? what was missing?

  not selling anything - trying to figure out if this is worth building as a plugin vs standalone tool. appreciate any thoughts

I've just noticed on the packaging it says not recommended for pregnant women or children. I'm assuming it's because it contains caffeine and can push people over the tolerance if they think it's just like water. They also contain magnesium, potassium, calcium, sodium and vitamin C. The caffeine free version doesn't carry the same warning, and the only difference is that it doesn't have caffeine.

Thoughts on drinking it? I'm conflicted, it's so helpful and logically seems like it should be absolutely fine, but I also feel like I'm doing something wrong because of the warning. ",1,1767179699.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

After messing with the timeline because Saiki wanted to achieve a unique coffee jelly flavor, but every time he tried, something always prevented him from doing so, he tried again and again and again and again... repeating New Year's until he finally achieved the unique coffee jelly flavor.

But so many repetitions caused the timeline to alter, putting his world in a constant loop on New Year's Day, and when the clock strikes 11:59 p.m., the day repeats itself.

1q0am3n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0am3n,"Looking for ""ew... i slept with my bro for 3 years?! Well go hell f**kboy""","Grayson texted me a shirtless pic: [Coming over tonight.]
My heart raced. The second my plane landed, I went straight to him.
Found him on his knees outside his building. Tying another girl's shoelaces.
I stopped dead. Everything went cold.
I thought he'd panic when he saw me. Scramble for an excuse.
Instead, he smiled.
""Ava! Perfect timing. This is Brielle—my girlfriend.""
Then he turned to her.
""Babe, this is Ava. We go way back. Just friends.""
I felt myself shut down.
So that's it. I was just a hookup with history.
That night, I blocked him everywhere.
Put in for a transfer.
But the day I left, he showed up crying.
""Where are you going?!""
""Somewhere you're not.""

Just friends.

The words hit me like a punch.

Brielle narrowed her eyes at me, then turned on him.

""Friends don't show up straight off a plane dragging luggage behind them.""

He jumped in fast.

""Babe, seriously—we grew up together. That's all it is.""

Then he looked at me, annoyed.

""Why'd you even come here? You should've just gone home.""

The wind blew my hair across my face. Good. It hid the tears.

I glanced down and saw my shoelace trailing loose. I bent down, tied it, wiped my eyes.

""Just passing through.""

Brielle was still sulking. Grayson barely looked at me as he waved me off.

""Yeah. Go.""

I turned and wheeled my suitcase away, throat bu//rning.

After college, we both stayed in the city.

One night at some work party, he got blackout drunk. I helped him out of his jacket—and suddenly, he kissed me.

In the dark, I didn't stop him.

I'd wanted him since we were kids.

Friendship was just the excuse I used to stay close.

The next morning, I tried to laugh it off. Told him we should forget it.

He didn't laugh. He kissed me again.

After that, everything changed.

We held hands in the snow. Kissed at midnight. Spent nights wrapped up in each other.

I thought we were together.

Turns out I was the only one who did.

I got home and just... collapsed on the couch.

Everything that just happened kept running through my head on a loop. It was so stupid.

My phone lit up. Grayson.

[You home?]

I stared at it.

The whiplash was insane.

Did that actually just happen?

How do you tell someone you love them while you're still fu//cking someone else?

My stomach lurched. I barely made it to my knees before I started dry-heaving.

Another text.

[Be there in 10.]

I laughed. I was crying, but I laughed.

So that's what I was. A booty call with a history.

[Don't come over.] I texted him back.

Typing bubble. Then:

[What's your problem? We've always been like this.]

[Or are you mad I have a girlfriend now? Chill. I'm not even sleeping with her yet.]

I actually laughed out loud. It was that ridiculous.

When did I ever say I was okay with this?

Every time I s1ept with him, every time I let him touch me—it was because I loved him.

And he thought—

[You were into it too.]

I blocked him without thinking twice. Deleted his number. Everything.

Then I locked myself in the shower and stayed there for two hours.

Like I could scrub him off my skin. Undo every stupid decision.

I just felt disgusting.

For giving him everything. For getting nothing back.

When I got out, he was already inside.

He grabbed me before I could say anything, pulled me close, mouth on my neck, hands everywhere.

""You showered without me?""

He dangled a box of condoms. ""Let me hop in real quick. Then we're good.""

I snatched the box and threw it straight in the garbage.

""Give me my key back. And leave.""

He stopped. Blinked.

""Wait—are you serious right now? Did you actually catch feelings?""

He laughed. Like it was funny.

""Come on. We've known each other since we were kids. There's nothing new here.""

I felt humiliated. Crushed. I couldn't even breathe.

He finally got that I wasn't joking.

He tossed the key on the floor.

""Don't tell Brielle.""

Pause.

""I really love her.""

That broke something in me.

He knew exactly what he was doing.

Whatever was left of my dignity, he ground it into the floor.

Along with every memory that used to matter.

I bit down hard so my voice wouldn't shake.

""Fine.""

I dragged my butt to work the next day.

Because that's what you do. You fall apart after five.

I threw myself into every project I could find. If I stayed busy enough, maybe I wouldn't have to think.

That night I was scrolling Instagram when Grayson's story popped up.

My stomach flipped.

When I first got on there, I'd bugged him until he followed me back. Took forever.

My thumb hovered over his name. I knew I shouldn't.

I clicked anyway.

There they were. Faces pressed together. Fireworks exploding over Disneyland.

I really into theme parks. I'd asked him a hundred times to go with me.

Same line every time: ""That's for kids. We're almost thirty. Why would we go?""

Guess it wasn't about Disneyland. It was about me.

I kept scrolling.

He looked so happy.

Every memory I thought was ours—he was already making new ones with her.

I didn't sleep until three.

Anger and heartbreak kept ripping through me in waves.

I didn't get it.

What did I do wrong? Why was I the one drowning while he got to be fine?

...

Christmas was coming. Work made us stay through Christmas Eve to hit some bullsh!t deadline.

Everyone complained. I was relieved.

Grayson's family lived across the hall. Every year our families had dinner together on Christmas Eve.

At least now I had an out.

By the time everyone left, it was past midnight.

Fireworks started going off outside. I stood at the window watching them fade and didn't realize I was crying until my vision blurred.

Suddenly someone tapped my shoulder.

I spun around. My manager Liam stood there with two coffees.

I wiped my face fast.

I thought I was alone.

Smiling, I took the cup. ""Thanks.""

He kept his voice soft. ""Why are you still here?""

I pressed my lips together. ""Leaving soon.""

He smiled a little. ""You're always so put-together. Never seen you cry before.""

Beat.

""Bad breakup?""

I froze. ""How'd you know?""

He shrugged. ""You stopped posting about him.""

I had nothing to say.

Yeah. I used to post about Grayson constantly. Like I needed proof he was mine.

Liam seemed to catch my embarrassment.

""If your love life's a shitshow, throw yourself into work. Company's opening a southern office. We need someone to lead it.""

He looked at me.

""Board wants you. You in?""

...

It was late so Liam drove me home.

Halfway there, snow started falling.

I watched it through the window. Last Christmas it snowed too.

Back the, Grayson and I set off sparklers in the snow. It came down so thick it covered our hair.

My nose went numb but I didn't want to go inside. He grabbed my hand and shoved it in his jacket pocket.

""What's with you? You're walking like a turtle.""

I blamed the weather. ""Waiting for more snow.""

He stopped. Cupped my face. Kissed my forehead.

He grinned. ""That what you were waiting for?""

...

My head was spinning.

Was any of that real? Or was I just some idi0t replaying fake memories?

My phone buzzed.

Grayson. I still knew his number by heart.

[Why aren't you home? Your mom said you're still at work. I'll come get you.]

I glanced at it. Tossed my phone in my bag.

Five minutes later Liam pulled up outside my building.

I got out. He stopped me.

""Hey—your fly.""

I looked down. My zipper had busted open. No idea when.

My face went nuclear. I yanked at it five times. Wouldn't budge.

Kill me now.

He smiled. ""Marry Christmas.""

Then he drove off.

I stood there wrestling with my zipper like an idi0t.

Then I turned and looked up.

Grayson was standing there.

So was Brielle.

Her smile was all teeth. ""Oh wow. You two were just in his car and... haha... Christmas hookup?""

""Starting strong!""

I snapped, ""It's not like that!""

She waved me off. ""Girl, relax. We're all adults. Grayson and I couldn't keep our hands off each other last time either. We were in the—""

She giggled and shoved his arm. ""You're so bad!""

Grayson's face turned to stone. His voice went ice-cold.

""Don't compare yourself to her. She's not exactly picky, if you know what I mean.""

At his words, Brielle fake-gasped, still giggling. ""Babe, that's mean.""

He looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe. ""She's desperate and fake.""

Then he turned to Brielle, voice soft again.

""You're nothing like her.""

Pause.

""You've got class. She's just... easy.""

Brielle ate it up.

I stood there. Nails digging into my palms so hard I thought I'd draw blood.

""You're right,"" I said. Voice steady. ""I didn't know what good se//x was until now.""

I smiled.

""Guess my standards were in he11.""

Grayson's face went black.

Christmas morning, I woke up to chaos in the living room.

Grayson's mom barged in and shook me through the blankets.

""Get up, beautiful! You missed dinner last night. You're coming to lunch, and I'm not taking no for an answer.""

I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. Grayson stood behind her looking like he wanted to choke someone.

I was already scrambling for an excuse.

My mom smiled. ""Grayson's girlfriend is coming over. Mabel invited all of us.""

My brain stalled.

Wait—already meeting the parents?

""Mabel, I don't think—""

My dad groaned. ""This girl. When's she gonna find someone? All she does is work. Your mother and I are going gray over here.""

Great. Now it was about me.

""Fine. I'll come.""

...

By the time I dragged myself over, everyone was already there.

I could hear Mabel gushing about Brielle. How smart she was. How sweet. What a wonderful wife she'd make.

I stepped inside. The room went quiet.

I froze. Then it hit me.

Mabel used to say that stuff about me.

My mom coughed awkwardly. ""There you are. Come meet Brielle. Grayson's girlfriend.""

Before I could say anything, Brielle spoke up.

""Oh, we've actually met. The night Grayson and I got together.""

She smiled. ""Ava showed up straight from the airport with her suitcase. You two must be really close.""

Bringing that up felt like she'd torn off a scab I'd barely grown.

My chest tightened. But it didn't that hurt like before.

...

Once the parents left, Brielle dropped the act.

""You still hung up on him? That's... kinda sad. But hey, I get it.""

She stepped closer, voice sugar-sweet. ""Whatever you two had before—it's cute. But let's be real. You never stood a chance.""

""We're getting married in three months. You're welcome to come.""

So they're married.

I used to think about marrying him.

Asked him once what kind of wedding he wanted.

He didn't even look up. ""We're not even close to that. Why bring it up?""

Tried asking in bed once. He just fu//cked me harder. Never answered.

He never answered.

But that was an answer, wasn't it?

I was still thinking when Brielle's voice cut through.

""Babe, I think Malt's hungry. Can we go check on him?""

She pouted. ""I don't remember if I filled his bowl before we left...""

That was an hour and a half round trip.

I remembered when I forgot a file once. Called Grayson and asked him to drop it off.

Ten-minute drive. He shut me down immediately.

""Can you get your sh!t together? I'm not your delivery guy. I need a break too.""

But now?

Grayson was already grabbing his jacket. ""Get dressed. We'll leave now.""

And just like that, I got it.

The difference between love and nothing was that obvious.

He was short with me because he never loved me.

I was never his girlfriend. I was just... available. A safe fu//ck he didn't have to work for.

The next few days, I avoided every family thing I could.

Mom figured it out. She slipped into my room one night and sat on my bed.

""Honey, I know you've had a thing for Grayson since you were kids. But he's with someone now. You can't keep waiting.""

She paused. ""Mabel has already welcomed Brielle into the family. That whole childhood engagement thing—you know it was never real. Let it go, honey.""

I nodded. Then asked.

""Mom, what if we moved south? Work just offered me a transfer.""

""It's warmer. Your knee won't act up as much in winter. You and Dad are retired anyway. Could be a fresh start.""

Mom saw right through me. ""Whatever you need. We're with you.""

I wrapped my arms around her.

Resting against her shoulder, I thought—

If I left him behind, would things finally get better?

...

Work picked back up after New Year's. I buried myself in it.

The transfer came through. I'd be leaving next week.

Mom wanted one last dinner with the Morgan family before we left.

I didn't want to go. But I couldn't say no to her.

Dinner started. Grayson wasn't there yet.

I exhaled.

Mabel mentioned he'd been swamped with engagement shoots. Practically living at Brielle's now.

She pulled out her phone to show me some photos.

I scrolled through them. They looked so happy in every single one.

There was one where they were looking at each other.

I could see it. Clear as day.

He loved her.

Something in me went quiet.

Maybe it started that night after Christmas. When I sat on my bathroom floor crying and deleted every picture of us I'd ever saved.

That's when I accepted it. He never loved me.

And once I did, I let go.

Eventually, I'd build my own life. Meet someone who actually wanted me.

What's the point? I'm done wasting time on him.

Once that clicked, I felt lighter. I smiled and handed her phone back.

""They look amazing together. Your grandkids are gonna be gorgeous.""

Mr. Morgan chuckled. ""We always thought you'd end up being our daughter-in-law. We even found that letter you wrote Grayson back in high school...""

I didn't flinch. Just laughed like it was some old embarrassing story.

Mabel relaxed. ""We were worried you might still... anyway. Congrats on the move, sweetheart.""

I lifted my glass.

Then a voice cut in.

Infrastructure
Big W for the coastal road. Being able to go from SoBo to Bandra in ~15 minutes instead of 45 is honestly life changing. I use it often and it’s one of the few infra projects that actually feels worth it.

At the same time, big L for literally every other normal street. Roads dug up everywhere, potholes that appear overnight, and stretches that feel permanently under construction.

Metro is a big W overall, but genuine question: who is actually using it in SoBo? I barely see people around me using it, but maybe I’m just living in a bubble.

Cost of living
Rent is insane, especially in SoBo. LA / NYC level rents, which isn’t shocking anymore, but I still don’t fully understand how people are affording it unless generational wealth or dual incomes are involved.

High expenses feel completely normalised now.
₹600 coffee.
₹2500 per person dinners.
₹25k Jordans.
₹100k LV belts.

It genuinely feels like US pricing in many places. I also see a much bigger credit card culture coming in, something I don’t remember growing up here.

Work & hustle
The hustle culture is still very much alive, but I also see a large chunk of people who seem… comfortable being mediocre. Just doing the bare minimum, no real desire to excel.

Which is sad, because this city has all the money you need if you’re willing to go after it.

Running a well-established business alongside an AI startup has been fun in terms of meeting clients and doing business in Mumbai. People are sharp when it comes to deals. But building a strong team has been tough. I don’t see the same hunger and ownership mindset I expected.

Curious if others feel this shift or if it’s just my experience.

Dating & social life
Dating has been weird. I’ve met people, but not many genuinely interesting connections. I don’t like dating apps and honestly don’t know how well they work for men here.

Everyone is busy. Calendars are packed. Dating feels like a task rather than something organic. Hookups seem way more normalised now, which is fine, you do you.

I’m grateful I still have a small core friend group I hang out with, but growing your social circle after moving back has been harder than I expected. People moved on, different life paths, totally normal.

Also… nightlife is a joke. Why are clubs shutting at 1:30 in Mumbai of all cities?

The Mumbai part
One thing that hasn’t changed: people here are still incredibly polite and helpful. Strangers are quick to assist, there’s basic courtesy everywhere, and that part genuinely feels nice to come back to.

I don’t feel like a tourist in my own city, but once in a while I do go, “Oh damn, when did this open?” or “Wow, Mumbai has this now?” Even though I used to visit once a year, living here full-time hits different.

Wrapping up
2025 felt like a reintroduction to my own city. Some big wins, some frustrating realities, and a lot of adjusting.

Hopefully settling in more through 2026.

For others:

	•	How was Mumbai 2025 for you?

	•	For people who moved back after being abroad, did it take time to feel fully settled?

	•	Do you think the city is actually getting better, or just more expensive and louder about progress?

Would love to hear different perspectives.

Drink a lot of water like one litre.

I know women have a certain style where they can push from the inner walls of the vagina to pull the shit out.

So for men i reccomend putting your finger in your ass style and im not recommending gay sex here. Im reccomending just lightly pulling on the walls of your anal hole in a certain direction while trying to push.

While it shares similar traits with anal i reccomend it for anyone constipated and have no other way to go.

Do all this in one hour. For me eating the prunes takes 45 mins as it also needs to digest. Drink 1 litre in 15 minutes. Lastly the shit takes ONLY 5 mins. After this drink two servings of coffee and boom a little bit of diarrhoea but it works.

Eating food after that may make u shit too depending on what.

Also check how many grams of prunes or apircots you need depending on how many calories you eat. I eat 1750 calories so i eat around 150g of prunes a day.

Lastly theres a timing for it. If you eat at a lot at 12 noon and lets say a little bit at 6 pm, take the prunes the next day 12 noon and continue the process.

(Tecumseh) -- Excavation work is expected to begin early next year on a rare earth minerals mine in southeast Nebraska.

NioCorp Critical Mineral Security announced plans earlier this month on the first phase of construction for its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project, with an initial operational footprint of roughly 640 acres along Highway 50, six miles south of Tecumseh. NioCorp Chief Operating Officer Scott Honan tells KMA News that research into the larger 7,800-acre carbonatite area dates back over 50 years, to 1971, when the rock formations that host the rare minerals were first discovered. Now, after decades of research and planning, Honan says construction is set to begin in the first quarter of 2026 on a portal project for the Elk Creek mine, establishing the main entrance and access points, which he adds is a significant undertaking given the size of the proposed mine.

""We're going to access that mine with what we call a ramp or a deep line and you might look at it and say, 'that's a tunnel,'"" said Honan. ""These initial steps we're going to take here starting in 2026 involve excavating down to bedrock and then creating kind of a big wedge-shaped hole in the bedrock that will allow us to start these two tunnels that will then eventually get us down to where the ore body is and allow us to start mining.""

https://preview.redd.it/js35r3gcqiag1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d40b98dfeff7026e087c4047f653191bd5132b8

The estimated capital costs for the initial portal project are around $44.6 million, with total project construction costs estimated at $1.2 billion. Plans call for the eventual implementation of the Railveyor system and other electric-powered equipment to drill for a variety of rare-earth minerals. Honan says much of their focus is on niobium, with the proposed mine being the first in the United States to have access to the material.

""Niobium is a very stable commodity in terms of its pricing with a very well-developed market and currently there's no North American production of niobium,"" he said. ""So it's a good thing not only from a business perspective, but I think in terms of satisfying our country's need for this particular critical mineral.""

Over the last few months, NioCorp has reported the acquisition and ownership of the land, its completion of over 11,000 meters of drilling, and the raising of around $384 million. Part of that funding also came from the United States Department of War, which granted $10 million of its designated production spending to the project to establish domestic scandium production, which strengthens aluminum alloys and makes them less susceptible to corrosion. Honan says scandium is one of several byproducts they believe could be produced from their niobium production.

""As we built a production process to produce niobium, it became apparent that we could fairly easily produce scandium as a byproduct, we could produce titanium as a byproduct, and we could produce some of the rare earth elements as byproducts,"" said Honan. ""So now we have sort of this integrated production process that will produce all four of those product streams from this single source of ore.""

Honan says nearly 300 million tons of mineral resources exist in the roughly 60-acre area in Johnson County, giving the mine an expected life of around 38 years. Much of the project's cost is also expected to be covered by a $780 million debt financing plan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, with approval required before the company can begin final permitting and construction. Honan says they are in the midst of finalizing a feasibility study to secure the funding.

**""As a country, we've talked about the importance of critical minerals and how we're going to get away from our reliance on places like China and Brazil for some of these things,"" he said. ""This is kind of the first time we've seen not only tangible support for our efforts to develop what is a critical minerals mine in southeast Nebraska, but an all-of-government approach. We're getting some assistance from the Ex-Im Bank, we've got some assistance from the Department of War, and we've got certainly great support from the Congressional delegation in the state.""**

Honan says that the loan could be finalized as soon as the second or third quarter of 2026, with a roughly three-year timeline to fully construct the mining facility. After construction, Honan says the mine is expected to create around 450 on-site jobs, including laborers, engineers, scientists, business executives, and other roles.

# Dec. 30th, 2025~The U.S. Air Force’s New F-47 NGAD Fighter Is Coming Soon

[Forget China's J-20 or J-35A: The U.S. Air Force's New F-47 NGAD Fighter Is Coming Soon - 19FortyFive](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/12/forget-chinas-j-20-or-j-35a-the-u-s-air-forces-new-f-47-ngad-fighter-is-coming-soon/)

[NGAD Fighter Mockup. Image Credit: Creative Commons.](https://preview.redd.it/e93v86k1riag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a856550f0d73f3f3f5510c4ad84818ae2479b4)

**Synopsis:** While China’s J-20 and J-35A stealth fighters collect headlines and [attention](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/12/f-35-doesnt-have-this-chinas-new-j-20s-mighty-dragon-stealth-fighter-is-a-two-seater/), Boeing says the Air Force’s F-47 sixth-generation fighter has already entered production—an eye-popping claim for a program publicly unveiled in March 2025.

\-The reason, company and government officials suggest, is that NGAD didn’t truly “[start](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/01/forget-chinas-stealth-fighter-america-flew-a-6th-generation-ngad-years-back/)” in 2025 at all. -Years earlier, the Air Force and DARPA quietly funded competing flight demonstrators, letting industry validate key concepts in secret before any public contract award.

\-That head start may have answered major questions—airframe, propulsion integration, signature management, and systems architecture—long before the program had a name.

\-If the 2028 first-flight target holds, NGAD could become a new blueprint for rapid [acquisitions](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/12/the-f-22-raptor-has-a-message-for-the-f-47-ngad-stealth-fighter/).

# Here’s How the Air Force’s F-47 NGAD Is Moving So Remarkably Quickly

Boeing says the U.S. Air Force’s new [F-47 sixth-generation fighter](https://www.realcleardefense.com/2025/11/18/f-47_programs_accelerated_pace_made_possible_by_ngad_x-plane_efforts_1148080.html) has already entered production – a speedy turnaround for a program only officially announced to the public in March 2025 – and company leadership is now pointing to a years-long, [largely hidden flight-demonstrator](https://www.twz.com/air/f-47-was-born-out-of-secret-x-planes-built-by-both-boeing-and-lockheed) effort as the reason the schedule is working out as well as it is.

During a media roundtable discussion ahead of the Dubai Airshow in mid-November 2025, Boeing Defense, Space and Security president and CEO Steve Parker described the company’s win in the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition as “humbling” and “transformational,” arguing that the program’s surprising momentum is the result of design work that was already mature when the award was made.

 While Parker declined to elaborate on some key schedule milestones, he acknowledged the Air Forcer’s stated target of a first flight before the end of 2028. Parker also insisted that Boeing is in a good position to continue moving [forward](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/12/f-47-ngad-6th-generation-stealth-fighter-has-a-message-for-chinas-j-36/).

“I won’t even touch the first flight day the Air Force has put the date out there; I’m just going to stay away from all that,” Parker said, [per The War Zone](https://www.twz.com/air/f-47-programs-accelerated-pace-made-possible-by-ngad-x-plane-efforts). “It’s all about execution, and that’s what is getting all of my attention. We’re in a good spot.” 

[ScAl alloys for \\""Platforms & Components\\"" \(Plural\) ... Just a pinch of Scandium makes \\""STUFF\\"" better!](https://reddit.com/link/1q0aisy/video/izswrobfriag1/player)

Earlier disclosures from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([DARPA](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/02/the-mad-scientists-at-darpa-want-to-build-a-mach-5-hypersonic-bomber/)) and Air Force leaders indicated that [NGAD’s crewed-fighter competition](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/kendall-x-plane-program-preceded-ngad/) was preceded by real-world X-plane flights that began years before the contract announcement – effectively allowing the risk and design work to move forward before the contract was officially agreed and giving the entire program a head start. It also means that the work done before the contract was awarded was entirely classified.

[A March 2025 report](https://theaviationist.com/2025/03/23/darpa-ngad-x-planes/) summarizing DARPA’s public comments noted that Boeing and Lockheed Martin had each designed and built an NGAD demonstrator aircraft under research-and-development contracts, with first flights in 2018 and 2022, respectively, and both aircraft logging several hundred hours of flight time. 

That strategy of contracting two companies that both competed to win the NGAD contract has worked well for the U.S. Air Force and the Pentagon so far.

The strategy was deliberate: to prototype early, keep the most consequential trade-offs classified, and then move rapidly once a baseline configuration had been [selected](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/boeing-declares-f-47-ngad-6th-generation-fighter-is-a-huge-a-win/).

# The X-Planes That De-risked F-47 NGAD

NGAD’s accelerated pace is a breath of fresh air for the Air Force after years of delays, schedule slips, and maintenance/sustainment woes on various emerging and fielded platforms. The difficult technical questions were, for the most part, answered before the project officially began, with the X-plane campaign laying the foundation for what is now known as the F-47. 

The Air Force’s former Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, in a statement cited by DARPA and defense reporting, said the X-planes had flown several hundred hours over roughly five years, validating several “cutting-edge concepts” and proving the service could “push the envelope” with confidence. 

Bringing risks forward and solving the most difficult hurdles first was important for [NGAD](https://theaviationgeekclub.com/here-are-some-of-the-x-planes-that-could-have-paved-the-way-to-f-47/): the political and budgetary hurdles for a new crewed stealth fighter are far higher than for a technology demonstrator. 

If key aerodynamic, propulsion-integration, signature management, and systems architecture questions have already been explored in flight tests, the Air Force can accept a more aggressive schedule after source selection and can be reasonably confident that schedule slippage will be minimal. 

The revelation of how the program works also helps clarify some long-running speculation about how many NGAD prototypes existed. 

Unconfirmed reports have suggested that as many as three demonstrators may have flown, with Boeing and [Lockheed](https://defence-industry.eu/lockheed-martin-responds-to-ngad-contract-loss-after-boeing-selected-for-u-s-air-force-programme/) now confirmed publicly as having built X-planes, and a third sometimes speculated to have been associated with Northrop Grumman before it stepped away from the NGAD fighter competition. 

What remains unclear, by design, is what the X-planes looked like, which missions and performance metrics were prioritized, and how directly they would translate into the eventual production aircraft.

Even senior former officials have tried to draw a line between the demonstrators and a fielded fighter. 

For example, retired Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has described the demonstrators as experimental rather than prototypes for a “tactical design,” indicating that, while the plan was to inform the NGAD program all along, the X-planes were intended only to reduce risk and explore concepts. 

# The Bottomline on the F-47

If the Air Force keeps the F-47 on track for a 2028 first flight, NGAD may become a new template for future programs: fly early in secret, mitigate the highest risks, and then move fast once a design is chosen.

# 🚀 NioCorp Year-End 2025 Recap — Why “2026 Is the Year” Actually Matters

As 2025 closes, NioCorp ends the year not with hype, but with **real, physical progress finally locked in**. After more than five decades of geological research and over a decade of permitting, engineering, and financing work, the company received Board approval for the **Mine Portal Project at Elk Creek**, with excavation scheduled to begin in **Q1 2026**. This portal is the literal gateway to the underground mine—establishing permanent access ramps, infrastructure, and the foundation for ore extraction. It marks the transition from planning to execution, something long-term holders have waited years to see.

2025 was a year of **quiet but critical de-risking**. NioCorp completed extensive drilling, secured land ownership, raised roughly **$380 million**, locked in the **Railveyor™ electrified mining system**, and continued work on a (FINAL DFS) feasibility study that reflects a modernized mine plan and lower-risk infrastructure. Just as importantly, the company advanced its **Pentagon-backed scandium program**, supported by a $10M federal award, validating the mine’s ability to produce not just niobium, but scandium, titanium, and rare earth elements from a single ore body. Elk Creek is no longer viewed internally as “just a mine,” but as an **integrated critical-minerals platform**.

The significance of this became clearer this week when COO **Scott Honan confirmed that portal construction will begin in early 2026**, with total project construction estimated at \~$1.2B and a mine life of nearly 40 years. He also reaffirmed that Elk Creek would be the **only niobium mine in the United States**, addressing a strategic vulnerability the U.S. currently fills almost entirely through foreign supply. **Niobium’s stable pricing, combined with Scandium’s role in next-generation aluminum alloys and defense systems, places NioCorp squarely in the middle of the U.S. government’s push to secure domestic critical minerals.**

So what does **2026** actually mean? It’s the year when multiple threads finally converge: **portal construction**, the **updated feasibility study**, continued **Pentagon and Lockheed Sc-Al alloy milestones**, and potential progress toward **EXIM Bank financing**, which management has indicated could reach a decision as early as **Q2–Q3 2026**. These are execution-based milestones, not promotional ones—and they’re the kind that unlock offtakes, financing, and long-term partnerships.

[\~WISHING ALL.... A HAPPY & PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR 2026!\~](https://reddit.com/link/1q0aisy/video/dpbeoq49uiag1/player)

**Bottom line:** 2025 was the final setup year. 2026 is when plans turn into steel, rock, and rails. After years of patience, NioCorp enters the new year with dirt about to move, government backing moving into place, and a clear path toward becoming a cornerstone of U.S. critical-minerals security.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

The pickup was smooth and personalized. What really surprised me was how personal everything felt even though Im just a member of WOH Without any tier or status yet. Staff addressed me by name, and a few of them even followed up on plans I casually mentioned the day before. That kind of attention really made me feel welcomed.

The hotel itself is beautiful. The room was spacious, modern, and very quiet. Location wise, it’s super convenient, close to malls, hospitals, and plenty of coffee shops, so getting around was easy.

The gym. It’s big, well equipped with modern machines and free weights, and they provide towels. I used it multiple times and it never felt crowded. If you go early enough you can get wellness shots! 

Housekeeping and laundry were consistently excellent. They followed my instructions perfectly and everything came back neatly done and on time, which was very convenient. 

Overall, this stay left a very strong first impression of Hyatt. If this is how they treat someone with no status at all, I’m honestly excited to see how the WOH journey goes from here. One day i will be a Globalist!

It’s a raw, sometimes funny, often heartbreaking look at love, loss, and the messy art of putting yourself back together. I printed it, I uploaded it, I hit ""publish,"" even tried to start posting on Instagram and TikTok.

My sales dashboard, however, shows a very intimate party of one.

So, I’m swallowing my pride and turning to the experts: **YOU**. For those of you who’ve been in the trenches of self-publishing, especially in poetry or niche genres:

What actually worked to get your book in front of readers who weren’t related to you?

Any BookTok or Bookstagram strategies that don’t just feel like screaming into the void?

Is it all about ARCs? Blog tours? Sacrificing a notebook to the algorithm gods?

I’m all ears. My book is about finding beauty in the broken pieces, and right now, my marketing plan is the most broken piece of all.

Thanks in advance for any wisdom. I’ll be over here, refreshing my KDP reports and believing in the magic of stranger kindness.",0,1767178713.0,publishing,3,0.36,False

1q0abaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1q0abaz/the_psychology_of_rizz_sciencebased_tips_that/,The Psychology of RIZZ: Science-Based Tips That Actually Work (Not Cringe Pickup Lines),"Look, I've spent way too much time studying this. Read books, listened to podcasts, watched countless YouTube videos from relationship coaches and psychologists. Not because I was desperate (okay maybe a little), but because I noticed something weird: everyone my age is simultaneously more connected than ever yet completely terrible at actual human connection. We can craft the perfect text but freeze up in person. We understand memes better than body language.

The truth is, most ""rizz"" advice is either pickup artist garbage or so generic it's useless. After researching actual psychology, communication theory, and yes, embarrassing myself plenty of times, I've figured out what actually works. Not tricks or lines, but genuine skills that make you magnetic.

1. Understand that attraction isn't logical, it's emotional

This is the foundation everything else builds on. You can't logic someone into liking you. Attraction happens in the limbic system, the primitive part of our brain that responds to feelings, not facts. This is why the ""nice guy"" who lists all his good qualities gets nowhere while someone who makes people feel something gets results.

Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships (dude has predicted divorce with 94% accuracy) shows that successful connections are built on emotional attunement, not compatibility checklists. His book ""The Science of Trust"" breaks down how we build connection through micro-moments of emotional exchange. It's dense but insanely good if you want to understand the actual mechanics of human bonding.

2. Stop performing, start connecting

The biggest mistake is treating interactions like a performance where you need to impress. That creates anxiety and kills authenticity. Instead, approach conversations with genuine curiosity. Ask questions you actually want answers to. React to what people say instead of waiting for your turn to talk.

Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down perfectly in ""Captivate."" She's a behavioral investigator who studied thousands of social interactions and found that charismatic people ask more questions and use specific techniques to make others feel heard. The book covers everything from body language to conversation threading. Best communication book I've ever read, hands down.

3. Master the art of playful tension

Real chemistry involves a balance of comfort and tension. Too much comfort and you're just friends. Too much tension and it's awkward or aggressive. The sweet spot is playful teasing, slight challenges, moments of intensity followed by warmth.

This doesn't mean negging or being mean. It means not being afraid of disagreement, having opinions, creating moments of uncertainty. If someone says something, don't always agree. Push back a little. Make them work for your approval sometimes while also showing genuine interest.

4. Your energy matters more than your words

People remember how you made them feel, not what you said. This sounds fluffy but it's backed by neuroscience. Your nervous system communicates with other people's nervous systems through microexpressions, tone, body language. If you're anxious or trying too hard, they feel it before you say a word.

The app Finch is actually great for building better mental habits around this. It's a self care app where you raise a little bird by completing daily check ins and mood tracking. Sounds silly but it helps you develop self awareness about your emotional state, which is huge for showing up better in interactions.

5. Stop seeking validation, start offering value

The frame should never be ""please like me."" It should be ""let's see if we vibe."" This shift is massive. When you're seeking validation, you're in a low power position. When you're genuinely exploring whether someone is worth your time, you're equal.

This doesn't mean being aloof or playing games. It means having standards and being willing to walk away from people who aren't reciprocating energy. Mark Manson's ""Models"" covers this concept brilliantly. He argues that real attraction comes from vulnerability and honesty, not manipulation. This book will make you question everything you think you know about dating and social dynamics. It's uncomfortable in the best way.

6. Develop conversational calibration

Good conversation is like jazz, you need to read the room and adjust. Some people want deep talks immediately. Others need small talk to warm up. Some respond to humor. Others want intensity. You can't use the same approach with everyone.

Pay attention to engagement cues. Are they leaning in or pulling back? Asking questions or giving short answers? Matching your energy or subdued? Adjust accordingly. The Charisma on Command YouTube channel breaks down these micro-adjustments in their analysis videos. They study celebrities and influencers to decode what actually makes people magnetic.

7. Physical presence and vocal tonality matter

Stand up straight but relaxed. Take up space without being aggressive. Make eye contact but don't stare. Touch appropriately when there's rapport (arm, shoulder, brief contact). These are all ways of communicating confidence and comfort.

Your voice also carries massive weight. Speak from your chest, not your throat. Slow down. Pause for emphasis. A deeper, slower voice is perceived as more attractive and authoritative. There's actual research on this from UCLA's vocal perception studies.

8. Create experiences, not just conversations

Instead of standard coffee dates or endless texting, do something. Mini golf. Cooking together. Exploring a new part of town. Shared experiences create stronger bonds than interview style conversations.

There's psychological research on this called the ""misattribution of arousal."" When people experience excitement or adrenaline with you, they partially attribute those feelings to you. It's why first date advice always includes active or novel experiences.

9. Be outcome independent

This is the hardest one. Stop caring so much about specific results. You can't control whether someone likes you back, but you can control showing up as your best self. When you detach from outcomes, paradoxically you get better results because you're not radiating desperation.

Practicing mindfulness helps here. The Insight Timer app has thousands of free meditations including ones specifically for social anxiety and building confidence. Better than any subscription meditation app honestly.

10. Develop yourself beyond dating

The most attractive thing you can do is have a life people want to be part of. Pursue hobbies. Build skills. Chase goals. Have interesting stories. Be passionate about something. People are drawn to others who are going somewhere.

This isn't about becoming ""high value"" in some transactional way. It's about being someone you're proud to be. When you genuinely like yourself and your life, that confidence radiates.

The reality is most people struggle with connection not because they lack some magical technique, but because they're anxious, inauthentic, or looking for external validation to fill internal voids. Fix those root issues through self development, therapy if needed, and genuine self work. The rizz follows naturally when you're operating from a place of abundance rather than scarcity.

There's no shortcut. But there is a path. And it starts with recognizing that being attractive isn't about memorizing lines or following formulas. It's about becoming someone who's genuinely comfortable with themselves and curious about others. Everything else is just details.",1,1767178413.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

1q0a9gt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0a9gt,December Snacks hits & misses!,"Hi all,
Back with my hits & misses for this December!

1. Mevano is my favourite hot chocolate mix out there! It’s smooth, rich, and lump-free, with no refined sugar. Although it tastes better and sweeter. It felt so comforting and perfect for Christmas and the cold December weather. Will definitely repurchase. 8.5/10

2. I did enjoy Christopher Cocoa at first, but after trying Mevano, I realised it wasn’t as naturally chocolatey and was noticeably more lumpy. I also had to whisk it much longer to get a smoother blend. 6/10

3. Well, I’m not very sure about Artisante. I don’t remember the taste standing out much… matlab, it was nice, but not something that left a strong impression. I wouldn’t purchase the entire range, maybe just one flavour (Mocha with Coffee or Caramel). I found a few flavours to be more medicinal, and it also requires a lot of whisking to get a smooth blend. 4/10

4. My personal favourite among the three was the stollen and bundt cake, only caz I couldn’t really enjoy the boozy plum cake. I just had a bite and it was so-so! I love how the classic stollen was soft on the inside with a generous filling of dried fruits and nuts, with just the right balance of sweetness. The bundt with orange notes was comforting!

5. The classic shortbread is buttery, rich, and one of the best store-bought authentic Scottish biscuits. It melts in your mouth and is a tad bit sweet. It’s a perfect add-on to my Mevano hot chocolate. However, it’s a bit pricey. I would still rate this 7/10 for that nostalgic style.

6. My savoury is back and this time it’s the Kai murkulu. It has a crispy texture and pleasing savoury taste with traditional spice notes. Definitely pricey as compared to the local bakery, but I like that this isn’t made from maida, palm oil, and preservatives. 8.5/10

7.  Choco brownie was definitely moist, but a little too sweet for my liking. I would still say it’s a good chocolate flavour for a packaged brownie that’s affordable. 6/10

8. The jackfruit pudding cake is a pleasant change from plain fruit cakes. I would add that it tastes a bit unique, I enjoyed it with ice cream! 7/10
 
9 & 10… Finally got my hands on the butter caramel and coffee caramel toffees! Like the chocolate toffee, both the flavours are buttery and smooth texture that melts easily in the mouth. I love how quickly it dissolves as you chew & i would rate them 9/10!

11. I found the Noice kaju katli to be fresh, tasty, definitely rich, made with simpler ingredients & reminiscent of traditional homemade katli, not the hard ones! It doesn’t use silver vark, which keeps it simple and clean. 8.5/10

12. Shankarapalli is usually my fav!!! This one is crisp and golden with a light flaky texture and has just the right hint of sweetness. 9/10

13. 6/10 for the Noice chocolate cake! I found this to be soft with rich chocolate flavour. While it’s not overly sweet and has a homemade feel, it could be more moist. Good for a light treat, but not very indulgent.

14. The date flavour is sweet and pairs well with coffee or chai (without sugar). However, it can feel a bit simple compared with richer dessert cakes, so if you prefer very decadent or intense flavours, this might seem a little understated. 5/10

15. I wanted to try this after seeing so many people mention it. I’m not a huge choco pie fan, to be honest, and this didn’t completely change my mind. It’s soft and okay, but a bit too sweet. Decent as a one-time try, not something I’d crave. It’s still better than the blueberry one so 4/10.

We kicked off the session going round the room answering the question ""What did you have for breakfast?"" I was instantly freaked out. Being put on the spot in a room full of professionals makes answering seem like an assessment of one's character. My brain goes into overdrive trying to guess if there's a secret subtext like in a job interview so I started running through my possible responses:

a) pink Monster and birth control.
b) That would be unprofessional, I should make some thing up, what do NT people eat? Granola?
c) What if they are ask what type of granola? I have no idea. They'll know I lied.
d) I should just say ""I'm not really much of a breakfast person.""
e) No, that sounds unfriendly..
f) Croissant, I used to eat them so it wouldn't be a lie. Wow I forgot about that, I wonder why I stopped eating them?
g) I want an answer that is funny, truthful and makes me seem like an adult.
h) Oh my god, I'm almost 30 and not even capable of having a sensible breakfast.
i) Who tf cares?
j) I bet no-one else thought this much about the question.
k) I wish I could be normal about things, it's just breakfast ffs.

1q0a962,https://www.reddit.com/r/StratteraRx/comments/1q0a962/my_year_with_strattera_100_mg/,My Year With Strattera 100 mg,"Just wanted to share my experience. TL;DR: it works, especially if I'm burnt out. Drink lots of water.

I'm male, weigh around 80 kg (so 180ish pounds). I started Strattera because I was burnt out at the time, and my brain rejected any stimulants. On ramp was two weeks of 40 mg, six weeks of 80 mg, then 100 mg onwards. I tried going 80 mg immediately since I used Strattera before, but I got \*really\* nauseous. There is a rough guesstimate that says that ideal mg is 1.2 times your weight in kilos, which happens to be 100 mg for me. As always, it's a case of trial & error. Sorry.

I needed to be patient with Strattera. It took around six weeks for side effects to calm down and therapeutic effects to kick in. It's not like stimulants, where it works almost immediately. I got hit with emotional blunting, extreme boredom, non-existent libido, and dry mouth for the first few weeks. Dry mouth went away, emotional blunting and extreme boredom went mostly away, and maybe half of my libido came back.

So good fun nice effects:

\- My emotional state stabilized. Even when the emotional blunting went away, I was much more emotionally stable. But unlike anti-depressants, I didn't feel dead inside.

\- Compulsive behaviours disappeared almost immediately. I overate and abused porn. Gone. I think this is also connected to my emotional state getting stabilized.

\- There was some improvement with my executive functions and starting tasks. I would have liked more, but it wasn't nothing.

\- Compared to stimulants, it's easier to use. It's active 24/7. It doesn't ""kick in"" as stimulants do. I also didn't get the comedowns I'd get with stimulants. It works when I get sick, or stressed, or whatever. I don't need to manage it actively like I do stimulants.

\- I can just hang out. I'm not constantly ""on"" like how I am with stimulants.

\- I can have a bit of coffee. More than a latte gives me heart palpitations, but I can still have the latte. Which means I can decide how stimulated I want to be, at least a little bit.

\- This may be specific to where I live. Strattera is much easier to find. No shortages. I also don't need a receipt to get it. I still routinely visited my doctor, but I don't need to count pills and count dates as I do with stimulants.

The not-fun side effects, and how I dealt with them:

\- Rule of thumb: if something goes wrong, drink more water. Idk what's up with that. I don't question it anymore.

\- My sleep schedule got fucked. According to my watch, I sleep 5.5 hours on average. I started taking 3 mg melatonin, meditated a tiny bit, and sometimes read before bed. Sometimes I sleep a whopping 7 hours!

\- My libido got shot and somewhat got back. And I got ED. It's not that I can't perform; I'm not that interested in sex in general. Putting 10+hours between taking the pill and sexy times helps... somewhat. I didn't try Cialis and whatnot; they are way too expensive here.

\- heart palpitations and increased heart rate. My average heart rate increased by 15 bpm. If I drink too much caffeinated stuff, my resting heart rate shoots up to 120 bpm. Dehydration also increases my heart rate because god knows why. Water helps, as does decreasing caffeine and being more active. I think if I give my body a reason to have a high heart rate, then my heart rate decreases.

\- semen leakage and testicular swelling. This is so weird, but here we are. Do not be afraid. These are completely harmless side effects. We're fine. So sometimes after I pee, a bit of semen comes out. Completely independent of whether I was turned on for something or not. It just...does that. And also sometimes my testicles swell and hurt. Guess what helps. Water! Apparently, when I get bloated, everything pushes downwards into my bladder and prostate, then my body gets the wrong message. Water helps with digestion issues and, therefore, helps with this weirdness. It helps more than masturbation, and drinking water is easier to do when I'm on the go.

\- I'm slightly bored all the time. I don't have any solutions for this. I'm sure drinking water helps with this haha. I have this hypothesis that my unrelenting anxiety was a source of constant stimulation for my brain. And now that it's gone, I'm slightly understimulated all the time.

So yeah, that's it. I am going to switch to stimulants next year, only because I need to get shit done, and for me stimulant do a better job when I need to get shit done. Emphasis on ""a better job""; Strattera works for getting shit done. Concerta works better for me.",11,1767178193.0,StratteraRx,1,0.93,False

1q0a5gk,https://v.redd.it/34a53osvqiag1,How about now?,"After my video yesterday, a lot of people here seemed genuinely shocked about the cultural difference in how a moka pot should be cleaned.
And honestly once I saw where many of the comments were coming from, it made perfect sense why it turned into a culture shock. Different coffee cultures, different habits, different “rules”.

My grandma, a wonderful Sicilian woman, cleaned everything to perfection… except her old moka pot. So here’s a short insight into why I usually just rinse mine.

That said: many of you told me I’ll experience a different taste when I clean it properly. And yes there is a difference, but to me it’s marginal, so in the end it might not matter that much. But I have to admit… seeing my pot shining again did something in me.

I also want to thank everyone who appreciated the coffee flow coming out of the moka and for the really good questions. So here’s what I do every morning to get this “crema” out of my pot:

- I hand-grind with my Comandante grinder, usually between 15 and 20 clicks. I had to try (and fail) a lot until I got what I wanted. Every brand needs a different grind level, so I tested a lot of settings.

- The beans are as freshly roasted as possible. After trying many brands, I found a roaster near my town that supplies a nearby grocery store. The beans I’m using now were roasted on December 2nd. It’s a 70/30 Arabica/Robusta blend.

- I always pour boiling water into the water chamber. I learned this from an AeroPress world champion a few years ago. She said that starting with boiling water means the coffee grounds don’t get exposed to too much heat from the stove during the brewing process, so they don’t get “roasted” again. It makes sense to me, and I’ve been doing it that way ever since.

- I don’t tamp the coffee. I keep it loose, hard to describe. Basically, I don’t use a spoon to press it down. I fill it by shaking the filter, or I tap the side with the grind container or finger so the coffee settles on its own. I also add a bit more than necessary, like a small hill on top. 

- As soon as the flow starts, I turn off the stove immediately. No more active heat.

- I’ve mastered this with my 1-cup and 3-cup pot. The 6-cup is a challenge on its own.

I hope this answers some questions and I hope you like my beautifully cleaned pot. Have a wonderful day and a Happy New Year!",23,1767177809.0,mokapot,10,0.93,False

1q0a2ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoshanFurnitures/comments/1q0a2ud/how_i_imported_60k_worth_of_custom_furniture_from/,How I Imported $60K Worth of Custom Furniture from Foshan to Australia (Complete 40ft Container Breakdown),"
Look, I've been watching Australian furniture prices for years, and honestly? It's gotten absolutely ridiculous. After getting quotes to furnish my investment property last year and nearly choking on the numbers, I decided to do something about it.

The result? I imported an entire 40ft container of custom furniture from Foshan, China for around $60,000 AUD landed cost. The same pieces from Australian retailers? Easily $180,000+.

Here's exactly how I did it and everything I learned along the way.

The Challenge
I needed to furnish a complete 4-bedroom house plus outdoor areas:

- Custom modular sofas (specific dimensions for my awkward living room layout)
- Full kitchen cabinets (non-standard measurements)
- Complete bedroom furniture sets for 4 rooms
- Outdoor pergola with custom specs
- Dining sets and misc furniture
- Storage solutions throughout
Getting quotes from Australian suppliers was genuinely depressing:
- Lead times: 16-24 weeks minimum
- Zero flexibility on measurements
- ""Custom"" meant picking from 3 preset options
- Prices that made absolutely no sense

The breaking point? A kitchen quote for $42,000. For cabinets. Just cabinets.

Why I Went With Agent in China

Look, I'll be honest - I spent about two weeks trying to do this myself. Researching Alibaba suppliers, getting quotes, trying to coordinate everything.

 Then I had a moment of clarity:
The complexity wasn't worth the 8-9% I'd save by going direct.

Here's what changed my mind:
- Language barriers (my Mandarin is non-existent)
- Quality control nightmares waiting to happen
- No clue how to verify factory credentials properly
- Coordinating 10+ different manufacturers
- Making sure everything arrived at the same time
- Biosecurity compliance (this is MASSIVE in Australia)
- One mistake could cost me thousands
Finding my agent
I found my agent through a recommendation in an expat business group on Facebook. He's based in Foshan, been doing furniture exports for 4 years, and specializes in Australian shipments (which was crucial for biosecurity compliance).

What he charged: 8-9% commission on the total order value. No flat fees, no hidden charges, no coordination fees.

What he handled:
- Factory sourcing and vetting
- Quality inspections at each factory (with detailed photo reports)
- Price negotiation (saved me about 25% off initial quotes)
- Coordinating production timelines across multiple factories
- Managing all biosecurity compliance
- Container loading supervision
- Export documentation
- Being my single point of contact for everything

Total agent fees: ~$5,580
Worth every single cent.

The Furniture Breakdown

Custom Modular Sofas (3 Complete Sets)
The Challenge: My living room has this weird alcove that makes standard sofas look absolutely ridiculous. Needed L-shaped configurations with very specific measurements to make it work.

What I ordered:

- 3 custom modular sofa sets
- Main living: 4.2m x 2.8m L-shape
- Rumpus room: 3.6m x 2.4m L-shape
- Media room: 2.8m x 2.2m compact L-shape
- Fabric: Performance linen (spill-resistant - important for investment property)
- Colors: Neutral grey and warm beige

The Process:

1. Sent detailed measurements and room photos to Vinay via WhatsApp
2. He connected me with 3 manufacturers who specialize in modular sofas
3. Got CAD drawings back within 48 hours
4. Had video calls where Vinay showed me fabric options in the factory showroom
5. Reviewed high-res photos and videos of fabric textures, colors in different lighting
6. Made adjustments to cushion depth and arm height based on what I saw
7. Approved final designs with material specifications

Cost: $8,400 AUD (Australian retail equivalent: $28,000+)

Quality Control: Vinay sent me photos at 3 production stages:
- Frame construction (solid hardwood, not particle board - he verified with close-up shots)
- Cushion filling (high-density foam, not the cheap stuff - he literally cut one open to show me)
- Final assembly and fabric application before packaging

The attention to detail here was insane. He caught that one manufacturer tried to substitute a cheaper foam and made them redo it. Didn't cost me anything extra.

Kitchen Cabinets (Complete Kitchen)

The Challenge: Australian kitchen quotes were $35,000-$45,000 for a standard kitchen. Mine had non-standard ceiling heights (2.7m) and I wanted soft-close everything, plus specific internal configurations.

What I ordered:

- 12 base cabinets (custom heights for appliances)
- 8 wall cabinets (extending to ceiling - no wasted space)
- Island bench unit (2.4m x 1.2m with storage)
- Floor-to-ceiling pantry unit
- All hardware: soft-close hinges, drawer runners, handles
- Benchtop: Didn't ship this - got quartz locally (too risky)
Materials Specified:
- Cabinet boxes: 18mm plywood (NOT MDF - this was important)
- Doors: 2-pack polyurethane finish in matte white
- Hardware: Blum soft-close (specified the actual brand, not knockoffs)
- Internal fittings: Pull-out drawers, spice racks, corner solutions

The Process:
1. Hired a local kitchen designer in Australia ($800) for detailed plans
2. Sent complete CAD drawings with measurements to Vinay
3. He found a manufacturer in Foshan specializing in export kitchens
4. They modified designs for Australian standard appliance sizes
5. Got 3D renders for approval via email
6. Had video calls where we walked through the factory showing me door samples, hardware options
7. He sent videos of the polyurethane finish being applied and curing
8. Made changes to handle styles and internal drawer configurations
9. Approved materials and finishes after seeing everything on video
Cost: $12,600 AUD (Australian equivalent: $38,000+)

Critical Detail: We were ensured all cabinets were:
- Flat-packed (saves massive shipping space and costs)
- Numbered with detailed assembly diagrams in English
- Treated for Australian biosecurity (heat treatment + certification)
- Pre-drilled for easy assembly
- Packaged with all hardware separated and labeled
The manufacturer even included extra hinges and drawer runners. That attention to detail was impressive.

Outdoor Pergola (Custom Design)
The Challenge: Wanted a 6m x 4m pergola for the backyard entertaining area. Australian quotes were $15,000-$22,000 for aluminum structures. Insane.
What I ordered:

- Powder-coated aluminum frame (marine-grade, rust-resistant)
- Adjustable louvre roof system (can control sun/shade)
- Integrated LED lighting strips in the beams
- All mounting hardware and detailed installation guide
- Custom dimensions: 6m x 4m x 3.2m height
- Color: Dulux Monument (matched to house exterior)

The Process:

1. Sent backyard photos, measurements, and design inspiration images to Vinay
2. He connected me with an outdoor structures manufacturer
3. They provided engineering drawings (important for council approval)
4. Had a video call where they showed me the aluminum profile samples, louvre mechanism
5. Vinay filmed the powder coating process so I could see the color match
6. Specified powder coat color with RAL code
7. Reviewed videos of the LED system being tested
8. Made adjustments to LED placement and louvre angle range
Cost: $8,900 AUD (Australian equivalent: $19,000+)

The pergola came with the most detailed installation manual I've ever seen. Every bolt numbered, every step photographed.

Bedroom Furniture (4 Complete Sets)

What I ordered for each bedroom:
- Queen bed frame with under-bed storage drawers
- 2 x matching bedside tables with soft-close drawers
- Wardrobe (different sizes per room - 2m, 2.4m, 2.8m, 3m widths)
- Dresser with mirror

Materials:
- Solid oak frames and oak veneer panels
- Soft-close drawer runners throughout
- Dovetail joints (sign of quality construction)
- Matching handles across all pieces
- Natural oil finish (not the cheap spray lacquer)

The Process:

1. Selected style from manufacturer's catalog 
2. Customized dimensions for each room
3. Had video calls where Vinay showed me wood samples, finish options
4. Specified internal wardrobe configurations (shelves vs hanging space)
5. Reviewed videos of drawer construction, dovetail joints being cut
6. Chose handle style and finish after seeing them on video
7. Approved wood samples and finish samples based on high-res photos and videos
Cost: $14,200 AUD total for all 4 rooms (Australian equivalent: $48,000+)


Quality Check: Vinay inspected drawer construction, joint quality, and finish consistency. He rejected one dresser that had a slight color mismatch and they remade it. Didn't cost me anything extra. He sent me before/after videos showing the issue and the corrected version.
Dining Sets & Miscellaneous Furniture

What else went in the container:

- 2 x dining tables (8-seater solid oak, 6-seater for breakfast nook)
- 16 x dining chairs (mix of upholstered and solid wood)
- 3 x coffee tables (different styles for different rooms)
- 2 x TV units with cable management
- 3 x bookshelf units (floor to ceiling)
- Outdoor dining set (aluminum table + 8 chairs, weather-resistant)
- Various side tables and console tables
Cost: $7,600 AUD

My agent helped me maximize the container space by suggesting a few additional pieces that would fit perfectly in the remaining space. Smart thinking. He literally measured out the container space and sent me a diagram showing what else could fit.

The Quality Control Process

This is where Vinay absolutely earned his commission. He personally visited each factory during production:

Inspection Points:
1. Material Verification - Confirmed actual wood species, hardware brands matched specs. He sent close-up photos of wood grain, hardware brand stamps

2. Construction Check - Joint quality, structural integrity, finish consistency. Videos of drawers being opened/closed, doors swinging

3. Functionality Test - Every drawer, door, moving part tested. He literally tested every single drawer and hinge

4. Finish Inspection - Paint/stain quality, no defects, color matching. Photos in different lighting conditions

5. Packaging Verification - Proper protection for shipping, labeling correct

He sent me detailed photo and video reports at each stage via WhatsApp. Found issues with 3 items:

- Dining chairs had wrong fabric initially (caught before production started - showed me fabric swatches on video)

- One wardrobe had a scratch on the door (they remade just the door - he sent before/after photos
)
- Sofa cushions were slightly wrong density (caught during inspection, remade - he literally sat on them and showed me the difference)

Without Vinay, I would have received all of these with problems. That alone justified his fee.
Biosecurity Compliance (THIS IS CRITICAL FOR AUSTRALIA)

Australia doesn't mess around with biosecurity. Vinay handled all of this, which was honestly the most stressful part for me to think about:

Wood Treatment Requirements:
- All solid wood: Heat treated to 56°C for minimum 30 minutes
- ISPM 15 certification for all wooden components and packaging
- Fumigation certificates where required
- Treatment stamps on all timber
Packaging Requirements:
- Absolutely no straw or hay packing materials (prohibited)
- Plastic wrap and cardboard only
- Clean, new packaging materials only
- No soil, seeds, or organic matter


Documentation Required:
- Manufacturer's Declaration (stating all materials used)
- Heat treatment certificates for each wooden item
- Phytosanitary certificate from Chinese authorities
- Detailed packing list with material specifications for every item
- Photos of treatment stamps
Cost of compliance: Included in agent's coordination, but he said it typically costs $600-800 if done separately.

The documentation was perfect. Not a single issue at Australian customs. Vinay sent me scanned copies of everything before shipping so I could review it.


Container Loading Day

Vinay supervised the entire loading process in Foshan. This was absolutely crucial because:
Strategic Loading Order:

1. Heavy items first (pergola, kitchen cabinets) at the bottom and front
2. Sofas and upholstered items in the middle
3. Fragile items (mirrors, glass) at the top
4. Everything strapped, secured, and braced
5. Gaps filled with smaller items to prevent shifting
Container Specifications:


- 40ft High Cube container
- Internal dimensions: 12.03m x 2.35m x 2.69m
- Total cubic meters: ~76 CBM
- Maximum payload: 26,300 kg

What Actually Fit:

- All furniture listed above
- Still had about 7 CBM of space left
- Vinay suggested adding some extra outdoor chairs and side tables
- Final weight: ~8,200 kg (well under limit)
Vinay sent me a complete video walkthrough of the loaded container before sealing. I could see everything was properly secured and protected. That peace of mind was priceless. The video was like 15 minutes long, showing every section of the container.

The Real Cost Breakdown
Furniture FOB (Free On Board) Price:
- Sofas: $8,400
- Kitchen cabinets: $12,600
- Pergola: $8,900

Actual Savings: $116,493
ROI: 170% savings

Even accounting for my time (maybe 50 hours total), this was an absolute no-brainer.
The Freight Forwarder Experience
Vinay recommended a freight forwarder he works with regularly (they handle his shipments weekly). They were excellent:

In China:
- Container pickup from Foshan factories
- Transport to Guangzhou port
- Export customs clearance
- Bill of lading preparation
- Container tracking

In Australia:
- Import customs declaration lodgement
- Biosecurity inspection coordination
- Communication with Department of Agriculture
- Port to door delivery arrangement
- Unpacking at my property (I paid extra $180 for this)

Communication: They had an Australian office in Sydney, so I could call during business hours. Made a huge difference compared to dealing with time zones.

Australian Customs & Quarantine Process
What Actually Happened:
Day 1: Container arrived at Port Botany, Sydney Day 2: Freight forwarder lodged import declaration electronically
 Day 3: Biosecurity inspection scheduled (mandatory for wooden furniture)
 Day 4: Inspector physically checked:


- Treatment certificates matched items
- Random physical inspection of items
- Packaging materials inspection
- No signs of pests, soil, or contamination
- Treatment stamps visible on timber

 Day 5: Clearance granted, container released for delivery


Pro Tip: Having all documentation absolutely perfect meant zero delays. I've heard horror stories of people waiting 3-4 weeks because of missing paperwork or incorrect treatment certificates.


Delivery Day

Container truck arrived at my property at 8:00 AM sharp. Two guys unloaded everything into my garage in about 2.5 hours.

Condition Check:
- 99% perfect condition
- 2 dining chair legs had very minor scratches (not visible when assembled)
- 1 cabinet door had a tiny dent on the back panel (not visible when installed)
- Everything else: flawless
Packaging Quality:
- Everything wrapped in thick cardboard and multiple layers of plastic
- All corners protected with foam edge protectors
- Fragile items double-boxed with ""FRAGILE"" stickers
- Assembly hardware in clearly labeled bags (in English!)
- Instruction manuals for everything
Honestly, the packaging was better than most Australian furniture I've bought.
Assembly & Installation


What I Did Myself:
- Assembled all bedroom furniture (pretty straightforward with the instructions)
- Put together dining tables and chairs
- Installed TV units and bookshelves
- Assembled outdoor furniture


Total time: About 3 full days spread over 2 weeks
What I Hired Out:


- Kitchen installation: $2,800 (local carpenter, took 3 days, excellent work)
- Pergola installation: $1,800 (took 2 days, needed 2 people for safety)
- Sofa assembly: $400 (they're heavy and awkward, worth paying)

Total Installation Costs: $5,000


Installation Experience: The carpenter who did my kitchen was impressed with the quality. He said the cabinets were better than most Australian-made ones he's installed. The pre-drilling was perfect, everything lined up, hardware was quality.

Problems I Encountered (And How They Were Solved)

Problem 1: Communication Time Zones
- Vinay was 2-3 hours ahead (depending on daylight saving)

- Solution: Used WhatsApp for async communication, scheduled video calls for important decisions. Worked perfectly.

Problem 2: Seeing Samples Without Visiting
- Couldn't physically touch fabrics and finishes before ordering

- Solution: Vinay did detailed video calls from factory showrooms, showing me everything in different lighting. He'd literally walk around with his phone showing me samples from every angle. Also sent high-res photos and videos of materials

.
Problem 3: Minor Hardware Substitution
- Some drawer runners weren't Blum as specified (cheaper Chinese alternatives)
- Solution: Vinay caught this during inspection, negotiated a $420 refund. I replaced them locally for $280. Net positive

.
Problem 4: Pergola Engineering Documentation
- Australian council wanted specific wind load calculations
- Solution: Vinay got the manufacturer to provide detailed engineering specs with calculations. Took an extra week but council approved it.


Problem 5: Container Delivery Timing
- Original delivery date changed due to port congestion (not Vinay's fault)
- Solution: Freight forwarder kept me updated daily. Only delayed 4 days total. Not a big deal.


Problem 6: One Wardrobe Door Slightly Off
- During assembly, one wardrobe door didn't align perfectly
- Solution: Local carpenter adjusted it in 10 minutes. Minor issue, easily fixed.

6. Schedule More Video Calls Earlier Start video calls with Vinay at factories 2-3 months before ordering. I was too eager and rushed this part. The video calls were incredibly valuable.


7. Get Multiple Agent Quotes I went with the first agent recommended to me. Should have interviewed 2-3 to compare services, fees, and communication styles.


8. Budget More for Local Installation I underestimated local installation costs. Budget at least 8-10% of furniture cost for assembly/installation.


9. Request More Progress Videos I relied on photos and videos. Should have asked for even more detailed videos during production, especially of internal construction.


10. Plan Delivery Timing Better I had the container delivered when I was still doing other renovations. Should have coordinated better so I could install everything immediately.


11. Get Benchtops Quoted Earlier Waiting until after cabinets arrived to get benchtop quotes was stressful. Should have had this organized beforehand.


Why Using Agent Was Worth It

Time Saved:
- No factory hunting (he had vetted suppliers ready)
- No back-and-forth with multiple manufacturers in broken English
- No translation issues or miscommunications
- Single point of contact for everything
- He handled all the stressful parts
Money Saved:
- Negotiated 18-25% off initial factory quotes (saved ~$9,300 - $12,900)
- Caught quality issues before shipping (saved potential thousands in replacements)
- Ensured proper biosecurity compliance (avoided potential fines/delays)
- Coordinated production timing so everything was ready together (saved on storage fees)
Stress Saved:
- Didn't have to worry about getting scammed
- Professional quality control at every stage
- Proper documentation handled correctly
- Insurance claims support available (didn't need it, but good to have)
- Someone who understood both Chinese manufacturing and Australian requirements
What 8-9% Commission Got Me:
- Factory vetting and selection
- Price negotiation with manufacturers
- Custom design coordination via video calls
- Quality inspections (3 stages per item with photo/video reports)
- Production timeline management across 5 factories
- Complete biosecurity compliance handling
- All export documentation
- Container loading supervision with video walkthrough
- Shipping coordination
- Problem resolution throughout
- Peace of mind
Would I Do It Without an Agent?
For a single item? Maybe.
For $60K+ of custom furniture across multiple manufacturers? Absolutely not.
The risk is too high, the complexity too great, and the potential for costly mistakes too real. Vinay's 9% was the best money I spent on this entire project.
Is This Actually Worth It?
The Math:
Total Investment:
- Furniture landed cost: $68,507
- Installation: $5,000
- Kitchen designer: $800
- My time (design, coordination, assembly): ~50 hours
- Total: $74,307
Australian Retail Equivalent:
- Conservative estimate based on actual quotes: $185,000
- Savings: $110,693
ROI: 149% savings
Break-Even Analysis: Even if I valued my time at $150/hour (which is high), I still saved $103,193.
Per-Item Savings:
- Sofas: Saved $19,600
- Kitchen: Saved $25,400
- Pergola: Saved $10,100
- Bedrooms: Saved $33,800
- Everything else: Saved $21,793
Every single category had massive savings.
Who Should Consider This?
This Makes Sense If:
- You need $30K+ of furniture (container economics work better)
- You want custom sizes/configurations not available locally
- You're furnishing multiple rooms or properties
- You're okay with 3-4 month timeline
- You can handle or pay for assembly/installation
- You're comfortable with video calls and photos instead of physically seeing samples
Skip This If:
- You need furniture urgently (under 1 month)
- You're only buying 1-2 pieces
- You can't handle the coordination effort (even with an agent)
- You absolutely must see and touch everything in person first
- You're extremely risk-averse
- You don't have space to receive a container delivery
The Foshan Furniture Market
For those curious about Foshan:
What's There:
- 3,000+ furniture manufacturers
- Everything from budget to luxury tier
- Specializations: Modern, classic, outdoor, commercial, custom
- Entire districts dedicated to specific furniture types
- Massive wholesale markets
- International buyer services
Quality Range:
- Budget tier: IKEA-equivalent quality
- Mid-tier: Freedom/Fantastic Furniture quality
- High-tier: King Living/Jardan quality (what I ordered)
- Luxury tier: Custom designer level
What I Ordered: Mid-to-high tier. Solid construction, quality materials, excellent finishes. Not luxury designer pieces, but way better than flat-pack and comparable to high-end Australian brands.
Tips for Finding Your Own Agent
Where to Look:
- Expat business groups (Facebook, LinkedIn, WeChat)
- Trade show contacts (if you can visit Foshan)
- Referrals from others who've imported (best option)
- Alibaba (some agents have profiles, but verify carefully)
- Furniture industry forums
What to Ask Potential Agents:
- How long in business?
- Specialization? (furniture specifically, not general goods)
- Commission structure? (percentage vs flat fee)
- Detailed quality control process?
- How many Australian clients? (biosecurity knowledge crucial)
- Can they provide references?
- What's included in their service?
- How do they handle quality checks? (photos, videos, in-person?)
- Do they do video calls from factories?
Red Flags:
- Asking for full payment upfront
- No physical office address in China
- Can't provide verifiable references
- Vague about QC process
- Promises unrealistic timelines
- Unclear fee structure
- Poor English communication (you'll struggle throughout)
- Won't do video calls or factory visits
Green Flags:
- Established business (5+ years)
- Clear, transparent fee structure
- Detailed QC process with photo/video documentation
- Multiple Australian client references
- Responsive communication
- Transparent about challenges and timelines
- Understands Australian biosecurity requirements
- Has relationships with freight forwarders
- Willing to do video calls from factories
Resources That Helped Me
Australian Side:
- Australian Border Force website (biosecurity requirements)
- Department of Agriculture (wood treatment standards)
- ChAFTA agreement details (for duty-free confirmation)
- Local council (for pergola approval requirements)
Chinese Side:
- Vinay (my agent - happy to share contact if people DM me)
- Foshan Furniture Fair information (if you want to visit in person)
Tools I Used:
- WhatsApp / wechat (communication with Vinay - video calls, photos, messages)
- Google Sheets (tracking everything - costs, timelines, specifications)
- Shipment tracking apps
- Currency converter (AUD/CNY rates fluctuate)
- Google Drive (storing all documentation, photos, and videos)
Final Thoughts
Importing furniture from Foshan using Vinay as my agent was genuinely one of the best decisions I made for this property. The savings were massive ($110K+), the quality exceeded my expectations, and I got exactly what I wanted in terms of customization.
The key was absolutely using an agent. Agent commission was worth every cent for the time saved, stress avoided, quality ensured, and problems prevented. The video calls from factories were game-changers - I could see everything without flying to China. Trying to do this myself would have been a complete nightmare and likely would have cost me more in mistakes.
Timeline Reality: This isn't quick. From first contact with Vinay to delivery was about 2-3 months. But for $110K+ in savings? I'd wait twice as long.
Quality Verdict: Everything arrived in excellent condition. The furniture is solid, well-made, and looks fantastic. A few very minor issues (scratches, tiny dent) but nothing that affected functionality or appearance. Quality is genuinely better than most Australian furniture I've bought at similar price points.
Would I Do It Again? 100% yes. Already planning to import outdoor furniture and some additional pieces for another property. Now that I know the process and have Vinay, it's even easier.",1,1767177532.0,FoshanFurnitures,0,1.0,False

I love a good super-subjective year-end best list for TV, songs, whatever — something you can happily concur with, or take strenuous objection to, and most of all get ideas for something fresh to check out in the new year.  
  
I thought it would be fun to do one for ice cream. Over the past year, I've been ordering a different new-to-me brand each month from around the country to try (and share with friends at our weekly TV night). So my list is the top flavors I tried for the first time in 2025 — 25 trying to be clever, but then I totally cheated with ties, so it's really 30 if someone wants to audit me, and then a few honorable mentions (but we're here for sugar and cream, not math).  
  
The absence of esteemed brands (Haagen Dazs and Ben & Jerry's) means only that I tried many of their flavors in previous years and didn't buy them much in 2025 since i was focusing on ones I got through shipping (Graeter's, Clementine's, Blue Bell) and others I sought out at the Whole Foods and other summer sales (Van Leeuwen, Jeni's), thanks to recommendations from this sub. I didn't want to make this even longer with flavor descriptions, but I'm quite happy to share mini reviews in the comments for any flavors that someone wants to know more about.

I am curious what others enjoyed this year. So please share your lists — it could be top 5 or 10 or 100, whatever — of anything you like: New flavors or any ice creams you tried this year, or favorite finds at the Whole Foods sale, or great limited editions (I did a bonus top 10 for those, too). Or, if you prefer, just comment to agree with flavors that you like or tell me what I like sucks. That's the fun of year-end lists!

1q09yv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetprojectors/comments/1q09yv5/help_deciding_short_throw_100_projector_in/,"Help deciding short throw 100"" projector in Thailand","Hi, I used to have more than 10 years ago an already old Epson projector. Today I'm looking to recreate a set-up, but I got lost in the sea of choices for the projector as well as the screen...

I'm in Thailand.

Projector will be set on a coffee table in between the sofa and the screen. Distance from projo to screen is 3 to 3.5 meters.

Budget is around 500$ projector and 100$ (?) for the screen. No specific reason to go for lamp or LCD... 

I will watch movies only (no gaming) at night and was thinking of a 100"" or 120"" screen size.

I have a hi-fi system that will need to connect to the projector (how cable or wifi?)

I'd prefer to avoid to look for used ones, as well as shipping from outside of south east asia.

So far I have looked at short throw model like the Wanbo X5 Pro, Xiaomi L1 pro, Yaber U11, Xgimi MoGo 2 Pro, TCL C1, BenQ MW560C, Sony VPL-EW578, Epson EB-E12 etc.

Any advice on projector brand and model and matching screen type (for short throw... not UST I guess).

The last week of 2025 has been hell and had me dreaming of previous days of ""well enough"" as a response to people asking how I am. So I get it, being sole bread winner and doing just about everything around the house plus some, is exhausting.

The situation went like this. I was sitting on the couch, very nauseous. My husband (M27) asked me to put something away from the coffee table. I said no, I was too nauseous to do that right that second. Plus I needed to use it before I gave it back to the friend I borrowed it from.

I managed to use said utensil for a short period before becoming to nauseous again. I am then messaging a newfound friend who went a LONG way out of their way to show me kindness for no reason at all. I was responding to messages and when husband asked again if I could put stuff away, I stated again that I'm nauseous right now. He asked why I'm on my phone then? (Screen time can, but doesn't always antagonise the nausea). I said ""because this person has shown me huge kindness through doing me a big favour, so I want to and feel obliged to reply as somewhat a small show of appreciation."" 

His response was ""Well i do a lot of favours for you at the moment too, so you'd think you could do what I ask occasionally."" That wrecked me. I called him a jerk. I said I understand I'm not carrying any of the load at the moment, but it's not considered ""doing favours"" for each other when you're in a committed relationship.... it's just considered loving your spouse. I went to bed without dinner. I am so hurt. Am I totally overreacting?
