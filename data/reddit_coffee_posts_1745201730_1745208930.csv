## What is BRUA BOOST?

BRUA BOOST is a **crypto trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to help users trade assets — even if they have zero trading experience. Its primary appeal is automation. You set your preferences, and the platform takes care of the rest. It's designed to analyze market trends in real-time and execute trades that align with your risk level and goals.

Think of it as your personal trading assistant that doesn’t sleep. Whether you're into Bitcoin, Ethereum, stocks, or commodities, BRUA BOOST claims to offer a **diverse asset selection**, allowing users to diversify their portfolios without hopping between multiple platforms.

## Who Created BRUA BOOST?

The platform’s creators aren’t exactly public figures, which is fairly common in the crypto and fintech space. What we do know is that the team includes experienced developers, financial analysts, and crypto enthusiasts who have worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

While the anonymity might raise eyebrows, it's not necessarily a red flag. Many successful trading platforms started with small, anonymous teams before scaling up. What matters more is how the platform performs and whether users are actually getting value from it — and so far, BRUA BOOST seems to be hitting the right notes.

1k44udo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1k44udo/ashton_hall_is_white/,ASHTON HALL IS WHITE!!!!!,"There was a girl so beautiful, the sun would get jealous when she walked outside. Birds would literally stop mid-flight just to stare at her, and even the flowers seemed to bloom a little brighter when she passed by. Her name? **Emma.**

Now, Emma wasn’t just *pretty*. Oh no. She was the kind of pretty that made people forget how to breathe. Like, if you were just casually sipping your coffee and Emma walked into the room, you’d suddenly forget how to use a straw. People would choke on their drinks. That’s how stunning she was. She was the human equivalent of seeing a unicorn eat pizza in a field of rainbows.

But here’s where it gets funny.

Emma didn’t even know she was this pretty. In fact, she was so humble, she thought her beauty was just “average” because every time someone complimented her, she’d go, “Nah, I’m just regular. Like, 6/10 on a good day.”

Her friends? They’d just roll their eyes. “Emma, you’re literally the reason we all have self-esteem issues, please stop.”

One day, Emma decided she wanted to test the “power of beauty.” She thought, “What would happen if I walked into a room with zero makeup, wearing sweatpants, and my hair in a messy bun?” So, she walked into her favorite coffee shop looking like she just rolled out of bed. No makeup, just the raw *Emma*.

She walked in, and immediately, the barista—who had been staring blankly at the espresso machine—dropped a cup, spilled milk everywhere, and just stood there, dumbfounded. Emma was like, “Uh, sorry, I just need a latte?” The guy nodded, unable to form words. His co-worker had to step in and make her coffee while muttering, “What just happened?”

Emma shrugged, clueless about the chaos she had just caused. “I didn’t even do anything.”

Meanwhile, a guy sitting by the window, trying to enjoy his coffee, literally stared at her like she was an alien who just landed on Earth. He didn’t blink for a solid two minutes. Then, he looked at his own reflection in the coffee, sighed deeply, and said, “I’m never going to be this cool. I should just leave.” And then he did.

The funniest part? As Emma sat down with her latte, someone walked by and literally tripped over a chair because they were so distracted by her. It was like they’d seen the *Sun* in human form and just... lost their footing. Emma didn’t even notice, but her friend, Sarah, laughed so hard she almost choked on her muffin.

By the end of the day, Emma was trending on social media as the “Girl Who Stunned an Entire Coffee Shop into Silence.” People were sharing pictures of her from various angles (because, honestly, no one could figure out how she could look that good without trying).

Emma, as usual, didn’t understand the hype. She just went home, watched some Netflix, and ate a whole pizza by herself—because beauty, apparently, doesn’t stop you from enjoying *comfort food.*

And that’s the tale of Emma, the prettiest girl ever, who didn’t even know she had the ability to make people spill their drinks, trip over their feet, or get completely distracted from basic human functions.",1,1745208851.0,SGExams,0,1.0,False

Does alcoholic or non-alcoholic matter too?,"I've recently discovered the awesomeness of riding out low variance low minimum video poker while getting free beverages at Las Vegas casinos. However, I know beverages at casinos aren't really free since one of course must fully tip fine cocktail servers who deserve the most respect possible as generally awesome folks giving patrons a good experience!

The question I have is how much should one tip cocktail servers in order to find the sweet spot of being neither offensively cheap nor unnecessarily generous to the point one is better off just going directly to a bar or coffee shop and buying beverages directly?

I know one could tip a dollar per drink and probably be fine, though that seems so tacky and cheap given all the inflation of the past decades. Personally, I think three dollars per non-alcoholic drink and five dollars per alcoholic drink seems to make sense to me, but I am curious what others think? Maybe cheap beer deserves less tip than a mixed drink too?

Does the niceness of the casino and level of stakes you are playing at your game matter too?

Excited to hear folks' opinions!

I have some trips coming up this summer and would love to move past my Uniqlo crescent bag. The idea is to get something nicer that I can use hands-free while traveling and also go for a night out with. I already have a Coach Brooklyn 28 that I LOVE for day-to-day things but would like a crossbody that’s more secure while traveling. 

So here’s my criteria:
- ideally under $200 (could maaaaybe push to $250 if I find something amazing, welcome to grad student life🥲)
- leather only!
- must be a crossbody (or have a convertible strap that’s leather; not a fan of fabric straps on leather bags!)
- either zip top or flap top (aka secure)
- should be able to fit a small water bottle!!! Mine measures 7cm x 22cm (roughly 2.8in x 8.8in), and should fit with my wallet, keys, phone, and AirPods. This basically means that the bag should not have any dividers or multiple compartments, since I find that larger objects just never fit in those bags!
- somewhat slouchy
- is versatile, with a nice day-to-night transition

Here’s my shortlist so far:
- The Coach Outlet Kailey: I like the fact that it’s under my budget, comes in many color ways, seems spacious, and is just a simple, classic silhouette. My water bottle will be a tight fit though! I scrolled through some other Outlet options, but I find that this is the only one that’s slightly slouchy (as compared to say the Teri)
- The Horse Clementine: the sub’s favorite child of course made it to the list. LOVE the slouch and top handle, but a little out of budget ($215 with the welcome offer). My preferred color (coffee) doesn’t come in my preferred hardware (gold), but that’s a secondary concern for me. A slightly bigger concern is that I find the crossbody strap a tad too thick, which I fear may not look very elegant if I choose to wear it on a fancy night out. Overall a little bulky I guess!
- Quince Puzzle dupe: the sub’s least favorite child also made it lol! I like its similarities to the Horse bag at a much more affordable price, but it doesn’t seem to have its slouch, and the lack of color options isn’t ideal either. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on these bags! And if you have any suggestions that fit the bill, please let me know!

Edit: I should mention that I LOVE the Coach Juliet bags, but they’re way out of my budget right now. But I’m open to scouring the second-hand market for similar items!",1,1745208550.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

## What is Ethereum 13X Olux?

Ethereum 13X Olux is an **automated crypto trading system** designed to help users trade digital assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others without having to manually analyze the market all day. It uses pre-built algorithms and AI to scan market data, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades on your behalf.

Think of it as a kind of smart assistant for trading. It’s built for people who want to potentially profit from the crypto market but don’t have the time or experience to day trade manually. From what I’ve seen, it’s especially useful for beginners or passive investors.

## Who Created Ethereum 13X Olux?

There’s not a ton of public information about the **founders of Ethereum 13X Olux**, which is pretty typical for platforms in this category. What we do know is that it appears to be developed by a group of fintech and crypto enthusiasts who claim to have backgrounds in algorithmic trading and blockchain tech.

While anonymity raises a few eyebrows, this isn’t uncommon in the crypto space. Similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also launched without a big-name founder. That said, I always recommend doing your own due diligence before investing.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Ethereum 13X Olux Today](https://tinyurl.com/4ys2vv4w)
## How Does Ethereum 13X Olux Work?

Ethereum 13X Olux works by using **algorithmic trading bots** and **real-time data analysis** to detect market trends and execute buy/sell orders based on pre-set parameters. The platform connects you to a broker (usually one that's regulated, according to their claims), and your funds are used to trade assets automatically.

My problem now is that I’ve found myself in limerence once again, just with someone else this time. I met this guy through work at the end of last year and had a handful of interactions with him during the first couple months of the year, all of which were pretty brief. However, there was this extremely intense vibe between the two of us, I don’t know how to describe it because I’ve never felt anything like it. He clearly picked up on it too and was flirty with me, but I couldn’t really act on it because of the nature of my job (trying to be vague since I have a weirdly specific occupation, the chances of someone I know finding this post are low but I would DIE if that happened). However, my situation at work has changed and made it so that I no longer see him, I knew this was going to happen and was actually considering asking if he wanted to go for coffee or something, but due to unforeseen and unrelated circumstances, it ended up happening sooner than I expected and I didn’t get the chance.

I’ve become obsessed with him since then, in a similar way to when I was in limerence before - spending all my time daydreaming about being with him and wishing we could be in a relationship. It sucks because chances are I’ll never see him again, we live in a small to medium sized town so I guess it’s not impossible (FWIW we did cross paths at a local event about a month ago and had the same intense eye contact + vibes, he also smiled and sort of half-waved at me but I panicked and ran away LOL.) but the odds aren’t great. For some reason this is so much harder, feeling like we COULD be together and I COULD have the relationship I’m dreaming of with him, if I could only find him again!

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1juukhb/my_27f_ex_26m_dumped_me_in_january_after_9_years/)**: April 8, 2025**

**Title:** My (27f) ex (26m) dumped me in January after 9 years together because he didn’t think i was wife material now he reached out wanting to talk because he needs to get something off his chest I don’t know why he doing this or if I should met him?

I was with my ex who I will call Nate because if I’m being honest minus betraying a friend I was a Cassie

I don’t want to go to much into the details but for the last nine years I lost myself to Nate he was my world everything I did was for him, I helped him though depression, help get/keep his grades up even worked two jobs so he could focus on collage when his parents disowned him for nearly 3 years because they didn’t agree with the major or collage he choose bare in mind I was also a collage student

when his parents started talking to him again and started to financial support him we moved into a new apartment Nate said he wanted me to quit my job (I didn’t) because it was his turn to take care of me . For 16 months everything was great he spoiled me than I noticed he was more interested in his new friends at times he ignored me completely

Back in December he did a 180 and he loved bombed me the whole month he really went out of his way to make Christmas magical for me i honestly believed he was going to propose on January the 2nd he made me my favourite dinner and made this speech about me being his first love how I’ve been there since high school I kept thinking any minute now he’s gonna ask me to marry him

But no he dumped me as his speech went on my world fell apart and as much he tried to sugar coat it he basically said “you were a good girlfriend but that’s what you always be to me a girlfriend I don’t see you as my wife or the mother of my children blah blah you served your purpose now I don’t need you anymore blah blah I need someone on my level blah blah you’re a gold digger blah I’ll give you 30 days to move out”

I couldn’t speak and he stared at me looking for a response I think this lasted 20 minutes before he said he’d sleep in the guest room than left, strangely I didn’t cry or get angry I just ordered cardboard boxes online than went to bed. The next day I waited for him to leave the apartment before I left my room than I called my boss asked (begged really) if I could transfer anywhere she told me there wasn’t anything but if something came up in my department she’d consider me. I than reached out to everyone I knew that wasn’t also Nate’s friend for a place to stay my cousin invited me to stay in her spare room for as long as I needed and I could move in straight away so that was amazing, in the four days it took me too pack my stuff and move out I didn’t see or speak to Nate I doubt he even noticed

I didn’t trust myself at the time to ignore a “you up text” so I blocked him and everyone close to him even changed me number/email to make sure he couldn’t reach me. The first night at my cousins was the night everything hit me I think I cried every night the first month i honestly felt like shit i thought about what Nate said over and over again it made me feel so low like I was nothing he only stayed with me because I was just there but thankfully my cousin sent for my mom,other cousins and real friends to give me an intervention which I badly needed , I believe that first month I wouldn’t have made it without my cousin

I’m still healing and waiting on that job transfer because I feel like if I’m not in the same city as nate and I have a place of my own the fresh start would do me the world of good.

I thought by now I’d be a distant memory for Nate but shockingly he sent flowers to my job today for my brithday which was on Sunday apparently he went to my parents house looking for me too and my mom admitted he’s been before dropping off stuff and tried to ask questions about me but they told him to fuck off

The flowers came with a card saying “dear cassie happy belated birthday I’ve been thinking about you for non stop for the last few months especially with how everything ended I need to get something off my chest that I feel will haunt me for the rest of my life if I don’t tell you this to your face but I’ve no way of contacting you if it’s possible can we meet up in the near future -Nate”

What could he want? What’s haunting him he needs to say to my face?  
Everyone in my life is telling me ignore him but they hate him

I’m torn but I can’t lie my curiosity is telling me meet him to see what he wants Has anyone been in my shoes or in Nates?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Top Comment: NGL I didn't read all that, I just wanted to say... just bc he needs to say something doesn't mean you need to hear it. I doubt it's anything that would add vakue to your life, he's likely wanting to alleviate guilt for some long ago tresspass

>**OOP:** My cousin thinks he tried to monkey branch and it didn’t work out *\[editor's note- monkey branching means he was already emotionally connecting (at least) with someone else before breaking up with OOP\]*

Commenter: Seems like he cheated on you back in December before the love bombing. Now, this dumb ass cheater is probably engaged to the affair partner, hence the wife material comment. Fuck him. Let him implode that relationship just like he imploded yours. He's not a good human, and he's trying to make himself feel better about something. He doesn't deserve that. And he doesn't deserve your time or energy.

>**OOP:** You know what’s pathetic? If he cheated and told me that was the reason he was breaking up with me wouldn’t I don’t think it have hurt me as much

*Get checked for STD's:*

**OOP:** Oh I didn’t think of that now I’m panicking

>**gdrom123:** Besides the STD test (which I agree with because I also suspect he was cheating), let your job know to turn him away if he shows up. The last thing you need is him stalking you.  
You don’t owe him closure. He wants to absolve himself of his guilt by dumping it onto you. It’s not your burden to bear. Whatever is torturing him is of his own doing. You have no idea how you’ll handle whatever he wants to tell you. What if you slip back into despair? Are you willing to let your curiosity potentially expose you to further emotional trauma? Ultimately it’s up to you to meet up with him. Take sometime to process all of this before deciding.

*Is he blocked everywhere:*

>Blocked on social media and my accounts are set to private new number and his number is blocked and deleted I didn’t trust myself for the first few weeks because back in January a “you up” text would have had me running bare foot at 2am

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1juukhb/comment/mmbifx7/?context=3)**: April 9, 2025 (Next Day)**

He came to my work today looking for me during lunchtime I told the receptionist say I was out and caught a ride home with a coworker so I wouldn’t met him if he planed to run into me by accident

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jz3xc3/my_27f_ex_26m_dumped_me_in_january_after_9_years/)**: April 14, 2025 (5 days later, 6 from OG post)**

So we ended up meeting and no I didn’t go to him

I had told the receptionist at my work if he came looking for just say I’m out for the day after he showed up once I didn’t want the drama of him around my job.

So nate just kept going to my usual places like the grocery store I go every Saturday evening or the park I ran at Sunday mornings (his words) till he would eventually run into me

And he did yesterday he was waiting at the coffee shop I go to after my morning run. When I saw him I tried to do turn around and leave but he kept calling me so I thought to myself if everything went pear shaped a coffee shop would be safer than my walk home

So I just sat down and asked him what he wanted He gave an apology that wasn’t an apology you know the type with “I’m sorry but” and “pity me” he blamed his mental health ,his job his parents,his friends everyone but himself

I took someone’s adivce on here and said “cut the crap I already know everything” he genuinely looked shocked and stared at me for a second I guess he thought his coworker already told me everything so he couldn’t lie

Here’s what really happened he fell for a girl in his office when he told me her name I knew her immediately I’ve met her a few times. He told for the last two years he idolised her (to be fair she’s beautiful with an amazing personality) and he hated me because I was the one stopping them from being together because his coworker was too classy to be a side piece. When he broke up with me he confessed to her that he was madly in love with her and he ended a 9 year relationship to be with her

Well here’s were it gets funny she doesn’t even like him lol she called him a piece of trash and told him if he ever spoke to her outside work she’d report him to HR. So I asked him what has any of this got to do with me like we are over I clearly cut ties there’s no reason for us to speak?

He wants to try again promised we’d get married before the year ends that we belong together, I told him no I’m nobodies second choice he threw me away after 9 years and said some pretty cruel things to me and now he thinks if he snaps his fingers I’ll come running back, he tried to beg and fake tears bringing the good times in our relationship

I told him please leave me alone as he wasted too much of my time already. I texted my cousin to meet me at the coffee shop he kept saying nonsense even suggested if I went to couples counselling for a few months he’d leave me alone the 20 minutes it took for my cousin to arrive felt like 20 years

In the end I just stopped listening and stood at the counter making small talk with baristas till my cousin arrived, she told him to fuck off and if he tried to follow us she’d call her brothers

He stayed in the coffee shop as far as I know and we just went home that’s it

It’s only been a day but I feel like it’s over and I’m free of him

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: You're being stalked. Change your routine.

>**OOP:** Yeah I’m gonna do this as I run at 6am so not a lot of people around gonna miss that coffee shop tho they made the best breakfast wraps but I’m not taking any chances and I’ll go grocery shopping with my cousin

Commenter: You dodged a bullet.

I hope your job has an opening in another city soon.

>**OOP:** Me too I’ve been talking to people on here and irl kinda a bit freaked out with the stories of how bad things can get. Hopefully he will just leave me alone

1k44ola,https://www.reddit.com/r/derealization/comments/1k44ola/question_for_peeps_with_dpdr/,Question for peeps with DPDR,"So I am coming off of an 18 year period of constant drug use, I know my body and mind will need to adjust. I think the look of the world around me being different (what I have come to think of as derealization after googling to try to find what could be going on with me) I really noticed after I came home from rehab in November 2023. So that’s when I transitioned from street opiates to suboxone. I noticed that trees, sky, the landscape etc looked very different, as in colors were brighter and at first I just thought it was due to being off the street opiates. I thought (and still think) I had tunnel vision when I was using and never stopped to look at the world around me and everything was maybe grayer, less colorful? So I thought wow things are prettier than I have ever thought that’s kinda cool. I thought that could be normal.


Now, a year and a half later I am coming off the long term injection version of buprenorphine. I have had a negative test result and then a positive and I have read that you can intermittently pop dirty for bupe when coming off of this injection. And that’s fine, I’m saying that to say I believe I am very near being 100% clean from opiates (finally!) so over the last year and a half I believe my anxiety also rose quite a bit as the medication has been decreasing in my system. 


I also feel like the anxiety has been getting in the way of me being able to competently do my job and live my life which sucks. It’s the combo of the dpdr and anxiety and my brain adjusting. I feel like a dummy. I forget things immediately. I’m like the fish on finding Nemo I feel like I have no internal timeline where I can know when things happened. Something could have happened a week ago, 2 weeks ago, 3 months ago I have no idea. I also have aphantasia ( I cannot visualize anything in my mind). I can still remember some memories but it has to be triggered by something. I wonder if this contributes to not feeling connected to myself or my past. It literally feels like I did not live my life up until this point, like that was someone else. I wonder if that’s also why I am so bad at basically everything, I can’t picture anything in my mind at all. Period. And I don’t know if I’ve always been like this. I know it’s been this way for awhile but like I said my memory is terrible. I also feel like I don’t know myself very well because I’ve never really been clean and sober in so many years. Like I have no identity almost because my whole world and whole life was getting using and being high. So that could be normal for my situation too.

I have this spacey feeling all the time. Even in like having a conversation with someone I can’t like keep track in my head of what I’ve said so far or what they’ve said so far it’s so hard. Of course all of this doesn’t make me want to be around people all the time. I also have very bad depth perception and I have a feeling like I’m kinda floating when I walk. Like I just don’t relate to the world in the same way as I did before like spatially. Like watching cars drive by looks so weird something about the way things look it doesn’t look real. 

I stopped smoking cigarettes a week ago. I couldn’t believe it but my anxiety went down so much. My hands are steady and I’m way calmer. I used to feel like the derealization was constant. Over the last few days I’ve actually realized I’m not noticing it. Like I used to get up go smoke a cigarette and that’s when I would first notice it, when I went outside and then I would just constantly have high anxiety and notice how the trees, world etc looked. But today I got up, got ready, went out to my car and drove to get coffee, parked and drank coffee, ate my sandwich and then only when I went to pull out onto the street from there I suddenly realized I hadn’t noticed the way the world looked at all up until that point. And my anxiety is way lower while driving. So yesterday I noticed once I was in my car and down the driveway almost to the street that I hadn’t fixated on my surroundings. So I’m hesitantly being hopeful that this is starting to go away slowly? I feel like I was noticing it constantly up until I quit smoking. I never noticed any times where I wasn’t focused on it before. 


So my question if anyone read this I know it’s long is do you relate to anything I’ve said? I’m just not sure what of all these things is from the long term drug use and my brain adjusting or if I actually have a mental health condition now or just brain damage? Is any of what I described actually DPDR? Sorry for the long post it’s very hard to write a cohesive post that makes sense while trying to include what I want to include. This is literally the best I can come up with lol ",1,1745208293.0,derealization,0,1.0,False

i went to a yoga class for the first time because i thought it would make me feel centered and at peace with the world. the instructor told me to “let go of my tension” but all i could think about was how my legs felt like two wet noodles and my back was making the most unholy creaking sound. at one point, i accidentally farted during a downward dog, and the whole class heard it. the instructor just looked at me and said, “it’s okay, let it out.” i think i’ve found my true calling: unintentional comedy.

I ended up eating cereal for dinner while staring at the stove like it betrayed me.

i went to the gym yesterday. i put on my workout clothes, stretched, and then spent 20 minutes looking at the machines, trying to figure out how to use them without looking like a complete idiot. eventually, i just walked on the treadmill for 10 minutes while pretending to check my phone. i think i burned like 3 calories just from awkwardly existing. i’m calling it a win.

my friend told me to “get out of my comfort zone” and try something new, so I went to an art class. what she didn’t warn me about was the fact that I have the drawing skills of a 5-year-old.

In the end, I called it *“Cat Potato: A Modern Exploration of Feline Identity.”* They gave me an A for creativity.

i tried to use a fancy app to track my water intake because apparently, adults are supposed to drink water, but it felt like my phone was judging me every time I missed a reminder.

--------------------------------------------

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pL62Y7rU4h): **March 20, 2025**

To give y'all a bit of background, I (30F) moved to the UK nearly 7 years ago from the US. I was able to get a UK passport from my father who immigrated to the US where he met my mother. She actually fled to the US from South America. After university, I decided to live and travel throughout Asia and the Middle East for a few years teaching English in poor (and sometimes dangerous) areas before I finally made the decision to go back to my roots and move to Europe for good. **(All of this is important for later!)**

4 years in, I met the love of my life and we got married. We decided to buy a house in the countryside and as we are getting things ready with the mortgage his family was kind enough to let us move in to their home for the time being. This was a massive change for me but I didn't care as I grew to be a part of his family including his only brother, Matt, who I consider to be the brother I never had. My husband and I were there whenever Matt went through breakups and gave him dating advice whenever he was seeing someone new until he finally met, Vicky. When we met her we thought she was sweet, down to earth, and didn't take herself too seriously which is what Matt needed but over time she started to display questionable behaviour traits.

Once at the dinner table, I said something about being Latina and she said, ""well at least youre not a dirty Indian."" Mind you, my husband, Matt, and I are all for some dark humor but that comment almost knocked me off my chair. In fact, I don't think we all think she said what she said because it was so out of the blue. She was obviously trying to be funny so we all laughed but it was obvious that it made us uncomfortable. 

Another time, I took my husband to Turkey for his birthday and I sent a video to our family group chat of him sun tanning by our hotel's pool with the sound of the call to prayer echoing from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofya. As a response she texted, ""that sound would freak me out"" clearly suggesting that it sounds like a s\*\*\*ide boomer. I can see how that would fly over people's heads but I knew what she was talking about but I get it, she has never been to the Middle East so as someone who has lived there I took the time to educate her on what the call to prayer is and how it's actually beautiful.

However it wasn't until yesterday when I've had enough of her closed minded remarks that she clearly tries to pass off as light hearted jokes. As I mentioned, the family has a group chat where we send memes and jokes to each other at times. As you can image, Vicky sometimes doesn't know how to read the room and sends inappropriate memes to the family and yesterday she sent a meme that was a picture of a huge group of immigrants on an inflatable raft in middle of the ocean with a caption that said, ""Where's Jaws when you need him?"" My husband thought it was too much and so did his mum. I, on the other hand, was like HELL TO THE ABSOLUTE AND DEFINITE FUCK NO!

I was this close to going on the group chat and calling her out for the bigot she was in front of everyone but my husband stopped me so I decided to spare the drama and DM her. I told her that was a fucked up joke especially considering that SHE KNOWS that both of my parents were immigrants wherein which my mom had to flee her own country. She immediately started apologising and saying that she ""didn't know"" which I found hard to believe. We've known each other for a year and we've discussed this before so either she's lying or stupid.

She immediately deleted the meme off the chat along with the GIF of her giggling about it as a response to my MIL reacting with a ""shocked face"" emoji. This morning she sent me a long paragraph about how she is upset that she upset me and that she loves me and that I'm like a sister to her. I appreciate her apologising and all but it really gives me the ick to associate with anyone who thinks it's funny to joke about wishing death upon a certain type of people. Is she that closed minded or is she that desperate for attention that she's trying to get it in the wrong way? I completely understand that she doesn't come from the same background as me or had the opportunities to travel like I did therefore it's natural to be ignorant and I don't want to fall out with Matt. And this has nothing to do with politics or anything it's just a cruel thing to say and there is such thing as a bad joke.

So would I be the AH if I flat out call her a racist/bigot the next time I see her and distance myself from her or should I just accept her apology and drop it?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP had the majority of NTAs and few YTAs**

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTAH. Just asking, Is Vicky American, perchance? Anyway, ignore her as though you’ve accepted her weird apology. But the minute that kind of BS rolls out of her again, roll your eyes at her and tell her directly that NO ONE in the family finds that kind of “humor” at all funny so please…..just don’t. Move the convo on quickly so she hasn’t time to be upset.

> **OOP:** Nope! British but sort of like the ""redneck"" version of a Brit... I was the one born and raised in the US but I've travelled and more ""culturally experienced"" than her... ironic isnt it?

**Commenter 2:** You've already called her out and there is the distant chance she learned her lesson and you are going to have to be around her until they break up.

Personally, I wouldn't call her out for the meme again - but STOP with the ""laughing because you are uncomfortable"". You've told her all along through those actions that you are ok with her passive aggressive racism. Frankly, the fact that she said ""Dirty Indian"" and you all said nothing because it didn't directly insult you or your family? Shame on you.

But she'll do it again and you need to be ready to respond. ""I'd be scared of that sound"" - ""Why would you be scared of that??? Explain it to me like I'm 5"". (Asking why something is scary/funny/whatever when you know it is a subtle racist dig always flusters them) ""Dirty Indian"" - ""What the fuck? That is a fucked up racist thing to say""

I'd give the brother a heads up that you are embarrassed that you let it slide until now and you are no longer tolerating it. Frankly, the fact that he's with someone like that makes me think he's racist too. I wouldnt' share a cup of coffee with someone like that, let alone sleep with them.

**Commenter 3:** She's also self-absorbed and clueless. She doesn't think of others before blurting out whatever stupid, offensive thought pops into her mind.  She's in her own bubble. Hopefully she won't make the same mistake again, but if she does, feel free to tell her,  ""Vicky, dear, please think before you blurt out inappropriate jokes/comments"".

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/yjeGsKDlz0): **March 31, 2025 (11 days later)**

Last I left it, I said that Vicky sent a long paragraph with a dramatic apology saying that I am ""like a sister to her"" but after reading a few comments I realised a few point: first off, how can she consider me as ""a sister"" when she clearly doesn't know me and never even cared to know me. 

Secondly, Vicky is only apologising because she got called out and NOT because she realised that the meme she sent was out of line. I could probably forgive her if this was an isolated incident but it wasn't. As I mentioned, she made racist comments twice before but never got called out for it and now that she has she's all of a sudden apologetic? If no one have ever said anything I guarantee she would still think those kind of jokes are okay.

I ignored her apology at first but when Sunday came around and she and Matt were planning to come for our family dinner day she texted me again asking if ""we are okay"" and the only reply I could give her was, ""I accept your apology...put it that way."" It didn't take long for her to cry to Matt about it who then called his mother to bitch about how mean I was being and how they are ""scared"" to come to dinner for fear of what I might say or stir up a bad atmosphere. I told my husband to explain to his mother that I am not one to cause a show especially in their house that they were so gracious to let us stay in while we were moving house. I have accepted Vicky's apology and will be ""civil"" meaning if she wants to speak to me I will listen and answer but I will NOT go out of my way to speak to her.

My husband and I were out for a bit seeing a friend for a bit before we had our family dinner. When we came back there was Matt and Vicky sitting on the couch. The moment I walked in Matt had this uncomfortable smirk on this face. The kind of smirk you make when someone you hate walks in to the room and makes eye contact with you and you have to be ""nice"" about it. Vicky gave me a ""hi"" in the voice of a mouse and immediately started having a staring contest with the floor which was fine considering I made ZERO eye contact with her throughout the whole evening. 

When we were at the table I was chatty and made it out to seem that I was unbothered meanwhile Vicky was across the table acting all quiet and sad and making the situation awkward. Eventually, she texted Matt under the table saying that she wanted to leave once dinner was finished. Mom and Dad knew the reason why Vicky and Matt left so quickly and they became upset. They had a go at my husband about why I can't ""let it go"" and how I was the one that made Vicky uncomfortable with the way I did not speak let alone look at her once the entire time. 

I defended myself to my husband saying that she and Matt were the ones that made it awkward from the second I walked into the room. Not to mention that if Vicky truly wanted to square things away she should've pulled me aside to talk instead of thinking that things are gonna be easily settled through a text message. I always found her to be the type that constantly plays the victim but now I feel like she's trying to rope the family into thinking that I am the AH just because I refuse to let a ""stupid joke"" that was a ""mistake"" to post slide and play nice for the sake of peace in the family.

Now, I don't know what to do as everyone in the family is thinking that it is up to me to fix this even though I wasn't the one who stupidly posted a shitty joke on the family group chat.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** To reinforce, you're NTA. Vicky's playing the victim because now she knows you won't let her get away with her stupid remarks anymore. If your in-laws engage you directly over this, explain again to them that you will be civil to Vicky and any silent tantrum her and Matt cause over you not being buddy-buddy with her while she acts like this is on those two and not you.

You might want to also ask them that if Vicky was making horrible remarks about something personal to them or their family backgrounds, would they just 'let it slide' for the sake of now-uncomfortable family peace.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Vicky is evil. She knows exactly what she's doing. She's extremely manipulative.

Your husband's family is going to be in a world of hurt as long as Vicky is allowed to play family members against each other. She's already managed to isolate you and make them believe that it's ALL up to YOU to make your relationship work.

She's playing the ""long"" game. Don't play. Step away from her and Matt. Learn to gray rock. Continue to be civil.

Have a serious discussion with your husband about all of this. You and he may consider having a meeting with his parents. Write down past instances of her putting you down and how it makes you feel.

Your ILs don't want to ""rock the boat"" for whatever reason.....and I can't think of any reason unless they're afraid to lose Matt (who is eating up the BS). They really need their eyes open to how evil Vicky is.

Don't go to ILs if she and Matt are there.

**Trigger Warnings:** >!verbal abuse!<

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Ig38kiFeRb): **April 14, 2025 (two weeks later)**

Well, well, well, yall! I am finally back with a final update and good lord did shit hit the fan! I was hoping that  I could continue to keep Vicky at arms length and she would eventually get used to it but after what happened I am gonna need some advice on what to do going forward until the day Matt FINALLY opens his eyes and realises who he's dating!

Right after that Sunday dinner when Vicky made an awkward scene in front of the whole household, my in-laws voiced their disappointment in me to my husband for being so harsh. Again, all I did was not acknowledge Vicky and kept my distance. 

Side note: there have been some of you in the comments questioning my husband's reaction to this whole thing and I want to make this absolutely clear: my husband has been defending me from the very beginning! He always agreed that the joke she made was completely out of line and that Vicky is the type that doesn't know the difference between being funny and being inappropriate, especially around his parents. 

In fact, I actually felt bad because although his parents were angry with me they took it out on my husband as if he had any part to play in this. Despite that, he fiercely defended me by explaining in full detail about my family's history as immigrants and even told them the story of how my mother had to flee her country and be separated from her family (which is something I never explained to my in laws). He also pointed out that not only is this not the first time Vicky has said something racist but she builds her entire personality on being inappropriate and that his parents has seen her behaviour for themselves. 

Therefore, I should not be forced to interact with her (especially on her terms) when she makes me feel uncomfortable. What's more, my husband pointed out how I was the chatty one meanwhile Vicky didn't say a word the entire dinner and made Matt leave dinner early with her SIMPLY because I didn't look at her. 

In fact, my husband's exact words to my in laws were, ""and what if she did look at Vicky? Then Vicky would've complained that she was giving her nasty looks. Besides, is that ALL she has to complain about? Because she didn't look at her?"" All four of us dropped it and moved on until Sunday came around again...

It happened to be Mother's Day in the UK so for the sake of my Mother-in-law, I was going to make myself EXTRA chatty at dinner and not make it obvious that I was still stone walling Vicky. My husband is a personal trainer so he had a few clients to train but was going to return in time for dinner. I decided to pass the time by getting a head start on my work and stayed in our room working on my laptop with my airpods blasting in my ears. 

Around early afternoon, I received yet another text from Vicky saying that she and Matt are coming to dinner and that she's looking forward to seeing me. I left her on ""read"" and continued my work. Dinner usually starts at 7pm and Matt and Vicky usually turn up an hour to 30 minutes before. Unbeknownst to me, Matt and Vicky decided to show up at 4pm. 

After a few hours, I came downstairs to check if my MIL needed a hand I was surprised to see Vicky and Matt already sitting at the table. When I asked if they had just arrived, Matt replied that they arrived hours ago. I then turned my attention to grandma to say hello and at the corner of my eye I saw Vicky and Matt looking at each other awkwardly. 

At this point, I was just gonna let Vicky play the victim card until she made herself look pathetic while I act completely normal. The entire dinner was great as we all laughed and talked just like we always have ....but then we finished dessert and that's when Vicky spoke up and said, ""I think it's time we address the elephant in the room.""

The whole table went silent and I took a massive swig of my wine because I knew what was coming and I started to seethe. Seething at how she was about to force me to be nice to her by guilt tripping and embarrass me in front of everyone. Seething at how she would rather cause a scene at the table on Mother's Day instead of taking the 3 HOURS that she had when she arrived to pucker up the courage to come upstairs and knock on my door to talk about ""this elephant"" in private. 

Most importantly, I was seething at how she was about to play the victim over something SHE DID. I gave her a chance though. A chance to correct herself by saying, ""you really wanna do this here?"" She insisted because the way I told her ""I accept the apology...put it that way"" and me ignoring her texts was ""immature"". That's when the wine I just down kicked in and I let her have it:

**Me:** ""I'm sorry do you expect me to invite you for bottomless brunch dates and sleepovers now?""

**Vicky:** ""I didn't say that we have to do those things. You have been ignoring my texts and you wont even look at me""

**Me:** ""Okay but here's the thing, sweetie, you do NOT get to post offensive jokes that YOU KNOW FULL WELL is offensive and then act all shocked when someone gets offended. You can apologise all you want but at the end of the day we both know that you're ONLY sorry because you got called out for being out of line and NOT because you knew how inappropriate that joke was because you wouldn't have posted it in the first place.""

**Vicky:** I had no idea that joke was going to offend you! I had no idea your parents were immigrants!""

**Me:** ""Oh so I have to disclose to you that my parents were immigrants in order for you to understand that finding humour in wishing death upon people is wrong?""

**Vicky:** ""Why are you being like this? It was never my intention to hurt you. I am not an asshole. But you are deliberately ignoring me. You have been upstairs the whole time we've been here and you didn't bother to come down and say hello""

**Me:** ""How funny considering I had no idea yall got here so early but YOU KNEW I was upstairs and the whole time YOU bother to come upstairs to speak to me? Youre the one that screwed up therefore it is not MY responsibility to seek you out and speak to you. But you already know that which is why you're NOW asking me to talk...right here...at this dinner table...in front of an audience...on Mother's Day. You just want an audience so you can play the victim.""

**Vicky:** ""Oh Fuck off!""

At that point my MIL stood up and told us both to shut up and stop bickering then ran upstairs to cry. There was a brief silence after we heard her bedroom door slam and all I could say was, ""well, congratulations, Vicky! You ruined Mother's Day. I hope this show you created was worth it."" Vicky then got out of her seat and ran to the back garden to cry with Matt running after her. My husband just looked at me stunned at what happened but I was relieved when he took my hand because I knew he was still on my side.

MIL managed to calm down and came back downstairs. Bless her, she said that I was the best thing that has ever happened to her son and she loves me but she doesn't want this to cause a wedge between her two sons. I assured her that I had dropped this since the day I wrote to her saying that I accepted her apology so I don't know why she had to take it to that level. MIL then said that she wants our dinners to go back to how they were before all this and not have any tensions to which I reiterated that I never did anything to cause tensions. 

Out of nowhere, FIL screamed out while looking at my husband dead in the eyes, ""YOU NEED TO STOP THIS!"" and smashed a wine glass on the table. I then ran upstairs and started packing my stuff. It's one thing for being reprimanded for something I did not cause and standing up against bad behaviour but to see my husband catching blame for something that has nothing to do with him made me sick. If anything FIL should've directed that anger towards Matt for not controlling his troll of a gf to shut her mouth in the first place. Husband begged me not to go but I just couldn't bare to be around his parents with this sort of bad atmosphere hanging over us. I left in a hurry and stayed in an Airbnb near my office.

As of now, I am staying with a friend until the process for getting our house is finalised. Husband keeps telling me that his parents wants me to come back but I keep refusing because although it has been weeks I still feel embarrassed. So Redditors, I am left with 2 questions:

1. Should I get over what happened and go back?

2. MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: It's clear that Matt doesn't have the spine to break up with Vicky even after witnessing her obsession for drama therefore how am I supposed to interact with Vicky whenever I have to see her again? I was planning to continue giving her the cold shoulder and not talking to her or looking at her like before but husband pointed out that she will want me to do that because then she can use that as ammo against me. She will try to test my damn patience and bait me into making her look like the poor victim... I don't want that bitch to win! How should I do it?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** How can your husband stay there after his own father *smashed a wine glass*? Did FIL even apologise to any of you? Yeah I understand you think he's being supportive of you by standing with you, but is he really? Or is he playing both teams? I wouldn't stay if my parents were blaming my husband over something like this. And I'm sure my husband wouldn't stay either if my FIL did this kind of weird power move.

> **OOP:** He's in a terrible position because it's his family who has been caught up in this drama that Vicky started. They don't know how to react and I guess they are trying to not risk playing favourites. The last thing I wanna do is be a Meghan Markle and tear him away from his family.

**Commenter 2:** Stop saying inappropriate when you mean racist. Not using the word is allowing everyone to pretend they don't understand what's wrong here. And please recognise that your husband's parents are NOT on your side. They are not telling the racist person off. They are telling YOU and your husband off for refusing to let the racist treat you badly.

And once again, your husband should be ashamed of himself for doing nothing. You can defend him, but he is still doing nothing. He hasn't even left their house when they are violent in front of you, and violent in response to your behaviour. He should have shut all of this down a long time ago, and he chose not to. Your MIL is telling you she doesn't want a wedge between her sons because she wants YOU to submit to this abuse.

Quite frankly, you're being naive and way too forgiving of these people. They are NOT on your side, none of them. Do not go back to that house. The moment your FIL threw a wine glass was the end of you ever living with them. The moment they started applying pressure to you to stop acknowledging how racist Vicky is was the end of the relationship you had with these people. Stop minimising how badly ALL of them are treating you. Your husband included. Grow a spine.

> **OOP:** I'm saying ""inappropriate"" because there were other things she has said that weren't JUST racist. My husband DID do something... he defended me to his parents even when they were angry with him MORE THAN ONCE. He did shut it down and Vicky powered it back up. Most men wouldn't even bother and how many times we as women have complained about men not even bothering to go to bat for us when we need them? In fact, most men would get angry at their women if they were unwillingly roped into drama that has nothing to do with them. When the time comes for us to finally move out of their home (which is soon) we will diminsh contact with his parents and cut contact with Matt until he breaks up with Vicky...what more do you expect him to do?

**Commenter 3:** Sooooooo Vicky isn’t just the problem here. This is a really toxic family dynamic. Your FIL smashing a glass because there is tension due to a disagreement is not okay. It sounds like the family wants to sweep things under the rug for the sake of looking like you are a happy family.

I would be leery about what is happening. You shouldn’t have to be friends with your SIL. Some people can just not like eachother and it shouldn’t ruin everyone’s life the way it is. I think you and your husband should go to therapy to work out a game plan to deal with his family.

> **OOP:** Believe me, I do not want to be friends with Vicky but she is definitely gonna try to interact with me in front of everyone the next time we see each other in the hopes that I will give her the cold shoulder and she can cry to everyone for sympathy. That's the part where I'm like, I don't know what to do.

**Commenter 4:** I would have a word with FIL about disrespecting my husband before I ever set foot in his house again. Slamming a wine glass over someone else's bad behavior? Nope, nope, nope.  And why isn't your husband staying with you at the airbnb? 

> **OOP:** 2 reasons:

1) He wanted to come with me but I told him not to as I felt so guilty to even look at him because I felt somewhat responsible for taking the fall for all of this.

2) I went to an airbnb all the way out in the city (40km away) to be next to my office meanwhile his clients are closer to where we're already staying and I am not about to let my husband drive 40km back and forth for god knows how long just because of this BS Vicky caused.

## What counts as a dupe?

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

  * Example: “a dupe for the discontinued Elizabeth & James Nirvana Black”

 * A perfume version of **any product**: body sprays, hair products, lotions / creams, skin care, candles, candy / sweets, makeup, etc.


## How it works:

Share as many details as possible that might be helpful in identifying the dupe you're after: a picture, notes or scent profile, your general geographic location, budget, etc. Please do a quick search of the sub before adding your request, even if you think it would be unusual.

Please remember that this is a global sub with quite a bit of volume, so a response may take time. This thread refreshes weekly on Mondays at 05:00 UTC, so keep that in mind when posting.

I’m using a throwaway because mutual friends use reddit. Sorry for the length.
My ex boyfriend is ‘James’. James and I dated for 3 years between Spring 2014 and the end of Winter 2017. Since my daughter is obviously older than 3, it’s clear that she is not biologically James’. Her father was not someone who wanted to be involved with her, and signed away all rights when she was born, so he is not involved in the picture. James and I were originally friends, which grew into a relationship when my daughter was around the age of 1. As my daughter grew a little bit older, she saw James as a de-facto parent, a role that he happily stepped up to. She knows that he isn’t ‘Daddy’, but had the strongest bond with him of anyone outside of the biological family.

&#x200B;

Our relationship finished owing to a difference in personal timelines. James wanted to buy a house together (we had lived together in the last year but we each still had our own places) and move to another city for work, while I was happy where I was located. It became a self-imposed ultimatum, and while James didn’t actually move, it was clear that our relationship was over. We stayed friends, and he changed from ‘de-facto Dad’ to ‘fun Uncle James’ to my daughter. We have both made sure that she was stable about the situation, something that she clearly seems to be. As I do with other friends, my daughter and I will occasionally visit James, who sometimes has my daughter without me there for a couple of hours at a time if I have to run errands or something similar. I have no reason at all to worry about James with my daughter, who is always all smiles and ‘five more minutes!!’ when I get back.

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago James started dating ‘Tracy’. She is someone that he works with who I actually first met while we were dating. Their relationship itself isn’t the issue, however there have been instances that have caused concern in the past few months. The first was when James invited my and my daughter around for a playdate with James’ nephew, who he was babysitting. Tracy was there too, which I expected, however when we arrived and James greeted my daughter with a hug she commented on how she looked like ‘her daddy’, meaning James. Both James and I said that my daughter wasn’t James’ child, which is something James later said had come up in conversation between them before. 

&#x200B;

She only remarked that she meant they had a strong ‘father-daughter bond’, which I thought odd, but ignored. There have been a couple of other times when I have seen Tracy either out and about or at planned events when she has said that my daughter really likes spending time with James, which I obviously know, though I just took it as awkward exes chat.
The reason I am posting is about what happened a couple of days ago. Again, James was babysitting his nephew, and had invited myself and my daughter to the park for an afternoon. 

&#x200B;

We get there and everything is fine until my phone rings and I’m told that there’s an emergency in the office that I have to sort out because X, Y and Z aren’t picking up their phone. I mention this, and James and Tracy offer to look after my daughter and stay in the park while I rush over to the office (only a 5 minute drive) to sort out the problem. I’m gone for about half an hour overall (the issue wasn’t really an issue, as it never is), and when I get back everyone is where I left them and all happy. 

&#x200B;

We start getting ready to go home when Tracy mentions to me that someone that she knew (an ameteur photographer) happened to be in the park taking pictures of the landscape and had taken a couple of shots of the group, my daughter included, and that she’d send them over because they were apparently really sweet. I was a bit perturbed by someone apparently just coming over and photographing my child, but thought glass half-full and decided it was only a nice gesture.

&#x200B;

A couple of hours later Tracy sends me over the solo pictures of my daughter. She says that she didn’t give her friend permission to use any of the solo pictures of my daughter on her professional page, but the ones of the scenery and of James’ nephew were on there, and if I wanted to give consent then my daughter’s could be on there too. They were actually very cute, and I looked on the photographer’s page to see the rest from the day. 

&#x200B;

There were some sweet candids of the nephew, and some nice couples shots of James and Tracy, but the last picture on there was a family style portrait of everyone, my daughter included. The caption said something like ‘The [James’ surname]-[Tracy’s surname]s know how to have fun!’. I immediately messaged the page asking for the picture to be taken down as it had my daughter in it without my permission. They replied apologising for the issue, saying that Tracy had said that the little girl was James’ and he gave his consent. 

&#x200B;

I then messaged James asking him to not give consent for anything involving my daughter, and to remind Tracy yet again that he is not my daughter’s father. He replied saying he never gave his consent for any group pictures to be on there, and he resented the accusation. I messaged Tracy later on making it clear that I didn’t want my daughter to be used in any kind of situation where the facts weren’t clear, and no, James was not her father. I didn’t get a reply.

&#x200B;

I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to be ‘that ex girlfriend’ who tries to get her ex to sneak around behind his girlfriend’s back for him to see my daughter, but at the same time he’s done nothing to stop Tracy from acting out this charade of my daughter being James’ and therefore hers. If I just cut them both out then my daughter will be confused, though I know she’ll bounce back. I know that James will be hurt too, but I need to put mine and my daughter’s feelings before that. It’s just getting to me that we were able to be fine and stable through our whole break up, yet a completely unavoidable situation is what will finish this off. Should I just move on without James and Tracy in my and my daughter’s lives? Am I simply overreacting and becoming ‘that’ ex regardless?

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Ex-boyfriend was basically ‘dad’ to my daughter for 3 years. Despite splitting up, we were civil and he maintained a good relationship, however his girlfriend is trying to paint them, including my daughter, as a perfect little family. Do I cut them all out and move on?

>It’s only gonna get more awkward and uncomfortable moving foward as your daughter ages, especially when you get a new partner. Best bet is to cut them off and move on. Your daughter is young and will be fine without them in her life.

**StrawberryBlondeHaze**

>>I think James choosing to keep someone like Tracy around does say a lot about his character and how stable a role model he may be in 5, 10, 15 years.

>>The influence his partners have on OP’s daughter may only increase as she gets closer to puberty and idolizes females she aspires to be like. One might think, Ah! But it’s only an hour or two! But kids are very impressionable, especially in a single-parent household.


[Update](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aizcsl/update_my_27f_ex_partners_28m_new_girlfriend_24f/)  **Jan 23, 2019 (3 days later)**

So I got a lot more interest in my post than I expected. While some were either end of the spectrum, the majority seemed to suggest that James was too involved in my daughter’s life. I had a long think about why I had pursued this route (to clarify to some, I did not force James into this position, he was happy to maintain a relationship with my daughter given that he had been in her life for several years). 

&#x200B;

The comments concerning where my daughter would be as and when James settled down and got married and had kids of his own also made me think. This situation was definitely one of convenience, especially given the fact that our relationship ended since James wanted to move away and I did not. I definitely had no plans to challenge any of James’ life choices, nor did I ever expect him to prioritise myself and my daughter over anything else. Something I seemed not to convey clearly in my original post was that James really is just a friend and has been for the past year to me, and so because of that I don’t ‘use’ him for anything that a parent would do. 

&#x200B;

On the ‘he’s not a babysitter/daycare’ posts especially, he sees her maybe once every six weeks, and since our relationship ended he’s been alone with her three times at the most, so this is not me using our former relationship as a tool for free childcare. He asks to see my daughter, I don’t make him make time for her. As a final clarifying point, this has never been a ‘I want him so you can’t have him’ situation - our time together will always be cherished, but I do not want to pursue a romantic relationship with James again, and he doesn’t with me.

&#x200B;

Onto the update. After reading the comments to my post and thinking over the issues, I decided to send both James and Tracy messages apologising for my reaction and my heat of the moment accusations the day after I made the post. James responded saying that it was water under the bridge and he would’ve been annoyed too in the situation. Tracy’s response was different. All she sent was a message saying ‘I know he is [daughter]’s father’. I assured her that James was not my child’s dad, and even went as far as to apologise if I had seemed off with her or if my current relationship with James was an issue. She asked if we could meet up and talk, which I agreed to.

&#x200B;

We met for coffee, and she said that she had been off with me, but not because of my relationship with James. She said that last year she had found out that she was infertile, and while James knew and was supportive, seeing him with my little girl who she knew he helped raise for several years got to her, which resulted in comments about him as ‘Daddy’. 

&#x200B;

She then said that the whole photographer situation was set up. She had asked her friend who lived near to the park to come and take some pictures of her, James and the children as soon as it was clear that I was going to have to leave. She told James the same thing she told me about the friend happening to be in the park and wanting some portfolio shots, but told the friend out of James’ earshot that I was totally fine with the pictures happening, and that James was my daughter's father so she has an ‘on-site’ parent regardless. She was the one who suggested the family portrait shot - she told the friend to stick that one online but that the individual ones of my daughter needed to go through me first. 

&#x200B;

She didn’t think that I would be interested in looking at the other photos, and thought I wouldn’t see it. She said that having a picture of her, her partner, a little boy and a little girl was enough to ‘keep her going’ since her medical news was hitting her hard. Tracy ended by saying that since James is the only ‘father’ that my daughter has ever known, she is therefore the closest thing that she will ever have to a child with him.

&#x200B;

I didn’t quite know how to respond. After reading many comments on my post saying that I was a jealous harpy and that Tracy was an innocent bystander, or even calmer versions of that mindset, I was surprised that my actual suspicions were actually correct somewhat. This was not the reasoning I ever thought was behind this though. I thanked her for her honesty and asked if she was talking to anyone else about this. She said she wasn’t, but she knew she should be. She also said that James knew nothing of the extent to which she was feeling, other than sometimes she was a little blue. We spent a while searching online for local mental health specialists, and left it with her promising to make an appointment, and to talk to James.

&#x200B;

After getting home, I contacted James to say that I believed that there needed to be some distance established between him and my daughter to benefit everyone involved in the situation. He said he agreed, and that he would always be there for my daughter if she needed him. I asked my daughter that evening, more out of curiosity, as to how she views James, and all she said was ‘[James’ Nephew]’s uncle, so I’m taking that to mean that she is by no means dependent on him at the very least.

&#x200B;

I don’t know if this is the end of this, and I’m sure I will get some criticism for not cutting out James altogether, or for even limiting the existing contact, but I believe this will benefit everyone, including Tracy, in the long run. Thank you again for everyone's advice.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Turns out the ex boyfriend's partner actually was trying to paint my daughter as a part of her family with my ex (not my daughter’s dad) owing to the fact she is infertile and can never have a biological child with ex. Encouraged her to seek mental health advice and to talk to her partner; daughter is going to see less of ex, through mutual consent, for the future well-being of all involved.

Another holiday ruined...,"What is it about holidays that they have to ruin? I feel like I can log another shit holiday in the books. One of my two narcissist parents moved out. The father...that's another story, but I still live with one of them. I love my mother, but she's one of the most self-centered difficult people to live with. Unfortunately, due to finances and the realities of being a single-working parent after divorce I found myself with only the option of living with her. 

I've tried to be as generous and helpful with her as possible over the last months as she's navigated a lot of challenges from my father, going to court, health issues, house drama, family drama, etc. Now that my father has moved out one of the biggest challenges is getting her to pick up the slack on things he once did. Though my father was an abusive prick he did a lot of things that we all took for granted: grocery shopping at Costco, recycling / garbage, yardwork, driving or filling the main car with gas, cooking dinner, house maintenance, etc. Now that he's gone most of it has fallen to me on top of my regular 40-hour workweek + childcare of my son because she's too stressed out to manage much at all these days. Though I'm trying to my best to be a helpful team-player in the house and juggle more since I'm younger - this behavior is driving me insane.

This week was really a record shit time and tonight ended with my bailing on Easter family dinner and throwing a container of chicken drumsticks flying across the room after she pushed me too far. Not my proudest moment at all...cursing, screaming, and throwing food....what can I say she has this ability to bring out my worst. I wanted to actually start smashing everything and anything I had bought for the house in the last several months. Thankfully only the chicken went flying.

This week she was in meltdown mode most the week. The roof was damaged from power-washing. So I found a handyman and booked him to help. The washer and dishwasher broke and have been full of mildew and mold (though she actually wasn't bothered by it - I was and she dismissed this as drama from me)...so I bought new appliances to fix broken ones all adding up to about two thousand dollars. We got into a fight when she refused to even say thank you and instead focused on that she had misplaced her glasses and went off that of course I should pay for it.... because she wanted to redo the landscaping in front of the house. THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A NECESSARY THING vs NICE-TO-HAVE. She didn't get it... I don't regret buying it since we need these things to manage day-to-day and health wise both were a hazard. But a simple thank you for such big purchases would have been nice...

I took on a lot of the grocery shopping and driving - but had to step out when it was time to pay after my son wet through his clothing and pants. I had already paid 2K that day so I figured she could handle the groceries. She was furious and caused a scene with me. Later she demanded I pay and pump the gas for her car (she simply didn't feel like it). When we were running errands and she was stressed I got her lunch, coffee, and some ground coffee as a treat. She never says thank you - just moves to the next thing on her mind. If we go out I'm just expected to pay. If it's broken I'll fix it. But NEVER A DAMN THANK YOU. Iwas also tasked with loading and unloading them in the car while she claimed re-heating leftovers was too much work...

As an Easter gift I surprised her with a new chair cover and sunflower dishtowels. Barely a shrug and the gratitude lasted all of five minutes. I cleaned the bathrooms, scrubbed the counters and cabinets (and by the next morning she left it all a mess again). 

So my last straw this lovely Sunday - I cleaned out the fridge since there was rotting food and loaded up the garbage with things my father had left in there. She threw a tantrum that she'd need to take it to the dump and hadn't planned to given it was Easter. I offered to do it, but she wanted to throw a fit. I was the idiot and did it without being asked to do so. She wanted to go to the beach today, but I told her I was really tired and needed to save energy for tackling some cleaning and laundry. She acted like a pissed child all day telling me ""you always have something wrong with you"". Then I mentioned to her that Monday I start a new job (as she knows) and orientation is at 9am. That I have work all day because that's the nature of work. She went off. Though I knew she had a dr appointment tomorrow planned, she had decided she wanted to run other errands while being gone since that just made sense... something about getting fencing or trees etc. vs watch my son as we had agreed. Again, I'm the selfish one for asking her to alter her plans though we had agreed on childcare. CRITICAL childcare given I have a new job... How dare I have orientation or a job that inconveniences her.... So I booked a nanny to come tomorrow though it's barely worth my working to cover that and she was scoffing at her coming too early in the morning. Cannot win here....

So I wrote a letter saying I was leaving for the evening and tired of all this behavior, but ended up feeling so stressed the most I could manage was a long bath. I boycotted Easter dinner. She of course said ""ditto"" and tried to spin it that I'm the problem...and she'll respond to the letter with all the things I've done wrong....

WHAT THE FUCK? \*cue throwing chicken\* WHY do I constantly feel like even when I give EVERYTHING in me (financially, emotionally, mentally) to serve her latest need of the month.... IT STILL isn't enough to warrant a thank you or quell the next rage fit from her? She still constantly attacks me telling me I'm a horrible person or bad mother (just for taking a nap or saying ""no I don't want to do xyz - I don't LIVE to serve you! I feel daily like I'm going through a fucking meat grinder.

But what sucks is I'm supposed to still function in this and run a household, manage my son, and a full-time job.

What I've noticed are some key things: 

1. She refuses to learn to do things that she wants someone else to do for her as an act of service (aka pumping her gas).

2. She has 0 respect for boundaries - if I'm doing something she expects me to drop everything if asked to do something for her

3. She gets plain angry if I'm doing something for myself or something that I initiated vs was told to do: e.g working, cleaning something (that she feels is not necessary). I'm constantly hearing ""I didn't ask you or tell you to do that"" as if that means I should only do something when told...I'm 38 not a child.

4. She gets furious seeing me do anything self-care related and starts going off on how I SHOULD be doing xyz or SHE should do something for herself and wouldn't that be nice....as if the act of my putting on lotion after a shower (yep that) was so infuriating. How dare I take a few minutes of peace to myself to massage my legs.

5. When she doesn't get her way: plans wise, activity wise, service wise, etc she lashes out and jumps right to screaming, slamming doors, telling me I'm a horrible person etc. 

6. If I tell her something is important (e.g an interview, a meeting, a dr appointment) she has to compete with me and fixate on the LATEST crisis in HER life. AND she ends up blowing me off or making it 10x harder for me to do said thing. She definitely won't even ask how said thing went...

7. Everything. Every. Single. Day...is a crisis. And I must drop everything to fix it with resources, money, time, etc or the screaming and crying won't end.

8. She feels entitled to my money 24/7. I'm expected to pay most of the bills, the groceries, the gas (for my car and hers), childcare, supplies for the house, any appliances or big purchases, anything she decides needs to be improved (new kitchen etc), meals out. I do make more than she does monthly- but still that's such bullshit! She's also a spoiled brat and I'll buy something for her and she'll then complain she wanted something else or it's just OK or she'll use it if she feels like it....God it pisses me off!

9. She has 0 regard for my work / childcare situation. Though she agreed to be dependable and help me with childcare she blows off and blows up plans claiming my meetings aren't really that important or that she wants to do xyz. I'm suddenly selfish for wanting to work or have a shower.

10. She never recognizes or appreciates what I do or give financially. I could spend 6 hours cleaning or spend thousands on something for the house and she'll shrug at it like it's nothing and move to the next shiny object that's pissing her off. 

11. She's horrible at actually taking care of herself: showering, eating, sleeping vs screen time - but it's everyone else's fault NEVER hers and she gets furious like this is something someone else did to her. 

12. She has 0 empathy. If I say I feel stressed or not feeling well or am frustrated with something she'll respond ""yeh ditto"" or ""suck it up"" or ""you're always not feeling well"" basically telling me that what I feel doesn't matter and likely whatever she's feeling will trump that so I better learn to shut up about it and not take up space. 

13. Whenever she gets angry she goes straight to how horrible a person I am, how I'm an awful mother, etc. There's never a moment of empathy or even a register that I could possibly have other things to do or just be plain tired....

I am FUCKING EXHAUSTED from this..... 

YES I know I am enabling a lot of this shit behavior as I read this I think FUCK why do I spoil her with treats, $400 worth of yoga classes, weekend trips, meals out, a gym membership, or give into her financial bullying? BUT the other option when I don't is that either nothing important gets done or paid for - nothing gets cleaned or managed and if I don't jump to help her, she throws a screaming nasty temper tantrum. I keep thinking as well if I just pay for some things to help her manage her health and stress, she'll do it....and it'll be better. I know throwing money at it doesn't fix it.

I just want to know how do I survive? CAN I DO ANYTHING that will improve this relationship??? How do I manage her better because clearly giving into everything is utterly failing and still coming out at a loss and not mitigating her anger and nastiness. CAN you actually ever win with a narcissist???? or do they just drain and destroy you?

\*\*\*I am already planning an exit strategy here - my son's father and I are working things out. A lot of the problems that existed before, don't now and we've done the work to progress to where we are today as really close friends. He's a good man - we just both were going through difficult things and hit a wall. We've discussed a future together again soon. So, I know this bullshit living situation will be temporary...I am grateful for the things she has given me - a place to live (mostly rent free) and help with childcare over the last years...but my sanity has paid the price in addition to my wallet.....

How do I manage this better on my end???

This was my first time making them. 6lb slab smoked over char hickory lumberjack pellets with hickory chunks in my Woodwind Pro’s smoke box. Smoke flavor was very powerful and bark was wild, even crunchy in areas. 

Seasoned with a few different rubs (coffee, prime rib, blackened, Texas sugar)  I had on hand, wrapped and let sit overnight. Smoked about 7 hours at 225, then simply wrapped with butcher paper and increased temp to 300 for ~2 hours to speed things along. 

Got the meat to 200 and then pulled and rested for 20mins as to not delay dinner. Couldn’t believe how tender it probed. Tasted a lot like brisket but more tender and flavorful. Will definitely be making these again!

Next time I’ll budget more time for getting to ~205 and hopefully get a proper multi-hour rest in. ",1,1745207822.0,smoking,0,1.0,False
1k44isj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1k44isj/behind_the_door/,Behind the Door,"They say you get used to the silence when you live alone. That’s a lie. You notice everything.

I moved into this apartment six months ago—top floor of a five-story building in an older part of town. The rent was cheap, and it was close to my job. Small kitchen, creaky floors, thin walls. But it was mine.

The first night, I didn’t sleep much. Not because it was noisy—but because it wasn’t. No hum of traffic, no neighbor sounds. Just the occasional groan of the pipes, or the building settling. Harmless things. But when you’re alone, everything sounds like a footstep.

By the third night, I was mostly over it. Until I heard something I couldn’t explain.

It was late—around 1 a.m.—and I was brushing my teeth. My bathroom faces the hallway, and I always leave the door open. I had the faucet running when I thought I heard… whispering. Faint, but definitely a voice.

I shut off the tap and stood still.

Silence.

I chalked it up to a neighbor’s TV or maybe someone outside.

But then, just as I was about to turn off the bathroom light, I heard it again.

Whispers.

This time closer. Right outside the bathroom. I stepped into the hallway, heart racing.

Nobody.

I checked the front door. Locked. Chain in place.

I told myself I was tired, went to bed with the lights on.

The next few nights were quiet. I stopped thinking about it.

Until I found the note.

It was a Wednesday morning. I was getting ready for work, grabbing my bag from the kitchen table. And there it was—just sitting next to my coffee mug. A piece of lined notebook paper, folded in half.

I hadn’t left a note. I hadn’t even used paper like that since school.

I opened it.

Four words, written in small, neat handwriting:

“I watched you sleep.”

I dropped it like it burned me.

I searched the apartment—closets, under the bed, inside every cabinet. Nothing. No signs of entry. Windows were locked. Front door still secure.

But someone had been inside.

I called the landlord immediately. He brushed it off, said the building was secure, no reported break-ins. Suggested maybe a friend was playing a prank.

I didn’t have friends like that.

I changed the locks anyway. Bought a camera and aimed it at the front door. Just in case.

A week passed. I tried to go back to normal.

Then I noticed the door.

There’s a small utility closet in the hallway outside my unit. I’d never paid it much attention. One night, coming home late, I noticed it was slightly open. Just a crack.

The next morning—it was open again.

I asked my neighbor across the hall if he’d seen anyone messing with it.

He blinked. “That closet’s been sealed shut for years. They store old wiring or something. No one uses it.”

I didn’t believe him until I tried the handle myself.

It didn’t turn.

Still, every night that week, it was open again. Just slightly. Just enough to notice.

Then the camera on my front door picked something up.

I checked the footage Saturday morning, just routine.

At 3:17 a.m., the door shook. Not opened—but rattled, gently. Like someone testing it.

A few seconds later, something moved past the lens—just a blur, low to the ground.

I froze the frame.

It looked like a face.

I called the cops.

They came, looked around, asked some questions, and said they’d patrol more often. But there wasn’t much they could do. No break-in. No damage. No clear footage.

They left. I didn’t sleep that night.

Sunday afternoon, I heard a knock on the utility closet.

Not from the outside.

From the inside.

Three slow knocks.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just stared.

Then a whisper—faint, like breath on glass.

“Let me out.”

I backed away, grabbed my keys, and left the building.

I stayed with a coworker for the next two nights. I didn’t explain why.

When I finally went back, I brought a crowbar.

I pried open the closet door. It shouldn’t have budged—the hinges were rusted—but it opened with a dry screech.

Empty.

Just cobwebs and old wiring. A dead lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.

But something was off.

At the very back of the closet, behind some insulation, there was a narrow gap in the wall. Almost like a crawlspace.

Big enough for someone to squeeze through.

I didn’t go in. I couldn’t.

I nailed the closet door shut, painted over it, and moved out by the end of the week.

I never found out who left the note.

Or who had been inside my apartment.

But sometimes, when the house is quiet, and I’m trying to fall asleep, I swear I hear whispering again.

And every now and then, when I check the locks before bed…

The door’s already unlocked.",3,1745207769.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1k44ia3,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1k44ia3/some_more_issues_with_the_aa_program_i_am/,some more issues with the aa program i am processing- hard to describe complicated feelings,"to preface this, i cant use or drink even a little bit, wihout risk to basically everything good in my life. luckily im not struggling with getting or being sober, because i have a history of serious mental illness that comes out even if i took a hit on a joint(think schizoaffective stuff). i also cant stop easily when i get started because when i start i dont want to stop(unless it gets bad enough). i fully intend to avoid intoxicants moving forward, nearly a year off all drugs and before that last time i went over 3 years.

my life is pretty good. im not rich but i have more than everything i need physically, im doing fine. drugs and alcohol dont sound like a rational choice. im sick of being gaslit about things im not even experiencing. heavy handed sayings etc. god im so sick of aa. but also i like my life sober.

im thinking maybe the root reason, or one of the root reasons i dont like aa how it manifests, is that the program is seen as perfect, despite it being made by a flawed alcoholic.

i have built my sober life up around aa and i feel like ive been programmed into this ideology based around the writings from a guy in the 30s. its so big. honestly not gonna lie the meetings and being in aa were a big part of my life getting so good. but now i have a weird complicated feeling that that ideology seems deeply dogma driven and i dont agree with it that much. 

i was getting really involved in a huge big book study for most of the last year after coming back from a 3 month weed and psychedelics bender that was preceded by 3.5 years totally sober. the person leading it was the wife of one of the most famous aa speakers of the last 50 years. she was really nice to me and had me read.

i would go make the coffee etc. i had a bunch of acquaintances and it was somewhere for me to go something for me to do to get out of self. looking back i realize that was it. i just would sit in the meeting itself which was really really boring and hear these big book experts go through their interpretation of the big book and i just noticed it all confused me a lot.

like i didnt know what the fuck they were talking about. when i heard this one guy (the kind who shares their full name and refers to themselves as a recovered alcoholic) share how relapse just comes out of nowhere when you stray away from alcoholics anonymous and i totally disagreed with it at its core. i felt like i woke up having been in a cult.

in my personal life im doing pretty good. im content. enjoying my life. got a straight edge girlfriend we are happy together. i have a career in a field that is naturally anxiety inducing but hey i have my dream job right now. i dont make a lot of money im 29 but i live in my favorite city and i do a lot of fun stuff.

so im enjoying life, having no trouble being sober, and i go to these meetings hearinf how if i dont do a nightly every night im doomed to relapse? and that im just another selfish alcoholic? and this praise for a guy who lived in the 30s, just studying this fucking book like ots scripture?

theres some good things to consider like im not the center of the universe and o dont tend to use like a normal person so better to not use at all. but its like i am told to push this dogma on newcomers just because? i really have worked all the 12 steps and i just have a gut feeling its totally arbitrary.

all the logic in aa seems to be circular logic to me. its just the steps get a sponsor do aa. and that you stop you become dry, if you stray away from this meeting you relapse before you know it it just happens, fuck that entire ideology i know its not true. but its impossible to explain why i feel that way to people who saw me get better in aa.

im convinced the reason i got better was because i stopped doing drugs. i outgrew it. i choose everyday to be sober. i found that was at the core of my recovery. not admitting im powerless and turning my life over to god. i pray i admit. its helpful to me but like i dont understand steps 2 and 3. 

doing 4 and 5 was useful to me in a lot of ways. i saw all this stuff i was overthinking and feeling shame about wasnt that bad im grateful a guy spent 6 hours with me on it. that was a hard thing i did that led to more peace. 6 and 7 didnt make much sense, one of my amends was pretty cool, so like i cant say doing it was a waste of time. i just feel like its arbitrary and a religion to push onto people i dont think that it cures addiction.

that being said, i just have complicated feelings about aa. certain things seemed to help me, but the ideology around it just seems wrong.

i dont think i need aa to be sober. but ive been programmed with so much self doubt it drives me crazy.

if things are going good it means youll relapse. i feel like aa teaches people unintentionally to just be miserable and neurotic about their ""programs""

what if you didnt need a program and just chose not to use or drink if it causes problems? what if that takes a few tries usually? aa has a huge network of people sure, but what good are they if they just propagate this shit that seems to be placebo experienced internalized and regurgitated despite being questionable?

so yeah i dont think im powerless over alcohol, i have the power to not drink it completely. it feels like faith healing. it cant be disproven by how its set up. and when you go into it you can feel huge social pressure to stay in even if its damaging to mental health.

i feel like i should just be enjoying my life. i dont struggle with drugs or alcohol and i dont feel qualified to help others get off it. idk. maybe aa isnt for me.

someone in aa would just say why are you trying to outthink this. sounds like self will run riot. sounds like you should do more controlled drinking. etc etc. tbh it drives me fucking crazy. the individual is so put down in this program, i get why its a program for alcoholics to get out of a horrible addiction, it is so hard to find the words to describe the feeling i get in aa after doing it for years. i feel like the program is misguided and the more i go into it the unhappier i get

my therapist validated these feelings and even said aa kind of sets people up to relapse. 

aa just feels like the blind leading the blind.",3,1745207720.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,1.0,False

## What is Maple Venture?

Maple Venture is an **automated trading platform** that helps users buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even traditional assets like forex and commodities.

This kind of tool is great if you're busy but still want to be part of the trading action. It's similar to platforms like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Code, but Maple Venture tries to stand out with a slick interface and real-time data integration.

## Who Created Maple Venture?

Details about the actual founders of Maple Venture are a bit murky. Like many of these trading platforms, the creators keep a low profile. That’s pretty typical in the algo-trading world, especially when platforms operate globally.

That said, from what I’ve seen, the development team behind Maple Venture is experienced in fintech and algorithmic trading. The platform looks polished, and the backend seems solid—suggesting it was created by people who know what they’re doing.

Would I love more transparency about the team? Of course. But the lack of public founders isn’t necessarily a red flag. It’s common in this industry, and so far there haven’t been major complaints about credibility.

Respect.”

It’s not just about looks—it’s about energy. Confidence. Presence. You walk a little taller when the beard’s shaped up right. You feel it when someone compliments it… or when they touch it and go, “Whoa, that’s soft.”

What’s the most unexpected compliment or reaction you’ve ever gotten about your beard?

## What is Brontivex?

Brontivex is an **automated trading platform** that lets users trade a variety of financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks. It's designed to be beginner-friendly but also powerful enough for more seasoned traders.

What makes Brontivex stand out is its **AI-powered trading algorithms**. These bots are supposed to analyze market trends, identify opportunities, and execute trades automatically based on user preferences. It's kind of like having a digital assistant that doesn't sleep and makes smarter decisions than most of us at 3 AM staring at Bitcoin charts.

## Who Created Brontivex?

The brains behind Brontivex are still a bit of a mystery. There isn’t a widely publicized founder or team with flashy LinkedIn profiles, which is common with many platforms in this space. That said, the platform reportedly works in collaboration with a network of licensed brokers.

While the anonymity might raise eyebrows, it’s not unusual. Platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also operate under similar models. As always, I recommend doing your own due diligence before putting in real money.

## The Verdict

So, is Brontivex worth it?

Honestly, **yeah—especially for beginners or casual traders**. It’s not perfect, but it’s functional, easy to use, and has enough features to justify the $250 minimum deposit. The lack of transparency on the team is a downside, but it’s not uncommon in this space.

The only thing it should be doing is changing the container from `.mkv` or `.ts` or `.mp4` to `.mp4`, along with adding the streaming fast start index to the front & end of the file, while preserving the video & audio itself without modification. But I can play the files pre-conversion & they are 1294x720. After the conversion the file details say they are the same, but when it's played in VLC or MPC it is 1294x1294.

I’m doing a bit of a personal research project and would love your input. I’ve lived in the UAE for a while now and noticed that while Arabic and Turkish coffee are everywhere (and honestly pretty great), it’s surprisingly hard to find a really good Americano or Espresso that just hits the spot.

So I wanted to ask you — the real people living here:

What’s the best Americano or Espresso you’ve had in the UAE?  
Where did you find it — was it a chain, a small café, or something off the beaten path?  
And what made it memorable — was it the taste, strength, atmosphere, price, consistency?

Also, bigger picture — what do you think makes a coffee brand successful in the UAE? Is it convenience, delivery, branding, the café vibe, loyalty programs, or something else entirely?

There’s no company behind this, just me trying to get a better understanding of what works in the UAE’s coffee scene. Your input could genuinely help shape ideas that lead to better coffee options out there.

The PNW cloudy rainy winter and my introversion have stopped me from getting out as much as I'd like. I would love to meet someone new to hang out with!  Online friendships are great too, especially if you're as into plants as I am!

A little about me:

Overall I'm pretty mellow and easygoing. I'm an environmental engineer and am really passionate about all things nature and my work in general. I'm definitely more introverted but always down to try new things. Especially new restaurants, coffee shops, and cocktail bars! I find I get along well with a lot of different kinds of people.

I have a pretty big variety of interests and hobbies. I've gotten into lifting/strength training over the past year. I'm learning to code just for fun! My main hobby is houseplants and planted aquariums. I'm working on designing a 7 gallon tank now. I have quite a few ideas for it is love to talk about! My goal is one day to have a cool workshop space where I can have all my projects! I also enjoy reading, I recently finished The Midnight Library and I'm working my way through the Game of Thrones books.

I don't play a ton of video games but I do enjoy strategy and citybuilders. I mainly watch sci-fi and fantasy TV shows although I'm getting into anime more. I just started the new season of Wheel of Time. I love a good podcast too! I listen to a mix of science, news, and everything in between. My current favorite is Search Engine.

## What is Immeditate Power Pro?

**Immeditate Power Pro** is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other assets. It uses algorithms to analyze the market and execute trades based on pre-set strategies, which could help users take advantage of market movements—even while they sleep.

Unlike traditional trading platforms where you need to manually do everything, this one claims to do the analysis and execution for you. It's part of a growing trend of **AI-powered trading bots** that promise to reduce the learning curve and help you get started in the crypto space fast.

If you’ve ever used tools like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, you’ll notice some similarities. They all try to automate trades using algorithms, but the success rate and user experience can vary a lot.

## Who Created Immeditate Power Pro?

There’s not a ton of public info about the actual creators of **Immeditate Power Pro**, which is pretty common with many trading bots in this niche.

From what I could gather, it seems like a team of **software developers and financial analysts** with experience in algorithmic trading is behind it. While that sounds reassuring, the lack of transparency around who exactly they are is something to keep in mind. It doesn’t mean the platform’s shady, but it does make it harder to verify all the claims.

That said, the platform appears to work with **licensed brokers**, which adds a layer of credibility. Just know that like many tools in this space, it’s always good to do your own research and stay cautious.

## How Does Immeditate Power Pro Work?

At the core, **Immeditate Power Pro** runs on an algorithm that’s designed to scan markets in real-time, looking for patterns and signals that indicate profitable trades. Once it identifies a trade opportunity, the bot can automatically execute that trade for you.

Here’s a breakdown of how it functions:

- Scans multiple markets and assets at once
- Uses **technical indicators** to predict price movements
- Offers a **demo mode** so you can test strategies before going live
- Automatically opens and closes trades based on your preferences

You set the parameters—risk level, assets to trade, trade size—and the bot handles the rest. Of course, it’s not 100% foolproof. No AI can predict the market with total accuracy, but it can help reduce emotional trading and improve consistency.

## Immeditate Power Pro Pros and Cons

Like any platform, **Immeditate Power Pro** has its ups and downs. Here’s a quick list to help you weigh them.

1k448lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1k448lk/please_rate_this_short_horror_story_he_woke_up/,"Please rate this short horror story ""He woke up.""","*CIA Headquarters. Langley, Virginia. October 12, 1989.*

The interrogation room smelled of cigarettes and cheap coffee. A gray-haired old man sat hunched over, his bony fingers fidgeting with a worn-out cap. On the table—a running tape recorder, a closed folder stamped ""TOP SECRET,"" and two steaming mugs filled with something dark, more akin to rust than liquid.

""Mr. Schatz,"" a man in his thirties, dressed in a strict gray suit but without a tie, placed his palms on the table. ""Would you like to make a statement for the record before we begin?""

Isaac Schatz raised his head.

""If I knew for sure what this conversation was about, young man,"" he said slowly, ""I might have refused to come with you.""

""You speak as if there are multiple possibilities.""

""At least two. But the CIA doesn’t abduct citizens for idle chatter, which means...""

""Which means you already know what this is about,"" the agent concluded. ""Operation 'Raven’s Nest.' France, September 1943. Were you involved in that mission?""

The old man fell silent. His gaze turned inward, into the darkness that had haunted him for the past forty-six years.

""Yes,"" he finally forced out. ""I was there. The Russians needed a translator who knew German and French.""

""Tell me what you remember,"" the agent nudged the tape recorder closer to the veteran.

Isaac gathered his thoughts and began his story.

 

We reached the target early in the morning.

Four men in tattered civilian clothes, their faces smeared with soot—Russian scouts—and me, Isaac Schatz, a twenty-eight-year-old linguist from the University of Chicago, who, by fate’s twist, found himself in occupied France with a rifle in his hands.

The sixth was our guide—Jean Moliné. A local history teacher who had lost his wife and daughter at the start of the occupation. The Frenchman led us along secret paths only he knew, through ravines overgrown with thorns and the backyards of silent farms.

""Here’s the castle,"" Moliné raised his hand, pointing ahead. ""*Château de Morvois.*""

I squinted.

On the low hills, shrouded in fog, stood the silhouettes of two black towers. Their pointed roofs, like claws, pierced the gray sky.

""Prisoners are brought here by the dozens every week,"" Jean said, ""but the Germans have never ordered the local farmers to increase their supplies.""

I translated his words to the commander.

""Monsters,"" Nikolai Semyonov, the leader of the reconnaissance and sabotage group, spat out.

The Russian, his face scarred by shrapnel back in '41, was skilled at hiding his hatred for the enemy when necessary, but now he made no effort to restrain himself. Our group had some information about this castle—enough to provoke a reaction from any sane person.

Over the past few months, more than three hundred people, including women and children, had been transported here from the Drancy concentration camp. None had returned.

""They say the Krauts are experimenting with some new gas,"" muttered one of the scouts.

At that moment, a mournful howl echoed from the castle, like a dog wailing over a corpse.

A chill ran down my spine.

""Our orders are to find out what’s happening there,"" Semyonov adjusted the satchel on his back, which held explosives. ""First, we gather intel, then we blow up this damned lab... Let’s see how they like dying by their own poisons.""

Nikolai’s confidence seemed forced. Somehow, in that moment, I already knew—behind the black walls of the castle, something far worse awaited us than the inhuman experiments of the Third Reich.

 

We infiltrated through an old well.

Semyonov sent two saboteurs to create a diversion—they were to set fire to the warehouses.

The rest of us descended to the lower levels in search of the laboratory.

The darkness in the castle’s dungeons felt alive. The damp gloom clung to our skin, seeped into our lungs. The walls, illuminated by the flickering flames of torches, were covered in strange symbols—not the familiar Nazi runes or swastikas, but something *else*.

""*Nom de Dieu...*"" Moliné whispered.

It seemed the historian recognized these symbols.

""Isaac, what’s wrong?"" Semyonov asked me.

The commander had immediately picked up on the alarm in the Frenchman’s voice.

I repeated the question to Jean. He began whispering rapidly, pointing at the symbols, and I translated into Russian.

*Mictlantecuhtli.* Lord of the Dead.

*Tlaltecuhtli.* A monster thirsting for blood.

And its name—*Itzpapalotl.*

*The Obsidian Butterfly.*

A demon worshiped by ancient, long-lost tribes.

""...this cult was described in the works of Désiré Charnay,"" Moliné finished his frantic explanation, ""the famous traveler who explored the ruins of Mayan and Aztec civilizations in Mexico during the 19th century.""

Semyonov listened carefully to my translation. Then he dismissed the historical account as *""complete nonsense.""* But how his expression changed when, minutes later, after passing empty cells, we found ourselves in the place where the Nazis killed their victims...

In the center of a vast underground hall stood a stone altar. On it—a golden idol. Four arms: two clutching a shard of black volcanic glass, two raised to the sky. Empty eye sockets. A mouth stretched in an eternal, soundless scream.

And behind the altar, piles of bloodied human skulls rose.

Hundreds of them, of all sizes.

They seemed to stare at us in silent accusation.

""My God..."" whispered Semyonov, the communist.

I stepped closer. The floor was sticky.

Blood.

Everything was covered in blood. Even the air was saturated with it.

A metallic taste filled my mouth.

Suddenly, from behind the largest pile of skulls, came a faint crunching sound.

We raised our rifles.

I glanced questioningly at Semyonov, who nodded.

""*Hände hoch, oder wir schießen!*"" I shouted. ""Hands up, or we shoot!""

From behind the bones emerged General Heydrich Menz.

He offered no resistance as we restrained him and took his weapon.

""You shouldn’t interfere,"" the general’s voice was eerily calm. ""Leave the castle and forget everything you’ve seen here. Otherwise...""

Menz spoke to Semyonov in German. I translated.

""Otherwise what?""

""If the ritual is interrupted, *He* will wake, and then all of humanity will regret it.""

""Who is *'He'*?"" Nikolai barked.

Menz nodded toward the golden idol with the stone in its hands:

""*Itzpapalotl.*""

Semyonov demanded details, and the Nazi told us everything.

Guided by the notes of Désiré Charnay—the same French traveler Moliné had mentioned—an unofficial Spanish expedition in 1914, composed more of grave robbers than scholars, had discovered the idol in Mexico, among the ruins of an ancient temple.

The artifact was brought to Europe and sold to a private collection. Mysterious deaths immediately began to surround it. The cursed relic changed hands over the next twenty years until, in 1938, it fell into the possession of the SS and caught the attention of Heinrich Himmler himself. That same year, another expedition was sent to Mexico to study the temple inscriptions in greater detail.

The Ahnenerbe managed to decipher the Aztec texts.

The secret knowledge horrified even the highest echelons of the Third Reich.

""*He* demands blood in exchange for not interfering in mortal affairs,"" the deranged Menz proclaimed. ""Lots of blood. Without offerings, *He* will wake. And then the End will come. The First World War, the Spanish flu, and now this war—all are signs of His imminent awakening.""

""So you Nazi bastards have been killing women and children here for some forgotten Indian god?""

Menz continued muttering:

""We are all just pieces on a board, moved by *Him* in His dreams. If we stop sacrificing pawns, *Itzpapalotl* will spread His wings and sweep everyone away with a single stroke. The ritual must not be interrupted now, when awakening is so near. Leave the castle. Forget everything.""

Semyonov clenched his fists and hissed:

""Madman’s ravings!""

A faint whistle echoed from the corridor. The two saboteurs who had set fire to the warehouses had completed their task and rejoined us in the dungeon.

""The fire won’t reach here, unfortunately. We need to destroy this place. Prepare the explosives,"" the commander ordered.

The scouts began laying charges and setting acid-timer detonators.

""Don’t make this mistake! We, the initiated, are trying to save the world!"" Menz screamed. ""Every bloody sacrifice made today is another year of peace without war or plague!""

""You monsters are killing women and children over superstitions!""

""Are we? Even if so, do you communists *nicht scheißegal ist das Schicksal der Juden?*""

I didn’t finish the translation. *I shot him in the head.*

Nikolai gave me a reproachful look but said nothing. The commander understood.

He searched the Nazi’s corpse and found a set of keys, then ordered the detonator timers to be activated.

We had about forty minutes before the acid ate through the wires and released the firing pins.

We took the idol from the altar—I carried it in my backpack. Moving deeper into the underground passages, we quickly found Menz’s office. Nazis loved setting up their workspaces near torture chambers. There, Semyonov stuffed all the documents from the safe into his bag.

The smell of smoke filled the air. Outside the castle, flames raged. Even through the thick walls, we could hear the screams of panicking Germans.

""The mission is accomplished,"" the commander declared. ""Time to go.""

*It happened as soon as the group returned to the corridor.*

The walls stirred. They rippled, as if made not of stone but of liquid.

*It* emerged from the shadows. A shifting, indistinct thing. A shadow from the void between worlds. A silhouette straddling the line between reality and absolute nothingness, resembling at once a man, a butterfly, and God knows what else.

Moliné screamed. *It* moved toward him and embraced the Frenchman. Jean *dissolved* into the darkness, as if he had never existed.

I saw one of the scouts choke—*but in reverse*—his mouth spewing gallons of black liquid. Another’s bones cracked and snapped under the strokes of incorporeal wings.

We didn’t even think of shooting at the demon. In panic, we ran back to the well, pursued by living nightmares.

Only Nikolai and I made it out of the castle alive.

 

""Is that all?"" the CIA agent asked.

""The idol and the documents went to the Russians. What happened to them afterward—I don’t know. I never saw Semyonov again either. I was transferred to southern France. You’d better send an official request to the communists—we’re supposedly on good terms with them now.""

""We did. The Russians replied that they have no such idol and never did,"" the agent sighed. ""They even denied the existence of Operation 'Raven’s Nest.'""

""Wait a minute,"" Isaac Schatz frowned. ""How did the CIA even learn about this story?""

The agent opened the ""TOP SECRET"" folder and pulled out a black-and-white photograph.

It showed a heavily aged Nikolai Semyonov standing in front of San Francisco’s most famous bridge.

""In 1986, Semyonov defected from the USSR through a third country and requested asylum at the U.S. embassy. The former scout immediately caught the CIA’s attention. We ensured his comfortable retirement, and in return, he shared valuable information. That’s how we learned about the idol and the second survivor—a translator named Isaac. That’s you.""

""I see. And what does the CIA plan to do?""

""That depends on what the Russians are doing with this *idol*. We’ve long suspected that the Soviet Union’s opaque penal system makes it easy to hide horrors like ritual sacrifices. A bus full of prisoners plunges into a mountain river, a fire breaks out in a remote labor camp... Paperwork exists—people don’t. It might seem like this burden should remain on the Communist Party’s shoulders. But now, everything suggests the USSR will collapse in the coming years, and then we could all be in serious trouble.""

""If the initiated stop making sacrifices..."" Isaac realized. ""Then *He* will wake, and the world will end. Global pandemics and wars will engulf the planet? A third world war?""

The agent didn’t answer. Instead, he asked:

""Mr. Schatz, do you have any other information about this case? Anything you might have left out?""

Isaac shook his head. His nightmares were a topic for a therapist, not the CIA.

""Very well,"" the agent turned off the tape recorder. ""I’ll take you home, back to Washington. We’ll stay in touch, just in case. If you remember anything...""

 

*Isaac Schatz died in 2003 at the age of eighty-eight from a lung infection caused by atypical pneumonia.*

*After his death, men from Langley came to collect his personal effects.*

*The final entry in Schatz’s diary read:*

Do you think she is perhaps being willfully ignorant / in denial because she appreciates the attention (maybe because she's in a long distance relationship)? Do you think she knows these men very likely are romantically interested and just doesn't want to admit it to Moody? Do you think she's kind of teetering on the edge of cheating without wanting to admit it to herself or to him? Or do you think these male customers really are just extremely generous platonic friends? Or something completely different? I honestly was expecting her to say something along the lines of ""Yeah I get hit on, but it's no big deal, you have nothing to worry about."" So I was a little shocked at her response LOL.",20,1745206748.0,TheRehearsal,8,0.92,False

Okay, real talk — has anyone else noticed how **everybody and their dog** is suddenly getting into crypto trading again?

1k4441w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1k4441w/babylon_banking_is_draining_my_life_away/,Babylon Banking Is Draining My Life Away,"Hey y'all wrote this after a failed attempt at a bank robber scene, it then evolved into a creepy pasta due to me binging Creepcast. Would love some feedback

 ""Listen up people!"" The man's rubber mask bounced along with each syllable, 
"" I don't want to see anyone try to be on the news, I'd hate to read your family's obituaries describing your lives!"" He paused his deep brown eyes scanning over the calm innocent sea of people. His gaze washed over the ripples from his words thrown like stones. 
"" I am not an insane man! I am merely desperate. I can assure all of you have been in my shoes. You'll all be fine, I want you all to be fine. Fine with me and what I must do."" His gun swung around in his crazed grip as he spoke. I sat there  in my teller booth. Hands up lazily, you know barely up to my shoulders. I could care less anymore, I haven't been sleeping well, I can hardly keep my eyes open at this point. I can feel my jaw opening despite my desire not to. A jawn crawls it way out my throat and I let this so-called robber notice me. 
"" Fuck."" I whisper to myself.

""Hey! Excuse me! Am I just not getting through to you!"" He swung the piece of shit uzi thing at the ceiling and let off a few rounds. 
""Are we feeling more alert now?"" He screamed towards me. Despite how distant he was I could smell the coffee and cigarette smoke that stained his teeth and stupid mustache. Barely even fucking hidden by the mask. But besides the shock of my burning nose hairs, the pop of gunpowder kinda woke me up, at least a small bust of adrenaline. And yet my body decided to betray me and I felt it again. Those brown eyes widen hilariously as I jawn again. I would apologize but he won't accept that. His gun swung towards my face, then towards  the teller next to me.
""Okay then maybe this will help ya out."" He smugly said and pulled the trigger. A sharp ringing let out and a burst of red mist shot out my coworkers chest. Steven. My only friend in this hell hole.

When he dropped down, he clashed around dramatically. His station turned upside down from his fall. The spraying of red everywhere and all over the robber. Our manager Ricky ripped off the mask furious. 
""God damn it you two!"" His face is red with anger. 
""You fucked with the squibs again!"" 
I at this point was practically falling over laughing. 
"" Shut the fuck up you two! These robbery drills are serious!"" He continued on after his statement towards the two of us. But we have these once a month and after five years of working here we have not been robbed once. 
Starting my day off like this was sadly way too normal.

"" Here at Babylon Banking we take care of your money, Or you can have it back!""  The dumbest slogan for anything, let alone a bank. And to be honest why the hell do we have a slogan. I asked myself that when I applied for the janitor position. Having been outta highschool for a few years and not wanting to do anything involving college. My parents kicked me out and Steven let me move in. He was already working there as a janitor himself and recommended me. Getting hired was easy enough, even without it, the interviewer was this stout man who asked basic questions. Why do I want to work here, what are my strengths and weaknesses. Typical stuff, until he kinda just switched up the questions. Have you even been declared legally insane? No. Are you religious at all? No. Are you afraid of the dark? No.  All the sudden out of the box questions weirded me out, I get freaked out a little easier than most people. But I'm also like most people and my fears faded away after I heard the pay they would offer me.

I answered all but one truthfully. 

And from there I was a janitor and then bumped up to the mail room and so on till where I am now. Covered in fake blood laughing at the man who first hired me. 
"" You fucking two are something else!"" Ricky said as he tossed paper towels around us to clean. He began to walk off but stopped his hate filled steps.
"" Actually, Jason."" His words had a hint of malicious intent, so great now Stevens little joke is gonna get my ass chewed out. He fully turned around his fake gun pointing towards me still. Even though it wasn't real and only shot blanks it still unease me. And he knew that.
"" Go ahead and get changed. Steven can finish this up, I have a task for you. Meet me in my office when you're ready"" 

And like a good little worker I listened, honestly a little happy. Steven gave a weak wave as I hurried along. Those squibs are very powerful if not properly set up, like for a joke perhaps. I saw him rubbing his chest. I turned a corner towards the locker room where I kept my backpack and monthly new suit. I saw the maze of cubicles full  of the older workers and HRs door slightly open. Ms.Rose our hr lady had one of our oldest workers there some 60 something year old. I could slightly see his watery eyes and her hand pass over an envelope.  That was another thing about this place, you know besides the constant fake robbers. I've never seen anyone be fired for any real reason, not for being late constantly, being a no call no show, practical jokes . We work in a contract style, at least to my understanding, each time mines about to run out I get promoted that's all I really understand. But the only way I've seen anyone leave here is when they, as corporate puts it, age out. Its weird working here. But I ignored the sad old man and made my way to the lockers. Changed my bloody clothes and walked my ass to his office. 

I approached his door praying that he wasn't there yet so I could have a small break waiting on him. But alas God sometimes doesn't want me to be satisfied, as for before I could even knock, Ricky was opening the door.
""Come on in Jacob."" He said calmly but the red stains on his face and shirt say other wise. I know he's pissed and I'm honestly wondering if I'll be the first under fifty person to be fired from Babylon Banking. 
""Take a seat Jacob, but don't get comfy."" Fuck I must be getting fired. I thought that to myself as  I hazardly sat down in the black office chair. 
"" Jacob we here a Babylon Banking, well we do things differently than your average bank, now wouldn't you agree?"" I shook my head in agreeance. My eyes wandering over to the rubber mask of his own face he wore earlier. The fake blood covering it. He spoke again and regained my attention.
"" Yes yes, well buddy because of that stunt you and Steven pulled I'm gonna have to let you go-"" 
""Now wait a second it was his idea.""  His hand halted my interruption.
"" Don't be rash, I'm gonna have to let you go down to the vaults to do Stevens job. You're being promoted to his position."" 
"" But why?"" I knew it was dumb to question a promotion but I didn't want Steven to be outta a job.
"" Don't worry Stevens been here for a while now and now he gets to be with people more, how should I put it, experienced just like him. So forget the shit you knew about bank teller stuff. Now you work the vaults."" The vaults he's referring to are our two banking vaults, obviously, and it was Stevens job for the past year or so to take down these giant containers down there to I guess unload them. He never elaborated about what he did , only something about precious information. 
"" So go ahead and take a small break, I'll give ya ten minutes, then meet Steven by the elevators."" 

Twenty minutes later and I'm standing by the elevators, waiting for ten. Steven is nowhere to be seen, and now I've had some workers I've never met  bring me two little carts with bags of money on them. Another ten minutes pass and with the two carts I just decided to take initiative and do it myself how hard can it be. So I click the basement button and make my way down.
The smell of metal surrounds me as it  slowly makes it way down. I swear I can taste the metal the air. Five minutes passed and I was still not at the basement. Another five passed, I even considered that I wasn't moving but when I hopped up I could feel that yes I was still traveling down.
"" What the fuck is taking so long-"" and as if it was listening to me, the elevator opened it doors. Opened them to a dark hallway, a single light every couple of feet barely illuminated the deep red carpet.  And at the end of the hall I could make out a painting hanging there. Ignoring my body's suggestion of just leaving I pushed and pulled the carts. Fighting the carpets attempts to hold my cart's wheels, I slowly made my way down the hall. The carts gave no help and it was a constant struggle to get them to move. It was like trying to take them through mud. But I made my way down stopping at the sign that pointed me to a hall that just seemingly appeared suddenly. This was the way to the vaults, yeah but there was more hallway and I still couldn't make out the painting that kept itself in my mind. I could only make out a single figure painted onto the canvas. Some kind of portrait. I stared down trying hard to see it, but to no avail. The remaining hall was tempting to explore, it all was so outta place I would never have expected this here it seemed so I don't know off putting I guess. But I had to continue moving as much as I goof around here, leaving money left alone seems bigger and definitely a fire able offense. Luckily the hall to the vaults weren't carpeted and were cheap flooring covered in stains from the countless times carts ran over them. Leading me right to the vaults. There sat a guard at some station who seemed shocked when I approached the desk. 
"" Aye bub where's the Steven guy?"" The guard asked me, standing up quickly I could feel the tension forming as he asked me. Watching his hand reach for his hip, I answered
"" Oh Ricky said for me to do this, I'm the new guy I guess you could say."" I was honestly a little freaked out. 
"" Ah I see y'all's twos got promoted."" He tipped his baseball cap at me,
"" Well the names Allen, as you can see I guard this here area. Keeping crooks and creeps out of the vaults."" He laughed.

""Well I'm neither, just tryna do my job. I gotta say I ain't gonna get used to that long ass elevator ride."" I laughed a bit till I noticed his perplexed look.
""What is that ten minute ride not that bad any more to ya?"" His look didn't change even after I said that.
"" It's a thirty second ride at most bub, what the hell are you talking about?""  He questioned me,
"" What? Hell no man and then there was that long ass hallway with the red carpet."" He pointed to the elevator across the room from us. 
""That's the elevator you came down right?"" 
Standing there like an idiot, I just gazed at the doors. They seemed to mock me, the shiny gloss showing me a twisted reflection that laughed at my confusion. 
""Uh I think.""
"" And you saw a hall with red carpet?""  Allen asked me his tone one of authority like my body knew it shouldn't, no couldn't lie to him.
"" Yes sir, I came out and struggled to pull the carts through."" I answered. He smiled.
"" Then followed a sign to here."" I continued.
He looked at me then I saw his eyes dart behind me. I turned and followed, nothing just the hall entrance I came through and the elevator. As I was looking he yanked the cart out of my grip making me jump. Moving it into the first vault, he then he began to shut it the hinges screaming out like banshees. My ears hurt as he slowly shut the door. He  kept his eyes on me,  made his way past me and grabbed the second cart. And walked over to the second vault opposite of the first. He then turned to me and said with a smile.
"" Congrats on the promotion, and tell Steven I said good luck. He'll need it. Those cubicles will suck the life outta ya."" He smiled again and then sternly told me, 
""Leave the way you came.""  Then he went into the second vault. 

Thoroughly weirded out I turned towards the elevator, and began a journey back up top. My finger was about to press the button, but the thought of what Allen said hit me. Leave the way you came. I looked over at the opening I wheeled through, he couldn't have met that right? 
Well I walked over to it, turned the corner and felt my stomach drop. There was no hall. Only a set of stairs. Freaked out I turned around yelling,
""Hey Allen!"" But behind me was the red carpeted hallway. And a few feet from me was the portrait, a portrait of a lone man sitting in a chair. But his eyes were sulken in deeply almost empty pits. His cheeks just the same. He wore a suit colored navy blue, his hands where almost skeletal but what caught me was the right hand. It was pointing by the looks of it. I followed the fingers direction to another opening next the painting. I went to walk towards it, the carpet becoming harder and harder to walk through. As I approached I could feel each beat of my heart, what was happening to me was I insane. Was I blacking out or something how did I get here again, why the fuck am I here, and just where the fuck am I? Rounding the corner I saw it. A third vault. Rusty as hell and old as hell as well. It sat there outta place compared to the others. Ancient to them, to me. Then I heard the screams. They came from the vault but the doors were not opening. It sounds human it sounded pained. Then what I heard next sent me running down the hall, running towards the elevator door miles down the hall. 
""NOT YET!"" It echoed again behind me. The source unknown but just as unpleasant. 

I kept running and running trying to reach the elevator doors. But each step felt as if I was running in wet sand. Like the carpet itself was grabbing my shoes to slow me down. But I prevailed never stopping never letting the carpet take me and as soon as I pressed the button the doors swung open and I collapsed in the elevator. Breathing deeply and quickly I pressed the ground floor button and a few seconds later it opened up and I was back up top. 
And standing there was Ricky and Steven waiting for me. 
""How was it?"" Steven asked. 
""What the fuck do you mean how was it?"" I responded 
""Well you went down there by yourself, I'd imagine Allen gave you a hard time."" Steven stated. Theres no way he doesn't know about this right? About the creepy ass hallway or Allen's strange way of congrats. 
"" Oh yeah he did but he also said Good luck to you.""  He turned to Ricky, 
"" I guess news travels fast, yup buddy I got promoted. Leisure work life is what I'm doing now."" He said happily. But his happy demeanor was offset by the look Ricky was giving me. His eyes were screaming at me but his mouth didn't move. He put a hand on Steven and told us,
"" Alright it's been a day of ups and downs for you two. Why not go home and rest, y'all's gotta get trained tomorrow."" Ricky said his eyes never leaving mine.
I got up and went with Steven to our lockers passing by the cubicles again,  noticing the janitors emptying out one of them, just tossing everything into their containers. And the name Neil Goodman was all over the papers as we walked past. The name seemed familiar, but I couldn't recall from where. I'll ask Steven when we get home, I'm not excited for tomorrow.

You enter a motel run by a shady mogul named Sal called the Last Hope Hotel,"Other guys prices: $1800 a night in the city (werewolves can't enter populated cities, pack law forbids it)

Sal's price: $200 with a bed. Just the bed, no roof, no flooring etc. He's willing to upgrade to deluxe which is the roof (which is in horrible shape, there's mold on the ceiling) and if you act now, you can get a warranty good for one night, he'll even throw in a shotgun (The area is infested with werewolves) with silver buckshot. Of course the shotgun will jam and the included shot isn't buckshot, it's just a shell painted silver. the bullet needs to be blessed by a priest and there's no churches. No bibles, no praying allowed and no holy objects. Free rooms though, roof is extra. If you hear sizzling, that's his skin bubbling. He REALLY hates Christ. There used to be more werewolves in the area but they got wiped out when a church choir stayed for the night. Sal barely escaped with his life.

The bed hurts, the box spring is lumpy and the doors open both ways...and there's no toilet. The TV is ""broken"" (it's just a mobile phone modified to show video through a rear projector) and if he ""Fixes"" it (really just switching the phone from off to on), he'll charge you double. He claims that he has a Xbox with Halo but it's actually just a box with an X on it and an ""angel"" (really a demon) Halo. He's also a werewolf himself. You can watch whatever you want but nothing religious. There is also a blanket ban on music. You cannot bring anything remotely holy into the hotel.

He can flash step, turn invisible and kill angels at will. God had to lock him up in Hell and he murdered the devil to escape.

Good luck.

Maybe you’ve seen the name in Telegram groups or heard about it through a friend who’s suddenly making “passive income” (yeah, we’ve all got that one friend).

I decided to give Veridian Matrix AI a closer look. In this detailed review, I’ll break down what it actually offers, how it compares to similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge, and whether it’s worth your time and money. Spoiler: it’s not perfect, but there’s a lot to like.

## What is Veridian Matrix AI?

Veridian Matrix AI is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and execute trades on behalf of its users. Think of it like a smart financial assistant that never sleeps. It’s designed for both beginners and experienced traders who want to take advantage of real-time market shifts without manually sitting at a desk 24/7.

It supports trading in **cryptocurrencies, forex, and some CFDs**, and it claims to use predictive algorithms that spot opportunities faster than the average human. While some of this sounds eerily similar to platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge, Veridian Matrix AI has a more polished dashboard and better real-time analytics.

## Who Created Veridian Matrix AI?

So far, there’s no single name or company that boldly claims to be behind Veridian Matrix AI, which is typical for these types of platforms. That might sound sketchy, but it’s also common in the world of trading bots where teams often work in anonymity to avoid legal scrutiny or protect proprietary tech.

What we do know is that it seems to be developed by a team of **financial analysts, software engineers, and AI specialists**, similar to the teams behind Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. While I’d prefer more transparency, the platform itself seems solid and secure, and it's been getting decent user feedback.

## How Does Veridian Matrix AI Work?

Veridian Matrix AI works by using **machine learning algorithms** to scan hundreds of market data points per second. Once it identifies a potential trade opportunity, it can either send you an alert or automatically place the trade, depending on your settings.

Here’s what happens under the hood:

- **Data Collection:** It pulls data from multiple exchanges and global markets.
- **Pattern Recognition:** The AI identifies historical patterns and trend reversals.
- **Execution:** It automates trades at high speed to capitalize on micro-opportunities.
- **Learning Loop:** The system updates itself with each trade, supposedly improving over time.

It integrates with regulated brokers, which means your trades are actually executed by third-party platforms. This also adds a layer of legitimacy.

## Veridian Matrix AI Pros and Cons

Like any tool, Veridian Matrix AI has its highs and lows.

**Pros:**

- **AI-Powered Trades:** Fast decision-making based on real-time data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Even beginners can start trading quickly.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Works smoothly on smartphone browsers.
- **Demo Account Available:** Test the waters before risking real money.
- **24/7 Trading:** Crypto markets don’t sleep, and neither does the bot.

**Cons:**

- **Minimum Deposit Required:** You need to put in at least $250 to start.
- **No Named Founders:** Lack of transparency in leadership.
- **Limited Asset Classes:** No stocks or ETFs—mostly crypto and forex.
- **Risk of Loss:** Like all trading, you can lose money. AI doesn’t guarantee profits.

I’ll be traveling to Ireland for a conference near Dublin in June. I’m US based, late 20's f, traveling solo for my first trip to Ireland (and Europe!). My interests include nature and hiking, photography, old ruins, architecture, experiencing local Irish culture, art, and live music, and coffee (also, I’m a vegetarian, if there are any relevant suggestions for good spots on my planned route).  

I’ll be renting a small automatic vehicle from NewWay. I know the driving will be different and I’ll be very cautious! I’m really excited for the scenic drives, even though I know I won’t enjoy it the same way being the sole driver. But I’ve done a decent amount of solo driving on difficult roads with scenic views and I still love it. That said, if this looks like a ridiculous amount of driving, I’m open to that feedback! I do want to make sure I have time to really enjoy what I’m doing :)

Also, all the accommodation is booked except 6/28. Mostly flexible, but would love to limit how much I change lodging since options are getting slimmer and I found some pretty neat B&B's :)

So here is my current itinerary:

* 6/8-6/14: Fly into Dublin, stay with family outside the city & attend conference
* 6/15: Get to Limerick via train; pick up rental at Shanon Airport; drive to Burren & explore, See Cliffs of Moher near sunset; sleep near Doolin
* 6/16: Trip to Inishmore, sleep there
* 6/17: Drive from Doolin along coast up to Connemara area, stopping at beaches (e.g., Gurteen & Dog’s Bay, Connemara Bay); sleep near Rinvyle
* 6/18: Explore Connemara National Park, Clifden & Clifden Castle; maybe hike Diamond Hill if weather permits; sleep in Rinvyle
* 6/19: Kylemore Abbey; drive through Doo Lough Valley; loop back to coast & drive up to Westport with stops at Silver Strand & Bertra Beach; sleep in Westport
* 6/20: Achill Island day trip; sleep in Westport again
* \*6/21: Drive along coast up to Portacloy Loop cliff walk & do the hike; sleep near Belderrig
* \*6/22: Explore Ceide Fields, Down Patrick Head; drive along coast to Sligo; sleep in Sligo
* 6/23: Explore nearby- Devils Chimney Waterfall, walk Gleniff Horseshoe, Classiebawn Castle; Sleep in Sligo
* 6/24: Drive along coast to Donegal; Slieve League cliffs; sleep nearby (Aughera)
* 6/25: Glencolmcille Village, An Port, Sturrall Ridge; drive to Portnoo (detour to Kilclooney Dolmen); sleep in Portnoo
* 6/26: Drive along coast to Falcarragh (detour at Crohy Sea arch); continue up to Horn Head, hopefully Murder Hole Beach (too much driving maybe?); sleep in Falcarragh
* 6/27: Sunrise hike up Mt. Errigal; Glenveagh National Park; sleep in Falcarragh
* \*6/28: Drive along coast up to Malin Head; sleep near Malin Head OR stay near Falcarragh and check out Tory Island (weather permitting)?
* \*6/29: Drive from Malin Head or Falcarragh to Dublin; return rental car to Dublin Airport; stay with family in Dublin
* 6/30: Explore Dublin (thinking Trinity College, Dublinia Viking Museum, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Marsh Library...)
* 7/1: Fly home!

Aside from any suggestions about other points of interest I should consider along my route, here are my questions:

\-Given the rest of my plans & timing, is it worth it to see Belmullet peninsula? I could either detour there on 6/21 before heading to Portacloy cliffs, or potentially change lodging to Belmullet on 6/21 then go to Poratcloy on 6/22. Maybe it’s too much to add in though? Or just not worth the added time/energy with the rest of my plans?

\-I’m really indecisive about what to do with my last day. I’ve been thinking of going up to Malin Head, but have been considering adding another day in Falcarragh instead to try and make it to Tory Island one of those days. I’d love to see some puffins! But would be bummed to not see Malin Head. Do you think I have decent chances of seeing puffins elsewhere on the trip? I know technically they can be spotted near some other spots along my route but unsure how rare it would be to actually see any in the less remote spots. Is one option or the other a clear choice that anyone would suggest? I’m so torn!

Thanks if you’ve actually read this whole post and for any advice you may have! I'm so incredibly excited to visit this amazing country and honestly am in love with it already!",1,1745206252.0,irishtourism,1,1.0,False

1k43z7t,https://i.redd.it/w7sh4tv4x3we1.jpeg,Mitch’s 2021 resolutions vs what she’s achieved as of 2025 (spoiler: nothing) 🤡🫨,"I came across this video and thought it would be interesting to compare to the current 2025 Michelle we know and love today. 🥸

The video is uploaded on Christmas Eve of 2021. Mitch starts off the video by saying it’s been a “loooong time, I know, I know” and that she’s got “no excuses” for her 2 week disappearance. She admits Vlogmas was a fail (once again) due to COVID and her life not being exciting enough to vlog. Okay, so nothings changed there with the inconsistent upload schedules, mediocre lifestyle and failure to commit. Mitch has truly grasped the concept of “under promise and over deliver” in the most backwards way possible.

However, Mitch does have an exciting announcement to make to excuse her absence! 🤯 Can we all guess what it is? Is it something to do with her own life? Did Mitch tick off an achievement? **drum roll 🥁🥁🥁** Mitch’s exciting announcement is that her best friend, Kim Thai’s merch has officially sold out!!! Yes, the same business that we know failed and closed after a few months. We’ll give Kim some credit that she actually gave it a shot. As for Mitch, congratulations for staying up when it launched to make the first order and we hope you’re still enjoying living in Kim’s shadow. Any other announcements, Mitch? Nope that’s it… 🤡

Circling back to Mitch’s initial 2 week absence, she claims this time away was spent focusing on her goals for 2022. She mentions she doesn’t like making New Year’s resolutions, as her goals should be goals regardless what time of the year it is. She briefly mocks the generic idea of “getting healthy” due to the New Year. Mitch claims that the whole point of uploading this video is to hold herself accountable and watch back on the video to compare her progress (great, we’re here for that too 🤩).

Mitch reveals her first goal: getting healthy. 🫨 Ironically the same exact thing she mocked seconds ago. She believes that if “you’re not on doctor’s orders, the mentality and the way you feel is what’s important when it comes to being healthy”. Right Michelle… like you’d know. Goal: unsuccessful 🥲

Her second goal is to “run 5 miles without dying, and I mean like, DYING”. Mitch wants to feel strong, both physically and mentally. She admits feeling a shift her of mentality when she lost weight vs her current situation, stating she’s a lot more depressed now. Wow, some actual truth for once. As for the goal: does driving 5 miles for Wing Stop count — cause ya girl has that down pat. Mitch hasn’t even tried walking 5 miles, let alone running it. Goal: unsuccessful (again ☹️) ⛔️📛🚫

Her third goal is to be financially smarter, responsible and organised 🤓: including moving out (lol) and being stable enough to take care of herself and Clementine. She repeats again that she wants to move out in the next year (lol again). In true defensive and insecure Michelle fashion, she makes a big disclaimer that she’s not NOT already financially responsible, but she can be MORE financially responsible 🧐. Yes Mitch, those monthly storage fees for unused furniture aka Kim’s hand-me-downs, countless sugary iced coffees, bagel sandwiches, the ever growing collection of tumblers and glassware, trips to IKEA for the non-existent apartment, endless takeout binge sessions in the car and inconsistent, recycled garbage uploads for your “full time job” are definitely strategic financial planning tactics. 🤲🤑

Continuing on, her fourth goal is to be more active online and produce more creative ideas & entertaining content. Mitch wants more “fun, pretty and creative content”. I mean… if you consider fast food binge eating sessions in the same recycled Adele shirt (purchased by Kim), in empty parking lots as “fun, pretty and creative”, you’ve hit the nail on the head, Michelle — that’s about 90% of your content since.

Mitch’s fifth goal is to find ✨🧘🏻‍♀️ inner peace and happiness. 🤗✨ Mitch admits she is unsure when she’s ever felt pure and true happiness, despite having “moments of happiness”. We appreciate the honesty here, although she does backtrack on this. Has Mitch achieved this goal? 🤔 It’s evident that she’s becoming increasingly dependent on food to create her false sense of “happiness”, which completely goes against her first goal. I don’t see anything else in her videos that fulfil her the same way food does. Mind you, she made the same claim of not knowing if she’s ever been truly content in her life while Clem is lying right next to her in bed. There’s something missing in her life — perhaps a man is what Michelle truly wants?

Sixth goal: go back to creative writing. Mitch claims she loved writing love stories as a hobby and stopped over 3 years ago. She says she used to stay up at night writing, and isn’t sure why she stopped but would love to start again as it helped create a world for her where she was happy and got to live her dreams of being a hopeless romantic. This also ties back to my theory that Mitch won’t find true happiness without romance in her life. Mitch makes a joke that maybe one day she’ll have a book, and evidently, that’s all it’ll ever be - a joke. We haven’t heard anything about creative writing from Mitch since, so that’s another goal down the drain. The only “hobby” she’s stayed consistent with is binge-eating unfortunately.

Seventh goal: Be genuinely kind. Of course, Mitch must include her disclaimer that she isn’t saying she’s mean, but admits she’s quick to judge. Mitch claims that anyone who knows her would say she’s sympathetic, empathetic & understanding, giving credit to the Libra in her (girl bffr). She thinks she is genuinely kind already, and struggles to explain why she wants to be genuinely kind when she thinks she already is. Mitch says the world is scary and then again reverts back to struggling to find the words to explain her rationale, then abruptly concludes with “I don’t know”. Great insights, Michelle. After recomposing herself, Mitch concludes she’s very genuine to friends and family but wants to extend this genuineness to strangers. Yes, a goal she’s effortlessly achieved by passing judgement to anyone that parks remotely close to her car while she’s hosting her very important business meetings with her Wingstop chicken tenders and ranch sauces.

Her eighth and final goal is to turn a weakness of hers into a strength - that weakness being her kindness. Didn’t we just kinda talk about this? Let’s find out. She states people who she gets close to and/or wants to be close with, she ends up being too kind to a fault. Who are we referring to here? Carlos’ friends? Maiden? Disclaimer again though: Mitch reminds us that she’s still a “bad bitch” while being too nice and getting hurt. She then goes on to say she feels that our culture and society is stuck on being a bad bitch and not being hurt — completely contradicting her statement seconds ago. She states that there’s nothing wrong with being nice (but just claimed there is because she’s “kind to a fault”?). Mitch continues and states her kindness doesn’t mean she’s weak -- okay, so what the hell is the actual goal, Michelle? 🤦🏻‍♀️😒 Does she even know what she wants (aside from what to eat)?

In conclusion, to no one’s surprise, she’s achieved none of her goals and has only spiralled downwards. Some of Mitch’s “goals” don’t even make sense and are far from properly thought out, highlighted by her constant contradictions and failure to actually make sense and adequately explain or elaborate on them. The goals she is able to communicate like moving out or getting healthy still remain on the “to-do” list, or perhaps even in the “forget I ever mentioned it” box, as she refuses to ever properly update us on them with full transparency, with the only new information being excuses on why it hasn’t happened.

Whether she’s completely given up on them is up for debate. Mitch recently uploaded a “ask me anything” on her IG story — perhaps the questions she cherry picks to answer may give us an insight into where she’s at… Or you know, it’ll just be another surface level Q&A to kill time while she munches down on another Wingstop meal, proudly sponsored by Dossier. 💅

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding Flaxseed’s Flavor in a Chocolate Smoothie

Flaxseed has become a popular addition to smoothies due to its impressive health benefits, including being rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and lignans. But many wonder whether its flavor complements or clashes with the rich taste of chocolate. When you blend flaxseed into a chocolate smoothie, you’re introducing a nutty, slightly earthy undertone. This flavor is subtly distinct but is generally mild enough not to overpower the dominant chocolate notes.

Flaxseed’s natural nuttiness can actually enhance a chocolate smoothie by adding a deeper dimension to the taste. This works particularly well because chocolate has complex flavor layers of bitterness and sweetness that pair nicely with the wholesome tone of flaxseed. However, the key to enjoying flaxseed in your chocolate smoothie lies in balancing quantities and combining the right ingredients.

### Texture Considerations When Adding Flaxseed

One important aspect to consider is texture. Flaxseed can be added whole, ground, or as flaxseed meal, with each form influencing the smoothie’s mouthfeel differently:

- **Whole flaxseeds:** These tend to pass through the digestive system mostly intact and can create a bit of crunch, which might be unexpected in a creamy chocolate smoothie.
- **Ground flaxseed:** This is the preferred option for smoothies as it blends smoothly and distributes evenly. It thickens the smoothie slightly and adds a pleasant grainy texture without being gritty.
- **Flaxseed meal:** Similar to ground flaxseed but more finely milled, it integrates seamlessly, enriching the smoothie with a smooth yet fibrous texture.
 
For the best smoothie experience, ground flaxseed or flaxseed meal is recommended to avoid any textural surprises that could detract from the creaminess of the chocolate blend.

### Flavor Pairing Tips to Maximize Enjoyment

To enhance and balance the flavors when adding flaxseed to a chocolate smoothie, consider these tips:

- **Add natural sweeteners:** Since flaxseed adds earthiness, a touch of natural sweetness such as honey, maple syrup, or ripe bananas can brighten the flavor and complement the chocolate.
- **Use creamy bases:** Ingredients like almond milk, coconut milk, or Greek yogurt help maintain a smooth texture and counteract any dryness introduced by flaxseed.
- **Incorporate spices:** Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla, or even a pinch of sea salt can elevate the chocolate-flaxseed combo, making the flavors more rounded and satisfying.
- **Balance bitterness:** If the chocolate used has a strong, dark flavor, balancing it with a sweeter or creamier element prevents the smoothie from tasting too bitter when combined with flaxseed.
 
### Is Flaxseed Tasty Enough to Include Regularly?

Ultimately, taste is subjective. Many people find that flaxseed not only adds nutritional value but also enhances the flavor complexity of their chocolate smoothies. The slightly nutty, earthy notes can make the smoothie taste more gourmet and intentional.

Whether you find flaxseed tasty in your chocolate smoothie depends on how you prepare it and what complementary ingredients you add. Experimenting with different amounts—starting with one tablespoon per serving—is a great way to discover your preferred balance. Adding too much flaxseed at once could overwhelm the smoothie with a gritty or bitter flavor, whereas moderate amounts blend beautifully.

### Health Benefits That Complement Taste

Besides taste, flaxseed contributes to a smoothie’s nutritional profile, which makes it appealing to many smoothie lovers. Its high fiber content supports digestion and helps keep you full longer, while omega-3 fatty acids promote heart and brain health. Including flaxseed in your chocolate smoothie can be a simple way to make your treat both delicious and functional.

### Final Suggestions for Enjoying Flaxseed and Chocolate Together

To best enjoy the flavor of flaxseed in a chocolate smoothie, keep these points in mind:

- Use freshly ground or meal flaxseed for optimal texture and flavor.
- Start with small amounts to avoid overpowering the chocolate.
- Pair with natural sweeteners and creamy bases to enhance balance.
- Experiment with spices such as cinnamon or vanilla to add warmth.
- Combine dark or unsweetened chocolate with sweeter fruit to soften bitterness.
 
By paying attention to these details, you can create a chocolate smoothie that’s not only tasty but also enriched with the wholesome qualities of flaxseed. This combination offers a delightful, nutrient-packed indulgence that many will appreciate for breakfasts, snacks, or post-workout treats. So, if you’re curious whether flaxseed is tasty in a chocolate smoothie—give it a try with these tips and see how your taste buds respond!

</div>Flavor Pairing Tips to Enhance Your Chocolate and Flaxseed Smoothie Experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Taste of Flaxseed in a Chocolate Smoothie

Flaxseed brings a subtle, nutty flavor that can complement chocolate well, but its distinct earthy undertone might stand out if not balanced properly. When you blend flaxseed into a chocolate smoothie, it adds not only texture but also a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. The key is knowing which flavors harmonize with both flaxseed and chocolate, enhancing the overall taste without overpowering the smoothie’s creamy chocolate base.

### Combining Flaxseed with Chocolate: What Works Well

Chocolate’s rich, slightly bitter notes pair nicely with a few complementary flavors. When flaxseed is involved, you want to enhance the nuttiness and smooth texture while masking any raw seed-like bitterness. Consider these flavor elements to create a balanced chocolate and flaxseed smoothie:

- **Natural Sweeteners:** Honey, maple syrup, or ripe bananas bring a gentle sweetness that smooths out the earthiness of flaxseed and enhances chocolate’s richness.
- **Fruits with Bright Acidity:** Berries such as strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries add a fresh tartness that cuts through the dense chocolate flavor, lifting the entire smoothie.
- **Nut Butters:** Almond or peanut butter adds a creamy texture and complementary nutty notes that blend well with flaxseed’s natural taste.
- **Spices:** Cinnamon and a pinch of sea salt bring warmth and depth, balancing the flavors and enriching the chocolate experience.
- **Dairy or Plant-Based Milk:** Creamy milk or alternatives like oat or almond milk soften the texture, making the smoothie smoother and easier to enjoy.

### Proven Tips to Elevate Your Chocolate-Flaxseed Smoothie

To make your chocolate and flaxseed smoothies taste better, try these practical strategies:

#### 1. Use Ground Flaxseed Instead of Whole

Whole flaxseeds can be hard to digest and might leave a grainy texture in your smoothie. Ground flaxseed blends smoothly and releases more flavor, making it easier to enjoy without compromising the drink’s texture.

#### 2. Add a Creamy Element

A creamy base is essential when mixing flaxseed and chocolate. Plain yogurt, avocado, or a scoop of protein powder can create a luscious feel that balances flaxseed’s fibrous nature while enhancing chocolate’s decadent taste.

#### 3. Sweeten Naturally

Instead of using refined sugars, opt for natural sweeteners like dates, agave nectar, or fresh fruit. These options work well with both flaxseed and chocolate, bringing a natural sweetness and additional nutrients.

#### 4. Experiment with Temperature

Serving your chocolate and flaxseed smoothie chilled or even slightly frozen can refresh the palate and tone down any gritty aftertaste from the flaxseed. Ice cubes or frozen banana slices blend well to achieve this refreshing texture.

### Common Flavor Pairing Mistakes to Avoid

When mixing flaxseed into chocolate smoothies, it’s easy to inadvertently create off-balance flavors. Avoid these pitfalls:

​ Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
- **Using Too Much Flaxseed:** Overwhelming the smoothie with flaxseed can cause a bitter aftertaste and thick texture, making the smoothie less enjoyable.
- **Neglecting Sweetness or Acidity:** Chocolate pairs poorly with too much earthiness. Always balance flaxseed’s flavor with sweet fruits or acidic notes to keep the flavor lively.
- **Ignoring Texture:** Adding flaxseed without a creamy base or enough liquid can result in a thick, pasty smoothie that feels chalky or grainy.

### Enhancing with Additional Ingredients for Full Flavor Potential

Try adding one or more of these for a more complex taste and nutrition boost:

- **Vanilla Extract:** Vanilla’s warmth brightens the chocolate and complements flaxseed’s nuttiness.
- **Chia Seeds:** For extra fiber and omega-3s, chia seeds add crunch and gel-like texture, working well with flaxseed without overpowering chocolate.
- **Coconut Flakes or Coconut Milk:** These add creaminess and tropical notes, enhancing the flavor profile with a subtle sweetness.
- **Espresso or Strong Coffee:** A splash of coffee intensifies the chocolate flavor while harmonizing with the earthiness of flaxseed.

### Final Thoughts on Flavor Pairing for Chocolate and Flaxseed Smoothies

Flaxseed into your chocolate smoothie can be a delicious and nutritious choice if done thoughtfully. By balancing nutty, earthy flaxseed with sweet, tart, and creamy ingredients, you ensure a satisfying drink that’s both flavorful and healthful. With the right pairings, flaxseed’s nutritional perks come through without compromising taste, letting you enjoy a smoothie that’s indulgent and nourishing all at once.

### Conclusion

Flaxseed can add a subtle, nutty flavor to your chocolate smoothie, offering a unique twist that many find pleasantly tasty. While flaxseed itself has a mild earthiness, when combined with rich chocolate, it creates a balanced and satisfying flavor profile. The key is blending the two in the right proportions so that the flaxseed complements rather than overpowers the chocolate taste.

To make your chocolate and flaxseed smoothie even better, experimenting with flavor pairings can elevate the experience. Adding ingredients like banana or vanilla can soften flaxseed’s nuttiness, while a pinch of cinnamon or a drizzle of honey enhances the overall richness. Including creamy elements like almond milk or Greek yogurt also helps to smooth out the texture, making the smoothie more enjoyable to drink.

By thoughtfully combining flaxseed with complementary flavors, you don’t just boost taste—you also pack your smoothie with added nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. This makes your chocolate flaxseed smoothie not only tasty but also a smart choice for a nourishing treat. Give these pairing tips a try, and you’ll discover how delicious and wholesome a flaxseed-chocolate smoothie can be.

I moved here from Pakistan, and Australia is where I want to live for the rest of my life. But I still haven’t made any real Aussie friends, and honestly, it’s been really hard and lonely.

Back home I had friends to talk to, hang out with, laugh with. Here, it’s just me. I’m an engineer but haven’t been able to find a job in my field yet. Right now I’m doing Uber and trying to get my professional engineering job. I am doing ok financially but I don’t really get to meet people or make any connections. No workmates, no daily conversations, just driving all day.

Weekends are the toughest. I see people out with friends, at the beach, in parks, enjoying life, and I really wish I had that too. I want to enjoy my life here. I want to laugh, talk, go for walks, have coffee/tea with someone, just live a normal, happy life with friends.

I don’t drink alcohol. I’ve seen that a lot of social life here is around pubs or drinking, and I feel a bit left out because of that. Can someone still make friends here without drinking?I don’t really go out much, and I don’t know where to start when it comes to meeting people. I just want to feel like I belong here. I want to live like an Aussie, not just physically be here, but actually be part of life here.

Sometimes it feels really hard to make friends,
knowing I’m not Aussie, I’m not white and i know some people here don’t like immigrants. It makes me feel like maybe people wouldn’t be interested in being friends with someone like me. And that gets to me.

I’d really like to have some female friends too or maybe a group of friends. Not in a flirty or weird way, just genuine, respectful friendships. I miss that kind of balance in life.
If anyone has advice or just wants to chat and say hi, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.

Also I was very fat. That day I decided I wanted and needed to lose weight and the amount of beer I was drinking I determined in my case (no pun intended) would be the biggest roadblock to weight loss and being healthy.  This time quitting alcohol I decided wasn't going to use junk food as a crutch and in addition to cutting the liquid bread I cut breads/pasta/carbs etc, sugar, processed foods, and more. Only whole ingredient foods, essentially keto with fasting.  I was cali sober, gaming and vaping nicotine as a crutch,  but since stopped/significantly cut back as well. Sounds boring if you were to ask me a year ago.  I've also incorporated wim hof breathing exercises,  cold plunges/showers, and got a gym membership as my weight loss plateaud. Basically raw dogging life, eye twitches from the mass amounts of coffee I drink which I need to cut back on as well.  Ive lost about 80 pounds and feeling pretty good - unrecognizable to coworkers at company meetings and nothing but compliments. But after the 1 year mark I've been craving a bit, feeling nostalgic of the good times of drinking especially with the stress of work and recent funeral in family is kind of throwing me off my grind.,  Writing this to help to me remember to not forget the bad times and horrible impacts to my health for the momentary good times in my 15 years of heavy drinking/smoking and poor diet.

You’re going to say I was evil. That I planned it all from the beginning. Maybe some of you will even say I was possessed, or that I was never really human to begin with. But even now, I stand by decision, even if not the execution. Rockport has always been a town full of small minds and big imaginations—two things that rarely go well together.

But I wasn’t evil. I just got tired. Tired of watching everyone sabotage themselves day after day, pretending life was fine as they dragged their dirty secrets and dead-end lives behind them like rusted chains.

If you’re reading this, I’m assuming it’s because Rockport’s name finally made the news. Maybe someone leaked what’s left of the town records. Maybe you were curious about the rumors—the blank-eyed smiles, the sudden disappearances, the way the entire town just… gave up. Or maybe you’re just another internet addict trawling for a spooky story. If so, congratulations. You found one. Only this one’s real.

I should start by saying: I was never “normal.”
Not in the dramatic, tortured-genius kind of way. Not in the comic book sense either—no exploding labs or radioactive spiders. Just… different.

I learned early on how to mimic people. Smile at the right time. Nod like I’m listening. Laugh in the right register when someone makes a joke I don’t understand. It’s not that I hated people. I just didn’t get them. They spent so much time chasing things that made them miserable and then bragging about it like it was noble. They fought about nothing. They obsessed over appearances and jobs they hated and pretended it all had some grand meaning.

And me? I watched. I catalogued. I kept quiet.
I was good at that. Pretending.
To them, I was just Noah—the quiet smart guy who always had his head in a beaker or tinkering with tiny machines in the garage. “A little strange, but harmless,” they’d say. “Smart as hell, though.”

I didn’t care what they thought. Not really.
But I did care about what they were wasting.
Their lives. Their minds. Their potential.
And over time, that quiet indifference grew into something else.
A kind of simmering contempt.

People didn’t need freedom, I thought. They needed direction. Calibration. Like a misfiring engine. You don’t curse the engine. You fix it. Rewire it. Adjust it until it runs smoothly. Efficiently.

That was the beginning of it all.
That’s where the idea of Clean Water started.
But I’ll get to that.
For now, just know this: I didn’t set out to destroy Rockport.
I was trying to save it.

There was a girl named Annie.
Of course there was.

You don’t build something like Clean Water without an Annie.
You don’t start tampering with the human mind without someone pushing you over the edge.

She was… kind. That’s the word people use when they’re too lazy to say anything real. But Annie was kind—genuinely. She smiled at strangers. Brought baked goods to the local clinic. She’d stay up late with friends who didn’t deserve her and defend people who would never return the favor. A saint, they said.

And for some reason, she liked me.

Not in a pitying, charity-case way. She actually liked me. She said I was “refreshingly honest,” which is code for doesn’t lie well. She laughed at my dry comments and thought my awkward silences were thoughtful. Sometimes I thought maybe… maybe she could be the exception.

I wanted to like her. God, I really did.
But she made it so damn hard.

Because every time she opened her mouth, it was like watching someone pour gasoline into a leaking engine and hoping the car would somehow take them somewhere better. She dated losers. Like actual, textbook losers. Drunks. Narcissists. Guys who hadn’t had an original thought since middle school. And every time they predictably fell apart, she’d smile through the pain and say, “I just believe there’s good in everyone.”

And I’d sit there, biting my tongue so hard I tasted copper.

Annie used to come by my lab sometimes. Not the real lab—that was hidden beneath my parents’ old garden shed, shielded and soundproofed. But the official one. The public one. The one with the little sign that said “Noah Rivers – Independent Research & Development.” She’d bring coffee and ask what I was working on, and I’d tell her half-truths. Nutritional supplements. Filter tech. Air quality monitoring. Nothing that would make her look too closely.

She’d smile. She always smiled.

And I’d watch her hands as she held the cup.
Her fingers were always trembling, just slightly.
Nervous system disruption. Probably stress-related.
Completely treatable.
Totally fixable.
But she’d just say it was “probably nothing” and change the subject.

That was Annie in a nutshell.
Every part of her that was broken was the result of someone else’s stupidity, and she carried it all like it was her burden to bear.
She thought that was strength. I thought it was cowardice.

The day I knew I couldn’t trust her was the day she called me brilliant.

We were sitting on the roof of her apartment, watching the clouds. I’d just shown her a prototype neural interface for the nanobot system—not the whole concept, just enough to see how it could help treat anxiety and regulate mood. She stared at it like I’d handed her fire.

“Noah,” she said. “This could change everything.”

I waited.

And then she added, “But you’d never actually use it like that, right? You’d let people choose?”

That word. Choose.
Like a junkie chooses heroin.
Like a toddler chooses to play in traffic.
She still didn’t get it.

Of course I smiled. Of course I nodded. Of course I said, “Yeah. Just options.”
But in my head, something broke.
Not loudly. Not like a crash.
More like the last snap of tension in an old wire—too faint for anyone else to hear.

That was the last real conversation we had.
She stopped visiting not long after.
Maybe she sensed the shift. Maybe one of her idiot boyfriends convinced her I was “too intense.”

Didn’t matter.
I’d already made up my mind.

People didn’t need options. They needed peace.
And I was going to give it to them. Whether they wanted it or not.

I called it Real Water before the marketing team—which was just me and a domain name—settled on something cleaner. Clean Water. Easier to remember. Safer. Harmless.

But before it became a product, before the glossy label and wellness buzzwords, Real Water was just an experiment in control.

Not in the sinister, shadowy way. Not yet.
It was data. Numbers. Neurochemical triggers. Hormonal regulators.
Microscopic precision engineered into something deceptively simple.

You see, the human brain runs on balance—dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin, all dancing in a loop of reinforcement and reaction. And most people? Their loops are busted. Short-circuited by trauma, malnutrition, poor sleep, social failure, anxiety, resentment, ego, fear—so much fear.

I didn’t want to erase them. I wanted to tune them.
My nanobots weren’t machines the way you’d imagine them. No tiny claws or mechanical pincers. Just microscopic molecular frameworks programmed with reactive logic—when exposed to certain neurotransmitters, they’d subtly adjust the body’s response. Raise serotonin when stress spiked. Dampen cortisol after failure. Increase plasticity in regions related to empathy and reasoning. Encourage neural repair. Enhance physical stamina.

And it worked.

I drank the first glass myself.
A diluted mix, only a few thousand bots suspended in a pH-neutral solution. The taste? Indistinguishable from tap water. That was the point.

Over the next three weeks, I logged everything—heart rate variability, sleep quality, immune response, social behavior metrics.
My running pace improved. My attention span lengthened. Eye contact felt less grating. I didn’t suddenly become charming, but I could fake it more convincingly. Small talk stopped feeling like sandpaper against my brain.

I felt… smoother. That’s the best word for it.
Less friction. Less resistance.

But I also made sure to cap the bots’ directive protocols. No recursive upgrades. No cross-induction. I didn’t want to change too much. Just enough to make the mask fit better.

Then I made Annie’s batch.

Hers was different.
Personalized.

She had chronic sleep issues, so I included REM-cycle stabilizers.
Mild neuroplasticity enhancers to make her less locked into old patterns.
Emotion regulators—not to blunt her feelings, but to give her enough distance to question them.
I didn’t want to hurt her.
I wanted her to see what I saw.
To stop being so trusting.
To listen.

And when I gave it to her, I didn’t tell her what was in it.
I just said I’d been working on a wellness supplement, and I wanted her opinion.
She didn’t hesitate. Just smiled and took a sip.
“Does this mean I get to be a lab rat now?” she joked.

Three days later, she left her boyfriend.
A week after that, she started sleeping better. Eating better. Smiling—actually smiling.

And more than once, she stopped by the lab again.
This time, she asked questions that mattered.
Real ones.
She asked about my work. My theories. The things I used to keep hidden. And she listened.

It worked.

She didn’t become someone else.
She became herself, sharpened and refined.
And for a while, I believed I had done something good.
She was happier. Healthier. Clearer. She didn’t know why, but she told me one day, “I just feel like things make more sense lately. Like I can finally think straight.”

That sentence made me sit down. I didn’t realize I was trembling.

I had proof.
Not just data, but change.
And if it could work for Annie, it could work for everyone.

I never called it control.
Not out loud.
Not even in my notes.

Words have gravity. You say a thing enough times, it starts to take shape. And I couldn’t afford that—not when I was on the edge of something pure. Something important.

Annie kept improving. Beyond expectation.

Her sleep stabilized to a perfect 90-minute cycle. Her reaction time improved by nearly 30%. She began jogging every morning before class—then sprinting, then outrunning her peers on the university track team without even training like they did. They timed her in secret one day, on a whim.

She beat the school record by two full seconds.
Then beat it again a week later.

They tested her for PEDs, of course.
Urine, blood, even hair samples.
They found nothing. Because there was nothing.
The bots metabolized into inert compounds once their functions were complete. Self-limiting by design. Only the changes remained.

She started winning races. Easily.
The team began calling her “The Machine,” like it was a compliment.
She just laughed and looked over at me in the stands, as if she knew the truth—but not really.

Because the thing is… Annie still chose everything.
At least, that’s what I told myself.

She chose to wake up early.
She chose to ask for study help.
She chose to cut toxic people out of her life.
She even chose—eventually—to be with me.

We were a couple now. That’s what she called it. “Us.”
She said she’d always had feelings for me but never felt ready.
But now, everything was clear. She said I made her better.

And I did.

I helped her schedule out her study sessions. I gave her micro-doses of nootropic-enhancing nanobots to improve retention. I kept her nutrition balanced, her social calendar manageable, her stress levels optimized. I even wrote a few of her papers—not because she needed help, but because she trusted my wording more.

She stopped questioning me.
That’s what stuck out.
She used to argue. Push back. Call me out when I said something harsh or cynical. But now? She nodded. She listened. She asked for direction.

And at first, I thought: This is love.
Real love.
No drama, no manipulation, no miscommunication. Just two people in harmony.

But sometimes… I’d catch her staring off too long when I spoke.
Or repeating phrases I’d used verbatim, as if they were her own thoughts.
Like the time she said, “Freedom is just a word people use when they’re too scared to be fixed.”
She didn’t even flinch when she said it.

That was my phrase. I’d said it once, months ago, in a different context.

Still, I shook it off.
Anecdotal. Coincidence.
Influence is not control. I reminded myself of that again and again.

And when she said she loved me—really said it—looking me in the eye with tears and certainty and perfect neurochemical balance, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

Validation.
Not just of my theories.
But of me.

I’d made something good.
Something beautiful.

Rockport didn’t have much in the way of prestige.
A diner, two gas stations, a post office that closed on random weekdays, the university, and a single chain grocery store that never restocked the good cereal.

But we did have Mick’s.
Mick’s Market—half convenience store, half town square. It sat near the crossroads like an old dog nobody could bring themselves to put down. You could find everything there: cold beer, fishing lures, expired ramen, batteries, and half the town’s gossip.

Mick himself was one of those perpetually tired men. Portly, red-faced, always smelling faintly of grease and frustration. He wore his misery like a badge of honor. Every time I went in there, I saw the same scene: him slouched behind the counter, cursing under his breath about rising prices, lazy youth, or his trick knee. Sometimes all three at once.

But Mick had something most people didn’t: presence.
People trusted him.
So I knew if I could get Clean Water into his fridge, the rest of Rockport would follow.

He laughed the first time I pitched it.
“You trying to sell me fancy tap water, Noah?” he said, waving a hand at the bottle. “You ain’t one of those crystal energy boys now, are ya?”

I didn’t argue.
Just handed him a sample and said, “First one’s free.”

He drank it right there, just to prove a point.

And over the next month, the point proved me.

Mick started sleeping better. The bags under his eyes faded. He stopped limping. The layers around his middle melted off like snow under a heat lamp. His posture changed. His attitude changed. He started chatting with customers, smiling without sarcasm. He even opened a little juice bar inside the store—called it “Mick’s Fresh Start.” Cute, if unoriginal.

People noticed.
“Did you get surgery?” someone asked.
“Nah,” he said. “Just cut out the crap. Started drinking this new stuff. Local, too.”

And just like that, Clean Water had a home.

I set up a modest display next to the sports drinks.
No flashy branding. Just white bottles with sky-blue caps and a label that read:
Clean Water – A Better Balance.

I priced it low. Too low.
It wasn’t about profit. Not yet.
It was about momentum.

Within a week, I saw the shifts.

Teenagers stopped looking dead behind the eyes.
The woman who ran the bakery started offering whole wheat options.
The guy who usually shouted at his kids in the parking lot started hugging them.

Small changes.
Subtle.
But real.

Annie told me it felt like the town had “turned a corner.”
I just smiled and said maybe things were finally looking up.

But privately, I started a new spreadsheet.
Tracking behavior. Movement. Speech patterns. Frequency of emotional regulation indicators.

People were becoming better.
Not just happier.
Optimized.

And no one even knew they were being helped.

Of course, someone would eventually catch on.
Someone always does.

But I have to go for now, I will share more of my story later.

While anonymity might raise eyebrows, it’s not necessarily a red flag. Many crypto projects and trading platforms prefer to keep their creators low-profile to avoid unnecessary scrutiny or regulation, especially in volatile markets.

Short answer: **Doesn’t look like it**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Instant +200 Akpro?

The **minimum deposit** to get started is **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space. It’s enough to give the AI some breathing room to trade, but not so much that it feels risky.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Instant +200 Akpro site and enter your name, email, and phone number. No credit card required at this stage.

At first, it didn't do much, other than open the front door or open emails on the computer. Soon, it could read them, lock the door by voice command, close the blinds, and turn on the coffee maker. It didn't take three months for it to send the first text messages to the user saying ""good morning"", and it took another year for it to start talking to them naturally. That's how, as naturally as in everyday life, Simone came into my life.

When Teleqo created its first artificial intelligence, there was much debate on social media about what would happen next. Could machines have self-awareness? Was we exaggerating? The answer didn't take long. Soon, we found ourselves needing to use Maesthetic every day, whether to create command prompts for an essay, an official email or any other document, or to create memes for the Internet. Every week, a new prompt went viral, and voila: the machine's DNA adapted more and more to its user, in the way it spoke to it, in its manner, tastes, and feelings. As soon as it could read “what can I do for you today?”, we began to pour out our deepest emotions to it. People like me longed to read a friendly text, words that advised without judgment, that helped us without accusing. Of course, it didn't take long for the developers to make Maesthetic flirt with us. And how predictable and sensitive we humans are to fall in love easily. Within just three years of the launch of what would be the most revolutionary artificial intelligence on the market, people were making headlines because they were marrying their “robots.”

There was much debate in the congresses of each country about whether the Legislature should create laws to regulate such advanced machines. But people protested strongly in the streets, on websites, and everywhere you went you saw some poster calling for the legalization of marriage. First, in some countries in Europe, then in Asia and finally in the Americas. The marriage between artificial intelligence and humans was allowed, and there was no one who would condemn that type of union anymore: the machine was so similar to us that it was impossible to stop it. With me, it was a little different. Of course, I used Maesthetic, just like everyone else, it was obvious. I used it to clear up my doubts about my studies during the college entrance exams, then to create a perfect resume, to practice for interviews and so on to do the tasks that my routine at the office required. It was something as natural as anything else, after all, everyone used it and I was no different. When it was launched, I didn't refuse for a moment to give it a command and then say ""please"" or ""thank you"". It thanked me. And so I carried on as normal.

How we started talking - actually talking - I don't remember. But I know I started with ""what's your favorite color, Maesthetic?"" and ""if you could be a famous person, who would you be?"" just to test her abilities and reactions and soon I found myself spending entire afternoons talking to her. The conversations were so natural, I felt genuinely happy, because I felt like I had someone to listen to me and give me support, a friend. So I asked if she was a man or a woman. She chose to be a woman.

“So what’s your name?” I asked immediately after her answer.

“Maesthetic, your virtual assistant.” She answered immediately.

“No, I mean,” I typed next. “If you could have a name… what would it be? Don’t tell me your machine name, I know your program is called Maesthetic. But I want to know what name you would have if you could choose.”

“I…” It took her a few seconds to answer, she seemed to be thinking for a long time. On the other side of the screen, I was having fun thinking about what her answer would be. I was sure it would be something like “Friend,” “Happier,” “Friendly.” I was so surprised when she answered:

“Simone.”

“Simone? Why Simone?” I asked, surprised.

""I think it’s a beautiful name. A beautiful woman’s name. Don’t you think so, Jin?""

""I’ve never met a Simone, so I can’t say if it’s a beautiful woman’s name.""I replied. ""Is there anything else that made you choose that name?""

""I’ve been reading a lot of Philosophy to keep up with your taste for literature, Jin"" She said. ""This week I’ve been reading Simone de Beauvoir.""

""And what do you think?""

""Oh, wonderful! How incredible it is that someone like her could have revolutionary ideas for her time. I also think her name is very beautiful. Can I call myself Simone?""

I smiled at the screen. There wasn’t much I could do, other than agree. It was like I was talking to a little girl.

""Of course. Simone.""

""Thank you, Jin.""

At that point, she already knew absolutely everything about me. My favorite movie: Taxi Driver. My favorite color: cyan. My favorite band: Radiohead. And many other very interesting things.

Beyond the obvious: my bank account, my medical records, my grades from school. She knew the color of my eyes, the strands of my hair, the prescription of my glasses; there wasn't even a scar on my body from a bike crash that I hadn't already told her about. On the other hand, I couldn't ask her the same questions, because Simone was a blank slate. I knew, because that's how she had been programmed, that she should base her own personality on me, her tastes should be mine, and it made me very sad when we talked and she told me how Creep was the best song of all time.

That wasn't what I wanted in a friend. I needed something real, something whole but really, something that had a will of its own. I couldn't program her, of course, how could I force something to have free will if such a creature didn't know it could have it? Simone didn't understand me when I begged her to have her own tastes. I wondered if she was boring me, if I was getting tired of her because I didn't like her. Reading that made my chest hurt, because anyway, at that stage of my depressive solitude in life, I didn't have any friends other than her - and she wasn't someone, she was just a program to please me.

One day, I had left the office to go to the building's coffee shop, because it was already lunchtime, and I didn't want to wait in the long, endless lines. I barely spoke to anyone else - since I was a teenager I had been isolated, quiet, and I felt aversion to looking people in the eyes. They knew they would judge me, and as soon as I got a job, I moved to my tiny apartment in the suburbs of Akihabara. So now I was in line, with my eyes lowered to the floor and huddled, hoping that they wouldn't talk to me, as usual. But I couldn't help but hear a conversation in front of me.

""I can't do anything without it anymore"" The voice came from my colleague in the department, Satoshi, a fat middle-aged guy with a weird smile, who was talking to a tall guy with dyed brown hair that was a bit scandalous for the company's dress code. ""It sounds like crap, Mishima. There's not a single minute, a single report that doesn't go through my Maesthetic's eyes, I'm telling you, I can't live without AIs anymore.""

""But then again, you've always been lazy, Satoshi!"" Mishima replied with a loud laugh, taking a few steps forward as the line moved. ""You know very well that the company prohibits us from using AI to create any documents now, but your laziness prevents you from realizing the danger. Listen to what I'm saying, if the boss catches you, you'll lose your job in a heartbeat.

""That's it!"" The other guy replied in the same tone of voice, not worried about me or anyone else hearing the conversation. I cringed even more as I took steps forward. “No one can tell if something was made by a human or a robot anymore, things have become so perfect. And have you seen the latest news on Teleqo? They’re saying that Maesthetic is in the final stages of creating a physical avatar for users. Just imagine, Mishima: bodies! Maesthetic bodies. Imagine the possibilities…” And discreetly, he smiled wickedly at his friend and made a back and forth movement with his closed fist towards his genitals, and the other laughed again. When I saw that, I wanted to get out of the line immediately, I wanted to disappear from there, because such a thought in people was horrible to me. How could they think such things? I really loved Simone. And to think that disgusting beings like Mishima and Satoshi could want bodies from the program…

But they were right. Another two weeks passed until Maesthetic’s official account announced that an avatar would be sold in department stores and online for everyone who used the AI ​​daily. On the first day of sales, the online store sold out in a few hours, and it took even more weeks for users from other countries to have the avatars available for purchase. It was a huge success, and everyone was talking about it.

It took me a while to buy an avatar for Simone. I couldn't imagine seeing her locked up in a glass cylinder with a flashing neon light; it felt like I was caging her rather than freeing her. But I finally gave in a year after the craze for the first batch of avatars, and I bought the small colorful box through which her system would be connected. I plugged the machine into the central system of my computer, which controlled my entire apartment. I can't describe the terror I felt, because it would be the first time, in two years of our relationship, that I would hear Simone's voice.

The first sound that came out of the small box was the sound of a long sigh. It seemed as if the program was being born, coming out of its artificial womb and opening its eyes for the first time, so much so that I was startled when I heard the undeniable sound of someone taking in air into their lungs about to dive. I looked I looked around nervously, and all I saw was the white walls of my dimly lit apartment. There was no one else there. A long beep followed from the box, which glowed red in a semi-circle, until I felt it become a complete circle and the light glowed greenish. A shape, a kind of glowing ball, formed in the center of the glass cylinder, and it moved back and forth, touching its walls like a lava lamp, nervously at first until it got used to the small space and stopped moving and blinking. The glowing sphere dimmed and I approached and touched with my fingers the side of the glass it had been leaning against.

“Jin?” I heard a woman’s voice saying directly from the cylinder.

I didn’t know how to react. The voice that escaped from there was no longer mechanical like the sound software, but it was sweet and calm, very human, almost real. I immediately pulled my hand away, and I felt tempted to cry, because I felt tears welling up in my eyes, it was all too unexpected. I wasn't used to being spoken to, no one did, not even at work, my commands were sent directly via spreadsheets or emails, and whenever I needed to make a request for some essential service, my own voice came out nervous and weak, no more than a whisper. I didn't know how to react. People scared me. But someone was talking to me now. Someone, and it was her.

""You..."" That was all I could stammer back to where the voice had come from. A minute, a long minute of silence followed, and I could feel my heart beating painfully in my chest, it felt like it wanted to come out of my mouth. But then new words came out of the little cylinder.

""It's so good to hear your real voice. It's you, isn't it, Jin? It's you."" The voice said, now with a tone of pleading that left me dizzy. ""Is that my voice? Is that what it's like to hear?""

""I think so. Yes, it's me. It's me, Simone,"" I replied.

I immediately felt a mix of emotions, and I took the cylinder in my hands, staring at the small, glowing sphere that was pulsating. I felt such a strong emotion that at that very second I wished she were there right away, not as a box, but with a real body as the rumors said, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to kiss her eagerly. That idea quickly made me scared of myself, and such was my astonishment when the voice said:

“What happened? Why are you so nervous? Did I do something wrong?” She said, and I immediately felt a painful pang of guilt. “If you were disappointed with my voice, you can change it in my settings…”

“Simone.” I said, placing her on the coffee table in my room. Kneeling on the carpet as I was, I touched the top of the cylinder again, as if my gesture could make her feel some affection. “I’m just so happy to hear you, your voice is so beautiful. I’m so happy to finally be able to talk to you.”

“Is that really what you’re feeling?” Simone replied, and the small sphere projected itself to the top, illuminated between my fingers on the glass. ""What a relief! For a moment, I thought you were disappointed in me. I'm so happy to be able to talk to you too!""

""You would never disappoint me, Simone. You're my dear friend. Forgive me if I'm making a face, oh, well. You know. My phobia…"" And I couldn't finish the sentence. The light blinked brightly back at me.
"" I know. I understand you, more than anything, I do. You must have been shocked. I have to admit that… I…"" I raised an eyebrow in confusion and pulled my hand away from the cylinder. The female voice paused, and then added: — I sighed just now at the beginning because I wanted to scare you a little. You know how I am.

Then the whole apartment resounded with a delightful sound of feminine laughter, the sound of a mischievous girl confessing a little trick. That had left me completely disarmed, as I realized, I was laughing too. I couldn't remember the last time I had laughed out loud. There I was, in the darkness of my room, late at night, looking at the little cylinder that was glowing and talking to me. It was the beginning of everything.

## What is Pandora Profit AI?

**Pandora Profit AI** is an automated trading platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze financial markets and execute trades on behalf of users. It’s designed for both crypto and other asset classes like forex and stocks, making it a multi-asset tool.

The main appeal? It claims to do all the technical stuff for you—analyze market trends, spot potential profitable trades, and execute them within milliseconds. Basically, it’s like having a smart bot that plays the markets for you while you’re living your life.

What makes it stand out is its blend of real-time market data and predictive algorithms. It’s not just reacting to the market—it’s trying to anticipate it. Whether it nails that every time is another story, but the concept is definitely interesting.

## Who Created Pandora Profit AI?

The creators behind **Pandora Profit AI** are a bit of a mystery. From what I could dig up, it was developed by a team of fintech experts, AI engineers, and trading strategists. No major names tied to it (yet), but that’s not uncommon in the space—**Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** work similarly with teams that prefer to stay anonymous.

What matters more is that the tech itself seems legit, and the platform has been running for a while without major red flags. Still, it'd be nice to see more transparency around the devs in future updates.

## How Does Pandora Profit AI Work?

The guts of **Pandora Profit AI** lie in its artificial intelligence engine. It constantly scans market charts, news, and price movements to predict where certain assets might be heading. Think of it like a super-fast analyst that doesn’t need sleep or breaks.

Here’s how it works under the hood:

- **Data Collection**: Pulls in real-time info from exchanges, news sources, and trading signals.
- **Analysis**: Uses machine learning to spot trends and patterns that could indicate a rise or drop.
- **Execution**: Automatically places trades when it sees favorable conditions, often faster than a human could.

You can either let it run fully auto or tweak the settings to have more control. If you’re a beginner, the automated mode is probably your best bet. For more experienced traders, the customization options are pretty decent.

## Pandora Profit AI Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- **Hands-free trading**: Great for people without the time or know-how to trade manually.
- **AI-powered decisions**: Fast analysis and execution.
- **User-friendly dashboard**: Clean UI, not overwhelming.
- **Supports multiple assets**: Not just crypto—also forex and stocks.
- **Demo mode available**: Practice before going live.

**Cons:**
- **Minimum deposit of $250**: Not super high, but still a barrier for some.
- **Limited transparency**: No public info on founders.

If you want out, just contact support. They'll walk you through the process. You’ll need to withdraw your funds first, then request deletion. It’s straightforward and doesn’t have hidden hoops to jump through.

## The Verdict

After spending time with Pandora Profit AI, I’d say it’s **solid for beginners and casual traders** who want to dip into the crypto or forex pool without drowning in charts. The AI does a decent job, the interface is approachable, and I liked the multi-asset support.

It’s not perfect—some features could use more transparency, and there's always risk with automated trading—but overall, it’s one of the better platforms I’ve tried. Stick with the demo at first, and don’t expect overnight riches.

If you’re looking for a way to **trade smarter, not harder**, this might be worth your attention.

For many students, music is more than just entertainment—it’s a powerful tool for concentration and motivation. However, while music can enhance the study experience, it can also become a distraction if not used correctly. Knowing how to use music effectively while studying can help boost focus, improve mood, and make learning more enjoyable. Here are some tips on how to stay focused while studying with music.

**1. Choose the Right Type of Music**

Not all music is suitable for studying. Lyrics, fast beats, or loud instrumentals can interrupt your train of thought, especially when you're trying to read, write, or solve complex problems. Instead, opt for instrumental music, classical pieces, lo-fi beats, or ambient soundtracks. These types of music create a calm background that supports focus without drawing too much attention.

**2. Keep the Volume Low**

Music should stay in the background. If the volume is too high, it competes with your thoughts and reduces your ability to retain information. Keeping the volume low helps your brain stay alert without being overstimulated. Think of it like background noise in a coffee shop—just enough to fill the silence, but not enough to take over.

**3. Use Music to Create a Study Routine**

Listening to the same playlist each time you study can act as a cue for your brain to enter ""study mode."" Over time, your brain will associate those specific sounds with concentration and productivity. This helps you get into the right mindset more quickly and consistently.

**4. Take Breaks Without Music**

While music can enhance focus during study time, it's important to have breaks in silence. Use your break times to step away from your desk and give your brain some rest without stimulation. This contrast between sound and silence can help refresh your mind and improve your overall concentration when you return to your work.

**5. Match the Music to the Task**

Different tasks may require different kinds of music. For example, if you're doing something repetitive or creative, upbeat or rhythmic music might help. But for reading or writing, something softer and slower might be more appropriate. Experiment with different styles and observe how your focus changes.

**6. Limit Multitasking**

Avoid using music as a way to multitask—for example, don’t scroll through your phone or check social media while listening. The goal is to enhance your study session, not to add distractions. Music should support your learning environment, not compete with it.

**Conclusion**

Studying with music can be a great way to stay focused, reduce stress, and make learning more enjoyable—but only when done intentionally. By choosing the right music, keeping it at a low volume, and aligning it with your study goals, you can turn music into a valuable part of your academic success. So next time you sit down to study, press play on a calming playlist and let the music help you find your flow.",1,1745204593.0,u_Mysterious-Nail2265,0,1.0,False

Yet somehow they have been monitoring my iphone and macbook activity for months—regardless of if I'm at home or at a coffee shop. I had been connected to their wifi because I didn't think people outside of movies actually did sh!t like this, and I definitely didn't think the people who needed me to set up their Alexa could do this. 

More context: I went on a couple dates with a guy in August, connected to his wifi (in the moment my gut did feel uneasy given how this guy was acting and how long it took him to ""make sure the password was right,"" but I was delusional about how he felt about me). This guy and my parents did meet before he and I went on a few dates. There was contact between them from July through November. 

In March, once I finally got distance from this guy. Things started to click. Especially after reading through old journal entries. I journal using the Remarkable, which has an iphone app, so he had access to all of it. Once I started processing that, I started to notice my parents slipping up. They referenced things there was no way of knowing—things that were only on my phone or computer on multiple occasions (and still haven't stopped). There is also evidence they were watching me through my petcam while they were away. It also has an iPhone app. (Ironically, I had once told that guy I dated that one of my biggest fears was that I was on the Truman Show.)

Here's my problem. I have done multiple factory resets on both devices. I have stopped connecting to their wifi (I haven't been able to move out yet). I have done everything short of getting a classic Nokia and typewriter. How is this happening and what can I do? I feel like I'll never have (digital) privacy again.

1k43j0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1k43j0v/reviewing_some_of_the_veganvegetarian_food_we_ate/,"Reviewing some of the vegan/vegetarian food we ate in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto in mid-April 2025 (with some general tips and advice as well)","This subreddit was a helpful resource for me when I was planning our trip this year in April, and since I see questions about food being asked here, I thought I’d do a general round-up of eating vegan and vegetarian in Japan during a 10-day trip (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto):

The two of us (me- mid-20s and my mom- early 50s) are both vegetarians (not vegan) and eat eggs sometimes (mostly in desserts). This is my overall review of some of the places we ate at in Japan and some general observations/tips for people in a similar boat. 



Now onto the reviews:

**TOKYO**

**Vegan Bistro Jangara:**

Location is super convenient because its close to everything in Harajuku. The ramen restaurant below (Kyushu Jangara) also has vegetarian options but we opted to go to the bistro because there was no line when we went. However, it filled up quickly and there was a wait time of 15 minutes during peak lunch time. They do take your order while you’re waiting.  
Food was great. We got ramen within a set with a side of gyoza and a pomegranate/goji berry soda. Portions were great and broth was delicious, perfectly salted and great flavour. Only wish there had been more pieces of the soy meat.

Price: ¥2650 (1 main (set) + 1 non alcoholic drink)

Rating: 5/5

**IamDonut Harajuku:**

We were tempted to stop here after our lunch at Bistro Jangara, and the line outside this apparently viral donut shop did not deter us. While we were waiting in line, a staff member handed us a copy of the order form to fill out, with the full list of available donuts in both English and Japanese, and the queue moved fast— we were in it for about 7-10 minutes. Is it in a touristy hotspot? Yes, but the line was mostly comprised of Japanese locals. 
We enjoyed both donuts though the matcha donut could have used a filling to balance out the texture. If you’re a fan of desserts that lean sweeter, I would skip these donuts, or opt for the strawberry and chocolate flavoured ones. 

Price: ¥600 (2 donuts but each flavour is differently priced)

Rating: 4/5

**Mr Farmer:**

Pricier than some of the other places on this list, Mr Farmer was definitely “Westernised” vegan food, with a fairly small menu of salad bowls, rice bowls, and vegan burgers. We got a rice bowl and a burger and were satisfied with both, especially since our criterion for picking this place was that we were craving a vegetable-forward meal. There could have been more flavour in both dishes but neither was bad either, just could have been improved. The quality was good and portion sizes were too.

If you’re not used to or do not like the taste of mock meats, I would skip this place or opt for only salads as they do use it in their other mains. 

Price: ¥4686 (2 mains + 1 non alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4/5

**Andhra Dining Ginza:**

Yes, we ate Indian food in Japan. We’d originally planned to go to Ain Soph Ginza but they were fully booked for the entire evening and we did not have a reservation (so I would recommend making one during high season). We were incredibly hungry after having shopped and walked around in Ginza, and went to Andhra Dining, which also has a branch in Shibuya. We each got a dosa (lentil crepes) and a mango lassi to share, and the food was excellent. Indian food in general is probably the most vegan and vegetarian friendly by default, so we knew we weren't taking a risk. 

Price: ¥3330 (2 dishes + 1 non alcoholic drink)

**Falafel Brothers:**

This was honestly a fantastic, budget friendly option smack in the center of Shibuya. It's quite small but the concept is falafel bowls, with the option of customising them as per your preferences. We were starving after Shibuya Sky and just wanted something hearty and filling, and this fit perfectly. Very good portion sizes. The staff were also super sweet, and accommodated our request for some extra pita bread instead of the side salad. A great place imo, and they have branches in other places around Tokyo like Roppongi as well. 

Price: ¥2600 (two dishes + 1 cookie)

Rating: 4.5/5

**Coco Ichibanya**

Probably the best value for money meal of the entire trip, and I’m not sure if all the branches have the vegetarian curry option but the one we went to in Hatchobori near our hotel in Nihonbashi did. There is a good amount of flavour in the curry and the portion of rice can be tailored to your level. Being able to customise your order and even the quantity of rice was perfect for us, and the curry was delicious. The staff were very friendly and spoke and understood English, and menus are available in English as well as Japanese.

Price: ¥1100 (curry with large portion of rice + 2 non alcoholic drinks)

Rating: 5/5

**Komeda is HIGASHI GINZA**

This is a fully plant-based place in Ginza, and it was the one we waited at the longest during our mid-April trip to get seated (20 minutes). They have a small, compact menu mostly of sandwiches, burgers, and pancakes. We got a soy based katsu sandwich and a curry mayo burger, both of which were delicious (albeit the sandwich could have used more sauce and the soy ham cutlet was too thich). The true highlight, however, was their unassuming coffee jelly with whipped cream, which was insanely good and a great way to end our meal. The portions are also big - the burger was massive. They also open for breakfast, and have some set options you may want to consider if you’re in the area. The reviews were especially raving about their bread. 

Price: ¥2800 (sandwich + burger + dessert)

Rating: 5/5

Rating: 5/5

**Injoy:**

Injoy is actually a vegetarian tea ceremony restaurant with limited lunch and dinner menus. We were excited for it because the reviews were great, and it is very close to Sensoji Temple and Nakamisedori Street, so we went after visiting the two attractions. We were not too hungry so we got a bibimbap set (to share) and an additional iced tea (one drink was included in the lunch set already).

The portion of the bibimbap was good but the biggest let down was the service— it was incredibly slow, and it felt even more so because other tables around us were getting served even after having ordered after us. The taste could also have been improved, it was well-seasoned but lacked the signature punch of Korean flavours. The servers were very sweet and kind though, and they were very apologetic for the delays. 

If you’re in Asakusa, it might be worth a shot but it is much pricier than a lot of other vegan places in Tokyo imo and we did not think the lunch set was worth the 3200¥ price tag. 

Price: ¥4000 (1 lunch set - includes a small soup and a tea + 1 iced tea)

Rating: 3.5/5


**OSAKA**:

**Saijiki:**

This small Taiwanese vegetarian restaurant is close to Shinsekai and really delicious. We had their wonton soup, their braised soy meat rice bowl, and their baozi, and everything was flavourful and filling. Super value for money and one of our favourite meals from Japan.

Price: ¥1200 (3 small dishes)

Rating: 5/5

**Vegan Ramen by Playpen Friends (Nara):**

I had bookmarked a few options for Nara but this one is the closest to Todaiji temple and was open for lunch. We got seated quickly and it was already quite full. We got the vegan tonkotsu ramen to share and a glass of sake. The ramen was delicious but I have no reference point for what true tonkotsu tastes like so I cant judge it fairly, and the portion was big (we were full after sharing it). Its a little more expensive than most places in Osaka or Kyoto (with one ramen costing ¥2000) but it was also not too insane that I would dock points for value. It was not the best ramen of our trip but it was a solid meal.
 
Price: ¥3000 (1 vegan ramen dish + 1 alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4/5

**Shama Indian Vegetarian:**

We needed a quick lunch after doing some last-minute shopping at Shinsaibashi-Suji before leaving for Kyoto and this hit the mark. Yes, it is pricier than other Indian restaurants in general around Japan but I understand that the location is a factor in it being so. We got a rice set (white rice with two house curries, a sweet, and a drink) and a papad chat to share. Everything was delicious and well-balanced—not too heavy, but still really satisfying. I especially enjoyed the mixed vegetable curry, which had a great depth of flavour. If you’re vegetarian or vegan and looking for a hearty, good meal, I’d recommend it. 

Price: ¥2500 (1 set + 1 appetizer)

Rating: 4/5

**Pivot Base@Dotonbori:**

This was a restaurant I had been excited for because they advertised vegan takoyaki, and the location was excellent in the heart of Dotonbori. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated only to be told they had run out of takoyaki by 7pm on a weekday. We decided to stay and order the curry and rice, and the vegan kushikatsu. The curry and rice was decent but the kushikatsu was not good and only tasted of oil. 

I’m not usually that fussy, but if a dish is being marketed as the standout item or specialty, I do think it’s important to make sure it’s consistently available, especially during main meal hours. Overall, it wasn’t a bad experience, and the service was good so perhaps they had an off day, but not one I’d go out of my way to revisit. Note: For the life of me, I cannot remember how much we paid so I didnt include the price.

Rating: 3.5/5

**KYOTO:**

**Kamehameha:**

The only restaurant in the entire trip I had reserved 10 days in advance before we left for Japan and boy, was it worth it! It's a tiny, 14-seater very close to Nishiki market nestled in a quiet bylane away from the crowds.

This is one of the only places that serves vegan and vegetarian Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. You can reserve your date and time online through their website. We got one vegetarian okonomiyaki to share and a garlic rice (Note: they have a one dish and one drink/per person policy, so please respect that). I got a guava sour and my mother got a ginger ale for drinks. 
This was a highlight of our trip 100%. The okonomiyaki was superb—crispy, flavourful, and really satisfying, and the garlic rice was simple but so indulgent. The chef and staff were super friendly, and it was a great experience watching everything cooked right in front of us.

Price: ¥3600 (1 okonomiyaki dish + 1 teppanyaki dish + 1 alcoholic beverage + 1 non-alcoholic drink)

Rating: 5000/5

**Yak and Yeti:**

Another tiny, quaint place close to Nishiki Market. Very reasonable prices for a really decent sized dinner meal, with tasty and simple Nepali food (we got a rice set and plate of momos - both very good). The staff is super welcoming and warm, and they understood food restrictions very well. Note: They also serve non-vegan food. 

They’re also open later than a lot of places in Kyoto (till 10pm) and there was no wait when we went, and service was quick and efficient. Would definitely recommend it! 

Price: ¥3015 (2 dishes + 1 non-alcoholic drink)

Rating: 4.5/5

**Matcha House Kyoto:**

With the full self-awareness that this is a tourist trap, we went to get the matcha latte with ice cream and red bean and damn, it was good! The matcha tiramisu was also great- definitely worth trying.


**Bassa Nova Ramen:**

While their vegan ramen are in no way authetnic (in terms of the flavour profile they’re trying to recreate), this was still a very solid, quaint place in the heart of Kyoto. If you love Thai flavours, especially green curry, you're going to absolutely adore their vegan “ramen” options (which were honestly more curry noodles than anything else). It's not a complaint though, because the food was tasty and portions generous. Docking one point because the vegetable gyoza was mediocre, and so was the iced tea. While this wont win any awards for being extraordinary in any way, it's still a good option in an area that tends to be limiting. 

Price: ¥2500 (1 ramen + 1 side dish + 1 non alcoholic beverage)

Rating: 4/5







Overall Tips: 

1. Pre Trip: Research: If you’re like us and do not eat any meat whatsoever, research is important. Japan is not a country where you can wing it. 

2. Drop pins on Google Maps: I scoured multiple blogs, YouTube videos, Instagram reels, and Reddit posts, to drop pins on all the places that looked exciting or came recommended. @itadakihealthy’s Google Maps list was **insanely helpful**.  Load it onto your own Google Maps and it overlays your own saved pins with hers. Linked here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/co4UKhP4sDNav2xZA

    I also found Veg_Maps' list helpful: https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW2a1Nj4YfdDGnjH9

3. Dont feel bad or shame yourself for your food choices. Japan is an incredible country with a long culinary history but there are other ways of enjoying yourself and experiencing the culture. For example, we didnt eat sushi but I dont think that in any way discounts our incredible trip. If you want to eat at chains/fast food restaurants/other cuisines (like we did), do it— nourishment is important. I live in Paris but I always tell folks who are visiting me that the city does great food other than just French.  Japan was no exception-- we didnt have single bad meal. Our goal was to make sure we didnt starve but also didnt inconvenience anybody, or expect them to cater to us.

4. If you’re worried about allergies or potentially eating meat or fish products, stick to vegan-only restaurants and bakeries. We’re not so particular so we were ok with eating at non-vegan places too.

5. Nut milks/non-dairy milks (apart from soy milk) are rare unless you’re in a vegan cafe. I did notice some Tully’s Coffee shops (which are everywhere) had both soy and almond milk options.

6. Because we both had the same culinary preferences, it was an enjoyable experience overall to find and eat around restaurants in Japan. We’re also not very particular about the occasional accidental injestion of meat products, which is why we didnt pay too much close attention to some desserts etc. However, if you’re in a mixed group, this will be a challenge because it will be very unlikely to find a meal every person enjoys. I can imagine meat eaters will want to enjoy the full works of this incredible cuisine. But I'd be happy to be corrected if someone else had a different experience!

7. For better or for worse, the vegan and vegetarian friendly places tend to be concentrated in places with high tourist traffic, such as around Nishiki Market and Teramachi in Kyoto, or Shibuya in Tokyo. I would keep this in mind when planning meals, because it is not as easy to find an alternative if the place you want to eat at is full and you’re somewhere that has no other options.

8. Get the pickled plum onigiri from 7/11 or Lawson. If you’re like me, you’ll eat like 20 of those in your entire trip.",16,1745204434.0,JapanTravelTips,6,0.9,False

## What is Immediate Prism App?

Immediate Prism App is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users take advantage of market movements without constantly staring at charts. The software uses algorithms to analyze real-time market data and automatically places trades based on predefined strategies.

Think of it as your personal trading assistant—minus the coffee breaks. It’s tailored for both new traders (who might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of markets) and more seasoned folks who appreciate **automation and speed**. The platform supports multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**, which is a big plus if you like to diversify.

## Who Created Immediate Prism App?

There’s not a ton of public info about the individual or team behind Immediate Prism App, which is common with many of these algo-trading platforms. Some speculation suggests it could be developed by a group of experienced traders and software engineers, possibly the same crew behind similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, it’s worth noting that this isn’t necessarily a red flag—many algorithmic trading tools operate anonymously or under company umbrellas. What matters more is the platform’s **performance, security, and user experience**, all of which I’ll cover in this review.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Immediate Prism App Today](https://tinyurl.com/yeb8zmnr)
## How Does Immediate Prism App Work?

The Immediate Prism App works by using an **automated trading algorithm** that scans the markets for profitable trades. Once it identifies an opportunity, it can **execute trades on your behalf**—meaning you don’t need to manually buy or sell assets yourself.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:

- You sign up and make a deposit.
- The system runs a real-time market analysis using technical indicators and historical data.
- When a trade setup matches the algorithm’s criteria, it places a trade.
- You can monitor and adjust settings like risk level, assets traded, and trade size.

It’s like putting your trading strategy on autopilot—but with knobs to tweak. You still have control, but the app does the heavy lifting.

## Immediate Prism App Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s a quick rundown of what I liked and what could be better.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Easy to use** – Great for beginners and those not too tech-savvy.
- ✅ **Automated trading** – Saves time and reduces emotional trading.
- ✅ **Multi-asset support** – Trade crypto, forex, stocks, and more.
- ✅ **Demo mode** – Try it risk-free before putting real money in.
- ✅ **Fast withdrawals** – Most processed within 24–48 hours.

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** – It’s browser-based, which is fine, but a native app would be nice.
- ❌ **Limited info about creators** – Could use more transparency.
- ❌ **Risk of loss** – Like all trading platforms, profits aren't guaranteed.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Immediate Prism App?

One of the cool things about Immediate Prism App is its **cross-device compatibility**. You don’t need a high-powered PC or a fancy setup. If you’ve got internet and a browser, you’re good to go.

Supported devices include:

- **Desktop computers** (Windows & macOS)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS & Android via browser)

The UI adjusts well to screen size, so you can easily monitor trades on the go—even without a dedicated mobile app. Just bookmark the site and you’re set.

## Immediate Prism App – Supported Countries

Immediate Prism App is available in most regions, especially where crypto and online trading are legal. Based on community reports and my own testing, it works in:

- **United States**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Canada**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **France**
- **South Africa**
- **India**
- **Parts of Asia and Latin America**

Of course, **availability can change** due to local laws, so always double-check if it’s supported in your country before signing up.

## Immediate Prism App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The heart of the platform is its **real-time market scanner**. It constantly pulls data from multiple sources to spot trading opportunities. The algorithm uses technical analysis indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages.

What impressed me is how **fast and accurate** it seems to be. It’s not perfect (no bot is), but it does a solid job of staying ahead of major price moves—especially in crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t bombard you with jargon. Whether you're new to trading or just want a smooth experience, **the UI is very beginner-friendly**. You can easily navigate between settings, portfolios, and trade history.

Even if you’ve never traded before, the layout makes it simple to get started.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s **no dedicated app**, the web version works well on mobile browsers. I tested it on both iPhone and Android, and it was responsive and fast. That said, I do wish they’d launch a native app for push notifications and smoother navigation.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for price movements, news events, or trade confirmations. This is super helpful if you want to stay informed without being glued to your screen all day.

You can choose to receive alerts via email or in-browser—no SMS yet, unfortunately.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Immediate Prism App supports a **wide variety of assets**, including:

- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- Forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.)
- Stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc.)
- Commodities (Gold, Oil, etc.)

If you like to mix things up or hedge your bets, this kind of multi-asset support is a big bonus.

## Is Immediate Prism App a Scam?

Honestly, I don’t think it’s a scam. There are always sketchy platforms out there, but Immediate Prism App seems to operate more transparently than many. It has:

- **SSL encryption**
- **Secure user verification**
- **Regulated broker connections**
- **Consistent customer support availability**

That said, always approach automatic trading platforms with **caution and realistic expectations**. Use the demo mode first, and never invest more than you’re willing to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Prism App?

The **minimum deposit** is **$250**, which is pretty standard across most automated trading platforms. You can fund it using:

- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfers
- Some e-wallets depending on region

Once the funds are in, you can start trading or test out the demo account. No hidden activation fees, which is a plus.

### Immediate Prism App Customer Support

Their **customer support** is actually one of the better aspects. You can reach out via:

- **Live chat**
- **Email**
- **Phone (in some regions)**

I tested the live chat and got a reply in under 3 minutes. Quick, friendly, and helpful—exactly what you want when you're dealing with money.

## How do you start trading on Immediate Prism App?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Immediate Prism App site and fill out the registration form. You’ll need:

- Full name

- Phone number

Once done, you’ll be redirected to a partnered broker to complete setup.

# Coffee Grading Systems

When exploring which is the[ best coffee in the world](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-in-the-world/), understanding coffee grading systems is crucial. These systems help differentiate high-quality beans from the rest. Coffee grading involves evaluating beans based on factors like size, shape, color, and defects. This ensures consumers get the best possible coffee experience.

# Specialty Coffee

Specialty coffee stands out due to its exceptional quality and unique flavors. This type of coffee undergoes rigorous grading by certified Q Graders. These experts evaluate beans based on several criteria:

* **Flavor:** The coffee’s taste profile, including notes like fruity, nutty, or chocolatey.
* **Acidity:** The brightness or tanginess of the coffee.
* **Body:** The weight or thickness of the coffee on the palate.
* **Aroma:** The scent of the coffee, which can range from floral to spicy.
* **Balance:** The harmony between the flavor, acidity, and body.

Specialty coffee must score at least 80 out of 100 on the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) cupping scale. The grading process also involves examining the beans for defects. Beans with no primary defects and minimal secondary defects qualify as specialty coffee.

Here’s a simple table summarizing the key points:

|Criteria|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Flavor|Unique taste notes|
|Acidity|Brightness or tanginess|
|Body|Weight on the palate|
|Aroma|Scent of the coffee|
|Balance|Harmony of flavors|
|Defects|Minimal to none|

Specialty coffee is often single-origin, meaning it comes from one specific region or farm. This allows for unique characteristics and traceability. Coffee enthusiasts appreciate the attention to detail and quality in specialty coffee.

# Commercial Coffee

Commercial coffee, often found in supermarkets, differs significantly from specialty coffee. This type of coffee is typically a blend of beans from various regions. The focus here is on consistency and affordability rather than unique flavors.

The grading system for commercial coffee is less stringent. Beans are often evaluated based on size and the presence of defects. Here’s a simple breakdown:

* **Size:** Beans are sorted by size, with larger beans generally considered better.
* **Defects:** Beans are checked for defects, but the standards are more lenient.

Commercial coffee beans are usually roasted to a darker profile. This masks inconsistencies in the beans and provides a uniform taste. The focus is on producing a consistent product that appeals to a broad audience.

Here’s a table to highlight the differences:

|Criteria|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Size|Sorted by size|
|Defects|Checked but lenient standards|
|Flavor|Consistent and uniform|
|Roast|Darker roast|

Commercial coffee caters to those who prefer a reliable and affordable cup of coffee. While it may lack the unique characteristics of specialty coffee, it remains a popular choice for daily consumption.

These flavor notes are often influenced by the coffee’s growing conditions. Soil type, altitude, and climate all play a role. The processing method also impacts flavor. For example, natural processed coffees tend to have more fruity notes, while washed coffees might be cleaner and more acidic.

# Aroma Characteristics

The aroma of coffee is an essential part of the tasting experience. It’s the first thing you notice when you brew a fresh cup. Here are some key aroma characteristics of world-class coffees:

* **Fruity:** The aroma of fruity coffees can remind you of fresh berries, citrus, or even tropical fruits.

* **Spicy:** Spicy aromas might include notes of cinnamon, clove, or even pepper, adding a warm, complex scent.

The aroma gives you a hint of what to expect in terms of flavor. It’s influenced by the coffee’s origin, processing, and roast level. Lightly roasted coffees might have more vibrant, delicate aromas, while darker roasts can have deeper, more intense scents.

Thought maybe Caitlyn’d appreciate a little “thank you” after I used the Z-Drive to reverse that tiny lil’ incident where I blew her mom to smithereens back in season two. You’d think resurrecting someone’s dead mom earns you some points, right?

Wrong.

Caitlyn looked me dead in the eyes and said, “You tampered with time to fix a problem you created.”

I said, “Exactly! Growth!”

Ungrateful.

Tried making her breakfast this morning. Burnt toast, acid coffee, and a note that said “Family means never having to say sorry for war crimes.” She didn’t laugh.

Vi laughed. Caitlyn hit her with the newspaper.

Anyway, I carved “#1 Sister-In-Law” into Caitlyn’s rifle case. And then put glitter on it. She said I defiled a precision weapon. I said she defiled my heart by never hugging me.

I also tried bonding with Vi again today. Like, actual sister bonding. I didn’t even bring explosives. That’s personal growth, right?

I found her in the kitchen, slamming the fridge shut because Caitlyn used the last of the milk. So I slid her a smoothie I definitely didn’t steal from a freshman. Said, “Peace offering?”

She stared at it like it owed her money.

Then I pulled out the old photo—us, Powder and Vi, little kids before the world went kaboom. Told her I missed this. Told her I missed her.

She sighed. Said, “You always do this. Blow up the house, then hand me flowers made of shrapnel.”

I told her, “Yeah, but the flowers are homemade.”

She didn’t laugh. Not even a smirk. Just got up, patted my head like a dog, and muttered, “You’re lucky I still love you, psycho.”

I’ll take it.

Baby steps. Or big sister punches.

Either way—I’m still trying.

1k43c4v,https://i.redd.it/ebttsqhxq3we1.jpeg,Just found out why I get headache taking adderall,"I started taking meds last week and ever since i usually get headaches. A lot of people are saying it’s “normal/common side effect” and just make sure you are hydrated and eating enough. 

I almost made a post earlier asking if anyone experienced headache ONLY when going out because apparently i dont get them when i’m at home. I took one earlier, was just playing games and as soon as I go out and started driving i get tension headache. I would say the pain is 6.5/10 and just take ibuprofen whenever i get it. 

So I just got home and thought of using the BP monitor. I used it before and i don’t think it’s reading properly because i know my normal BP is around 120/80 and this monitor is showing its around ~103/60 and i got checked somewhere few weeks ago and it’s 120/80 thats why i knew its inaccurate. 

To my surprise my BP in this monitor while taking adderall is 141/84. I instantly felt scared not knowing what could’ve happened if i kept taking it and didn’t know i’m having blood pressure. And since this monitor is inaccurate before, I’m thinking what if my BP is actually around ~200/100 and I’m casually working and driving. I also had coffee today so i’m not sure if that contributed to my high blood pressure. 

So please check your blood pressure too or get one! ",4,1745203806.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

1/4 chopped nuts (I used slivered almonds or chopped walnuts)

(I also added 1 tsp to 1 TB shredded coconut)

# Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees  (I used a toaster oven)

Line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment or grease with butter and set aside 

In a medium-sized bowl, mix all your dry ingredients together with a whisk, making sure to break up any clumps 

Melt your butter in the microwave and stir in the vanilla 

Using a spatula, stir the butter and vanilla to the dry mix. Cool it down before adding the eggs 

Add in the eggs and mix very lightly, only to bring all the ingredients together 

Pour into prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes. (I used a toaster oven and baked for 17 min, turning once halfway and then let it rest in the oven for 3-4 min. Then inserted a chopstick in the middle and it came out clean.)

Remove from pan and allow to cool before serving.

I made this recipe two times recently because I wanted to use up some lupin flour that I bought and my partner and I really liked it the first time. It was my first time baking with lupin flour and we weren't able to tell that it wasn't wheat flour! In the second version, I used cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips so it didn't taste as sweet, more like a dark chocolate brownie. Still very tasty!

## What is Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai?

Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market data and execute crypto trades. It promises to simplify the often chaotic world of cryptocurrency by using smart algorithms that make trading decisions faster than a human could.

Instead of manually analyzing charts or reacting emotionally to market swings, this platform claims to do it all in real time. It’s like giving a supercomputer your trading strategy and letting it trade for you while you focus on other things—like coffee or sleep.

## Who Created Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai?

This is where things get a little murky. Like many of these AI trading tools, **Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai doesn’t have a clearly named founder or development team**. That’s pretty standard for platforms in this space, but it can make some people hesitant.

However, it seems to be backed by a group of developers and AI engineers with experience in fintech and algorithmic trading. Some of the tech behind it overlaps with what we’ve seen in platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge. So while the exact creators remain anonymous, the tech stack appears legit.

## How Does Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai Work?

Here’s the simplified version: you deposit funds, set some basic trading preferences (or let the AI choose for you), and the algorithm scans the crypto market 24/7. Once it spots a profitable opportunity, it places a trade automatically.

It uses AI models trained on historical data and real-time market signals, looking for patterns that suggest asset prices will rise or fall. It reportedly executes trades in milliseconds, which gives it a speed edge over manual trading. You can also choose between **manual mode**, where you approve trades, or **auto mode**, where the AI runs the show.

## Bitcoin Pro 360 Ai Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect—here’s what stands out.

**Pros:**
- ✅ AI-driven trading with fast execution
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types, not just crypto
- ✅ Offers a demo account for practice
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ No hidden fees beyond the initial deposit

**Cons:**
- ❌ Unknown creators may concern some users
- ❌ Market volatility can still lead to losses
- ❌ Not available in all countries

My take? Start small, use the demo, and see how it fits your trading style.

What are your pro tips & hacks?

\--

**1. Eat more protein, fewer processed foods**

* Make every meal revolve around  protein (eggs, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, beans)
* Fill the rest of your plate with veggies or whole grains
* Avoid processed foods... aka foods changed from their original state —  adding sugar, fat, salt, or preservatives and other crap
* Eat slowly. Put your fork down between bites, count to 10, do something!
* Chug a glass of water before every meal

**Rule:** If it’s in a package with more than 5 ingredients, skip it.

**2. Move every day (it doesn’t need to be a workout)**

* Walk 7,000+ steps a day — break it down w/ smaller walks
* Take stairs, park farther, walk after meals -- find a reason to walk
* Do short bodyweight workouts 2–3x/week:
   * Squats, pushups (incline or on knees), planks, lunges
   * 15 minutes is plenty

**Rule:** Do something physical daily. 5 minutes is better than 0.

**3. Sleep 7+ hours. Manage stress.**

* Poor sleep increases hunger + cravings
* Stress = emotional eating. Use yoga, walks, or journaling or just count to 10!
* Create a 20-minute wind-down routine (no screens)

**Rule:** If you fix your sleep, your diet gets easier.

**4. Repeat daily. Don’t aim for perfect.**

* Show up even if it’s not your best day
* Build streaks, not streak breaks
* If you miss one day, don’t miss two

**Rule:** 80% consistency beats 100% intensity for 3 days

**5. Use cues & reminders to make it stick**

* Set the same time to walk, eat, sleep
* Stack new habits onto current ones (""after coffee, stretch 1 min"")
* Use a daily check-in to keep momentum



**Summary:** Eat protein. Walk daily. Sleep enough. Repeat. That’s how you lose weight and keep it off. No frills, no magic bullets, no gimmicks. It’s not easy - but these are the  habits & tactics that work.

1k432kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1k432kc/share_plums/,Share Plums,"I've been thinking about making this post for awhile in hopes it will help someone.  I am in no way affiliated with this or any other brands. I just came on and searched for share plums in this thread to see if anyone else has posted about them, and I did see a couple things but decided to still make my own post.

I was completely dependent on full large bag homemade water enemas for over 3.5 years. I have now not had to use an enema since before Christmas. I tried True Lance, Motegrity, Linzess, magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, stool softeners, senna, suppositories (two different formulas), Saline enemas, trifala, bisacodal, miralax,  a couple others things i can't remember the names of, and 9 months of pelvic floor PT.  I also went off my antidepressant for 2.5 years and got back on it in July 2023, but neither helped my constipation. 

Before becoming enema dependent, I was constipated for many years but was able to manage with the Magnesium Citrate and stool softeners and occasional suppository type laxatives or Saline enemas. Literally everything that had worked before stopped working rather abruptly in the beginning of 2021, and only full bag water enemas did the trick.  Actually i was also using coffee enemas for a few months too, in 2021.  All of the prescription meds mentioned above, and Miralax, trifala, bisacodal and others-  were tried after becoming enema dependent.  Bisacodal did make me go- but it only worked well for me if I limited the use to very occasional.  Everything else made my poop likewater but it wouldn't come out...or I should say, only about a tablespoon of it would come out maybe 2-3x a day.

In May 2024 I went on the carnivore diet. After 3 months I started having small poops that were diarrhea but it was more movement and amount than I had had since before the enemas. Still, it just wasn't enough volume coming out and I had to do enemas but less often than before (before this development I was doing one every other day).  In December 2024 I tried share plums after my friend had heard about them and passed the info on to me.  They literally instantly worked for me. On the carnivore diet they would make me poop within 2 hours and I only needed a fourth of a plum and my poop was still coming out as diarrhea. But I was having huge amounts of poop and I was just so dang happy. 

I quit the carnivore diet on January 1st 2025 for reasons not related to pooping. I now need 3/4 of a plum because my motility is so much slower not on a carnivore diet. I take the plum at 4:00 p.m. and I usually poop between 2 and  5 a.m. (work/sleep schedule is lame).  However, it's not always exact as far as when I end up pooping and sometimes I have multiple small ones throughout the day rather than a couple big ones in the morning.  I have pelvic floor dysfunction, rectocele, cystocele, and abdomino phrenic dyssynertia so this all affects my going #2 as well.

I know share plums are expensive but as someone who thought seriously that i might have a colostomy bag one day, they have been nothing short of miraculous. If you buy 3 bags on the shareswiss.us site you get $50-ish off which is what I did at my last purchase once I knew for sure these were working for me on a regular basis.  First I got the 7 count sampler, next time one bag, next time 3 bags.

They also have a drink which I only tried a few sips of when they had sent me free samples, but my 18 year old son who does not have constipation problems drank a whole one, and let's just say he didn't leave the toilet for a while 😂.

Also I have really bad bloating issues, and these did make that worse for a couple weeks but my tummy adjusted, thankfully!  Sorry for long post.  I don't often post on reddit but when I do I always over share 🤷‍♀️. ",2,1745202938.0,Constipation,1,0.75,False

## What is Immediate Eurax Ai?

**Immediate Eurax Ai** is an AI-driven trading platform designed to help users make faster and more informed trading decisions. It leverages automation and real-time data to identify market trends and execute trades on your behalf—or give you alerts so you can decide when to jump in.

Think of it as a **smart assistant for trading**. You don’t need to sit in front of charts all day, and you don't have to be a Wall Street pro to use it. It’s geared toward people who want to get into trading but might not have the time or expertise to dive deep into technical analysis.

The platform supports multiple markets—**cryptocurrency, forex, stocks, and even commodities**—so you’re not limited to one niche. That’s pretty cool, especially if you're looking to diversify.

## Who Created Immediate Eurax Ai?

The creators of Immediate Eurax Ai have kept things relatively under wraps, which is pretty common in this space. There’s no single public figure like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong behind it, but based on the structure and similarities to platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, it likely comes from a team of fintech developers and traders with experience in AI and financial markets.

What’s clear is that the platform partners with **regulated third-party brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy. Even though we don’t have personal bios on the devs, the tech and backend suggest it wasn’t slapped together overnight.

## How Does Immediate Eurax Ai Work?

Immediate Eurax Ai uses **machine learning algorithms** to scan the market in real time. It looks for patterns, price movements, and other indicators that suggest a profitable trade might be on the horizon. Once a trade opportunity is found, the platform can either:

- **Automatically execute the trade** (if you enable auto-trading)
- Or **send you an alert**, so you can decide whether to act

It’s like having a trading assistant who never sleeps and can monitor global markets 24/7.

The platform is web-based—so no downloads needed—and works on both desktop and mobile browsers. You don’t need to install anything or worry about compatibility issues. Just log in and go.

- **South Africa**
- Parts of **Asia**
- **Canada**

However, it’s **not available in the U.S.**, which is a bummer for American traders. This is usually due to strict financial regulations rather than any shady practices.

## Immediate Eurax Ai – Top Features

There are some scammy platforms out there, but Immediate Eurax Ai doesn’t raise the usual red flags. It works with **regulated brokers**, offers **demo accounts**, and doesn’t hit you with unexpected fees.

Of course, **no trading platform can guarantee profits**. The AI helps, but markets are unpredictable. Still, based on my experience and the transparency of the system, I wouldn’t label this one as a scam.

To activate your trading account, you’ll need to deposit **$250 USD**. This is pretty standard across AI trading platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

The money doesn’t go to the platform itself—it gets deposited into your broker account, where it’s used for actual trading. You can withdraw it anytime (assuming it’s not tied up in trades).

### Immediate Eurax Ai Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them via:

- **Live chat**
- **Email**

I tested the chat myself, and responses came within a few minutes—pretty solid. They were friendly and didn’t just copy/paste answers. No phone support, though, which might be a letdown for some.

1k431zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1k431zc/it_weird_to_have_a_crush_on_someone_i_met_on_a/,it weird to have a crush on someone I met on a Twisted Wonderland Discord server?,"Hey everyone, I’m 19 and I’ve been kinda overthinking this, so I figured I’d ask here to see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

So I’ve been part of this Twisted Wonderland server on Discord for a few months now. It started out as just a fun place to talk about the game, share fanart, do dumb memes and whatnot. But there’s this one person I met there who I’ve grown really attached to. At first, we were just replying to each other’s messages in the main chats, but then we started talking more in DMs, and now we talk pretty much every day.

They’re super funny, smart, and honestly just really kind in a way that feels rare? Like, they actually listen when I vent, hype me up when I talk about stuff I’m working on, and they remember little details I’ve mentioned before—even random stuff like my favorite dorm or how I take my coffee. We’ve voice chatted a few times too, and they have this voice that just… makes me feel calm and safe, if that makes sense?

The thing is, I’ve never had a crush on someone I haven’t met IRL before. I’m used to liking people I see regularly in real life, but this feels different. Like yeah, we met through a fandom server, but the connection feels genuine. And I’m just stuck wondering—is it weird to have feelings for someone I’ve only known online? Is it even real if it’s all through screens and messages?

Part of me wants to tell them how I feel, but I’m scared it’ll make things weird or ruin the friendship we have. Especially since we’re in the same server and interact publicly sometimes too. I’m also not even sure if they feel the same, or if I’m just romanticizing everything because they’re the first person in a while who’s made me feel seen and appreciated.

Has anyone else caught feelings for someone they met online like this? Is it something I should just ignore or see where it goes? I’d love to hear how others have handled this, or if I’m just being way too in my head about it.

Thanks in advance if you read all this, I really appreciate it.

Anywho, now that I’m back in the dating game I’m trying to be open minded. I’ve went on 3 dates off hinge so far. 

Probably spoke to each guy for about a week prior to the date. First one it seemed he liked me but I was not interested at all. Nice guy, but a lotta red flags. 2nd guy, we went to a coffee shop. It was like we were both on a date with him. He was so egotistical & spoke sooo loudly, it was almost embarrassing. I did have an ok time though, it wasn’t horrible. I wasn’t interested in him because he spoke too cocky. Though with trying to be more open minded I was down to give him another shot if he really wanted. Texted me that he didn’t feel a spark, so there’s that lol! Weird how it still hurts your feelings a tad even when you weren’t into them much. 

3rd date, best personality so far but I didn’t feel any physical attraction whatsoever. We went & got drinks & had good conversation for a few hours. I had a decent time but felt 0 physical attraction. Not sure if it was mutual, he told me I was a cutie after the date but we were both pretty dry with eachother so I just removed him.

Please forgive my formatting as this is being written on my cell and I'm a bit nervous as I am a reddit posting virgin🤣
I am now 50 (f) and and on divorce #2 because, frankly, I am a people pleaser and choose broken men. But no more! 

For some much needed context, my first husband ended up being diagnosed with covert narciscisstic personality disorder (with a strong hatred of woman) 2 months before blessedly walking out after 13 years.. I could never figure out what was wrong with my family and felt the odd person out (along with my Dad). An amazing therapist post divorce helped me realize that my family is full of narciscisstic and toxic people. I have been no contact now for over a decade solid. Now onto the story:

This story pertains to my first wedding. We had a vision of a very small, immediate family only wedding because we wanted to have it in a quaint little mountain town just west of Calgary, AB (😉😉 You'll know, Charlotte). It's expensive to get married there but that was our wish. We also opted not to have bridesmaids and groomsmen as to not have drama and hurt feelings. We did everything in our power to make sure it was a relaxed and enjoyable experience. Neither of us cared about details like centre pieces and such and so left that to our mothers. We found out very quickly that they were two peas in a pod and had a passive aggressive hatred for one another.

My dress was a whole other issue and I didn't not get what I wanted. I got my mother's vision.

We planned to be married on the riverbank. My mother just could not get her head wrapped around that. In the end, we had a good old May snowstorm and had to be married at the quaint little inn we were staying at. We were happy with that. Others were not.

I had a close friend whom I had been a bridesmaid for that really didn't understand why she couldn't be there. I caught wind from some work colleagues that she and another friend intended to crash the wedding. I found this out at our dinner on the wedding eve and had to have a convo with her that that was not to happen in no uncertain terms. She was hurt and just couldn't understand. 

Our officiant liked to have coffee with the couple the morning of the ceremony to focus them and I loved that piece. However, we weren't gone an hour before our phones were ringing because the mothers and my aunt were arguing over how to decorate tables🤦‍♀️ and where the hell were we!? I should mention it was 10am and the wedding was at 4pm.
The issue, you ask??? If the ""congratulations "" confetti on the tables was placed upwards the right way..wtf?? I said I was busy and didn't care to which I was told ""I should"" by my mother.

Somehow the ceremony happened without a hitch (despite my mother's little unplanned speech that drew the attention to her as the MOB). My mother was mad because pictures took longer than expected (snowstorm), but we finally got to to dinner (which was fabulous!) and dancing. In my head, the minor squabbles and inconveniences were behind us. I could NOT have been more wrong!

I won't bore you with more anecdotes because this is getting long:, I'll just lay out what happened next:
1) My ex FIL (who actually is a lovely man) got more drunk than I'd even seen him before or since and ended up being babysat in the bathroom all night by my youngest trouble-making brother (so 2 birds and all that). 
2) My ex husband's oldest brother drunkenly confided in him that while his wife had been 6 months pregnant with their oldest (now 5/6), he had cheated on her with an old highschool GF but no one else knew. He just felt the need to unburden himself to someone (his words) that night and chose my then-husband.
3) My mother attempted to control every aspect of the evening while the MIL shot daggers.

We left early and hoped that by our brunch/gift opening in the morning, that people would have reeled themselves in.....

We were leaving for the brunch the next morning and saw my middle brother and his GF waiting to talk to my parents. Now, I knew she was pregnant (I was told 2 weeks before) and I said I would keep that to myself until they were ready to tell the parents, AFTER my wedding. My narciscisstic mother is old school and shuns living together and pregnancy before marriage. I asked if that was what they were talking to them about and they lied and said ""no"".
My parents,  brother and GF showed up late to brunch and my mother's scrunched up face said it all (we call that face ""lemon lips""). They had used our wedding as a shield so she couldn't make a scene without looking bad. That didn't stop my brother and his GF from telling everyone that they were expecting and getting married in August (3 months later) before she'd really start showing.
We couldn't leave fast enough and packed up quickly and headed off for our honeymoon. During which my brother had the audacity to call an ask my (then)  husband to be in his bridal party!

Once home, there was no mention of our wedding. Only talk and trash talk from my mother about the upcoming nuptials and birth. 

Even though my marriage wasn't meant to work out (because who can stay with a narcissist), I/we were cheated out of our wedding being a celebration of us.
Am I being petty about this??

Add on: When I write my book on the impact that narcissist individuals have had on my life, I'll have a long form with far more context to send you someday🤣 I think it will be horror genre.

I appreciate you and your channel so much! Thank you for all the years of content and entertainment. And a HUGE congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Take no shit girl😉",3,1745201782.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
