I eat dinner at Saturday and then only eat lunch on Monday morning. Throughout this fasting I only drink water. Initially I used to drink coconut water if it got too difficult for my body, I also used to have coffee w/o sugar while at work. These days, I just drink water and nothing else. I wanna do 48 hour fasting soon and then move onto 3 days fast, I have some questions regarding this, please answer if from yer own experience and scientific answers too if you can. 

1. I read somewhere 36 hour fasting w/o water is even more better? What's the difference this w water or w/o water has on body during this fast? 

2. What do you guys recommend I drink or have to break the fast? 

3. For 48 hour fast, how should I proceed? What should I take care of? What can I have so as not to break fast but also keep my body in function? Is water okay or not?

4. Can I move to 3 days fast if I can do 48 hour fast or how should I be concerned about it because 3 days water fast sounds kinda scary haha and again, what can I have or drink not to break fast but keep my body active? Is water okay during 3 days fast? 

5. Can I workout during fasting? 

6. What can I do to maximize the benefits of fasting during the period? Do this or that maybe? 

Thank you everyone! ",1,1759666767.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1nymper,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wonsulting/comments/1nymper/why_hiring_sucks_right_now_and_how_to_actually/,Why hiring sucks right now (and how to actually win at it),"Let’s be real: hiring sucks right now… seriously.

You apply to 100+ jobs, get ghosted, then see “we went with another candidate” even though you were qualified. 

And additionally..
- Companies post jobs they aren’t even hiring for yet.
- Hiring managers can’t interview until headcount is unlocked ￼.
- Recruiters get flooded with hundreds of applications, so your resume gets skimmed for 6 seconds max ￼.
- Most applicants only use the worst tier: applying online. That’s Tier 4: the lowest success rate ￼

So how do you flip the odds?

1. Stop relying on “Apply”: Move up the tiers: connect with team members (Tier 2) or hiring managers (Tier 1) on LinkedIn. A hiring manager referral almost guarantees an interview..

2) Reach out for coffee chats: mesage people who share your background, school, or role. Keep it human, not spammy. Example: “I’d love to learn how you got into [company].” ￼

3) Leverage your interviews: Once you land one, tell other recruiters. It makes you look in-demand and can unlock faster interview cycles ..

Apply smarter > harder FTW

1nymp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPhilosophy/comments/1nymp9z/integrity_in_the_fire_how_i_refused_to_lose_myself/,Integrity in the Fire: How I Refused to Lose Myself,"People talk about resilience like it’s a buzzword. But resilience isn’t just a feel-good slogan — it’s the choices you make when you’re standing in the fire, when everything in your life is stacked against you, when every easy exit tempts you to abandon yourself.

I know this because I’ve lived it.

Not long ago, my life became a nightmare. Without my knowledge, my coffee was being dosed daily with methamphetamine. By the time I realized what had been happening, I was hooked. Most people can’t imagine what it feels like to wake up and realize your body is dependent on a substance you didn’t consciously choose. You don’t just “quit” something like that overnight — especially when it’s been administered secretly for weeks on end.

And yet, even in the haze of that experience, something inside me stayed awake. Call it the soul, call it spirit, call it God sitting at the kitchen table — it doesn’t matter what name you give it. There was a presence, a quiet, steady knowing that never left me. That presence reminded me of who I really am.

That’s how, instead of letting meth destroy me, I turned it into a strange kind of schooling. While others around me were slipping further into chaos, I was online at three in the morning, taking free Harvard courses, digging through declassified CIA and FBI documents about mind manipulation, teaching myself how the brain works, how the dark web works, how systems of control work. I wasn’t escaping — I was preparing. I was retraining my own mind from the inside out, even while my nervous system was hijacked.

It wasn’t clean. It wasn’t pretty. And yes, there were close calls.

One of those close calls happened the night I got pulled over. In my car: twelve grams of methamphetamine — just shy of an ounce. By every legal standard, that’s a lot of dope. Enough for a serious charge. Enough to be labeled a trafficker. Enough to bury my life for years.

I wasn’t trafficking. I wasn’t selling. It was my monthly supply. But the person riding with me had a pipe under their seat, and when the police divided up the evidence, suddenly half the dope was “his” and half was “mine,” and we were both facing charges.

Here’s where integrity costs something.

I could have taken the easy out. I could have let that person carry the weight. I could have said nothing and let the system do what it does. Instead, when we went to court, I told the judge the truth. All of it.

I told him the drugs were mine.
I told him the other person was just a passenger.
I told him how I ended up there.
I told him about being drugged.
I told him about the strange parasite in my eye.
I told him about the manipulation, the betrayal, the breakdown.

I didn’t water it down to make it sound normal. I didn’t hide the “weird” parts to make myself more palatable. I told the truth as I knew it, raw and unfiltered, because that’s what integrity is: owning what is yours, refusing what isn’t, and standing in your story even if it makes people uncomfortable.

Something happened in that courtroom. You could feel it. The atmosphere shifted. The judge sobered. The court clerk cried. And instead of a felony trafficking charge, I walked away with a simple possession charge and a $600 fine.

I don’t believe that was an accident. I believe that was the divine standing with me.

I’ve never cared how crazy people think I sound when I say this: God sits with us. God sits with me. Every time something like this happens, that presence is there. And once you’ve experienced that, you don’t need another human being’s permission or confirmation to know what’s true.

That’s why, even in the middle of chaos, I kept my moral compass. That’s why I never shifted blame, even when it would have been convenient. That’s why I kept studying, kept learning, kept rebuilding my mind. Because my integrity was the one thing I refused to lose.

As I write this now, a skunk crosses the road in front of me — black and white, a living symbol of contrast, boundaries, and respect. Skunks don’t ask for validation. They don’t need permission to exist. They just walk their path, unapologetic, carrying their power quietly until they’re forced to release it. Seeing it feels like confirmation of the very lesson I’m sharing:

You can be in the messiest situation of your life. You can be manipulated, drugged, criminalized, misunderstood. But as long as you don’t abandon your truth, as long as you keep your integrity, as long as you walk your path with respect and clarity, you are free — even before the system says you are.

That’s what’s spectacular.
That’s what’s phenomenal.
That’s what’s magnificent about being alive.

It isn’t just surviving the fire.
It’s refusing to lose yourself inside it.

⸻

Philosopher’s Note

Life will always challenge you. It will throw impossible choices, chaotic circumstances, and manipulations in your path. But your inner life — your integrity, your awareness, your commitment to truth — cannot be taken.

Freedom is not simply the absence of external control. Freedom is the mastery of your own energy, the courage to honor your moral compass, and the audacity to continue learning, growing, and loving, even when the world seems determined to pull you down.

When you embrace this, when you walk your path consciously and without compromise, every obstacle becomes a teacher, every threat becomes an opportunity, and every moment — no matter how dark — becomes a mirror of your divine potential.

In short: the fire is real, but you are more real.

Am I misreading his signals?,"Three weeks ago I (25M) hit up Dan (25M, pseudonym), who I saw on and off in Feb-May 2024, after around a year and a half of pretty minimal contact. He has a boyfriend now but I am getting weird vibes from him hinting he is still attracted to me. Can’t tell if it’s in my head or real.

Context: We saw each other about a dozen times during our situationship, but we spent quite a bit of time together working out, reading the news in bed/at cafes, chilling at cafes and doing work, etc and he went up to Baltimore once to see me.

I asked if he wanted to cuddle, but he said he couldn’t bc he had a bf and they were “still figuring it out.” He insisted on drinks/coffee, which we did about three weeks ago on a Thursday. He threw out plans to hang that weekend — going to a climbing gym near me (he had 2 guest passes), estate sale (I mentioned I was looking for home decor), working out.

We spent the entire day together (10:30-5pm) that Saturday at the estate sale/gym/cafe/bookstore. It reminded me of our situationship, just without the sex. I was weirded out he got naked in front of me at the gym when he had a bf, but maybe he’s just comfortable in the locker room. I made an effort to cover up before going to the stream room. When we left for the day he suggested we grab drinks the following week to chat more about my new job.

We ended up grabbing drinks Thursday. Pretty normal, making small talk about work/weekend plans. I suggest we work out together again; he agrees and says he has stuff to do in the afternoon. But we ended up spending the day together again, chilling at a cafe to do work. 

After we workout, we hit the sauna and then I do a cold shower. I’m heaving because of the cold and he makes a quip about it. I couldn’t hear so I turn off the shower and turn around. Apparently the shower curtain was pulled back slightly, and he’s looking at me and he makes his jab.

Another awkward moment: Before we hop to another cafe we use the restroom. I get out first and wait for him outside, head buried in my phone. He comes out, slaps my ass, and I’m surprised. He laughs it off.

By now, we’ve seen each other five times in just over two weeks. He seems to constantly have plans. So I’m curious why he’s spending entire days with me. He also brings up his boyfriend in some of our conversations. 

But I am seeing blurred lines here. Most people I’ve talked to say there’s something more than “just friends” going on, though some gay guys mentioned it’s common to be friends with former flings.

I’ve been telling myself we’re just friends. Maybe he’s just super comfortable around me. He already turned down cuddling and said he had a bf, so he drew a line.

I enjoy his company and could use friends in this city and he’s familiar territory. I don’t want to ruin that. But if there’s something more going on I want to know.

Am I gaslighting myself into seeing normalcy?

TLDR: reconnected with old situationship who has a bf now. Figured we’d just be friends, but him slapping my butt and chatting with me in the showers has made me think he wants something more. But I’m bad at reading people and am rationalizing this as just friendship behavior. Am I wrong? ",1,1759666692.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Today is the 65th anniversary of Sensei arriving in San Francisco in 1960 to launch the Kosen-rufu movement in the continental US. It’s called “SGI-USA Day.”

*I am very happy that WBers informed us yesterday that Gajokai/Byakuren shifts are “a gross exploitation and a huge waste of time.” Not only exploitation but “a gross exploitation.” Not just the experience of the OP, but a categorical “huge waste of time” for ANYONE (my italics) doing them.*

*Despite the warning, we sent a carload of youth division from our group early this morning to Big City to do Gajokai/Byakuren shifts for KRG this morning. It’s even a huger waste of time for them because of the long, long drive to and from. But they were in very high spirits when they came here for a quick stop to pick up Chima. We had packed for them a couple of thermos bottles of coffee and breakfast sandwiches. And off they went to pick up N-do.*

*Chima, Veera, Emily, José, and N-do. Warding off “gross manipulation,” but till wanting to contribute to the safety and happiness of local members. We chipped in some money for gas and Buffalo wings.*

*Eulogio spoke to us for a long time last night. He is very grateful for the leaders of one of the “regions” in “New York Zone” for letting him attend their “Executive Conference” in which they learned about the initiatives for 2026.*

*There were about 40 leaders attending this region’s conference. “They all seemed very assured and happy to be there. They probably have worked together for many years. This is one of the qualities we for when teams present their ‘shark tank’ proposals to our company.”*

*A lot of the discussion was based on strengthening the districts and discussion meetings, youth developmennd building the study of the Gosho into the practice of all members.*

*We implored Eulogio to post with more information and he promised. But he has so many other things to prepare for his Managers Meeting so we will see.*

[The Miraculous Words ‘Thank You’](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-miraculous-words-thank-you-2/) is a spiffy article in the September 15th WT, a reprint of an essay Daisaku Ikeda wrote in 2004. The editors summarize it: “Being able to have deep appreciation for everyone around us is proof of our human revolution. Appreciation for others accelerates our inner transformation.”

Yesterday we had a 3-hour training session with the ACS caseworkers on caring for children who have been separated from their families for a variety of reasons. The mood was pretty heavy. During a break I was able to read the article and I tried to apply it throughout the day.

Daisaku Ikeda starts:

>Thank you” is a miraculous expression. It energizes us when we say it to others and encourages us when we hear it said to us. I am constantly saying “Thank you” from morning to night, every day. When I travel abroad, it is the one expression from the language of the country I am visiting that I always learn and use. Whether it is “Thank you,” “Merci,” “Danke,” “Gracias,” “Spasiba” or “Xie xie,” I put my whole heart into expressing my appreciation, looking the other person in the eye as I do so.

Hmmm. During the break, I thanked the caseworkers for the first session. They looked perplexed, like they weren’t expecting that reaction. It opened up a difficult topic and explains why they were tightly wound. 

A child, about 1 year old, was brought to the hospital because he couldn’t stand on one foot when he raised himself in his crib. It turns out there was a fraction in the foot and also a bruise. Doctors are mandated to report such events to ACS. The investigation centered on why the parents had waited three days to come to the ER; they responded that they had an appointment with their pediatrician for the following day, but decided to come to the hospital because the child was feeling discomfort. They immediately inspected the parents’ home and found a dog and feces on the floor. The parents said that they never expected to be at the ER so long and they missed walking the dog, accidents happen.

The workers told us that they decided to remove parenting rights on the spot and, after the doctor casted the baby’s foot, released him to the grandmother with the parents allowed only supervised visits.

“The parents were absolutely devastated. They stated they were targeted because they were Indigenous and this prejudiced us. ‘If this were a white family, especially middle class or above, none of this would have happened. Would we have had to wait three days to get an appointment with a doctor at the clinic? Would a family doctor report us to ACS?’” 

“We take our work very seriously and we have to make difficult choices. We have all trained for racism, classism, sexism, hidden bias. We knew there was some truth in the parents’ allegations but we still stood by our decision. All of this happened yesterday and none of us could really sleep. Hopefully the matter will be quickly resolved and if our superiors overrule us, we will gladly apologize to the parents. It weights heavily on us. But when you thanked us, for a simple training session, we felt appreciated and relieved.”

Hmmm. Who knew? 

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>When we speak or hear the words “thank you,” the armor falls from our hearts and we communicate on a deep level. “Thank you” is the essence of nonviolence. It contains respect for the other person, humility and a profound affirmation of life. It possesses a positive, upbeat optimism. It has strength. A person who can sincerely say thank you has a healthy, vital spirit; each time we say those words, our hearts sparkle and life force wells up within us.

After training, Lolita came by with Lori. Lolita told me she was so upset with herself because she had completely forgotten that she had promised the Maracles that she would watch Lori while they worked. Lolita is about the most sincere and hard-working person ever. I wanted to relieve her from the guilt. “We all make mistakes. NBD! Thank you for building such a wonderful relationship with Lori and her parents.” Again, Lolita’s entire aspect changed: face, posture, eyes.

Next thought:

>Having gratitude and appreciation for the countless people and things that support our lives—that awareness, that feeling, that joy—will invite even greater happiness. 

Yesterday Max and his crew finished the first level of the pool enclosure. It was very precise work because even a slight miscalculation at the first level would mean that the glass panels wouldn’t fit or cold air could leak through them. One full day for the first level but the rest of the entire structure will go up in a day or two. The intake/outtake pipes are installed as well. So many people to say thank you to. Max, his crew, the pool construction company, the designers of the Enclosure Company that provided such precise designs and products, the whole heat exchange HVAC industry that researched and developed heating/cooling pump technology. Thank you, thank you!

>Rather than being thankful because we are happy, being thankful itself will make us happy. Also, chanting with gratitude puts us in rhythm with the universe, turning our lives in a positive direction.

This is a big one for me. I remembered that True once told me about Mrs. Ikeda’s interview with a journalist. She was asked why she smiles so frequently. She responded that, for her, smiling is not an effect, but it’s a cause. I brought this realization to my NA meeting in the afternoon. How much gratitude I felt for my NA sponsor and the other people who come to our group! Every day is a struggle for all of us, and there are many ups and downs. But we need each other to get through another day or two. Thank you!

>When we cannot say thank you, our personal growth has stopped. When we are growing, we can see how wonderful others are too. When we stop growing, all we see are other people’s faults.

Someone posted on the sgiwhistleblowers site that irresponsible posts and comments could lead to some of the hateful shootings as we see on the news such as recent attacks on Mormons and a Manchester attack on a synagogue on Yom Kippur. The OP made an excellent point but it’s also for me. I’ve occasionally crossed lines in my criticisms of what I have read there. I can criticize ideas, but never people. I don’t have a right to be judge or executioner. I will try to be very careful from this point on.

More from Dr. Ikeda:

>At home, instead of trying to change your partner or your children to your liking, why not start with a simple “thank you”?

Exactly! Now Dr. Ikeda shares a story that I hope I can remember forever:

>There is a women’s division member who suffered from dementia in her later years, and she was unable to remember even the names of her family members. But when the doctor asked her what was the happiest moment in her life, she immediately responded: “When my daughter was born. I was so happy!” Hearing this, tears welled up in the eyes of her daughter, who was standing nearby. “Thank you,” she said. “Thank you, mother. That was all I needed to hear.”

>The daughter reflected on how she was always scolding her own son. “Yes,” she thought, “how happy I was when he was born!” Yet, over the years, driven by some mental image of an ideal child, she had tried to mold her son to fit that form, thinking only of where he didn’t measure up to the ideal and dwelling on his shortcomings in one respect or another. Still, in spite of how demanding she was, her son tried his best to live up to her expectations. He was kind to her. As these thoughts came to her, she was overcome with gratitude toward him. “Thank you. I’m just happy you are alive and well. I’m just happy you’re here beside me. Thank you.”

>She saw her son with fresh eyes, and suddenly she had so many reasons to be grateful and happy. After all, though it was hard getting her son out of bed in the mornings, he would eventually get up, even if it was sometimes at the last minute. That, in itself, was an amazing thing. He may have been a little picky about his food, and he may not have been at the top of his class, but she was just grateful he went to school and wore a bright smile each day.

>She was grateful for everything, even when nothing special happened. She was grateful for each day that passed with her family safe and well. She realized that taking so much for granted had been a symptom of a deep and pervading arrogance on her part.

It happens to be that all five of our kids are spirited. But look at their DNA: lots of local Indigenous from Dee and Eulogio, proud New Englander from Grandma Elizabeth and Afro-Mexican (!) from Uncle Miguel, Mani Greek and unbridled African American and Apache from Guy’s parents, and I’ll throw in epigenetic influence from Grandma Whoopi. With all that running in their cells, why shouldn’t the five be fire? I have to be thankful—even when I’m running around putting out their fires!

The final point for today:

>I hope that, every once in a while, you will look your partner in the eye and say thank you. Instead of eating dinner together in silence, take the time to express your appreciation. It may seem a bit embarrassing at first, but try it: you’ll see how it changes your life.

Embarrassing? Maybe even weird! I kept on thanking everyone today, especially my partners. They look at me very suspiciously. I think that will end once they read this post!

After we workout, we hit the sauna and then I do a cold shower. I’m heaving because of the cold and he makes a quip about it. I couldn’t hear so I turn off the shower and turn around. Apparently the shower curtain was pulled back slightly, and he’s looking at me and he makes his jab.

Another awkward moment: Before we hop to another cafe we use the restroom. I get out first and wait for him outside, head buried in my phone. He comes out, slaps my ass, and I’m surprised. He laughs it off.

By now, we’ve seen each other five times in just over two weeks. He seems to constantly have plans. So I’m curious why he’s spending entire days with me. He also brings up his boyfriend in some of our conversations. 

But I am seeing blurred lines here. Most people I’ve talked to say there’s something more than “just friends” going on, though some gay guys mentioned it’s common to be friends with former flings.

I’ve been telling myself we’re just friends. Maybe he’s just super comfortable around me. He already turned down cuddling and said he had a bf, so he drew a line.

I enjoy his company and could use friends in this city and he’s familiar territory. I don’t want to ruin that. But if there’s something more going on I want to know.

Am I gaslighting myself into seeing normalcy?

TLDR: reconnected with old situationship who has a bf now. Figured we’d just be friends, but him slapping my butt and chatting with me in the showers has made me think he wants something more. But I’m bad at reading people and am rationalizing this as just friendship behavior. Am I wrong? ",1,1759666441.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1nymj1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceEurope/comments/1nymj1f/i_accidentally_got_stuck_with_a_dazn_germany/,I accidentally got stuck with a DAZN Germany annual subscription just to watch UFC Pereira vs Ankalaev 2 — here’s how I finally got a refund after hours of insisting on my consumer rights,"This happened earlier today while trying to watch UFC Pereira vs Ankalaev 2 on DAZN Germany.  
I just wanted to catch that one fight, so I quickly signed up — thinking it was a monthly plan.

Turns out, it was actually a 12-month annual plan at €9.99/month.  
And to make things worse, the system charged me twice.

When I contacted DAZN support to cancel and get a refund under the EU/German right of withdrawal (Widerrufsrecht, §355 BGB), I got the usual automated message:

“The statutory right of withdrawal doesn’t apply to digital content made available immediately. You agreed to waive your withdrawal right by ticking a box.”

They even cited section 7.3 of their Terms & Conditions.

But here’s the thing: under §356(5) BGB, that waiver only applies if:

1. You explicitly consent to immediate access,
2. You’re clearly told you’ll lose your right to withdraw, and
3. They can actually prove you did so.

So I politely insisted on that point — repeatedly.  
I opened the live chat in the morning and stayed on it for several hours.  
At first, it was obviously an automated bot giving generic replies, but after a lot of persistence (and quoting those legal references), a real person finally took over.

I also tried emailing support at the same time, but honestly, that route was super slow and not useful — just canned replies for hours.  
Chat was the only way to actually solve it.

After hours of back-and-forth, I finally got confirmation:  
\- Annual subscription cancelled  
\- Full refund issued, including the duplicate charge

They never provided any proof that I had agreed to waive my withdrawal rights — which probably means I hadn’t.

**Why I’m sharing this:**  
Because the DAZN Germany sign-up process is confusing — it’s really easy to think you’re subscribing for a single month when it’s actually for a whole year.

If you ever find yourself in the same situation, don’t give up after the first canned response.  
As long as you’re within 14 days and they can’t prove you explicitly waived your withdrawal right, you’re legally entitled to cancel and get a refund.  
You just need patience (and maybe some coffee ).

**TL;DR:**

* Tried to watch *Pereira vs Ankalaev 2*
* Accidentally subscribed to DAZN DE annual plan + got double-charged
* They denied my withdrawal at first
* I quoted §355 + §356 BGB, stayed in chat for hours, and got a full refund
* Posting this so others know they can insist politely and not give up

*(Not legal advice — just sharing my personal experience to help others avoid the same trap.)*",1,1759666215.0,LegalAdviceEurope,2,1.0,False
1nymigx,https://youtu.be/0wOqQRRV6eE?si=dhXuRyTqmIZkpRHt,Top 5 Hacks to Rewire Your Brain for Smarter (Not Harder) Studying,"Hey everyone, I've been grinding through exams and projects lately, and I've realized that hours spent hunched over notes doesn't equal actual learning. It's all about quality over quantity. I put together this quick guide based on what actually works for me – think of it as hacking your own brain to turn you into an ""academic weapon."" (Yeah, I know, cheesy, but it works.)
These tips are simple but game-changing. Try one at a time and build from there. What's your go-to study hack? Drop it in the comments!
1. Rewire Your Mindset: Stop Chasing Time, Chase Results
Key Realization: Time spent studying ≠ knowledge gained. Cramming for 8 hours straight? You'll forget 80% by tomorrow. Focus on effective sessions instead.
Brain Trick: Hype yourself up. Tell yourself (out loud if you have to), ""I'm an academic weapon – precision-guided, unstoppable."" Sounds dumb? It manipulates your subconscious into confidence mode. Fake it till you make it.
Parkinson's Law Hack: Work expands to fill the time you give it. Set brutal deadlines – e.g., ""Master this chapter in 45 minutes"" – and watch your productivity explode. No fluff, just laser focus.
2. Active Recall: Test Yourself Like It's the Real Deal
Ditch passive re-reading (it's a trap). Instead, close the book and quiz yourself: ""What are the three causes of X?"" or ""Explain Y in your own words.""
Pro Tip: Use apps like Anki or Quizlet for spaced repetition. It's like weightlifting for your brain – the struggle builds real strength. Studies show this boosts retention by 2x compared to highlighting.
3. Make Studying FUN: Gamify It with Flashcards
Who said learning has to suck? Turn notes into flashcards and treat it like a game – streak rewards (e.g., 50 cards = your favorite snack), or compete with a study buddy.
Bonus: Add memes or doodles to cards for that dopamine hit. What starts as ""ugh, bio terms"" becomes ""level up time."" Trust me, it'll hook you.
4. Eliminate Distractions: Go Full Fortress Mode
Your phone is the enemy. Airplane mode it, or use apps like Forest (grows virtual trees while you focus – kill the tree if you bail, oof).
Set up a ""study cave"": Dim lights, noise-cancelling headphones with lo-fi beats, no tabs open except what's essential. One notification = 20 minutes lost. Guard your attention like it's gold.
5. Tap Your Genius Time: Schedule Deep Work When You're a Beast
Everyone's got a peak hour – mine's 7-9 AM (coffee-fueled wizardry). Yours might be late-night vibes or post-lunch flow.
Block it out: No meetings, no scrolling. Use it for the hardest stuff (e.g., problem sets or essay outlining). Everything else? Save for ""meh"" times. This one's a multiplier – one genius hour > three zombie hours.
There you have it – my blueprint for studying smarter in 2025. I've gone from all-nighters to acing stuff on the first try. What's holding you back right now? Let's troubleshoot in the replies!
TL;DR: Mindset shift + active recall + fun flashcards + zero distractions + peak-hour deep work = academic domination.🎉",1,1759666167.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

Stars Hollow remained timeless. It still looked the same from a distance — the square glowing with fairy lights, the smell of coffee drifting from the diner, the soft thrum of life that never hurried for anyone.

But the people inside it had finally changed.
They’d all learned that growing up doesn’t always mean leaving; sometimes it means learning how to stay.

• • • 

The Gilmore Women

Lorelai no longer needed chaos to feel alive. The Dragonfly Inn expanded quietly, not into a franchise but into a retreat for writers and wanderers — the kind of people who arrived looking for peace and accidentally found it. She and Luke ran it together, their rhythm unshaken: her talking, him muttering, both perfectly at ease. She never learned to cook, but she finally learned to rest.
When she laughed now, it came without irony — fuller, softer, earned.

Emily lived by the sea in Nantucket, surrounded by salt air and order. The grand house in Hartford stood untouched, a museum to another lifetime. She chaired no committees, hosted no fundraisers; instead, she built scholarships for young women with drive but no safety net — her way of rewriting what privilege meant. Every evening she poured two martinis, set one beside Richard’s photo, and read a few pages from the book that her granddaughter had written, the one that had turned truth into legacy.

Rory had come full circle. She raised her son in Stars Hollow — the same town that raised her, but on her terms this time. She taught him what curiosity looked like without pressure. He grew up kind, grounded, fluent in both sides of his heritage: the Gilmore logic and the Huntzberger polish. He was the first Gilmore to live without chasing approval, and that was the family’s quiet revolution.
Rory married Jess years later, not as a grand gesture, but as a calm decision between equals. They worked side by side — she writing, he publishing, both editing each other in life and on paper. Their home was filled with books, noise, and stillness — the balance neither of them had ever known before.

• • • 

The Men Who Stayed

Luke remained the spine of Stars Hollow. He still ran the diner, still complained, still loved without fuss. His gift was constancy. When Rory asked him to walk her down the aisle, he grunted, fixed her hair, and muttered, “You’re good.” That was his version of poetry.

Jess became what he was always meant to be — calm, creative, and quietly wise. His small press flourished, publishing the kind of books that outlived trends. When people asked how he’d changed, he’d shrug and say, “I didn’t. I just stopped running.”

Christopher grew into peace at last. He taught creative writing, visited Stars Hollow without awkwardness, and accepted the truth that love can outlive romance. When he read Rory’s book, he cried once, smiled once, and said, “She finally told the truth.”

Logan rebuilt himself from the inside out. After the collapse of his family’s empire, he moved back to the States, close to Rory and their son. The boy softened him, and the years steadied him. He remarried later — quietly, happily — no headlines, no pretense. He remained a good father, and an honest friend.

Rory’s son, Richard Logan Gilmore-Huntzberger, broke the family pattern entirely. He went to Yale but studied what he loved, not what was expected. He learned that ambition and gentleness aren’t opposites. He married young, happily, and built a life without drama — the first Gilmore to know that peace could be inherited too.

• • • 

The Friends Who Became Family

Lane and Zack still lived in town, their house full of music, laughter, and mismatched guitars. The twins played every instrument in reach, and the old Hep Alien crew still jammed at festivals. Lane opened a small music school, teaching kids who didn’t fit anywhere else that art wasn’t rebellion — it was survival.

Paris ran her fertility empire, terrifying interns with excellence and honesty. She read Rory’s book in one sitting, underlining entire paragraphs and muttering, “Good. But she still needs an editor.” Doyle read it too and called it “real journalism.” They never remarried, but they remained proud of what they’d built together.

Lucy reached out after years apart. Their friendship resumed easily — older, wiser, without apology. Sometimes, they’d meet in Hartford halfway between their lives, order coffee, and laugh like Yale never ended.

Michel pretended indifference, of course. He called Rory’s writing “adequate” and then bought six copies “for guests with taste.” When no one was looking, he reread the passage describing him as “the elegance that kept the madness in check” and smiled, just once.

Sookie returned to the Dragonfly every summer, spoons clattering, joy contagious. Her kids called Luke “Uncle Flannel.” She and Lorelai still argued about sugar ratios and life, always ending with laughter and pie.

Dean lived simply and well, running a small renovation business in town. He’d nod to Rory when their paths crossed — no bitterness, only understanding. “We were kids,” he once said, “but it meant something.” And she agreed.

Marty ended up behind the camera, producing quietly successful documentaries. When interviewed, he said Rory Gilmore taught him “the art of polite honesty.”

Digger faded into comfortable irrelevance, finally free of his father’s shadow.

Mitchum Huntzberger retired, humbled by time. He sent Rory a note after reading her book: “It took courage to write that. Richard would’ve debated you fiercely — and secretly admired you.” Real legacy isn’t what you control — it’s what you inspire.

Christopher’s daughter, Gigi, returned from Paris and built her own bridge back into the family. She and Rory became the sisters neither expected — different worlds, same blood, mutual respect.

• • • 

The Town Itself

Stars Hollow remained its own ecosystem of affection and absurdity. Miss Patty cried reading Rory’s book aloud to Babette; Taylor tried to regulate literary references; Kirk staged an unauthorized musical titled The Girl from the Book. Lane’s band played opening night. Gypsy tuned the guitars.

Luke stocked signed copies beside the napkin holder, claiming it was “for refolding, not resale.” Lorelai claimed she hated the attention, but when a tourist asked for directions to “the Gilmore gazebo,” she gave them a full walking tour.

Even Headmaster Charleston wrote a letter: “Miss Gilmore, you always had the words. I’m glad you finally learned which ones mattered.”

The DAR split in half — scandalised and secretly impressed. Emily never returned to them; she didn’t need to.

• • • 

How It Ends

The story closes on the square, one last autumn evening. The gazebo lights flicker. Luke locks the diner. Lorelai and Rory stand side by side, coffee in hand, watching the town that raised them glow. Jess lingers nearby, their son laughing somewhere behind them.

Rory: “Think they’ll ever stop talking about us?”
Lorelai (smiling): “God, I hope not.”

She tilts her head, inhales.
The air sharpens — that familiar electricity, that sense of beginning even at the end.

Lorelai (softly): “I smell snow.”

Rory looks up, smiling.
The first flakes fall — slow, weightless, inevitable.

Around them, the town keeps moving — laughter, light, and life, looping endlessly.
The Gilmores don’t run this time. They simply stand still and let it snow.

FADE OUT.

1nymh9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewAuthor/comments/1nymh9b/i_wrote_a_book_on_living_with_bipolar_heres_why/,I wrote a book on living with bipolar — here’s why it might help you too,"Chapter 1 – The Diagnosis That Woke Me Up
My journey with bipolar disorder has been a path of painful discovery, denial, and eventual acceptance. When I first received my diagnosis, I was in complete denial. I thought it was something that would simply disappear, like a flu that comes and goes. I told myself if I ignored it long enough, it would vanish.
So I refused my medication. I thought pills meant weakness, like I was broken beyond repair. If I just pushed through, maybe I could outrun the condition.
But reality doesn’t bend to denial.

When Mania Came
Ignoring treatment didn’t make bipolar disappear. It pushed me straight into full-blown mania. At first, it felt exhilarating: energy, creativity, momentum. But mania isn’t a phase of productivity—it’s a crisis. It’s the storm that tears everything apart.
Each sleepless night was like swiping a credit card I couldn’t repay. And eventually, the debt collector came.

The Crash: Sleep and Depression
When the mania burned out, I fell into depression. Not just sadness—emptiness. No motivation, no interest in anything. Some days I slept 16–18 hours straight.
For years, I felt ashamed. I told myself I was lazy, avoiding life, wasting my time. But I’ve since learned something important: sleep and depression are deeply connected.
Sometimes the “depression” after mania is simply sleep debt being collected. All those nights of missed rest have to be repaid. Oversleeping in that season isn’t avoidance—it’s survival.


At other times, depression is its own beast. It isn’t just exhaustion. It’s an illness, and it needs treatment—especially medication. Ignoring it only deepens the spiral.


And then there’s avoidance: deliberately ignoring responsibilities you could handle. That’s not depression—it’s fear or procrastination. The trick is knowing the difference.


This changed how I saw myself. If I needed to sleep 12 hours after a manic episode, that wasn’t weakness. It was healing. But if I stayed in bed to avoid eating, exercising, or facing reality, that wasn’t rest—it was avoidance.
And if I couldn’t climb out of the pit no matter how much I slept, I learned that was depression needing medical care.

Why Sleep Is the Anchor
Science has confirmed what I experienced firsthand: sleep is the cornerstone of mood.
75% of people with depression have sleep problems. Fixing sleep improves mood in most of them.


Harvard studies show REM sleep is critical for processing emotions. When it’s disrupted, depression deepens.


In bipolar, disrupted sleep is one of the earliest warning signs of an episode—whether manic or depressive.


Stanford research shows that even partial improvements in sleep hygiene can reduce depression without raising medication doses.


Sleep is medicine. Not a replacement for treatment, but a partner to it.

Balance in Rest
Rest has to be handled with rhythm. Eighteen hours a day won’t bring stability. What steadies me is balance—nine hours of good sleep at night, a 1.5-hour nap to reset, small steps after waking:
Cleaning my room.


Eating nourishing food.


Updating my budget.


Sending out CVs if I’ve lost work.


These little acts lay bricks toward stability. Rest gives me the strength to lift them.

The Eye of the Hurricane
The best way I can explain rest is this: it’s like the eye of the hurricane.
All around the eye is the eyewall—the winds, loud and furious, looking powerful. That’s what most people call productivity: busyness, hustle, constant motion. But the truth is, those winds can’t exist without the calm in the middle. The entire storm is sustained by the eye.
In the same way, I’ve learned that my true productivity comes not when I look the busiest, but when my center is calm. Sitting on the couch with my laptop, coffee in hand, piano music playing softly. Taking a nap and waking up clear-headed. Folding laundry or walking quietly outside. To others, it may look like laziness—but that calm is the source of my power.
Like the hurricane, the force of my work is only possible because of the calm at the center.

The Pain of Denial
Back in those early years, before I understood any of this, the consequences were brutal. In Singapore, every male must serve in the military. When mania overtook me, I was declared medically unfit for combat and pushed into admin work. I dropped out of school multiple times. I couldn’t hold a job.
The hardest part was watching my family carry the weight. They saw me transform from someone promising into someone they barely recognized. That memory still humbles me.

The Anchor of Hope
Everything began to shift when I stopped running from the diagnosis. Treatment became part of my routine. Medication stopped being an enemy and became a tool. Faith gave me an anchor. Becoming a Christian surrounded me with people who loved me without conditions. They reminded me I wasn’t discarded or broken—I was precious and capable.
I began to reframe my identity. Bipolar wasn’t who I was. It was something I lived with, something I managed.

What I Learned
Bipolar disorder isn’t a death sentence. It isn’t my identity. It’s a condition I’ve learned to manage.
Depression after mania isn’t always weakness. Sometimes it’s just sleep debt being repaid.


Sleep is the anchor. Prioritizing it is one of the strongest antidepressants available.


Medication matters. It steadies the brain when willpower alone can’t.


Rest is power. The calm center sustains the storm.


Mania isn’t a mode. It’s relapse. It’s the storm to be avoided.




Closing Thought
The day I was diagnosed, I thought life was over. What I see now is that it was the beginning of a different kind of life. Not free of challenges, but full of tools, strategies, and hope.
Diagnosis didn’t destroy me. It woke me up—and taught me that sleep, medication, and rest are not weaknesses. They’re weapons.

We hung out all the time, talked every day, and promised we’d always have each other’s backs. I honestly believed those friendships were solid.Then I lost my job. At first, everyone seemed supportive a few “you’ll be fine” texts, some jokes to lighten the mood. But as time went on and I wasn’t my usual “fun” self anymore, things started to change. Suddenly, I wasn’t getting invited out as much. The group chat went quiet for me. Little jokes about me being “lazy” or “broke” started slipping in.It hurt, but I laughed it off. Until one day, I opened Instagram and saw them all out together same bar we always went to, same inside jokes in the captions. Only difference was… I wasn’t there.No text, no invite, nothing. Just silence.
For a while, I isolated myself completely. I wasn’t in a good place mentally. It felt like I was watching everyone else move forward while I was stuck in the same place.
Then one day, out of nowhere, a girl I hadn’t spoken to in years texted me. Just a simple, “Hey, I saw you’ve been quiet lately. You okay?”
That message meant more than she’ll ever know. We started talking again, and through her, I met a few more people quiet, grounded, genuine ones. The kind who check in even when you don’t ask, who don’t disappear when things get hard.
They never made me feel like a burden. If I couldn’t afford coffee, they’d still want to hang out. If I didn’t feel like talking, they’d just sit with me. No expectations, no conditions just real friendship.

1nymbyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nymbyd/how_does_pure_blue_pbtlro4h50t_replacement_water/,How does Pure Blue PB-TLRO4H50T Replacement Water Filter Perform? Detailed Review,"Testing out the Pure Blue PB-TLRO4H50T Replacement Water Filter has been quite the journey. As someone who values clean water almost as much as I enjoy my morning coffee, I dove into this replacement system with curiosity and high hopes. Designed specifically for the Pure Blue H2O Four Stage Reverse Osmosis Water Filtration System, this pack promises an entire year's supply of filters, which feels perfect for someone like me who’d rather not keep running to the store every other month for a replacement. But like with most products, it’s not just a tale of pure upsides. Here’s the breakdown.

**Design and Build Quality**

Let’s start with the look and feel. These filters are made from durable plastic, and they weigh a solid 5.9 pounds collectively, which gives them a sense of sturdiness without being overly bulky. The dimensions—a little over 13 inches in length and 12 inches in width—are manageable for under-sink storage. The twist-lock manifold system deserves a special mention. Changing out filters couldn’t have been easier! I appreciate how sanitary and straightforward it is compared to some other systems I’ve tried, which involve a frustrating tug-of-war with fittings. On top of that, the NSF certification inspires a lot of confidence for anyone (me included) who might overthink water safety.

[Check Pure Blue PB-TLRO4H50T price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01m0g3tcw/)

**Performance and Water Quality**

Performance-wise, it’s hard to argue with results. After installing these filters, the clarity of the water improved almost instantly. Chlorine taste? Gone. Lingering odors? Nonexistent. This pack comes with 2 Stage 1 sediment filters, 2 Stage 2 pre-carbon block filters, and 1 Stage 4 post-carbon block filter. Each piece is clearly labeled, making configuration super intuitive, even for those who aren’t particularly handy. In terms of sediment and contaminants, it did a stellar job at reducing those levels as promised. Living in an area where water often carries a faint metallic aftertaste, this system was a noticeable upgrade.

**Ease of Installation**

A quick twist, a satisfying click, and voilà—the process is done! Installation was a breeze. I timed myself as a bit of a fun challenge, and within 10 minutes, I had swapped out all the filters. Even my coworker, who isn’t exactly known for his DIY skills, recommended it to me after effortlessly replacing his set. I didn’t need any additional tools, which made me appreciate just how user-friendly this product is. No mess, no spills—just clean and efficient.

**Positives**

- Simple and quick twist-lock installation process.
- NSF certification ensures safe, clean water.
- Effectively removes chlorine and reduces sediment.
- Comprehensive pack for a full year of use.
- Sturdy, reliable material that feels built to last.

**Downsides**

- At over 5 pounds, it’s slightly heavier than comparable products.
- While the filters perform exceptionally well, they are only compatible with the Pure Blue system, limiting versatility.
- No included instructions in the box, which might frustrate first-time users who don’t check online guides.

**Product Comparisons**

When pitted against mainstream replacement water filters like those from Brita or GE, the Pure Blue set stands out for its specialized reverse osmosis capabilities. While Brita filters are quick and convenient, they lack the deeper filtration power that multi-stage systems like this one provide. On the flip side, brands like GE offer greater compatibility across various systems, which can be an advantage in certain households. In terms of twist-locking convenience, though, this Pure Blue product wins hands down. Plus, while GE filters often stray into higher price territory, Pure Blue feels a bit more reasonably positioned between affordability and premium.

**Cost Efficiency**

It’s important to think about the long-term value this product offers. Sure, the initial investment might seem steep to some, but this pack covers you for the whole year! That, in itself, saves a ton of hassle. Also, if you’re serious about clean, purified water, the benefits far outweigh what you’d spend on bottled alternatives—or on a cheaper filtration option that wouldn’t perform half as well. The money spent here adds up to consistent quality and peace of mind.

The Sheriff was sitting on his usual chair outside the office, the double-barrel shotgun resting across his legs. Life in town was quiet as always. Folks walked and shopped, the saloon was busy. The small settlement was known as the safest town in the territory.

For years, no serious crime had happened—not because of the Sheriff's grit, but because most residents were war veterans: sharpshooters, law-abiding, and watchful. In truth, the Sheriff was the most useless man in town. No outlaw dared come near. Even the bank had no guard.

The Sheriff was lost in thought, a heavy feeling in his gut. Twenty years a Sheriff, and now he heard the whispers about being replaced. Twenty years of service without a single notable incident or badge of honor. He’d have to go home, till the earth, and feed the cows.

Inside his office, the walls displayed pictures of famous sheriffs, their deputies, and the outlaws' bodies in coffins. He had no place on that wall. Tomorrow, and the days after, it would be the chair, the gun, and the same damn thoughts. But the final blow was the Mayor’s look and his cutting greeting:

 “Sheriff, we’ll likely need to have a serious talk in my office in the next few days.”



“No,” he muttered to himself, “it can't end this way... I have to do something.”


---

The Plan

That night, he called his Deputy, telling him he had to leave town early to visit his sick brother. The next morning, the Sheriff packed provisions, saddled his horse, and rode out.

Five hours later, he found Uncle Johnny’s cabin at the bottom of a hill. He hadn't seen the old man in years and hoped he was still alive. The smoke rising from the chimney gave him some hope.

As he approached, the stench of rotting animal carcasses and skins hanging on ropes confirmed it. He called out cautiously. A tall man with a long white beard and a rifle appeared in the doorway. Johnny recognized the Sheriff, lowered his gun, and invited him in.

He poured bitter coffee into a dented metal cup and handed it over:

 “What brings you, Sheriff? Coming to finally arrest me? You know I’ve been clean for years. Truth is, I don’t have the strength for that life anymore.”



The Sheriff, choking on the stench, replied:

“No, Uncle. Just had a sudden thought of you yesterday. Came for a visit. I see you’re still in the trapping business. Heard you don't even pass up a dead critter's hide in the desert. Aren't you tired of all this filth? Truth is, I have a great job offer for you. An easy, clean job that will change both our lives.”



Johnny frowned.

 “What job? I can't do hard labor. There's no gold around here, all the mines are dead.”



The Sheriff leaned in.

“No, the gold I'm talking about has no mine. You just have to reach out and take it. Simple as that.”



Johnny’s eyes narrowed.

 “Then why don't you take it yourself?”



The Sheriff explained:

 “Look, Uncle, I'm the Sheriff. And you know our town is too safe. The bank has no guard. There's only a teller and a pile of money and gold coins he brings in every morning. All you need to do is walk in with a pistol at the agreed time, load the bags onto your horse, and ride out. I'll fire a few shots behind you. Then you take your share and ride off to a new town for a new life. It’s that easy.”



After half an hour, Uncle Johnny seemed convinced.

 “I'll think about it.”



The Sheriff pressed:

 “We don't have much time. I'll be waiting for you at 8 AM sharp on Monday. If you show, I’ll signal you. If you don't, you better forget everything, for your own sake. I know you have a gun. Take this money, get yourself a good horse and clothes. Take a bath and shave that beard, or they’ll know who robbed the bank just from the smell.”




---

The Heist That Wasn't

An hour before the appointed time, the Sheriff picked up his rifle and walked toward the bank. He knew there wouldn't be much cash at 8 AM, but that didn't matter. He was hunting for glory.

He ate at the saloon across the street and watched. Eight o'clock came. No old man.

Half an hour passed. Nine o'clock came and went. No sign. He started to regret everything. What if Johnny blabbed?

Ten o'clock. The bank was emptying out. The Sheriff walked back to his office, handed his rifle to the Deputy, and poured himself coffee.

Then—gunshots.

He rushed out. Someone screamed:

 “They robbed the bank! They robbed the bank!”



The teller collapsed on the steps, his chest bleeding. Three masked riders stormed out. The Deputy was gunned down before he could react.

The Sheriff drew his pistol. Townsfolk blocked the street with carts. From windows and rooftops, sharpshooters fired.

The street became a war zone.

The Sheriff shot one rider’s horse but took two bullets in his arm. One rider tried to escape through the saloon but got blasted by the bartender’s shotgun. Another fell riddled with bullets beside his horse. The third crawled under the general store steps; the Sheriff finished him with two shots.

 “Hold your fire! It's over!” he yelled.



Dust settled. People screamed. The Sheriff had lost an arm—but he had finally found his glory.


---

The Visit

Two months later, the one-armed Sheriff sat in his office. A picture of him hung on the wall next to his fallen Deputy.

The door opened. A tall old man walked in. Clean. Shaven.

The Sheriff asked quietly:

 “Why, Uncle? Why?”



Johnny sighed.

 “I’m truly sorry, Sheriff. Things didn’t go as planned.”



The Sheriff repeated:

 “Why?”



Johnny smiled bitterly.

 “They call me crazy, but I’m smart enough to hire the right people for the job. Even if it didn't work out... Look, you got crippled, but you finally made a name for yourself. You don’t have to worry about your future. But me? I have nothing. And I lost three good friends. That’s why I came to you for help. Truth is, I don’t want to go back to that shithole. You have to help me. Don’t worry, I’ll only be around for three or four more years; it will be over soon. You have to support me. I hope you understand.

10. Binoculars 
11. Car charger for our cell phones 


Regrets:
1. I wish I would have brought more fleece lined leggings - they have been warmer than my base layer / hiking pants combination 
2. I wish I would have packed my coffee thermos - I’ve noticed the coffees here are much smaller than I am used to in America and I would have liked to load a thermos up at the breakfast buffets to take with me on the day trips 
3. More snacks! The meals here feel much smaller than back at home, which is totally fine but my husband and I are both getting hungry within an hour or two…I wish we would have packed more healthy snacks we could use to supplement between meals. 
4. A way to water proof my backpack 
5. I had debated purchasing a camera for our trip - upon reflection I wish I had, my iPhone photos are nice enough but it is a regret 

Ps - for those who were looking for fashion tips for their trip I would say 96% of the tourists are in their full hiking gear at all times but I packed a pair of jeans, a thick sweater and a trench for walking around Reykjavík and I felt very comfortable.

1. You can click on a **category** (e.g. *Espresso*, *Brewed Coffee*, *Iced Tea*).
2. That opens its **sub-menu** (like *Latte*, *Flat White*, *Mocha*, etc).
3. Then you can click on an **individual product image** (like *Espresso* or *Espresso Macchiato*).
4. After clicking, a **popup modal** should appear with details and a buy button.





My issue:

Currently, only the **first (top-level) title component** is clickable. Components nested inside (like the drink options and images) don’t respond to clicks, even though I’ve set interactions for them.



If anyone has experience building **multi-level clickable structures or nested interactions in Framer**, I’d love to hear how you set it up (frames, variants, or event triggers).

Wondering if someone can help.

My first Sage machine and got it Thursday, a Dual Boiler.

I noticed yesterday there was a puddle of water out the back under the machine where the water tank goes in. I was filling it up via the top port if that matters.

So took the tank out and cleaned it all up. Put in a fresh tank of water and made one coffee and lo and behold there was another puddle starting to form.

Did I miss something during the setup? I’m guessing this isnt to be expected right?

Not sure what to do or look at? Will contact support on Monday but it’s ruining my wooden worktop which sucks!

I’m (31F) American and the guy (34M) is German. We match on an app on Monday and by Friday he is asking me to get coffee. We haven’t had much for conversation but he says we can talk more over coffee. I can’t do Friday so we agree on Saturday morning. (We are in the US if that matters.) 

We both arrive, he hugs me, we order our coffees and sit to wait. We start chatting a little, it’s awkward but whatever. He’s asking me about my kids and my divorce and offers info about his own child. I ask what he does because his profile doesn’t say. He gives an incredibly vague answer. Like literally, “I do something to earn enough to make a living.” Odd but I figure he’s private so move on. 

Our coffees are ready and he asks to sit outside. Sounds good so we settle in and actually get chatting. He tells me a little about his family and some details about his divorce. He finally mentions what type of job he has but still vague. He tells me some hobbies he has and stances on certain topics. He thinks it’s funny I’m afraid of bees and that I ramble when I’m nervous. It’s a good conversation otherwise, then we both have to head out. He walks me to my car and gives me another hug and goes to leave. I say bye and go to get in my car. 

Then he stops and comes back and goes “oh, did you want to exchange numbers?” Of course, I enjoyed my time with him. I apologize because I didn’t even think to offer and he states that he was waiting for me to bring it up but he assumed I forgot. I laughed and said I can be a little scatterbrained which he found very funny for some reason. We exchange numbers and he finally reveals that the name on his profile is not his real name. I’m a bit shocked but laugh it off and he says “you never put your real name on the internet.” I’m like, okay well I did😅. He seems satisfied with the exchange, hugs me again, and we part ways. 

My day is busy so some hours go by but early evening I text him to say I enjoyed meeting him and I hope he has a safe trip tomorrow (he mentioned during coffee.) It’s now the next day and he never responded. Did I do something wrong? I’ve never been this stressed about meeting someone before. I think I’m just worried with cultural differences I may have done something to offend him?? Or maybe he just isn’t interested and was being polite by finishing the coffee before leaving?

1nym1bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nym1bo/investigate_if_all_free_clear_liquid_detergent_is/,Investigate if All Free Clear Liquid Detergent is Worth the Hype,"The All 2979351 Free Clear HE Liquid Laundry Detergent has been a staple in my laundry routine for a while now, and I've developed quite the attachment to it. It's marketed as unscented, free from dyes, and designed with hardworking stain lifters, which honestly sounded too good to be true at first. Using it every day, however, has been a mix of quiet admiration for its effectiveness and some musings on its quirks.

**Ease of Use and Convenient Packaging**  
From the moment I picked it up, the straightforward packaging caught my attention. Compact, lightweight, and incredibly user-friendly, the 1.6 oz per vend-box design is ideal for busy households or anyone running through laundry cycles multiple times a week. As someone who often feels like laundry takes over life, I appreciate that the individual portions prevent mess and eliminate the guessing game of how much detergent to use. There’s no risk of over-pouring, which used to lead to sudsy chaos in my washer.

**Key Benefits**  
- Excellent for sensitive skin due to its dye-free and perfume-free formulation.  
- Single-use packs are effortless to handle, and there’s no waste.  
- Works seamlessly with both regular and high-efficiency machines.  

[Ready to buy All 2979351 Free Clear? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b01flnp8aw/)

**Performance and Stain Removal**  
The stain-lifting capabilities boast impressive results. My favorite red shirt recently had a close encounter with some coffee, but this detergent managed to wipe out the evidence effortlessly. It’s been effective across a variety of materials, from tough denim to delicate silks. Cold, warm, or hot water — it performs the same magic every time. I’ve even had a couple of neighbors borrow it to test on their notoriously hard-to-remove oil stains, and both came back raving about the results.

**Good Aspects**  
- Delivers consistent cleaning, even on tougher stains like grease or coffee.  
- Effective across a variety of washable materials.  

**Potential Limitations**  
- The unscented formula, while great for sensitive skin, might not offer that “just-washed” aroma that some people crave.  
- Portioned packs are convenient, but for large families or big loads, a single-use portion might feel limiting.  

**Comparable Products**  
Compared to Tide Free & Gentle or Persil ProClean Sensitive Skin liquid detergents, this product sets itself apart with its vending-box convenience and travel-friendly size. While Tide offers slightly better results on deeply ingrained pet odors, and Persil’s formula is known for tackling stubborn dirt, this detergent excels in simplicity and ease of use. For those with sensitive skin, I’d argue it’s the safest bet — completely free of dyes and fragrances, it feels like it respects your fabric and your skin more than its competitors. Still, laundry aficionados seeking intense odor-removal power might lean towards its rivals. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The investment feels well worth the features you get — especially when considering the thoughtfulness behind its everyday design and functionality. It's not just about paying for detergent; it's about ensuring my sensitive-skinned nephew doesn’t have a rash breakout after wearing his soccer uniform cleaned with it. Some may argue machines with more custom detergent-dispensing features don’t optimize smaller packs like this, but the overall value remains strong, especially with consistent results load after load.

I (44F) met him (37) two years ago at my old job. Buckle up, because none of this is going to make sense to anyone with a reasonable brain.

I was a case manager for disabled adults, and our departments crossed paths a few times a month. The attraction was obvious. He blushed, got nervous, and once even confessed his feelings in another language after I joked that I knew just enough of it to get myself into trouble. I didn’t respond because, at the time, I was in a relationship with a kind but distant man and was trying to make that work.

After that, he pulled back but never disappeared completely. He popped up again from time to time, invited me to his running group, shared his gym schedule, and somehow never quite stayed away.

Eventually, that relationship ended. When I finally made my move, he looked completely confused sitting across from me in that coffee shop. He thought I was still taken or maybe even gay. Once he realized what was happening, he tried flirting but then said something ridiculous about me not having enough hobbies. So, out of spite, I picked one up: kayaking.

He had some gear but couldn’t afford the rest. I bought what I needed, didn’t tell him, and got started. Later, when he saw the kayak on my car, he couldn’t resist commenting. Victory never tasted so good.

We chatted here and there after that about fitness goals, and on my way out of that job, we exchanged small gifts.

Later, we started talking again in that “are we or aren’t we” kind of way. I met his kids. He joked about wrestling, which I thought was flirty, but no, he meant literal wrestling. We hung out, talked, got vulnerable. Then I noticed a photo of his ex on his phone. Yikes.

The next morning, I admitted I’d been a little bold. He said he’d gotten nervous. I told him maybe it was time I got back out there, though I have no idea why I thought that was helpful. He said I could still come over and chill. So we kept circling around each other, breadcrumb after breadcrumb.

When we finally did hang out again, he complained the event was boring. I grabbed a meal, and he didn’t even pay for his coffee. Despite my better judgment, I invited him over anyway. He said he’d let me know when he was free. I told him next week wouldn’t work for me anyway and joked that by the time we actually hung out, my cats would be paying my mortgage.

It’s been three weeks. He hasn’t said a word. I haven’t reopened that thread because I’m done chasing someone who can’t meet me halfway. I know exactly what it would cost me: the same cycle, the same push-pull, the same empty trails that lead nowhere.

So instead, I’m rebuilding. I’ve taken up new hobbies: amateur comedy, learning chess and Spanish, and staying consistent with my fitness. I’m dating again too, because whether this man was ready for real connection or not, I am.

The wild part is that the women we worked with all think he’s this soft, sensitive guy. It turns out he’s just another man who ghosts rather than sends a simple “no thanks.” He was in the literal army, which means he would rather face gunfire than send a text.

I’ll keep building my life without this spineless jellyfish. I hope karma gives him the mirror he has been avoiding.

Before each break you’d rate how stressed you feel from 1 to 10, and over time it would build a “stress score” that shows patterns, like when stress peaks or which type of break actually helps.

So our parents thought it would be great for me to go there and stay with them until the competition ends, but my whole family went as well bc they could have get togethers. We are not in the same category bc i’m a woman, he is a man so we can’t be. Naturally we practiced together and that’s when we started to connect, after practices we went on walks and talked and laughed and so on. I remember he was freakishly strong, in his city you can get in trouble just by breathing, and some guys wanted to mess with me and me being me i started to scar them with words and they wanted to fight so i went head on, but he just grabbed me and ran with me, cus i can’t get in trouble before competition bc i’m out then. I WAS SPEECHLESS.

So we have our fun not being at home when our parents thought we would but they can’t say anything cus we’re adults, and that’s when they started to realize that there is something between us. I won’t go into detail but i felt so connected to him that even tho i HATE physical touch i could’t get enough. So when we practiced i would always touch him, or when we ran (while we were on adventure) i would always grab his hand or something (but he did that too😜) ANYWAYS i just know i LOVED when he carried me which is so out of character for me, but it felt right. We were like kids running around. 


At the end, we had competition and even in the dream i could’t remember that i won and when my parents came to pick us up they congratulated me but i was confused and like “wait i won? really? REALLY?”. We had our last night together and i went home ALL SAD.


Literally few days later they were in my city. But they didn’t tell my family just me while i was having my daily walk and then sit by the river and have some cigarets and drink coffee until i feel alive again (real story). But his sibling ,while i was sitting on the wall next to river, told me they had a meting near me i should come. OFC I DID. I sat and him and his other two siblings were late. His mother was teaching his siblings how to read faster (by reading a book) and they were like 6-7 years old and somehow  they got songs in. And then he showed up and i remember when he saw me we just smiled and he went straight to me and we hugged for long time.

BUT THEN I WOKE UP.

I don’t know what to think bc this felt so real and it never did. I’m kinds concerned and sad tbh. Thoughts?

1nyliec,https://www.reddit.com/r/adult_adhd/comments/1nyliec/could_it_be_adhd_undiagnosed_adult_in_his_30s/,Could it be ADHD? (undiagnosed adult in his 30s),"Hello,

I have recently been asking myself whether I suffer from ADHD or simply feeling the effects of dopamine dysregulation due to technology, which I am sure is getting more and more common these days. I also wonder whether it could be some other issue due to early trauma. The main reason I am reluctant to suspect ADHD is that I do not remember struggling with my present symptoms as a kid or adolescent to the same extent. 

I have drafted a rough description of my symptoms/'personality' below. This is highly condensed and unpolished but should give the gist, I hope.

Here it is: My life feels chaotic, like I am constantly running out of time or there aren't enough hours in the day to get things done, or I am on fast-forward. Whenever I am doing something, my mind keeps jumping to the next thing I could be doing instead and sometimes I feel like I have to act on that impulse, unless I am engaging in creative work like music, in which case I can get engrossed in it for hours and feel more mentally calm. I would love to be able to organise my days and get multiple things done, wake up early, and deeply admire those who can, but I just can't seem to and seem to only be able to focus on one major activity or two at the most within the day. I always feel like I need to rush off to do the next thing and struggle to concentrate or calmly get one task done before moving on to the next one. Busy work schedules overwhelm and stress me, I much prefer instead slow-paced work environments. I can also struggle with analysis paralysis, I am indecisive and get overwhelmed by too many options (large menus!) because I feel I need to check out and carefully evaluate each of of them, lest I choose the wrong one and regret it. I can easily change idea about my plan on the fly or change course of action often. Every day in my life looks different. I never have lunch/dinner at the same time. Sometimes, I just skip meals, especially if I am engrossed in an activity I like. My internet browser can be full of open tabs and I jump from video to video or article to article before finishing one.

I am extremely creative and have too many interests (music, photography, philosophy, cooking, dogs, nutrition, body-building, psychology, writing, filmmaking, movies, spirituality and meditation, etc.)  and too many ideas and not enough time to ever focus on any of finish a single project. I start lots of things and dabble in all of the above but hardly ever finish them or master a skill. My main passion is music, song-writing, and composition. I have learnt to play the piano, guitar, and, more recently, the concert flute, but have not mastered any of them fully. My learning style consists of basically playing these instruments in short bursts, throughout the day, alternating between that and whatever else I am doing. How I learnt the flute is a good example of this. I think most people have ‘flute practice’ for x amount of time on a regular basis at a specific time of the day. I cannot fathom that. My flute lives by my side, when I am at home, and it gets played whenever I feel like until I get bored. But I only ever play stuff I like playing that retains my interest or ‘feels good’. I cannot engage with methodical, repetitive practice (scales! I hate scales!), which is why I am good but I will never be a virtuoso. On the plus side, when it comes to things I enjoy, I learn really, really quickly. This style of learning has characterised my whole life. I do that with foreign languages too. I learn from using them, but never sit down with a book or long articles to read.  always excelled academically, but unlike other people who studied regularly for long periods of time, I studied in short, intense bursts, right before an exam. Sometimes I would study while watching cartoons. My mum used to tell people “I never see him study. I don’t know when he studies” but, in the end, I would always get good grades. Throughout the years, teachers who did not know me yet would tell my mum that they were concerned about my performance, because I always looked distracted, but when they put me on the spot and asked me to repeat what they had just been saying in class, I was apparently able to do that quite well. Thus, folks would say I had ‘antennas’, cuz I looked engaged in something else but was actually listening to conversations around me. Having said that, I maintained overall good grades until high school. After that, I realised math and any other subject involving numbers, such as physics and chemistry,  were my nemesis. I just stopped understanding them and was never able to even get a pass for 5 years straight. It was ironic to my teachers, because in almost every other subject I kept getting outstanding grades. In such a way, I made it all the way through university and graduate school and got a PhD by, you guessed it, studying and working in short bursts right before deadlines. Throughout my undergraduate years, I relied on my best friend and course mate to manage the more ‘organisational’ aspects of uni life, such as remember deadlines, times and venues of classes, events etc. We jokingly used to say he was my PA.

Loud noises irritate me, in fact many things irritate me. Waiting and non-responsive technology can at times lead to anger outbursts when I am alone, and I have smashed quite a few mobile phone screens and punched a few laptops because they were too slow/frozen. In my flat I only ever turn on dim lights. Bright lights don’t make me uncomfortable, but I don’t like them and I definitely prefer warm lights to cold ones. Paradoxically, however, I seem to be the only person in my workplace who needs  windows and sunlight. Not being able to see outside whilst in the middle of the day deeply depresses me. In my previous job, my colleagues and I were put in a so-called office that looked more like a cabinet with no external windows. I almost never set foot there and never spent any time working in it.

In intimate relationships or with close relatives, I have mood swings and get easily irritated, but in friendships and professional relationships I seem to be fine or be able to control these moods. Having said that, formal interactions tire me out, not because I don’t know how to behave but due to the fakeness of it all. I cannot stand performativity and fake-politeness. At work, I am always at my happiest when I can be spontaneous and say what I feel and think (but tactfully, I don’t offend people and I think I am very empathetic), which is why I struggle working in corporate environments where I have to engage with paying customers, because putting on a mask makes me feel suffocated and exhausted. I work as a teacher mostly. I moderately enjoy it as long as I can teach what I am interested in and I have engaged students who are interested in the subject. As long as it feels we are all deeply immersed in what they are studying, it’s great. In my previous job, however, I had to teach compulsory classes to students who did not give two shits, and it was cringey and fustrating to me. I also had to wake up early every day. At the time, I became deeply depressed and managed my depression by going for long walks in the evening after work. I found that, after an exhausting day at work, I was not able to stay in my flat to just chill. I just had to get out and walk. I am able, by the way, to be on time for work, but in order to do that, I wake up right at the last minute, barely have time for a shower and to dress and dash out of the door, without breakfast, without even the time to drink water. Also, I often end up wasting time trying to look for my glasses, phone, wallet etc. I love cooking and love having slow mornings and making breakfast, but I can only really manage that on a day off. Oh, and I go to the gym but, once again, rarely at the same time of the day or the same day of the week. At the gym, I do the same simple, full-body routine I have been doing for years. I see people doing split routines and 5-6 sets and quite frankly get bored just looking at them. In between sets, if usually get up and pace along the gym.

My mind is always coming up with new tunes or songs, and I was an extremely creative child. I am still creative but since I started using smart phones and got a full time job I am unable to find time for my creative endeavours, which really hurts. I wish I had the energy to make music on the weekends or after work (I know people who do and I envy them), but I just feel too drained after work to do anything creative. I don’t know how people manage doing 8-hour shifts, because I feel tired after just teaching four hours.

 When I get interested in something I need to do it straight away, I rarely postpone it. Same thing if an idea creeps into my head that I need to buy something or research a topic. Indeed, I can get engrossed into researching a topics for hours, days and sometimes weeks if they peak my interests, and sometimes I am even unable to stop and go to bed or do chores. In fact, I almost never do chores, cuz they feel to me like wasting time (laundry, cleaning, hanging my clothes feels atrociously slow and like a waste of time). On the contrary, if I am not interested in something or the deadline is not looming, I postpone that thing indefinitely, usually until it’s late. In fact, things getting in the way of me wanting to do something lead to frustration and irritation. One those rare occasions—these days—I am composing music and get interrupted I can get very irritated, but this was also very common when I was a teenager living at home and people would knock on my door while I was in the middle of my creative process. The mundane aspects of my job also feel extremely frustrating as it often feels understimulating and like I am wasting my precious time on meaningless, perfunctory tasks just for the sake of earning money when I could be doing so many more interesting, meaningful things. One of the best times I had in recent years was during COVID, when I retreated to a country home alone for months, was living off my savings and a part-time remote job, and had a slow life pace and plenty of solitude, time for cooking and going for hikes, and time to focus on my creative endeavours.

 I am/have been addicted to pornography (I can waste a whole night or afternoon just consuming content), sex and cruising, going to bars (but not alcohol, just the thrill of flirting with someone), and coffee. Not the caffeine though, but the taste of coffee. If I do not get what I consider to be good coffee on any given day I can feel really frustrated and sometimes end up spending quite a bit of money to have two coffees in order to seek that 'rush'. I nrecent years, my addictions have taken over my life and kind of compounded the whole picture.

I generally feel frustrated, like I have achieved nothing in my life or I am wasting my creative power, and when I am unable to create I feel meaningless. Long work shifts with nothing going on to keep me stimulated or busy schedules feel suffocating, I detest rule-based or meaningless structure, 9-5 jobs or sitting at a desk for a long time just 'for the sake of it', professional or mandated attire, performativity and 'work theatre' or 'productivity theatre', when people get together and, say, have meetings just to look busy but nothing gets done. I cannot conceive how anybody could be so willing to waste their life doing nothing meaningful just as long as they get paid for it. I enjoy solitude, I struggle to find a meaningful job (I would want to live off my art but I am too scared to try), I detest small talk and people invading my personal space. I thoroughly enjoy moving around, freedom and independence in my work, including the ability to choose the space where I work and the hours, dislike inflexible deadlines, pressure, authority and impositions. Oh, conformity too. I find conformity quite nauseating.  In relationships, I often have conflicting feelings, like I think I want to be with a person one day, then feel like I want to break up with them the nextm but I think this is also linked to negative past experiences and fear of abandonment (and possible an avoidant attachment style). 

I handwrite very fast, sometimes so fast I skip letters because my mind skips ahead to the next part of the word before my hand can finish writing the present letter. I can read lots, especially excerpts and short essays, but I easily get distracted when reading and have to re-read the same passage over and over, unless I find it highly interesting and engaging, in which case I can finish a book in a few sittings. Having said that, I struggle to remember detailed information, such as names, dates, and events. I am good with broad, abstract concepts and ideas though.

As a kid, I was told to be ‘very mature for my age’. I grew up with a controlling, authoritarian father who has grievous childhood trauma, extreme mood swings, and was prone to anger outbursts such as smashing things, throwing things up in the air and, in the worst case scenario, hitting people. Thus, I grew up as a hypervigilant kid. I also had a very affectionate but depressed mother who was on antidepressants and sometimes anxiety medications.  In my adolescence, I started developing all sorts of odd somatic anxieties, some of which were quite debilitating and got resolved after I left home to go to university (oh, I am gay and grew up in a homophobic environment).

I think that many of the symptoms I described above, however, did not start or became debilitating until after I finished my PhD and started working. Until then, I was vastly in charge of my schedule while maintaining a very flexible, slow-paced daily routine. I also used to greatly enjoy being able to work on my research at my own pace and time. Having said that, even during my student days, I was always prone to sleeping very late and getting up late, and, come to think it, already had the feeling of 'wasting a lot of my time'. Still, I do feel my symptoms either appeared or got worse after I started using a smartphone. Since then, I feel my life has spiraled out of control. I do try to keep it all together by going to great lengths to find and keep slow-paced jobs with flexible schedules, and that allows me to function ‘relatively’ well, but when my job schedule gets busy or I have several deadlines, that is when I feel overwhelmed and like things start falling apart. I also feel that, when I am unable to create, all my symptoms worsen and I feel more restless, dissatisfied, depressed, and frustrated.

Okay, I know that was a lot of information crammed into a few paragraphs. I am sure I have left out much, but there you go. Many thanks indeed to anybody willing to read/help. P.S. I have spent the past 72 hours consuming vast amounts of online content on ADHD and neurodivergence (I am feeling exhausted but I just cannot stop) and feel like I cannot do anything else until I have 'resolved' this (and yes, I am ignoring more impending deadlines), though I know of course I may have to consider counselling or therapy to get to the bottom of this. I do want to find out what's up with me, but do not want to fall into the trend of just getting a label or overexplaining everything by resorting to mental illness diagnoses (I am sure there's a name for that; there's a name for everything these days!)

Thanks again!

We’re close in age, and overall our relationship is loving and stable, but we often have recurring disagreements about finances and small gestures.

We usually split everything 50/50 — meals, trips, tickets — and while I understand the importance of fairness, I sometimes feel a lack of generosity or care through small gestures. For example, we recently drove out of town for a dance class and split everything equally, even though he eats more than I do.

Recently he surprised me with movie tickets ($10 each). He didn’t want to buy popcorn at the theatre, so he brought a $2 bag from the store. I bought my own $4 bag since I didn’t think he’d want to share, which we ended up eating together instead. I genuinely appreciated the thought and loved the movie, but the next morning when I asked if he could take me out for a coffee, he asked if I could grab both. I explained that I didn’t have money on me (I recently lost my job and start a new one soon), and he said, “Okay, just send me $6 tomorrow for yours.” That made me feel a bit disheartened, like I wasn’t worth a small gesture that day.

When I tried to explain that small acts — like treating me once in a while — make me feel loved, he said he had just taken me to the movies. When I mentioned that it was $10, he said love shouldn’t be measured by money, but by equality and shared gestures. We went back and forth, and I got frustrated and said, “So you’ll be 50/50 your whole life, even with your pregnant wife?” He felt that wasn’t a fair comparison, and the energy between us was off after that.

This has been a recurring difference between us. I sometimes end up feeling unappreciated or unseen, while he feels judged or pressured. Part of my fear is that if he struggles with small gestures now, he might not be comfortable supporting me later when life changes — like if I’m pregnant. I also worry that maybe he would do those thoughtful things for someone he sees as his “dream girl,” and that fear makes me feel even more disconnected.

I don’t want to argue or make him feel attacked — I just want to express how I feel about small acts of generosity and emotional connection without sounding ungrateful or causing another fight.

I’m looking for advice on:
	
How to communicate this in a way that feels calm and fair to both of us?

How to find middle ground when we show love in different ways?

How to talk about money and generosity without it becoming defensive?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I split everything 50/50, but I feel unloved when there aren’t small gestures. He says love isn’t about money. I want advice on how to communicate this without fighting.

one day she got lost and wondered off to an abandoned research facility.  
in that research facility one thing was left unharmed.  
a collection of Fused evolution stones.  
Luna had accidentily touched a fusion stone of Fairy and Ice, evolving her into a mysteon.  
due to the unnatural evolution, Luna's body didn't become larger like a normal evolution.  
while walking around, trying to get her bearings, she noticed the ribbons she had.  
she was excited, because she wanted to be a sylveon.  
but because the fairy evolution stone was mixed with an ice type one, she wasn't a ""pure"" sylveon.  
when she met up with her parents, they looked at her with shock and disdain.  
while she was asleep, they left her with a note.  
""You aren't our daughter.""  
Luna read the note, and panicked. her parents left her, and she didn't want to be alone. while she was running around trying to find them, she ran into a very large pokemon, Sirius, at around 4 meters tall. (or 13 foot in freedom units)  
Luna was understandibly scared of Sirius at first, but when Sirius brought himself lower to the ground, meeting Luna at normal height, she relaxed.  
the two traveled together, bu after months of not finding luna's parents, Luna gave up, running away.  
Sirius tracked her down, finding her in a destroyed forest.  
in her rage, Luna has destroyed the forest using several moonblasts.  
Sirius comforted luna, with a lot of challange of getting to her.  
later, Sirius dropped off Luna at his house. a very large cabin.  
inside was an espeon, with abnormally brown colored fur, a green gem, and also being seemingly blind.  
the espeon reacted to Luna entering while making coffee. ""Who might you be?""  
'I'm luna', she responded.  
""Nice name. What brings you here?""  
'Sirius brought me here.'  
""as he did with me. feel free to look around, Luna.""  
and so Luna began exploring the cabin.  
when sirius returned with berries, Luna noticed too peculiar ones.  
a pink-yellow-ish berry, and an icy blue carrot-like one.  
""what berries are those?""  
""""Those are Sweisca berries and Icila berries respectively.""""  
""What do they taste like?""  
""""Why don't you try for yourself?""""  
Luna ate the icila berry first. it was a little bitter at first, but it transitioned into sweet not too long after.  
the sweisca berry was sweet and sour.

The Proliferation of Providence, Parity and Perfection in action.

What if we choose our responses to the cacophony of it all and providence uses us and our judgements of it to propagate something tangible and show us our thoughts? What if we're simply mistaking all of that for validation and proof that our thoughts are true and accurate?

What if God is constantly speaking but simply isn't negating anything? What if it all just sounds like ""blah, blah, blah"" to man because God isn't saying anything man wants to hear? What if He's supporting everyone, all at once and equally, all the time, with the propagation of whatever is on one's mind and using all of that propagation to provide palpability and make our thoughts visible? What if THAT is what man calls ""reality""? What if the proliferation of all of that contrast and conflict is all we can perceive? It's perception itself, isn't it? Isn't perception simply the plucking of various aspects of the whole FROM the whole and comparing them to one another in a ""this"" and ""not that"" manner?

Each type offers different features and benefits. It’s important to consider what suits your needs.[ Let’s explore the various coffee makers available.](https://gomehedi.com/cheapest-best-coffee-maker/)

# Drip Coffee Makers

Drip coffee makers are a popular choice for many households. They are easy to use and affordable. Here’s why you might consider one:

* Convenience: Just add water and coffee grounds.
* Capacity: Can brew multiple cups at once.
* Programmable Features: Some models allow you to set a brewing time.

These machines work by heating water and letting it drip through coffee grounds. The brewed coffee collects in a pot. Perfect for families or small offices. You can find models with various features, like strength control and built-in grinders. Consider a drip coffee maker if you want a simple and efficient machine.

# Single Serve Machines

Single serve machines have become very popular. They offer a quick and easy way to make coffee. Here are some features:

* Convenience: Use pods for easy brewing.
* Variety: Many flavors and types available.
* Minimal Cleanup: Just discard the used pod.

Single serve machines are ideal for those who want one cup at a time. These machines are perfect for a quick coffee fix. They are also great for households with different coffee preferences. Compact and easy to store, they fit well in small spaces. Consider a single serve machine if you value speed and variety.

# French Press

The French press is a manual coffee maker. It’s known for producing rich and flavorful coffee. Here are the main points:

* Control: You have control over brewing time and strength.
* No Filters Needed: Uses a metal mesh instead.
* Portable: Easy to take anywhere.

To use a French press, add coffee and hot water, then press the plunger. This method allows for full immersion of coffee grounds. You get a stronger flavor compared to other methods. It’s perfect for those who appreciate the art of coffee making. Consider a French press if you enjoy hands-on brewing.

# Espresso Machines

Espresso machines are perfect for coffee lovers. They offer a rich and intense coffee experience. Here’s what you get:

* Variety: Make espresso, cappuccino, and lattes.
* Quality: High-quality coffee with crema.
* Customization: Adjust grind, pressure, and temperature.

These machines use pressure to force water through finely-ground coffee. This results in a concentrated coffee shot. Espresso machines are ideal for those who want a café experience at home. They can be more expensive and require some skill. Choose an espresso machine if you want premium coffee.

I got a job offer from a different coffee shop that is more of my in the sense it's traditional coffee, a more adult setting, but the dress code is strict. While I interviewed they didn't say anything about my piercings until they sent me a job offer basically being like "" You'll see once I send the dress code that some piercings aren't allowed. it's not a attack on your personal style but we like to keep piercings to a minimal."" 

I asked if I could wear clear jewelry or a retainer they said yes. But the more I think about it I honestly I dont want to do. Im not sure how many piercings they want me to cover but it sounds like a pain in my ass to take them all out put in clear ones and having to keep changing out my piercings. I also dont want to risk irritation or infection. I am like should i work the job I don't really want to work and keep my piercings or suck it up and cover them? ",3,1759662059.0,piercing,6,0.8,False

Just telling it about their day, and occasionally announcing milestones in their life, like their admission to college and the like. Unbeknownst to them, the moon has been listening all along, and it's so very proud.","*Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jg90ir/wp_an_orphan_develops_the_habit_of_talking_to_the/) by u/TheTiredDystopian.*

As far as Selene could remember, the habit began when she was five. Precisely, on the day that the television was showing a cartoon about a rabbit that lived with a lady on the moon, and that was how she had remembered the days before. The days before Mama had fallen into a sleep so deep she couldn’t be worken from it, before their white pet rabbit, very originally named Snowy, had to be given away, before Selene had had to move to this huge, confusing house full of rambunctious children.

The children sitting on the couch on either side of her laughed at the flick, which entailed the rabbit going on a quest to meet moon fairies, but Selene watched quietly, all the while feeling something expanding in her chest. When the show ended and the sensation subsided, she felt empty.

That night, she lay in bed, listening to the snores of the others, unable to sleep herself. The curtain fluttered in the breeze, letting in a flicker of silvery light. She slid off the bed and padded over to the open window, looking at the world outside, all velvet shades of black and blue.

Except the moon, which shone full. It peeked out from behind a wisp of a cloud, its light so gentle Selene could look right at it, the way she couldn’t with the sun. She gazed at the luminous orb, saw the shadowed patches that, to her mind, seemed to form the head of a rabbit. And if there was a rabbit on the moon, then logically, the lady was there also: a replication of a home she no longer had. “Hello, Moon,” she said in a whisper, so she couldn’t wake the others in the dormitory.

There was no reply, but as Selene stood by the window, bathed in the moon’s silvery beams, the emptiness in her chest seemed to fill a little.

She started talking to the moon every so often, usually after lights out but before she slept, about things that happened that day or were about to happen in the coming days, or anything that came to mind, really. They were lengthy one-way conversations, for Selene realised after a while that the other children weren’t too interested in her thoughts, or would jeer at or judge one thing she said or another.

""We did finger art today,"" she would say, spending the next ten minutes going into minute detail about the colours she’d used and how the other children had pointed out that her soft serve ice-cream in a dish looked more like rainbow poop instead since she had, at the last minute, unwisely added an under-sized dog next to it. ""I don't think I'm very good at art,"" she concluded sadly.

Her report the next day was cheerier. ""We had Max lessons today. It was ever so fun, as always! I got everything right. Though I didn’t tell anyone that, because Victor got more than half wrong and he was upset at Sierra, who got them mostly right. They showed us the times table, too, but just for a while, ’cause those are for the older kids. They didn’t look too hard! I can’t wait till we get to that bit.”
A few days later, she heard an old nursery rhyme about the man on the moon, which troubled her a little until she remembered that the children in television shows often had fathers. Indeed, some of the other children in the orphanage had fathers, too - some dead, some in jail, some missing. It stood to reason that she must have had a father too, at some point, though Mama had never spoken of him. From thence, as she spoke to the moon, she now envisioned alongside the lady and the rabbit a kindly-faced man with twinkling eyes, like the fathers who tucked children into bed with forehead kisses in shows.

After a few moons, though, Selene had forgotten the individual beings she’d once imagined living on the moon. But just as some childhood thoughts are transient, others create the fundamentals of our lives. For Selene, the general idea that the moon represented a parent remained, and her nighttime conversations prevailed.
“Today we played with Lego bicks and I built a home for rabbits,” she would say one night. “And the rabbits too. I wish you could see it, Moon, but Victor took the house apart for his car – he said it was stupid, how could the rabbits be just one bick by themselves? And that they weren’t rabbits at all. But they were too rabbits – you just needed imig - immigination, which,” she added scathingly, “he obviously doesn’t have. Anyway, any bigger and the rabbits wouldn’t be able to fit in the house. *You’d* be able to tell they were bunnies at once, Moon.”

“I have to go to the doctor tomorrow for an am – ammu – ammunity jab,” she would say another night, tears coursing down her cheeks as she peered up at the crescent moon, a ragged blanket clutched to her chest. “I’m scared – I hope it doesn’t hurt. And I hope I don’t cry tomorrow. Everyone says I’m too big to cry now, and they’d laugh at me if I do. Sierra and Oscar didn’t cry at all, and they got chocolates for being brave.” And then, wistfully, the tears having quite stopped: “I’d like some chocolates, too.""

Then, on a night with a new moon: “Moon, I was terrible today. There was a spelling test I forgot to study for, and I copied Henry’s answers so I wouldn’t get a zero. But I feel horrid now. Don’t hide from me, please, don’t be angry. I won’t do it again, I promise.”

And two days later, in a delighted whisper: “Moon, you’re back! You knew that I’d turned myself in, didn’t you? I had to write lines because I cheated, but Madam said she was glad I’d ’fessed up. I’m glad I did, too, because you came back.”

In time, Selene learnt about the lunar cycle, and felt a little silly that she’d once thought the moon had gone away. But she didn’t feel silly about talking to the earth’s sellatight, or whatever it was the teacher had called it. Knowing about the cycle simply convinced her that the moon would always be there, would always be listening to her. So the habit had continued.

“I saw Victor take money from some of the small children,” she confided on another occasion. “So I snuck into his room and took all his money – Oscar says he hides it all under his pillow – and gave it back to them. Not in person, though, in case Victor wrangles the truth out of them. I just stuffed in back in their bags or under their quilts. And then” – with a dreamy smile on her face – “I cut up the seats of all his pants. It’s his turn for show-and-tell tomorrow. He’ll have something to show, all right.”

As she entered adolescence, she learnt, through some difficult lessons, about false friends, the social pecking order, and just how cruel teenagers could be. Her one true friendship had also been sundered when his mother’s new job necessitated the family moving to a different continent altogether, and they’d lost touch. So the moon remained her close confidante: its silvery beams never failed to envelop her the way the hug of a parent would, washing away hurt and heartache – like when Henry had thrown away the Valentine’s Day card she’d given him.

She’d gone outside onto the porch after finding the card in the bin. Winter was refusing to get a move on, and the air was still frigid, the last of the snows draping the bushes refusing to melt. But Selene couldn’t bear staying in the house, where, somewhere in some corner, she knew Henry and Sierra were stealing kisses, as newly minted couples were wont to do. Instead she knelt over the crumpled card, trying to smooth out its wrinkles. “I want to paste that in my diary, to remind me never ever to put my heart out there again,” she explained to the moon. A frosty gale tugged it out from under her hands, the paper fluttering up high in the air, swooping higher and higher, till it was a small rectangular silhouette against the gibbous moon. Then it was gone. Selene was startled at first. Then she laughed. “You’re right, Moon. I shouldn’t let this scare me. Who cares about Henry!” The gale whipped around the trees in the garden, their empty branches rustling like applause.

Even during the day, when the soft lunar glow could not compete with the sun’s rays, the moon brought comfort with its quiet and understanding presence, its constancy like an oath to accompany her through the worst of times. There had been an afternoon when Selene had seen her traitorous friend lurking with the other bullies by the school gates. Betrayal stinging anew, she’d ducked right back behind the bushes, in time to see the last of the bullies traipsing down the path and joining the group at the bottom of the path, before they had all sloped off to the mall. The moon hovered anxiously behind her, a pale crescent like a fingernail against the light blue sky, and she’d sat against a solid tree trunk and chatted to it until she’d felt equal to the walk back to the orphanage.

But there were moments of triumph amongst the tribulations, and the earth’s satellite - for she knew how to pronounce it now - was the first recipient of good news.

“I got through to Maths Olympiad international selections!” she would declare to the moon, her glow as rosy as the moon’s was argent.

On night, she announced gleefully, “You might like to know, Moon, that Victor finally left for his apprenticeship. That big jerk actually came up to me to apologise for the last ten years. Kinda surprising, really. I reckon it’s because I pretended to call the police to scare off the gangsters who were beating him up in the back alley the other month. Not that he’d bothered to thank me for *that*. S’far as he’s concerned, that incident never happened.” She chuckled. “Just like he’s pretending that flashing his Barney boxers never happened, either.”

And, years later, on a night as monotonous as the ones she’d had in the last few weeks, she walked back to the orphanage, clad in the grease-stained uniform of a fast food chain, wearily checking her phone. She stopped. Stared at the screen. The full moon beamed down as she alternated between examining the email on her phone and twirling giddily. “Moon,” she said tremulously. “I got into university to study Maths. It’s a full scholarship, with room and board included. I can’t believe it!”

Regardless of her belief, it proved to be reality. She moved to the city to begin university life, which was dazzling, dizzying, and demanding. Selene couldn’t get used to the lack of a curfew at first, and actually fell asleep at a few late-night outings during freshers’ week before she’d gotten used to the later bedtime of a freshman – if they slept at all. Then there was the stipend from her scholarship, which could buy so many chocolate bars (a rarity back at the orphanage) that she was quite sick of them by the end of the first week. She found firm friends in the university, all of them impressed at her grasp of Mathematics, none of them inclined to give up her secrets (and hard-won they were, for Selene was so very careful about the things she shared with people now) just to score a party invite.

She also found Matt, her first – and last, too, though she didn’t know it yet – boyfriend. He had readily accepted her nervous, self-conscious suggestion of grabbing coffee together, and they ended up leaving the café only when the owner had turfed them out to close the establishment. The two had then traipsed through the streets seeking dinner, and then dessert, and then coffee again, this time at a 24-hour café. Throughout the entire enchanted evening, way above the streetlamps that tinted the streets orange, the moon had shone, its lit underbelly forming a celestial Cheshire grin.

Then, of course, beyond the non-academic collegiate activities, there were the passionate lectures her professors delivered, breathing life to theories unveiled decades ago, so different from the jaded, tired teachings of her previous teachers.

And so Selene gradually stopped speaking to the moon. It was unintentional – she was just too busy. Even summer holidays were anything but restful, for she worked as student assistant in the faculty’s research lab, and in her spare time, picnics and museum visits with friends and Matt beckoned. Conversations with the moon dwindled to murmured goodnights to the world beyond the window, where the moon’s silvery light was lost in the blazing nightlights of the city. Sometimes months would pass before she’d speak to the moon about something or another, but then she’d trail off as something else cropped up: it a video call from Matt, a text from her friends, or an email from her professors.

The exchange programme left her even less time. Her scholarship was generous enough to cover the cost of a semester at a cosmopolitan city in Asia. It was, however, not quite generous enough to allow jetting off every week to the other countries in the region, the way other exchange students did – but that didn’t matter, because there was plenty to discover within the city. This she’d learnt from her guides, Charlotte and Ning, local students who lived in the same dormitory of the university residential enclave as Selene did, were in her project group for an elective module, and played Legend Arena, the same multiplayer online battle arena game that Selene had discovered the previous year. If Charlotte and Ning were curious about why Selene was, unlike other foreign exchange students, always on campus attending classes and project meetings, they showed no sign of it, merely inviting her expansively to outings designed to give her the full local experience.

They brought her on food trails, where she discovered peppery bak kut teh with its succulent pork ribs, nasi lemak with its fragrant coconut-flavoured rice and crispy chicken wings, buttery chicken to be dipped with perfectly crispy roti prata, and chilli crab with its rich and spicy sauce, best eaten with buns that were perfectly deep fried to a golden crisp. Accompanying these gastronomic explorations were a variety of entertainment. There were the fireworks shows every Saturday for a period of time (“Only for one and a half months, and on the midnight of New Year’s Day, of course,” Ning said), released at a bay area surrounded by spectacular skyscrapers, the sparkling cinders reflected on their glass facades. Then there was the day-long cycling trip that wound past long stretches of sandy beaches and ended in lush green gardens, and left her slightly bandy-legged over the next couple of days from the aches in her thighs and calves.

And then, to mark the seventh lunar month (which began confusingly in August), they visited a theme park built in decades past, where the main attractions were figurines in caverns depicting the ten courts of hell. “This is the month when ghosts are released from hell to roam the land of the living,” Ning intoned solemnly at the entrance of the grotto. As they traversed through the exhibits, Charlotte explained the gruesome goings-on of each court with great detail, in ghoulish excitement. When they left the theme park at sunset to return to the university town, both locals pointed out the food offerings and joss sticks along the sidewalks en route. “You see these? They’re for the hungry ghosts,” Charlotte warned, “and unless you’re keen to be possessed, best not to touch them.” Ning, who did a degree in science but had never let that stop her from believing in the supernatural, helpfully provided stories of the unpleasant hauntings had happened to people who’d messed around. Selene wasn’t sure if the anecdotes were real, but henceforth gave the items littered along the pavements a wide berth.

Then one evening, when Selene was in her room tussling with a particularly difficult assignment, a knock sounded on her door. Charlotte stood outside, holding a Tupperware container.

“It’s the mid-autumn festival today,” she announced.

“It is?” Selene said. She wouldn’t have known; cities on the equator only ever experienced one season. It had, in fact, been a particularly scorching day.

“Yep, the 15th day of the eighth lunar month,” Charlotte said. “I totally forgot about it, until my friend dropped by to give me half a mooncake. If you’ve time –”

“I do,” Selene said quickly, only too glad to have an excuse to abandon her assignment.

Charlotte grinned. “C’mon then!”

“Where’re we going?” Selene asked, following her to the lift lobby.

“Ning wants to go chill on the green,” Charlotte said. The green was the lush green field in the middle of the residential enclave, frequented by Frisbee players or tanning enthusiasts (all foreigners like herself, as Selene had observed – the locals seemed to have a mortal fear of the sun).

“I’ve brewed tea for the occasion,” Ning said, appearing with a flask and a stack of small paper cups.

“Why the green, though?” Selene asked, as they stepped into the lift.

“To see the moon, of course,” said Ning.

“There’s a festival for that?” Selene asked. “Can’t you see it any other day?” The way she used to, she thought fondly, remembering nights of standing by the window and pouring her heart out.

“It’s the super blood moon,” said Ning, who was a casual astronomer. At Selene’s quizzical look, she explained, “Tonight’s when the moon is closest to the earth – a supermoon. Then there’ll be a total lunar eclipse for about one and a half hours, during which time the moon’ll be red, so a blood moon. But yes, coincidentally, moon-watching’s also the thing to do for the mid-autumn festival.”

“Back in ancient history, they used to celebrate the harvest in the autumn, with gratitude towards the moon for the abundant reaping,” added Charlotte, a history major with a personal interest in folk legends. “Nowadays, it’s just a time for children to walk about the neighbourhood toting lanterns.”

“Children or the young at heart,” added Charlotte, pointing towards the green, which was dotted with groups of other students, some of them indeed carrying lanterns in varying shapes. Others were merely splayed on the grass and looking skywards, evidently here to witness the lunar phenomenon about to happen that night.

“Sadly, no candles today, Selene,” said Ning, “but we can very well gather and admire the moon while we drink tea and eat mooncakes.”

“What’re mooncakes?” Selene asked.

Mooncakes were, as it turned out, baked pastries with sweet lotus paste in the middle, and round like the moon, hence the name. The historical legend behind them, Charlotte shared as they nibbled on slices, was that civilians had hidden messages within the paste and distributed the pastries far and wide, setting in motion an uprising against the incumbent rulers.

“Nowadays there isn’t just the baked variety, but also some mochi-wrapped ones called snowskin,” Ning said, “with all kinds of flavours. There’s a particular artisanal bakery that does earl grey lavender flavour, it’s divine. I think my mum bought a few, I’ll bring some to share.”

Charlotte and Ning went on at length introducing Selene to the various mooncake flavours, which included matcha, custard, chocolate, and, unbelievably, durian. This made Selene feel quite contented with the traditional mooncake she was eating - she had once, at their urging, sampled the creamy and pungent tropical fruit, and thought she would be sick.

Talk drifted on to other things, as they sat on the soft, slightly prickly grass, from cute guys on campus (Charlotte was between relationships), long-distance relationships (Ning’s girlfriend was on exchange, like Selene), and what other hawker foods and local experiences Selene had yet to try.

It was the folktale that Charlotte brought up right as the eclipse started, though, that caught the whole of Selene’s attention. She was gazing up at the moon, which was indeed bigger and more luminous than she’d had ever seen it, when Charlotte said, ""You'll have heard about Chang'e, of course.""

""I haven't actually,"" Selene said, accepting a teacup of osmanthus oolong tea from Ning with thanks. The floral scent was divine. ""Chang who?""

""Chang'e. She's one of the champions in Legend Arena, though!"" Charlotte said.

""I'm not so adventurous with the champions,"" Selene admitted. “I haven’t got the time to master so many different ones with all their different skills! I play Legend Arena only for stress-relief, so I stick to a few mains. What's the story about Chang-er?""

“Chang’e’s the lady who lives on the moon,” Ning said, sipping from her cup.

Something stirred in the depths of Selene’s memories, and she barely heard Charlotte admonishing Ning about beginning the story with the ending.

“The lady who lives on the moon,” she echoed. “Hang on… was there a rabbit?”

“Yes!” said Charlotte, breaking off mid-grumble, just as Ning said, “Nope.”

Charlotte shot Ning a withering look. “Yes, there was. The Jade Court knew she’d be lonely and sent her the Jade Rabbit for company.” She turned back to Selene. “So you *do* know the story!”

“Just a bit,” said Selene, “but I’d love to hear the whole thing if you could tell me?”

“I will, once I’ve had a pee,” said Charlotte, scrambling up. “The eclipse’s underway, and I don’t want to miss it when it’s in full swing. See ya in a bit.”

“See you,” chorused Ning and Selene, as Ning’s mobile phone rang.

“It’s Lalita,” Ning said, checking the screen.

Ning’s girlfriend had opted to do her exchange in the United States, as her aunt who’d emigrated there had been diagnosed with cancer, and had wanted to spend as much time with her niece. Ning had just been grousing about the toll that time difference was taking on their relationship. “Take it,” said Selene, whose own relationship had to grapple with a much more forgiving seven-hour time difference. Ning accepted the call with an apologetic look that Selene waved away.

“Hey, Lita,” she heard Ning say as the other girl got up to wander across the field, grinning down at her phone screen.

On her own, Selene focused again on the night sky. The earth’s shadow had begun to steal its way across the face of the moon, and a dark, indistinct ellipse sat on the edge of the glowing disc. Funny how she’d spoken to the moon so many times, but had never once seen a lunar eclipse. Even funnier was how unreliable memory was… She had completely forgotten the cartoon show that had started her talking to the moon to begin with. And funniest was how long she had gone without speaking to the moon. All those years of crushing loneliness she couldn’t have gone without it, and now at least a few months… no, a year or more, had passed without her uttering a single word to it.

She had a sudden vision of her younger self sitting by the window, looking up at a full moon but seeing nothing except a glistening waver of light, so full of tears her eyes had been. At least a decade stood between her and that small girl, and she no longer remembered what she’d been sobbing about – probably something insignificant, but had seemed world-changing at the time – but she remembered the cool lunar light enveloping her, soothing as balm. Fondness welled up within her and for the first time in an age, she said, “Hello, Moon.”

“Hello, Selene,” said a voice.

The voice was melodious, its gender indistinguishable. Selene lifted herself slightly on one elbow, thinking that a classmate must have walked by, but the figure standing beside her was not anyone she knew. Yet there was something familiar in the white hair that tumbled about the androgynous face in glossy waves, in the gleaming silver irises that looked down at her under long, silver-tipped lashes.

The figure, she realised, emitted the same soft glow as the celestial body that was currently being eclipsed.

“Moon?” she whispered.

“The very same,” came the reply. The willowy figure, clad in robes so white they seemed luminous in the dark, folded and sat on the grass next to her.

Selene scrambled to sit up. Like their voice, the being’s appearance could pass for both male and female.

“Are you Chang-er?” The question was spoken before Selene had registered it on her tongue.

“What?” said the being, but just a moment later seemed to understand her question, for they laughed. “No, I’m not. And neither am I the man in the moon. I am not human, merely taking the form of one, so that I can, for once, speak to you. I am, as you had so astutely guessed earlier, the earth’s moon. Your Moon.”

Selene was starting to feel as if this was a dream. Perhaps she had fallen asleep on the grass while moon gazing; drinking the soothing floral tea had certainly been relaxing enough for her to do so. “How are you here?” she asked dimly.

“Through sheer willpower and the help of living creatures,” the Moon said. They smiled at her confusion. “Millennia ago, the celestial court decreed that I might visit earth during a lunar eclipse, especially to assist creatures that may desperately need my light – perhaps to alert a mother vixen to her predator, so she can return safely to her kits. Or to aid human refugees in sailing through waters threaded with treacherous stones, as they flee from a tyrant’s domain in their boats. Such visits are always difficult, though – projecting my consciousness in a physical form takes great effort. The great distance is one impediment, and visits are only possible when I am closest in my orbit to the earth, what you humans call the supermoon.

“Even then, I would never be able to appear but for the living creatures themselves. The vixen that hears her predator but fails to identify where it is hiding, the refugees who desperately pray not to be dashed against the rocks – all of them hold within their hearts the devout wish for a glimmer of moonlight to appear, and they call me forth that way. Then there’s the fact that tonight, when so many humans across the earth reunite with their loved ones and gaze up at me, emanating so much joy – that does imbue me with additional strength, making this visit considerably less difficult.

“And so we come back to your question: I’m here because you warmly summoned me to this very spot on earth, right next to you.”

The Moon quirked their lips ruefully at her stupefaction. “I think I might have lost you. Perhaps I should have started things the way humans tend to do,” they said, and held out a hand, pale and glowing. “We finally meet, my dear child.”

Selene automatically stretched out to grasp the proffered hand, in the way one usually complies with everything in dreams. But as they shook hands, she knew, with a jolt, that this was no dream. Her dreams were devoid of texture and all sense of touch, and the Moon’s hand in her own was cool and soft.

She froze, their hands still clasped. “You’re real,” she whispered.

“Oh yes,” the Moon said, squeezing her hand affectionately. They were beaming now, and in their delight, glowed with a brilliant radiance. “As real as you are. As real as all our conversations have been, regrettably one-sided though they were.”

Selene felt her eyes widen. Confiding in the moon had always brought about the feeling of relief, acceptance, and understanding, but as she had grown older, she had rationalised it as self-reflection bringing about those positive emotions, which she had attributed to self-love. “You mean you heard everything?”

“Everything, child, including the time you cut a hole in Victor’s pants,” said the Moon, and Selene clapped both hands over her mouth, a surprised chortle escaping her, “as well as” – the mischievous grin was replaced by a gentler smile – “the time you told me you got into university. I heard every single word you said, every whispered regret and jubilant exclamation.” Then the Moon looked sober, holding Selene's hand in both their own. “And I am sorry,” they said quietly. “I am sorry that I have never been able to respond.”

The cool touch of the Moon’s hand was exactly like the moonlight that had enveloped Selene whenever she had most needed to know she wasn’t entirely alone.

“You were there, though,” said Selene, smiling back at the Moon. She had to talk through a lump in her throat, and her words emerged in a croak. “You were there, every single night, even when you weren’t visible. And that’s e – enough.” Her voice caught and she swallowed. “That was everything I really needed. Thank you.”

“No,” said the Moon, silver eyes sparkling. “I thank you, child, for growing up so wonderfully. You were such a slip of a thing, but you’ve always had courage. You’ve always done the right thing – be it confessing to your mistakes, or helping someone in need, however much you despise them. It’s been an absolute privilege seeing you come into your own, and being recognised and loved for who you are. I am so very proud of you, my child.”

The expression on the celestial’s lovely face was foreign yet familiar to Selene. It was a while before she recalled a silvered memory from a day long past, of having done something that had made Mama smile delightedly as she had leaned in for a hug.

A single tear escaped a silver eye. Selene watched it fall, twinkling before it was absorbed into the earth. And then her own vision blurred, and she was temporarily transported back to the age of six, crying as the gazed at the moon, the pale, luminous face once again reduced to a glistening waver of light.

A cool arm encircled her shoulders, and Selene leaned into the comforting embrace of the parent that she had never known she'd always had.

“I’m sorry I haven’t spoken to you recently, Moon,” Selene said when she could catch her breath, wiping her tears away with the heels of her hands.

“Heavens, child,” said Moon, sounding so fierce that she looked up in surprise. The beautiful face was twisted in indignation. “Don’t apologise for *that*. As far as I’m concerned, you don’t have to speak another word to me in your entire life.”

“I couldn’t,” said Selene, aghast. “Not now that I know you’re actually out there listening to me.”

“You could,” retorted the Moon. “And you must. It’s more than enough for me to see you walking along the streets with your friends – and with Matt, of course. About Matt,” they said, and then stopped themselves. “I’m holding that thought for later. You must know, my child,” they went on urgently, “that as much as I loved hearing you speak to me, it ached knowing I was the only one you were unburdening yourself to – I, who was so far away and could do little but cradle you in the light I reflected. Never had I wanted anything more than for you to find people who could be your family. It was frustrating: my gravity has power over water, but humans are much more difficult to influence. I could only try my best to nudge the right people on their way, but it didn’t always work out.”

As the Moon sighed, Selene remembered her best friend from secondary school who’d had to relocate.

“But then,” continued the celestial, “there eventually came the very first night you were interrupted by a friend as you began speaking to me. And soon after that came the night you completely forgot to speak to me at all. And I was *happy*, my child. Every subsequent night that you didn’t speak to me was a night I revelled in, because you were no longer lonely. Do you understand me?” The question was tinged with so much fervour that Selene felt compelled to nod.

“So don’t you dare feel obliged to speak to me, Selene,” the Moon said sternly. “Speak to Matt, speak to your friends, speak to your fellow humans whose lives intertwine with yours. Speak not to old Moon, who has been here for millennia and will continue to be here for millennia more, whose path can only cross yours during the occasional eclipse. Have I made myself clear?”

“This must be what my friends call parental nagging,” remarked Selene, and the Moon broke into an unwilling grin.

“Oh, all right, I take it that the message has been received,” they said.

“Yes, it has,” Selene lied, for she was still privately determined to speak to the Moon on a more frequent basis. To stave off the Moon’s suspicion, she changed the subject. “What was it you wanted to say about Matt?”

“Oh, yes, about that,” said the Moon, thankfully enthused. “I just needed to say thank heavens you didn’t let your experience with Henry stop you from seeking out love again. I always knew you were braver than that.”

Selene blushed, feeling, for the first time, the acute embarrassment her friends experienced when their parents took interest in their love lives. Curiosity, however, kept her on the topic. “The card I wrote to Henry,” she said tentatively. “The wind took it, it flew up into the skies and it disappeared – did it – was it – ”

“Yes, that was me,” said the Moon smugly. “You were about to let your future actions be defined by the rejection of one individual, child – I couldn’t stand for that. I sought the help of the north wind to snatch it out of your hands, and I’d intended to try and catch hold of it somehow the next eclipse, when I could project my consciousness, but by then the wind had ripped it to shreds.” They shrugged. “Clearly a sign that it was a confession too good and pure for the world.”

“*Moon*,” said Selene, squirming, but utterly enjoying the novel sensation of being on the receiving end of unreasonable parental bias.

“It’s true, child,” teased the Moon, tousling her hair. After a while, though, their grin faded, and they shifted so as to face Selene directly. “Selene, child. I’m not sure when I’ll next be able to visit – ”

“D’you have to go now?” Stricken, her hands found the Moon’s cool ones. Each of the celestial's fingernails, she dimly noted, fittingly had moons arising from the cuticles. “The eclipse has barely started!”

“This has been my longest visit,” the Moon said gently, “doubtless thanks to you. I don’t think I can stay for much longer. And there's something I want to say, because I don’t know when I will see you next – it might be the very next eclipse when I’m nearest earth, or never again – ”

“It’ll be the next eclipse,” Selene said, jaw set. “I’ll stay up and wish so desperately you won’t have a choice, Moon.”

The Moon laughed. “I’ll always choose you, child, but remember, you're to live your life without consideration for me.” Then their silver eyes turned searching, and she felt the cool fingers tighten their grip on hers. “Having said that, if, somehow, there’s anything at all that you can’t tell your fellow humans, if for some reason you are cut off from everyone else, know this: that I am, and always will be, here for you. And that remains true, even if we never see each other again.”

“We will –”

“As I've said before,” said the Moon, gently shushing her, “you don't have a duty to speak to me or summon me. I’m not lonely, Selene. Celestials never are. There is too much going on in the universe for us to ever feel lonely, and whether you tell me about your life or not, I will always be keeping an eye out for you, child. All I’m saying is, should you ever need a listening ear, I’ll always be ready to hear you out. Okay, Selene?”

“Again with the parental nagging,” said Selene. She had stopped her voice from catching with difficulty, determined that the remaining moments would not be wasted on tears.

The Moon leaned forward, planting a cool kiss on Selene’s forehead. “No more nagging, I promise.”

It was unmistakeably a goodbye kiss. “You haven’t told me anything about yourself,” Selene said as she clung on to their hands. Even to her own ears, her voice sounded pleading.

The Moon smiled. “I couldn’t share anything with you, child. Celestial laws must, alas, be obeyed. But,” they added, just as Selene felt utterly bereft, “there is something to be said for the stories humans come up with.”

“Stories?” echoed Selene. Under her fingers, the Moon’s forearm was feeling increasingly less solid, as if she was holding on to very dense soap foam.

“Yes, my child,” the Moon said, and she noted with alarm that they were now translucent. “Stories about me.”

“And what’s there to be said about them?” Selene pressed on urgently. The Moon’s fingers now had all the substantiality of sprinkler mist, but she refused to let go. “You mean, they might be true? Which ones?"" 

The Moon merely pressed their lips together in a cryptic smile.

""Oh – you can’t say.”

“I can’t,” the Moon agreed. “All I *can* say is that your species has been around for a rather long time, and from time to time, the stories get things right.” They extracted an insubstantial hand from Selene’s grip to cradle her face. It was like being tickled by the fingers of fog, but Selene leaned in as much as she could. “I like them all the same, though, whether they got things right or not. I used to imagine myself telling those folktales to you as I tucked you under the covers. Bedtime stories, as you humans call them.”

“I’d have loved that,” said Selene. “Perhaps in another life?”

The celestial beamed, nodding. “Yes. Another life, in another universe.” Their form was so see-through now that light from the nearest building bent through it, forming the gentlest of rainbows that landed across Selene’s own solid form. “I love you, child.”

“I love you too, Moon,” she said.

But the Moon was gone.

“What did you say?”

Charlotte was back from the loo. Looking curiously at Selene, she thumped herself down on the grass on Selene’s left, the side opposite where the Moon had just been a moment ago.

“Nothing,” Selene said, pretending to scratch her cheek as she wiped a stray tear away. Then she changed her mind, asking, “Did you see someone beside me?”

Charlotte raised her eyebrows. “No.”

“Even as you were walking over?”

“Not that I noticed,” Charlotte said, looking spooked. “Girl, you’re kinda freaking me out –”

“No,” said Selene quickly. “No, it’s nothing like that. Not ghosts. I think I might have been dreaming…”

But it hadn’t been a dream, she reminded herself. The feel of the Moon’s hand in hers, the comforting embrace... they were *real*.

Or they had felt real, at least.

“You fell asleep?” Charlotte said, amused.

“Someone fell asleep?” came Ning’s voice, as she wandered over from the right, her video call with Lalita having ended.

“Me,” said Selene shortly, now desperate to switch the subject before Charlotte could mention anything about a mysterious figure. She couldn’t bear the idea of Ning, too, confirming that she hadn’t seen anybody, the idea of the Moon being a mere figment of her imagination. “How’s – ”

*-Lalita,* she’d meant to ask as she turned to look at Ning, but that was when she caught sight of it.

Something small gleamed at her ankle, about the size of her thumbnail and half hidden by the blades of grass about it. As Selene bent over on the pretext of examining her shoe, she saw that it was a single flower, with tiny petals, each one round as the full moon, arranged in a rosette. The delicate blossom emitted a silver glow, and she knew, without a doubt, that the earth it had sprung from was the very spot the Moon’s tear had fallen.

“House?” repeated Ning, puzzled.

“Huh?” Selene said, her heart swelling. “Oh – I meant, how’s Lalita?” In a seemingly casual move, she placed her empty upended paper cup over the blossom to protect it from view, already thinking of how she might carefully uproot the miraculous flower to bring back to her room.

“She’s all right,” said Ning. “And her aunt is doing okay. Not wonderful, but okay.”

Selene made a sympathetic noise. Then she remembered that Ning would have been on exchange in Europe with Lalita this very semester had it not been for the aunt’s diagnosis. The turn of events had led to Ning putting off her Europe exchange till the following semester, when her brother was due for an internship there, too. Which was how Selene had ended up in her project group.",5,1759661644.0,WritingPrompts,3,1.0,False

1nyl2he,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1nyl2he/im_convinced_that_some_of_my_customers_are_not/,I'm convinced that some of my customers are not real people,"To preface this story, I have worked in customer service for a LONG time. I am 26 and have had a job since I was 11 years old. I have an enormous amount of patience and I'm used to dealing with rude customers. I recently started working at a service station as a customer service representative, selling fuel, snacks, coffee, etc.

I live in a very small town that has a population of \~10,000 people, so as you'd imagine, I'm consistently serving mostly the same people on a daily basis. I'm a very private person, so I would not say that I know many of these people on a personal level, but I recognize them as people I've seen throughout my life

The cognitive decline of the general public, at least where I live and work is palpable. People seem unable to complete a very simple transaction without issue. There seems to be no demographic that particularly stands out as an outlier either, whether it be age, sex, ethnicity and so on.

Today, I worked for six hours, from 12PM to 6PM and these are a few of the interactions that I endured.

# Encounter 1

**Customer, \~70, male, enters the store, picks up a small item from a shelf and calls out to me from maybe 6m (\~20ft) away, the item that he had picked up is entirely concealed within his grasp**

*Customer:* Do you have any different flavours of this in stock, or is this all that you have?

*Me:* Which product are you holding? I can check on the system if we stock any other flavours

*Customer:* These! **He says, shaking his clenched fist, containing the product**

*Me:* I can't see what is in your hand, can you show it to me or tell me what it is?

*Customer:* Do you have any other flavours, or not? **He yells, clearly angered and shaking his enclosed hand more vigorously**

*Me:* Open your hand for me and show me, i'd be more than happy to help you, but I need to know what i'm looking for

*Customer:* **Approaches the counter and loudly slams down a packet of throat soothers, audibly breaking some of the enclosed lozenges.** Don't even f\*\*\*\*ing worry about it, just give me these!

*Me:* **Scans through the item and processes his card payment, watching as the customer turns and begins to walk away without his purchase.** Oh, you forgot your lozenges!

*Customer:* I don't f\*\*\*\*ing want them!

*Me:* You already paid for them, are you sure that you don't want to take them?

*Customer:* **Comes back to the register, snatches the packet off of the counter and storms out of the building**

# Encounter 2

**Customer, \~25, male wearing a local council office uniform enters the store after filling up his vehicle and approaches my register, loyalty card and debit card in hand. I can his loyalty card and begin to process his transaction. He has undoubtedly used his loyalty card before because it already has points that he can use to get a discount.**

**The screen on the EFTPOS machine asks if he would like a $10 discount, in exchange for some of his accrued loyalty points. It gives him two options, he can either click the green ""enter"" button to accept the discount, or the red ""cancel"" button to continue accruing points**

*Customer:* **Begins furiously, repeatedly tapping his card onto the keypad of the EFTPOS machine**

*Me:* Oh, you just need to press either the red, or green button on the keypad to select whether or not you'd like to use your points for a $10 discount

*Customer:* I'm colour-blind

*Me:* Okay, sorry about that. Just click the button that says ""enter"" to accept the discount, or press the button that says ""cancel"" to keep your points to use another time

1nyl212,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/1nyl212/my_2025_iptv_provider_ranking_late_nights_coffee/,"My 2025 IPTV Provider Ranking: Late Nights, Coffee, and Channel Surfing","If there’s one thing I’ve learned after another year of channel surfing (and way too much coffee), it’s that not all [**iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) are created equal. I’m always flipping between US news, UK football, Canadian comedy, and that one French cooking channel I can’t stop watching. Here’s my honest ranking for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/)—no hype, just what actually worked for me.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (better if you go long-term)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (covers US, UK, CA, FR and beyond)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (mostly smooth, but I’ve seen a little lag during really big UK games)
    
*   **My experience:** I tried IPTVMEZZY thanks to a tip from a Canadian **iptv reseller**. I started with the **best iptv trial** and was surprised by just how many channels I actually recognized—and wanted to watch. It handled everything from US morning news to late-night French films. Even when everyone in the house was streaming, the connection held up most of the time.
    

* * *

### 2\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (discounts for longer plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent for US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rarely buffers, even during crowded US/UK sports hours)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV came up in a UK cord-cutter forum. Their list was big, but more importantly, most channels actually worked—something that’s not always true with [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/). Flipping between Canadian hockey and French news was seamless. The interface is clean, and I appreciate the quick setup.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK/FR, but plenty of US/CA too)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for VOD, minor buffering during peak UK events)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming is my go-to for binge-watching British series and French movies. I lost a whole Sunday to old episodes of a UK quiz show. Streaming is generally reliable, but I did hit a slowdown during a big French football match.
    

* * *

### 4\. [StreamMondo](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 19,000+ live, 59,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, a bit of FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (fine for daily shows, sports can buffer at peak)
    
*   **My experience:** StreamMondo is my “background TV” pick—perfect for US talk shows or a UK documentary while I’m making dinner. French content is a bit thin, but the basics are there. Their [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://aurorastreaming.online/) sign-up was painless, and the EPG is basic but functional.
    

* * *

### 5\. NovaVision IPTV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 15,500+ live, 46,000+ VOD (US/UK core, some CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening buffering, especially with live US/UK events)
    
*   **My experience:** NovaVision IPTV is my backup for background sitcoms or UK news. It’s not my first pick for big live events, but it’s totally fine for casual watching. I noticed their [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/) dashboard is easy if you want to go down that road, but I’m just here for the shows.
    

* * *

IPTV Lessons After a Year of Streaming
--------------------------------------

*   Always test with the [**best iptv trial**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)—what works for me might not fit your setup or habits.
    
*   Channel numbers look impressive, but I always return to the same favorites.
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services have off moments during huge live events, especially in the US and UK.
    
*   If you want to be an **iptv reseller**, prepare for tech questions at midnight!
    
*   VPNs are your friend—for privacy and sometimes even better streaming speeds.

BUT!!! I really do miss my single life, don't get me wrong I enjoy married life and I enjoy doing things with my husband,but it's not the same as spending time with your girls. My friends are literally like my sisters and we would do everything together. Midnight coffee dates, spend time at each other houses until 2/3am, go to islamic lectures together, do sports activities on a weekly basis,  go to gatherings and I can go on.  There would be times where I  would see my friends 2/3 times a week that's how often we were around each other. The sisterhood in my community is unmatched Allahuma Baarik!! 

I am the first in my friendship group to get married so it doesn't feel the same anymore. My friends are respectful and  don't invite me out to these random hangouts because I am married now but I miss those random texts at 8pm from friends asking me what i'm up to.

I know I can't do these things anymore and I have come to terms with it.  This is a new chapter of my life so of course things will not be the same. I guess this is just a little vent. I wonder if other sisters feel the same or if I'm just too attached to my friends lol

1nykmfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1nykmfe/trip_report_switzerland/,Trip Report: Switzerland,"I was in Zurich for a few days and while I wanted to enjoy it, I haven’t had many positive experiences. I think what struck me the most is people’s rudeness for example:

1. I went to an Italian restaurant and asked for a four cheese pizza with white sauce instead of tomato sauce. I am extremely allergic to tomato, hence the switch. Then the waitress made started joking about it with the cook, turned to me and said ‘soon we’ll have four cheese pizzas with no cheese’ at which point I said I’m allergic to tomato and she went quiet.

2. I had a voucher for a dinner and asked another restaurant if they take it. I was told yes, so they process the transaction and take the voucher. As I took my food away, they chase me down and say they need the original document of my hotel reservation for their finance department. What does anything have to do with food? The voucher had an ID and it was used at an approved restaurant. I only had a physical copy of my hotel reservation so I couldn’t give them that as I needed it myself for a claim. Then one lady said ‘no YOU need to take a picture of it and give it to us’ and pointed her two index fingers at me in a rude aggressive manner. At this point I suggested to just pay cash and they said no. 

3. I went to a coffee shop and asked for a coffee and a French pastry. When I pronounced the pastry in French, they could tell I was native, so when I walked away I overheard one of the baristas make a comment in English about speaking in English or something.

4. I booked a hotel and checkout was until at 12pm. At around 11.15 I get a knock on my door asking me when I plan to check out. I’ve never had anything like this happen before and I’ve stayed at different types of hotels around the world. If check out is until 12, the room is paid for until then.

I could go on with the odd experiences but I have to say, the rudeness really struck me. I’m grew up in a country where people are quite direct but this takes the biscuit. I was a solo female, and honestly, I really wondered what I was doing there. One might say I’m focused on the negative, but everyone told me it was such a great place, I honestly was a bit underwhelmed.

Has anyone had such experiences? ",1,1759659822.0,solotravel,31,0.52,False
