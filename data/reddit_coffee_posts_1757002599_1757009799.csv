I know its pretty ambitious but really hoping to see at least part of the Westfjords. Also planning to sleep in my car on campgrounds throughout the trip to save time.

**Day 1 (Tuesday): Arrival → South Coast**

* **Land:** Keflavík 9:30 AM → pick up car
* Drive straight east on Ring Road.
* **Stops:**
   * Seljalandsfoss & Gljúfrabúi
   * Skógafoss
   * Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach & Dyrhólaey Arch
* **Driving:** \~260 km / \~3.5–4 hrs.

# Day 2 (Wednesday): South Coast → Southeast

* **Highlights:**
   * Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon
   * Skaftafell: Svartifoss waterfall hike (\~1.5 hrs roundtrip)
   * Fjallsárlón Glacier Lagoon
   * Jökulsárlón & Diamond Beach (sunset here is fantastic)
* **Driving:** \~280 km / \~4 hrs.

# Day 3 (Thursday): Southeast → North Iceland

* Drive through the East Fjords
* Quick stops for viewpoints (Stokksnes if weather is clear).
* Continue to Mývatn area.
* **Driving:** \~430–470 km / \~6–6.5 hrs.

# Day 4 (Friday): North Iceland → Westfjords Approach

Is this doable or do you recommend sticking to just the ring road? I dont mind driving long distances daily but i also want to be able to do at least 2 or 3 longer hikes (anywhere with scenery). Also, is it worth spending more time in the eastfjords but skipping the westfjords or the other way around?",1,1757009558.0,VisitingIceland,1,1.0,False

She has multiple credit cards maxed out and she just signed up for another one. Every weekend she goes out to parties, buys expensive dresses, and eats at fancy restaurants. Sometimes she even tries to pressure me to join her, but I’ve learned my lesson from my previous roommate and I just don’t. I like going out sometimes, but I can’t spend money I don’t have.

It’s hard living with her because she doesn’t listen when I tell her to slow down. I’ve tried talking to her multiple times about not spending so much and not going to so many parties, but she just ignores me. She even complains if I don’t come along sometimes, which can be stressful.

I’ve been careful with my own money. I use debit cards that build credit instead of credit cards. That way I am only spending money I actually have, but I am still slowly building my credit for future things like renting an apartment or buying a car. It has been working really well for me. I cook my own meals, make coffee at home, and walk to campus instead of paying for rides. I also keep track of what I spend and save a little every month.

Living with her has taught me a lot about managing money and setting boundaries. I’ve realized I can’t control her choices, and I have to focus on what works for me. I try to stay patient, keep my own habits, and not let her lifestyle stress me out too much.

No matter what I do he just is refusing to nap. It takes him legitimately 2-3 hours of just laying in bed with his constant getting up out of bed and grabbing everything he shouldn't be (toys, books, etc) 

And before anyone says maybe he's done with naps I wish it was that easy.... Because he is the same at bed time. He fights it so so so much. My husband and I spoke with his pediatrician about this and she suggested giving him melatonin to help with sleeping at night, but I know he shouldn't have that every day. And if that doesn't work to sit in there until he falls asleep (but firstly that's not realistic because I have an 8 month old as well who needs us but also if were sitting in there he thinks it's play time. I don't know how or what I can do to make him sleep better or in general. Well give him a bubba(cup) of milk, binky, and put him to bed. 

Even if he does fall asleep around his normal 8-8:30 time frame he's awake anywhere between 11pm-2am and then will be up for 3 hours before falling back asleep and then still wake up at 7/8am.

I think they've fully or partially switched owners since then, but the quality of drinks and sense of community has only gotten stronger with time. They do various fundraisers for the local community, as well as for Palestine relief.

I tried as many pumpkin spice lattes as I could last fall and I can confidently say WhereUBean's Pumpkin Pie latte is hands down the best (Caffe Vita's is a close second and WeBe's was solid, too). I tried to get one this morning and they were sold out so I tried Figment in Thyme latte, which is a thyme latte with a mascarpone fig cold foam, and holy cow this is the best original drink I've had in years. Everywhere these days has a strawberry matcha, or a pistachio rose latte, or some uninventive espresso tonic, but this is actually a unique and tasty drink.

She works out of her home & asked me to do a trade for my services with hers. I did my part in mid-July and before then we had a couple exchanges the year prior when I bought items from her, but these were entirely transactional. I have not been ""paid"" yet for my part. During the session I did for her she sort of unloaded some personal things on me and this has happened with others in the past, so l usually just listen and validate so the person feels heard. I guess this opened the door for this situation.


She proceeded to start calling me for ""quick chats"" that lasted upwards of 45 mins multiple times per week and also texted almost immediately after the session. It was always her complaining about customers, her health issues, among other things.. but always complaints and essentially just her talking at me. Very one-sided and monologue-y.


She is nearly 40, childless, and single. She keeps pretty busy with her home business but being she is self emplayed has time to essentially chat whenever she feels like it. I have my SO and 3 kids- one of whom is 7 months old. I work full time Mon-Fri and have my side gig which often takes up at least 5-10 extra hours of my week. My older kids have extra curriculars. My family lives in town and I visit them often. I have my group of friends already & don't have a desire to make ""new friends"" and I certainly don't want to talk to anyone on phone calls. It ties me down and my baby needs my attention pretty much anytime she's awake (which is all the time) so it's not ideal. With text I can at least ignore them until I have time to chat. But she keeps calling and texting literal novels and always about the same complain-y bs. I've had to tell her I can only text during my work breaks be we can't have our phones out. She's called when I'm making dinner for my family or bathing my LO and even asked ""what's going on over there"" when she heard my baby crying over the phone bc she'd been talking for over an hour & my SO couldn't get her to settle down bc she wanted to nurse. so it's like she's clueless as to what a family unit functions like..


I talked to my therapist and she told me to just ignore the calls as often as possible & to take forever to text back and this chick will realize I'm not the one to chat to. I really hope this works but so far, it hasn't. This chick also isn't the type to take me being direct well.. like if I said ""hey I don't want to take your calls"" she'd be heavily offended and I don't want to create an issue bc we both have a similar customer base (for her home business & my side gig) and I just really don't want to muddy the water. But I'm so annoyed. On top of that, she has asked to borrow money from THREE times since mid-July (when this all started). I'm sorry but I work hard for my money and I have 3 kids to feed. I also barely know this person., like literally not even 2 full months.


She clearly needs a therapist and is lonely working out of her home 24/7 but I am just so frustrated that she latched onto me and considers me a friend. She does talk to others, as she's mentioned that, so I'm wondering if she spends days going thru her rolodex of people. We don't hang out, either, thank God. Before the calls started I had casually mentioned I'd be down for coffee sometime to be nice but I hope that time never comes - and maybe she forgot.

1n8hkyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1n8hkyo/job_hunting_preferences_unacceptable_to_h/,Job hunting preferences unacceptable to H,"Sorry about the extremely long post :(

I'm a grad student (28F) who will enter the job market later this year and my husband is a working professional (40M). I have the option to go into academia but I don't enjoy it enough to do it all my life. To begin my soft job search and begin networking, I've been talking to people in International Organizations and Consulting. I will also consider regular Industry but thats my third priority. Yesterday, I mentioned that the top consulting firms have some of their applications due this month. I think I had floated the idea of me looking into consulting before but now I can't remember to what extent. Anyway, yesterday my husband exclaimed: consulting requires a lot of travel so am I really going to apply?

In my head, I wasn't looking into consulting because of the travel. I also wouldn't want the job if it was anywhere more than 25-30% travel because that'd tire me out and I'd fail to perform at work. But with a little bit of travel and mostly local projects, I would be happy with a consulting job. My husband and I had a long discussion about this yesterday where I tried to figure out exactly what was the wrong thing here. I swore to him that I wouldn't take a job that was more than ~20ish percent travel if he's not ok with it even if the alternative was being jobless (previously, I was thinking if those are the only offers I got, I should accept them).

The conclusion was that he finds it extremely unsettling that I would even consider a job that would take me to a different city half the time. He thinks that's a betrayal to our relationship (we're otherwise an extremely loving couple and have even gotten compliments from strangers about our apparent chemistry). I tried to tell him yesterday and this morning that we're going to have differences in life so he should forgive or forget especially since I agreed to not go against his preferences. But he's insisting that this is something he can't seem to understand and feels hollow because of it. He does tend to get very slightly mean when we argue but its often when we both haven't explained each other fully. In this case, I have tried everything I can on the explanation side. I personally don't think this is anything to be upset over after I've agreed to respect his wishes. But increasingly, I feel like I'm missing something.

I told him this morning than in our recent discussions, he's been a bit too mean and I have been meaning to tell him that.. but at the same time, I thought that this was something I should understand and forgive. Me sharing this was supposed to help him see that there will be things about each other that we must accept even if we find it surprising. Instead, he said maybe we should not talk to each other for a few days since we're taking things for granted.

He's so upset that he didn't even drink the coffee I made this morning and made himself tea. Sounds like a small thing but its a first for us.

Of course I'm also extremely upset - I'm hanging by the thread here because I believe I should wait for him to be okay, or for him to tell me how to resolve his feelings. I usually have to pry things out of him when he's upset bc of something I did. His support is the biggest factor in my day-to-day sense of security and idk how to keep hanging on. Please help! Are we at a stalemate? Am I missing something that I should have done? ",1,1757009290.0,Marriage,1,0.99,False

1n8hjfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeVsPoke/comments/1n8hjfr/the_ultimate_guide_to_the_best_pvp_pokémon_in/,The Ultimate Guide to the Best PvP Pokémon in Pokémon GO,"That humbling experience sent me down a rabbit hole of PvP research that honestly changed how I play Pokémon GO entirely. Turns out, PvP has its own completely different ruleset where those perfect 4-star raid monsters are actually pretty terrible, and some seemingly underwhelming Pokémon become absolute titans.

After two years of climbing the Battle League ranks, burning through probably a million stardust (don't tell my wife), and having more ""wait, THAT thing beat me?"" moments than I care to count, I've learned what actually works in each league. So grab a coffee, because we're about to dive deep into the best PvP Pokémon that'll have you climbing those ranks faster than a Talonflame with Flame Charge.

# Understanding the Three Leagues: Your PvP Battlegrounds

Before we get into the Pokémon themselves, you need to understand that PvP in Pokémon GO isn't just one thing – it's three distinct metas with completely different strategies. The CP limits create fascinating scenarios where legendary Pokémon might be useless in Great League but dominate Master League.

**Great League (1,500 CP limit)** is where most trainers cut their teeth, and honestly, where I still have the most fun. It's the most diverse meta with the widest variety of viable Pokémon. You'll see everything from starter evolutions to mythical Pokémon, and the relatively low resource investment makes it perfect for experimenting.

**Ultra League (2,500 CP limit)** is where things get expensive fast. You'll need Pokémon powered up to around level 40-50, and legendary Pokémon start becoming major players. It's the sweet spot between accessibility and power.

**Master League (no CP limit)** is where your wallet goes to cry. We're talking fully maxed legendary Pokémon with perfect IVs and second charge moves. It's absolutely dominated by level 50 legends and pseudo-legends, but when you get a good team going, the battles are incredible.

# Great League: Where Legends Are Made (and Budgets Survive)

Great League is probably where you'll spend most of your PvP time, and thank Arceus for that because it's genuinely the most interesting meta. The 1,500 CP limit creates this amazing ecosystem where bulk matters more than raw attack power, leading to some surprising champions.

# The Absolute Titans

**Azumarill** is basically the poster child of Great League PvP. This chunky Water/Fairy type has been a meta staple since day one, and for good reason. With Bubble as your fast move and Ice Beam + Play Rough as charged moves, Azumarill can take on an absurd variety of threats. It walls most Fighting types, destroys Dragons, and even handles some Grass types better than you'd expect. The beauty of Azumarill is its consistency – it never has truly terrible matchups, making it perfect for newer players learning team composition.

**Trevenant** might be my favorite addition to the Great League meta in recent years. This Ghost/Grass typing is just *chef's kiss* perfect for breaking cores. Shadow Claw builds energy incredibly fast, and Shadow Ball hits like an absolute truck. The best part? It completely walls those annoying Counter users like Medicham and can even take down bulky Water types. I'll never forget the time my Trevenant single-handedly swept a team after my other two Pokémon went down – that's the kind of clutch potential this spooky tree brings.

**Medicham** is the Fighting type you actually want to use. Thanks to its Pure Power ability (which translates to higher stats in GO), it hits way harder than its CP suggests. Counter builds energy at lightning speed, and you've got options for coverage with Ice Punch for Flyers, Dynamic Punch for Steel types, or Psychic for that extra STAB damage. Pro tip: a perfect Medicham for Great League is actually 0/15/15 IVs – took me way too long to learn that lesson.

# The Steel Wall Squad

**Galarian Stunfisk** is one of those Pokémon that just refuses to die. This Ground/Steel typing gives it incredible resistances, and Mud Shot generates energy like crazy. Rock Slide is your main spam move for baiting shields, and Earthquake provides the closing power. G-Stunfisk is the ultimate safe swap – something you can switch to in almost any bad matchup and at least force some shields or deal decent damage.

**Registeel** costs more to build but offers even better bulk and coverage. Focus Blast gives you Fighting coverage, while Flash Cannon provides reliable Steel STAB. It's basically an immovable object that can slowly wear down opposing teams.

# The Starter Squad

Don't sleep on the Community Day starters, especially **Swampert** with Hydro Cannon. Mud Shot builds energy fast, Hydro Cannon costs almost nothing, and Earthquake can OHKO anything that doesn't resist it. The only real weakness is Grass types, but that's what teammates are for. Shadow Swampert hits even harder but loses some bulk – personally, I prefer the regular version for consistency.

**Shadow Venusaur** deserves a mention here too. Vine Whip + Frenzy Plant is your bread and butter, but Sludge Bomb gives you fantastic coverage against Fairy types and other Grass types. It's particularly nasty in the current meta with so many Water and Ground types running around.

# Ultra League: Where Legends Awaken (and Wallets Weep)

Ultra League is where PvP gets seriously expensive, but the battles become absolutely epic. You're looking at Pokémon in the Level 40-50 range, which means significant stardust and candy investments. But trust me, when you nail a team composition here, the satisfaction is incredible.

# The Ghostly Overlords

**Giratina Altered Forme** is the undisputed king of Ultra League. This bulky Ghost/Dragon type with Shadow Claw and Shadow Ball can handle an enormous portion of the meta. Dragon Breath is also viable if you want more consistent damage, but Shadow Claw's energy generation is usually preferred. Ancient Power gives you coverage and the potential for game-changing stat boosts – I've won matches I had no business winning thanks to an Ancient Power boost.

**Giratina Origin Forme** trades some bulk for higher attack power. It's particularly nasty with Ominous Wind potentially boosting all stats. The Origin forme is better for more aggressive playstyles where you want to pressure shields early and often.

# The Psychic Powerhouses

**Cresselia** might not have the most exciting moveset, but its incredible bulk makes it a premier safe swap. Psycho Cut builds energy reasonably well, and Grass Knot provides crucial coverage against Water and Ground types. Future Sight hits incredibly hard but requires good timing and shield management.

**Lugia** with Aeroblast is an absolute monster when you can get it going. The new signature move hits harder than almost anything in the tier, and Lugia's bulk means it can usually get there. Sky Attack is still viable as a cheaper option for shield pressure.

# The Recent Risers

Thanks to recent move updates, **Lapras** has made a huge comeback in Ultra League. Sparkling Aria gives it reliable Water-type damage without the self-debuff of Blizzard, and Ice Beam provides excellent coverage. The combination of bulk and coverage makes Lapras incredibly versatile.

If you're using tools like [PokeVsPoke.com](http://pokevspoke.com/) to analyze team compositions, you'll notice that Ultra League teams often require more specialized roles than Great League teams. The higher power level means matchups can swing more dramatically based on typing and move selection.

# Master League: The Legendary Battlefield

Master League is not for the faint of heart or light of wallet. We're talking about fully maxed legendary Pokémon with perfect IVs and optimal moves. But man, when you get a good Master League team going, it feels like commanding gods in battle.

# The Holy Trinity

**Dialga** is pretty much mandatory in Master League Open format. This Steel/Dragon type resists an insane number of types and hits like an absolute truck with Dragon Breath. Iron Head provides Steel STAB and charges relatively quickly, while Draco Meteor is your nuke option. Origin Dialga with Roar of Time is even scarier if you can get one.

**Kyogre** represents the Water type at its absolute peak. Waterfall builds energy steadily, and Surf is incredibly spammable for shield pressure. Origin Pulse hits harder than almost any other move in the game – when it lands unshielded, something's probably fainting.

**Giratina Origin** (yes, again) is even more dominant here than in Ultra League. With no CP restrictions, its offensive stats really shine. Ominous Wind potentially boosting all stats can single-handedly win games.

# The Supporting Cast

**Melmetal** provides excellent Steel-type utility with amazing coverage moves. Superpower destroys Dark and Normal types, while Rock Slide handles Flyers. The combination of bulk and coverage makes Melmetal a fantastic team player.

**Togekiss** with Charm is the premier Fairy type option. Charm deals incredible fast move damage, and Ancient Power provides coverage while potentially boosting stats. It's particularly valuable for handling the numerous Dragon types in Master League.

# Shadow Pokémon: High Risk, High Reward

Here's where things get spicy – Shadow Pokémon trade 20% of their defense for 20% more attack power. In PvP, this often creates glass cannons that can absolutely demolish specific matchups while being more vulnerable in others.

**Shadow Swampert** is probably the most versatile Shadow for Great League. The extra attack power makes Hydro Cannon even more threatening, and while it loses some matchups due to reduced bulk, the ones it wins become more decisive.

**Shadow Machamp** in Ultra League is an absolute terror with Counter + Cross Chop and Rock Slide. It destroys Steel types and can catch Flying types off guard with Rock Slide. Just don't expect it to tank many charge moves.

The key with Shadow Pokémon is understanding that they shift matchups rather than just being straight upgrades. Before committing the extra resources (and they ARE expensive to power up), I always recommend using [PokeVsPoke.com](http://pokevspoke.com/) to compare the Shadow and regular versions in your specific team context.

# Team Building: The Art of Synergy

Building a great PvP team isn't just about picking three individually strong Pokémon – it's about creating synergy where each team member covers the others' weaknesses. Here's what I've learned after building dozens of teams:

**Lead Selection** should ideally be something with play against a wide variety of opponents and good shield pressure. Pokémon like Swampert, Azumarill, or Galarian Stunfisk work great because they can handle many common leads while building energy for their charge moves.

**Safe Swap** is where you retreat when your lead gets countered. This should be something that doesn't have many hard counters and can either force shields or deal significant damage even in losing matchups. Registeel, Cresselia, and Trevenant excel in this role.

**Closer** needs to be something that can sweep weakened opponents and handle common end-game scenarios. High-damage dealers like Shadow Pokémon or things with powerful charge moves like Medicham work well here.

The most important lesson I learned (the hard way, after countless losses) is to always consider how your team handles the current meta threats. If everyone's running Trevenant and your team can't handle Ghost types, you're going to have a bad time.

# Common Mistakes That'll Cost You Battles

Let me save you some pain by sharing the mistakes that cost me hundreds of battles when I was learning:

**Ignoring IV spreads** was my biggest early mistake. In PvP, you usually want low Attack and high Defense/HP stats to maximize your Pokémon's stats at the CP cap. A 0/15/15 Medicham will outperform a 15/15/15 every single time in Great League.

**Poor shield management** kills more battles than bad Pokémon choices. Those two shields are precious – don't waste them on charge moves that won't KO your Pokémon, and don't save them so long that you never get value.

**Focusing only on meta Pokémon** without understanding WHY they're meta is another trap. Azumarill isn't good because it's popular – it's popular because its typing and stats create favorable matchups against common threats.

**Not practicing with new teams** before jumping into ranked battles. I cannot tell you how many rating points I've lost because I didn't know exactly how my new team's matchups played out in practice.

# Budget Options for New Trainers

Not everyone can afford to max out multiple legendary Pokémon, and that's totally fine. Some of the best PvP Pokémon are surprisingly accessible:

**Great League budget options:** Altaria, Skarmory, and Whiscash can all be built relatively cheaply and perform well. Altaria especially is incredible value – Dragon Breath and Sky Attack make it a legitimate threat to many meta Pokémon.

**Ultra League budget picks:** Steelix, Lapras, and Empoleon won't break the bank but can still compete. Steelix in particular is incredibly bulky and resists a ton of common attacks.

The key is starting with one solid budget team and gradually upgrading pieces as you earn more resources from Battle League rewards.

# Looking Forward: Meta Predictions and Advanced Tips

The PvP meta constantly evolves with new Pokémon releases, move updates, and seasonal rotations. Based on recent trends, I expect we'll see more emphasis on Shadow Pokémon as they become more accessible, and move rebalances will continue shaking up established hierarchies.

For advanced players looking to push higher ratings, start paying attention to energy management beyond just shields. Knowing when to throw early charge moves for energy advantages, when to let your Pokémon faint to preserve switch advantage, and how to count moves for optimal timing separates good players from great ones.

Team analysis tools like [PokeVsPoke.com](http://pokevspoke.com/) become absolutely essential at higher levels where understanding exact breakpoints and damage calculations can mean the difference between winning and losing close matches.

# Your Path to PvP Mastery Starts Now

Here's the bottom line – PvP in Pokémon GO rewards knowledge and strategy more than pure spending power. Yeah, having optimal Pokémon helps, but I've seen skilled players with budget teams demolish expensive ""meta"" lineups simply by understanding matchups and playing smart.

Start with Great League if you're new to PvP. Build one solid core team around proven performers like Azumarill or Swampert, learn the common matchups inside and out, then gradually experiment with new team members. Don't be afraid to lose battles while learning – every loss teaches you something about the meta.

Most importantly, remember that PvP should be fun. Sure, there's nothing quite like hitting Legend rank for the first time, but some of my favorite Pokémon GO memories are from ridiculous battles with off-meta teams that somehow worked perfectly.

The Great League rotation is currently active, so there's never been a better time to jump in and start your PvP journey. Trust me, once you experience that rush of a perfectly executed battle where everything goes according to plan, you'll understand why so many of us become completely addicted to Trainer Battles.

Now get out there and show those other trainers what you're made of. And remember – if a spooky tree or a blue egg ever wipes your team, just smile and think about how you're about to join the ranks of trainers who truly understand what makes Pokémon GO PvP so incredibly engaging.

Thanks to my last couple rounds of feedback I cut out what I thought was an important narrative driver that just wasn’t gelling with the rest of the story and hopefully have made it more streamlined. I also went and read a bunch of contemporary romances bc I NEEDED to modernise my comps- please let me know if I added too many.

I want to include the race of my MMC Chris, who is half white British and half Malaysian because it’s relevant to the character and his narrative arc, but I’m finding trouble including it in the query in a concise way.

Here is the reworked query and first 300, I’d love some constructive feedback. 

**Query:**

Dear AGENT,

Exploring racial and class dynamics in modern day Britain, cutthroat office politics and the meaning of family, FOUR LETTER WORDS is a 96,000-word enemies-to-lovers adult contemporary romance set in bustling London. It’s *The Launch Date* by Annabelle Slator meets HBO’s Industry with the biting banter of Emily Henry’s *Book Lovers*, perfect for readers of Ali Hazelwood’s *Love, Theoretically* and Talia Hibbert’s Brown Sisters Trilogy.

Financial analyst Olivia Baker is a workaholic in denial, climbing the corporate ladder fueled by ambition and chocolate-covered coffee beans. When Olivia learns her boss is being promoted, she puts herself forward to replace her, a position that would make her the first Black head of their department and put her on the fast track to funding her dream: a community centre for underprivileged youth she’d sketched out with her father before he unexpectedly passed away. 

Half-Malaysian, half-White reformed playboy Chris Westbury is newly sober and desperate to redeem himself in the eyes of his upper-class family, and puts himself in the running for the same promotion. 

Their boss is doubtful they can work together, so they agree to put aside their personal enmity and propose landing a big fish client for their firm- the biggest one in Stratford Gold Mutual’s history; Pinnacle Energy, a growing energy company expanding its holdings to the Asian market. That’s easier said than done, and they clash in their attempts to demonstrate leadership and maturity.

The more time they spend together, the more they find hidden depths to each other- Olivia sees a kinder side to Chris and Chris finds Olivia’s hidden edge magnetic. The pair find themselves drawn to one another, walking a tightrope of desire. A business trip to Paris and a one-bed mixup brings the simmering tension to a boil, and they give in to their inconvenient attraction– just this once. 

*Just this once* was never going to be enough. They draw up a no-strings-attached tension-relieving sex arrangement, complete with written rules they inevitably break. With the big pitch and promotion around the corner, and errant feelings threatening to collapse their delicate house of cards, the pair must decide if personal sacrifice is worth finally achieving professional fulfilment, or if their ambitions are getting in the way of something real.

(bio)

**First 300**

  
If one more cocksucking thing went wrong, Olivia Baker was going to fling herself into the path of the next oncoming bus.

She’d gotten a text from her boss, Madison, asking her to come in earlier than Olivia’s usual early, so running on four hours of sleep and a breakfast of chocolate-covered coffee beans, Olivia had rushed off to work. It was pouring with rain, adding a new layer to London’s usual grime; and she’d stepped onto the DLR to witness an otherwise smartly-suited commuter pissing into a Pret coffee cup, before setting it down gently by the doors like nothing had happened. She’d wanted to look around, like *did anyone else just fucking see that?* But tube etiquette didn’t allow for eye contact, let alone horrified camaraderie, not during commuting hours. You stood to the right, walked on the left, didn’t block the doors and minded your fucking business. 

She was uncomfortably damp; her hair had started to frizz out of her hastily braided bun, and her edges were lifting. That new organic styling mousse her sister had given her could go fuck itself; her hair needed industrial-strength holding gel to keep it in place.

She scurried through the glass and steel lobby of Stratford Gold to the lifts on the far side. As the doors closed, a fancy leather shoe shot into the gap. They slid open once again, and in stepped the last person Olivia wanted to see that morning.

Chris Westbury.

The gum underneath her new shoe made manifest.

Corporate nepotism hire and the company golden boy.

“Well, well,” he drawled, as the doors slid smoothly shut. “If it isn’t London’s busiest little bee.” 

“Westbury,” Olivia said by way of reluctant greeting, stabbing at the ‘23’ button like it would speed up their ascent. Chris gave her a slow once-over, eyes lingering long enough to irritate. “Don’t start.”

 “Sleep well last night?”

She arched her brow. “Like a baby.”

“Ah. Waking up screaming every hour, then.”

Getting in by train around 9am and have tix for The House of the Seven Gables secured so far. I’m mentally preparing for it to be absolute chaos that day with tourists, so I’m trying to keep my expectations low for how much I can really pack in. That said, the main things I really want to do with such limited time are get a good coffee in the morning, walk around town to see some historic architecture, do the house of the seven gables tour, get loads of candy from Ye Olde Pepper Companie, and get a few souvenirs from some shops.

I only have about 10 hours (likely less) to spend and my group is 7 people. My question really is what is the best strategy for getting some food and drinks given the expected crowds on a Saturday in late September? How early do the crowds start in the morning? Will we be waiting an hour just for coffee? Should we just get that before the train in Boston? I have a list of breweries and pizza places, so worst case scenario we can stand around and have a beer and get a pizza slices to-go later in the day, but I’ve also seen that most places don’t do carry out orders around this time. With our group size, should we just pack our own food, like PB&J’s and granola bars or something, in case we can’t find a spot to eat? Or is it just busier than usual around this time but not complete madness? Am I overthinking it?

Thanks for any insight! I’ve never been to Salem and would rather have come at a less busy time, but this is how it worked out and we couldn’t pass up the chance to explore this town. I’m already itching to come back in the off-season.",0,1757008794.0,SalemMA,1,0.5,False
1n8hcmf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYoRRwBduJw,Chinese expert's view on trade and Africa,"Fascinating interview that touches on a large variety of topics. A few points made that pertain to Africa: 

(1) 

China can absorb African exports if they face hurdles in the US (the same way Brazil has been able to divert its coffee exports to China from the US). However, are there any concerns here about this amplifying the mix of African exports of raw materials and food? In Brazil, there are some concerns that expansive trade with China can de-industrialize Brazil as its industry may not be able to compete with Chinese imports. 

Or will more trade with China mean better options for African consumers, and the overall rise in prosperity will lead to overall economic development? 

(2) 

The size of the Chinese market offers huge scale where various companies are able to try various approaches, allowing a winner to emerge. For example, Chinese companies tried different kinds of EV batteries (hydrogen, lithium ion, etc.) while the Japanese companies, due to the small size of the Japanese economy, were only able to try hydrogen batteries (which didn't turn out to be the winner). The size of the Chinese market offers various options and also fierce competition, which is conducive to producing very efficient companies with great products. 

Can this apply to Africa? If AfCTA moves forward, can the large market provide a similar dynamic in the continent to allow for the creation of dynamic and technologically advanced companies?

My name's Josh, and I work for a local Norwalk coffee roastery called Silvermine Coffee Roasters. We import and roast our own beans and have a variety of roasts, blends, and single origins. Check out our Google reviews-- best in the state!

We do a lot of retail and customer-facing service, which is my personal passion. (Please DM me if you want coffee!)

But we are expanding more into the wholesale world as well.

We currently supply coffee to Blue Cactus Grill, Lazy Sister, Fairfield University, King Industries, Maritime Rowing Club, the Hyatt in Greenwich, and a few more!

Even with a growing list of wholesale clients, we remain committed to our small-batch, hands-on, maximum-service philosophy and like to remain very personal.

Do you or anyone you know have a business (from small office to restaurant) that would benefit from the best specialty coffee you can get at a fair rate? I would love to book a free tasting and talk coffee. DM me!

Can't wait to hear from you!

(Excuse the mess but a year later, I’m STILL selling my ex’s things and they are STILL collecting dust around my apartment.)

I like pretty things and controlled fire is one of them. I do have most of my candles on a bamboo tray on my vanity - it looks pretty and I just bring the whole tray out and light it when I want candle light then put it back - but I wanted to use this somehow differently. 

So it came in and it is a nice piece and heavier than I thought it would be. And since I don’t have a dining room because why, I left it on my coffee table for a few days and just looked at it. 

Then I realized, IT IS A REMOTE HOLDER   Unironically, I have been using it like this for a couple of days now and it’s perfect. 

Have a great day. I just wanted to share that if we take a minute to see things differently, look at what can happen! (In my case, organization hahahaha)

Remember when we actually talked about plot twists and character arcs? Now every show subreddit feels like one huge quote marathon from The Office, 30 Rock, and more — and honestly, I’m here for it. It’s like the more obscure the quote, the higher the karma.

The real question is: which show’s fandom has the weirdest quote obsession? Because I swear I’ve seen Stranger Things fans turn “Friends don’t lie” into a weapon of mass snark.

Also, shoutout to the absolute madmen who manage to hold serious debates and meme wars simultaneously. You’re the real MVPs of r/television.

These lasts **MINIMUM** for 24-48 hrs on clothes. (Don't apply on skin)      
They have great projection too .        
They definitely are headache inducing! So use sparingly.      
.
**AL REHAB**     
.
.
**Nebras** : smells like those vim dishwash with lots of florals. Not bad but its so damn harsh. Sitting beside people while wearing this will make sure they hate you for life 🤎.    
1/10.   
.

 
**Dalal** : caramel , sandalwood , orange , an okayish gourmand attar .  
Al rehab has better option tho.   
4/10.     
.
.
**French coffee** : This is the reason i ordered , dark coffee with very sweet caramel . Smells like kopiko . Will definitely get the edp .       
9/10.        
.
**Golden sand** : vanilla , caramel but this time i also get soothing floral notes ,also this has woody notes balancing everything out . Way softer than the rest.
8/10.      
.
**Bakhoor** : Notes mention vanilla , which i don't get ,i get lots of floral n fruity notes which def aren't going well together, smells like citrus floraly soap you will get in a public washroom.  
3/10 .     
.
**Soft** : TONS OF CITRUS , unlike the name the lemon notes in this isn't soft at all, this smells sour , tbh i don't get anything else than citrus and a hint of caramel . Qas excited about this because the hype but this is just another soapy scent.    
4/10.       
.
**Zahrat hawaii** : unlike soft this is more balanced citrus, now are are talking , pineapple , fresh coconut , i also get strawberry with a good amount of sweetness . Smells like a fruity mocktail you will get in a beachside.   
7.5/10.      
.
**Lovely** : Again a citrusy fragrance 🌛, but !! this is the best one , this is the least synthetic citrus out of these . This smells fresh and clean (and just a lil bit soapy).    
8/10 .      
.
**Choco musk** : If you don't have any attars or even perfume. Get this , even if you don't like the notes get this for trying out specially since winter is here .Been using for 2 years and the compliments still surprise me . Few of the comparisons are :    
10/10 (for the price we are getting amazing fragrance).   
.
.
Now one thing i have noticed is all of these a very similar except french coffee and choco musk , half of them are soapy Citrusy scents and half sweet caramel gourmand.      
You don't need all since all of these are so similar.     
.
**In citrus** : lovely and zahrat hawaii (both are similar ).      
**In gourmand** : get choco musk and golden sand.  
Also french coffee is great.     
.
**AL NUAIM**      
.
**Blue wave** : i love blue frags but this smells like a fabric wash. Get this if you wanna smell like surf Excel.       
.
**Chocolate musk** : nothing like choco musk. smells like a cheap vanilla essence and chocolate syrup whose only resemblance to chocolate is brown colour.   
Drydown is that of milk chocolate.
But its still bearable.       
.
**White musk** : very nauseating sweet ,and  nothing like white musk .
.     
**Litchi** : smells exactly like those heart shaped candies.  
.
**Strawberry melon**: like the name suggests, amalgamation of 2 fruits that doesn't work together.
Overly sweet .     
.
**Hajre aswad** : if you really wanna try al nuaim , try this . This actually has white musk and non nauseating floral notes.        
.
Only scenario in which you should wear al nuaim: You have successfully captured all your enemies inside one non ventilated room . Just break the bottle in that room and you are done .🌚.  
Stay tf away from al nuaim , also the package mentions that **its not safe to apply on skin** !!    
.
**Al rehab >>> al nuaim** .   
.
Al rehabs were for 99-150 rs. 
Al nuaim is for 30 - 70 rs.

It doesn't make a ton of money, but basically pays for itself. So, the plan was to keep it around for something they can do when they enter their retirement stage. 

I never got into ceramics as much as they did growing up, so I was initially thinking of just shutting it down once they were done with it, but instead, I think I'd like to try and turn it into a more viable business since i do think there's still a decent market for it here. I don't think it'd make millions or anything, but i think it could do well. 

One thought I had was to revamp it into more of a ceramic and arts café. Greenware and bisque don't really sell as much as it did years ago, but we just have such a HUGE variety from years of collecting, i think it's just too much. So, my thought was to scale back how many different molds we pour and just focus on the handful that do sell well. 

Then, start making a bunch of different coffee and tea mugs, as well as some bowls and plates to sell. We've got a bunch of different styles that we can pour, so there'd be a good selection for customers that want to come in, buy a mug, and relax with some coffee or tea. They can sit down and paint too since we supply paints as well.

What I'd like to do though is create a new, simple logo for the business that we could place on the bottom of any mugs, plates, bowls, etc that we sell. Then maybe if you bring one in with our logo you get like 10% off a cup of coffee or something like that. 

I just don't know the best way of putting the logo onto all our pieces? I know there are services where you can give a company your logo and they'll print it on a bulk order of mugs and whatnot, but we'd be making our own ceramics. We wouldn't need bulk orders of mugs. I wouldn't expect to sell hundreds of pieces either, so if it's a little bit labor intensive, I think that would be ok for now. 

It seems like there are underglaze techniques for logos that go onto greenware or bisque before you glaze and fire. I was thinking that might be the best way since these pieces would need to be dishwasher and microwave safe. But there's like a million videos of a ton of different ways people do underglaze decals. All of them just seem like the artists are doing one-ofs or the process takes a ton of time for just one piece. Hand painted designs, a bunch of different types of paper to print onto, different types of paints used, etc. 

I know major companies will use that decal boob thing. I don't think we'd need something automated like that. I was just wondering if maybe anybody knows of a good way of doing a lot of the same decal over and over? Or some advice on equipment or whatnot? Maybe i just get a stamp made up with the logo and use that with a specific type of paint? Or would it be better to get one of those big decal printers?

I watched a ton of videos on overglaze decals people use too. Maybe I just get one of those Ricoh decal printers for $10,000 and do it as an overglaze? Where you print out a full sheet of logos, dip them in water, and then stick them on a ton of pieces. I saw there were some that you stick on and then refire the piece so that the ink bakes into it. I just worry that it'll fall off after a bunch of runs through the dishwasher or something. 

The other thought was maybe not just doing logos on the bottom, but possibly have some fun sayings and catch phrases onto mugs as well, which was one of the reasons I was thinking of getting a big industrial grade printer. I just want to make sure it's pretty high quality and will last a long time. 

Sorry, I'm kind of all over the place, it's all still in the inception phase right now, so any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm thinking over the next 1 to 2 years I'd start renovating and transitioning things, so I've got some time to play and test things out.

Nestlé has just ousted **Laurent Freixe**, its global CEO, after only one year in the role. The board confirmed he was dismissed for **failing to disclose a relationship with a subordinate**, a violation of Nestlé’s Code of Business Conduct.

🔎 **What happened:**

* A whistle-blower complaint in May triggered an independent investigation.
* The probe confirmed Freixe had not disclosed the relationship, despite Nestlé’s rules requiring it.
* On Sept 2, the board announced his immediate dismissal, with *no severance package*.



📉 **Why it matters:**

* Nestlé has now lost *three CEOs in just over a year*, plus its chairman.
* Shares are already down 30–40% since 2022 due to weak sales, rising costs (cocoa, coffee, dairy), and reputational controversies.
* Investors are increasingly concerned about governance instability at the company.

👤 **Who’s next:**

Philipp Navratil, head of Nespresso and a Nestlé veteran since 2001, has been appointed CEO. Known for cost discipline and innovation in coffee, his immediate challenges are:

1. Restoring investor confidence
2. Rebuilding governance credibility
3. Driving efficiency under the “Fuel for Growth” program
4. Leveraging Nestlé’s coffee strength while addressing portfolio restructuring

💡 **Bottom line:**

The scandal underscores how governance failures—even involving consensual relationships—can destabilize multinationals. Nestlé’s future now hinges on whether Navratil can steady the ship ahead of Q3 results in October.

What do you think—

* Is Nestlé overreacting to enforce governance standards, or was dismissal the only option?
* Can Navratil bring stability after such leadership turbulence?

* **Open for developers, designers, and anyone into tech.**
* Share interesting projects, side hustles, and ideas in a chill, no-pressure space.

Some activities we’re considering:

I don't get why she's always fucking miserable.

I said my piece.

Let's move on to Rosalie.

Everyone loves how she gives painfully straightforward advice, but she's a bad influence on Carmela and you'd be stunad to not see it.

Examples:

One episodes she said how Jackie didn't leave her enough when he died.

Soon after, Carmela is stealing from the bird feeder.

In the Whitecaps/Separation plot, Tony and Carmela appear to have made up at Hugo's birthday party. 

The next morning, Rosalie is having coffee with Carmela. Soon after, Carmela decides to still file for divorce against Tony. Can't help but think that Rosalie got in her head there.

I've said my piece.

Got plenty more to say about Carmela, but everyone's already said it.

But I will say this: She had no right to steal that money from the bird feeder. Tony's money, Tony's choice. That's his ""going on the lam"" money. If he wanted Carmela to have that money, he'd have given it to her a long ass time ago, and it would have gotten spent before butter melted in her mouth.

I don't wanna discuss how much of a complicit hypocrite she is. We all know that. Carmela's a fucking thief and Rosalie put that thought in her head.",0,1757008071.0,thesopranos,17,0.33,False

Usually we have Christmas dinner at my mom’s, and see my in laws at some point either Dec 23, 25 or 26 in addition to for sure seeing them at the bigger gathering on Dec 24. My dad and his spouse have been away for Christmas much of the past 10 years, but now this year they are home. My FIL passed away in January, so it’ll be the first year doing Christmas without him. 

My dad and stepmom have travel plans to Australia in Dec but told me they specifically booked their return flight to be home for Christmas to specifically spend it with us. Of course, she never talked to me about that when they booked it, just assumed. Had they run that plan by me before booking, I would have told them that Christmas is SUPER busy for us, and we’d have to check our schedules before planning one way or the other. I am closer with my mom, she usually has some of her extended family to her Christmas dinner, and she loves making a big dinner at her place - it’s like her thing. 

My dilemma is, my step mom said “we’re coming home on Dec 24 specifically so we can see you on Christmas Day”, then later pitched her idea to have everyone over at her and my dads place for Christmas Day dinner, including my MIL, MIL sister, my mom and of course me and my lil family. As kind as an offer as this is, I don’t think it’s the right fit. My mom loves hosting and likes to have some of her family over. My MIL I’m sure will be sad that day, and as much as it’s nice to be invited to dinner, I’m not sure how comforting that will feel. My step mom is wonderful, I appreciate her, she is also a very big personality and I know if she hosts - it’ll  be like “her show”. I know MIL will get kind of steam rolled (I’ve witnessed it happen more than once). Stepmom also said “even if we don’t do the dinner, we’re inviting ourselves over to what ever you’re doing that day because spending Christmas without you was too depressing last year” - a comment like this is so hard for my people pleasing tendencies. I don’t want anyone to feel sad. But this puts so much pressure on me. And even though step mom doesn’t mind a big group thing, I truthfully don’t think anyone else likes it, like they’ll play along and be friendly but no one else really enjoys it. Stepmom has the kind of really big personality that just lends itself to a situation like that. She can be comfortable in situations that others might typically be less comfortable. So realistically step mom is the only one who this plan really works well for. 

I know if I told my mom and MIL to go to my stepmom/dad’s place for dinner because it meant a lot to me, they’d do it, but truthfully I don’t want to. Stepmom and my dad are trying to save us the trouble of seeing everyone separately, but honestly I prefer seeing everyone separately. Yes, it’s more work for us, but I honestly don’t feel super comfortable or relaxed when everyone is together. I feel like I’m constantly worried if everyone is getting along, or if anyone is left out. I know that’s some people pleasing on my end, and I’m working on it - but it doesn’t just go away. I know I’ll feel this way at the dinner, and it makes me not want to do it (we’ve had a handful Of joint events already ). Plus to add to it, I feel confident my mom and MIL would feel the same way (actually I know my mom would bc I asked her). 

For the longest time after my parents split up, everything was completely separate, all events separate, I don’t think I even saw my parents in the same room together for YEARS. So while that happened when I was a child, and of course that was now decades ago, I still have the same unease, these feelings run deep with so much history. Like for decades my parents had nothing to do with each other, I am very grateful now that they’re friendly, but it still doesn’t make it comfortable to do Christmas together.

I actually feel like this plan was a bit manipulative of my stepmom. Because she knows we typically prioritize my mom and my MIL. The last ten years my dad and stepmom are out of town for Christmas, so obviously we’ve fallen into a groove with planning Christmas with those that are in town. Further to this, rightfully or wrongly I always prioritize my mom because she’s single, and my dad has his wife, plus up until basically this year, she was always busier with her boys at Christmas and now this is the first year that they’re both not in town. My step mom knows we’d default to our moms, so she tried to work around that by saying oh well why don’t we just have everyone here. It really is both things - she is suggesting something nice, but she is also doing it to benefit what she specifically wants. My step mom also knows that we’ll take extra special care of my MIL this year, being her first year without her husband. I feel like my step mom knew we’d probably be busy with MIL and my mom on Dec 25, so this was her idea to be able to see the kids. I realize that I probably sound like a brat. I truly am grateful and love all our parents, Step and in laws included, but I am also trying to stick up for what works for me, and what I know will give me a more relaxed holiday, what I want matters too. 

Adding to all this, my step mom pitched this to me, then said she’s going to ask my mil and my mom about it tmw bc they’re taking my MIL for coffee (the 3 of them have gotten together a couple times previously, they’re not super tight but my mom and stepmom arranged this as support for my MIL after she lost her husband). It makes me frustrated that stepmom was going to just pitch this to the other two. Stepmom can be very convincing and words things in a way that ppl just end up agreeing to when they don’t actually want to. She has a very good way of swaying a conversation to her benefit. It makes me feel like stepmom is getting our respective moms to agree to a playdate without asking us.  I am assuming step mom wants an invite to my mom’s for dinner, but for all the above mentioned reasons, I would rather not and I know my mom would rather not.

So I called stepmom and just addressed it directly and said, I don’t think that will work for dinner but thank you so much for the offer. I said we usually do dinner at my mom’s and we want to stick to that plan. We will see MIL earlier in  the day on 25.  I said we’d be happy to have you and dad over for a shorter visit on 25th, and then we have Boxing Day completely free to do whatever we all want that day. I said we’d love to have a really fun day on the 26th. I could tell stepmom was disappointed at first, which was to be expected, but by the end of the call she actually sounded mad. They’re getting home from their cross continent travel at 11 pm on Dec 24. I asked her if she thought they’d be tired and she said “yes we’ll be tired but we would have made it work, we specifically planned it this way so that we could see you but that’s ok, your dad and I will just figure something else out”. Then she seemed upset and when we said bye she was notably quiet and seemed mad. I feel like that was a very guilt tripping, passive aggressive response. 

I feel so frustrated. I didn’t think what I suggested was unreasonable. I know she REAALY WANTS TO SEE US DEC 25, but that actually just doesn’t work that well for US, and she basically just assumed it would without asking. She’s making it sound like I’ve gone back on my word meanwhile I never agreed to this. Also, I know it’s not the same as Christmas Day, but is plans on Boxing Day really THAT disappointing?! Plus, I even did say we could still see her on Christmas Day, yes it’s shorter and not the plan they suggested, but I’m trying to meet her half way. Stepmom has a history of doing this, assuming plans can go a certain way, even if she doesn’t talk to whoever she is “planning with”, then getting mad when it doesn’t go her way. To be clear I love her still, and my dad, I love everyone - I just also love myself and I know what my little inner child needs is a bit of a more chill Christmas, which unfortunately is not the Christmas step mom imagined. Christmas has always been hard for me, ever since my parents split. I am trying to protect my little safe bubble a bit by having things the way it works for us, and ideally having some time just for the 4 of us in our immediate family. I truthfully don’t even want to see MIL as much as we will be seeing her, but of course we will do that, she just lost her husband. 

Anyway, I’m impressed if anyone is still reading this. At least it felt cathartic to type it all out lol I feel a bit better now. Any supportive words are welcomed. ",1,1757007666.0,beyondthebump,4,1.0,False

Hear me out,"We all hear that *integration is where the deep happens,* but what often gets overlooked is that preparation is also a huge part of integration. 🌿

One of the biggest questions I hear before retreat is: *“Do I really need to cleanse beforehand?”*

My answer? 100% yes. Not because coffee or cheese or social media are “dangerous,” but because the point of cleansing is to create a clear home for the medicine to enter. Ayahuasca isn’t something you “take”- she’s someone you meet. And like any honored guest, she deserves a quiet, uncluttered space.

Cleansing is more than diet. It’s an act of devotion. Every time you step away from coffee, alcohol, sugar, red meat, pharmaceuticals, sex, or even constant scrolling, you’re sending a message to the plants:

✨ *“I’m here. I’m listening. I’m willing to let go so I can receive.”*

That’s why the more you put in, the more you receive. Less static in your system = clearer messages, smoother ceremonies, deeper releases, and a foundation for stronger integration afterward.

So no, coffee won’t hurt you. But giving it up, even for a short time, strengthens your discipline, shows your commitment, and makes more space for the medicine to work through you.

And if that feels like a big ask? That’s the medicine, too. 

👉 If you want to dive deeper, here's an article that breaks this down even more; why we cleanse, what it actually does, and how it shapes both ceremony *and* integration. [You can read it here](https://www.jennadreams.com/post/why-we-cleanse-before-ayahuasca-retreats).

We have been using a mix of outschool classes, workbooks, and reading to catch him up. He needs special attention in all areas to catch up. We plan on him going to SAST next year for 6th grade. 

We are on the go quite a bit and do our work in coffee shops and bookstores. I have tailored his classes to his preferences. Minecraft science, spelling and writing on iPad (sensory issues with paper), Math on outschool, picking his own books for independent reading, and classes at local museums etc. He will do the classes only when prompted. We average about one hour of work a day (in one subject on one assignment but he is actually trying). 

He’s not progressing the way he needs and deserves partly on me, partly on him. 

Slowing our schedule down is unfortunately not possible.

What options are available in Tallahassee? 
Secular Micro-schools or homeschool pods? 
Open and go student led curriculum?
Direct pay tutors that can meet with me a few hours a week and help him catch up?

•	⁠Exam results: Mostly C's and B's, rarely an A
•	⁠Stuck and frustrated with my academic performance because i knew deep-down i could do way better


What I Changed:

Study Routine -->

- 8AM to 1PM, 5PM to 8PM (i got sick one time, except that i sticked with routine)

- Active learning techniques instead of passive reading

- Consistent daily studying with clear goals

- Used quida.app Pomodoro mostly, 25/5, 30/10, 50/10, 52/17, blocking my phone with forfeit as I did. 

Lifestyle -->

- Increased water intake (minimum 2L per day)

- Improved sleep quality (consistent 6-8 hours)

- Regular, balanced meals (2 meals a day as a student is a lot for me)

- Reduced random social media scrolling, deleted instagram, no more yt shorts

- Took short breaks during study sessions

Physical and Mental changes -->

- Lost 2 kg, I eat 2 meals a day and sometimes it's not enough

- Unfortunately, drinking too much coffee and tea

- Under-eye bags slightly worse because I study on laptop all day long

- Mental clarity SIGNIFICANTLY changed, I can almost focus whenever i want in 5-10 mins and lock in for 3-4 hours

- More consistent energy, tea and coffee helps a lot but probably not that healthy

- Better mood, I sleep better because I kinda am proud of myself for studying consistently so far

- More confident in my studies, I'll have exams soon i might update results

- Better overall learning experience

He kept joking with my friends, bringing their food right away, refilling their drinks, but completely ignoring me.

After about twenty minutes, I asked politely if my coffee was coming. He nodded and walked away. Nothing. Ten more minutes, I asked again, he rolled his eyes and said “yeah, I heard you the first time.” Still nothing. My friends were already halfway through their meals before I gave up and went to the counter myself. The cashier poured me a coffee immediately, I paid, tipped her, and went back to the table.

When we got the check, the waiter had charged me for the toast and coffee he never brought. I told him I’d already paid at the counter, and he just shrugged. My friends were pissed about how he treated me, so when they paid their $100+ tab, they left no tip and wrote on the receipt, “Maybe try serving everyone at the table next time.” Now I feel bad because I know servers rely on tips, but I also feel like he went out of his way to treat me like garbage just because I didn’t order much.

AMH: 6.09 pmol (0.85 nmol)  
BMI: 19  
Hypothyroidism (previously mismanaged)  
ADHD  
Mostly vegetarian/pescatarian until recently

I’ve been gently preparing for egg freezing for about a year.

When I found out my AMH was low, I also learned my hypothyroidism had been poorly managed. Despite regular testing, my TSH had reached 9, way above the ideal fertility range of 1–2. My GP admitted this was missed.

This was a wake-up call for me, I couldn’t rely solely on the system. I'm pretty sure that my mis managed Hypothyroidism for 10 years has had an impact on my amh. Once I grieved this I decided I needed to be proactive with my body and take ownership of this journey.

I decided to take some time to prioritise improving my TSH and my overall health before egg freezing. I wanted to freeze as healthy eggs as possible. But I also didn’t want to leave it too long because of my AMH.

Here’s what I did over 11 months to prepare — physically, emotionally, spiritually, and logistically to optimise my health:

# Months 1–3: 

1. Deep focus on nervous system regulation (I’d been in fight-or-flight for years, which impacts egg quality)
2. Started adjusting thyroid medication and regularly testing TSH
3. Began taking prenatal supplements
4. Added targeted supplements (some guided by a functional nutritionist):
   * Ashwagandha
   * Omega 3s
   * CoQ10
   * Folate
   * Multi for ADHD (instead of meds)
   * Vitamin D
5. Weekly ADHD coaching, learning new executive function tools and letting myself be supported
6. Somatic therapy to release old emotional patterns and tension
7. Switched to hormone-friendly skincare, cleaning products, water filter, glass storage
8. Began prioritising sleep 

# Months 4–7:

1. Continued supplements (added some more from own research) + TSH testing
2. Intuitively felt drawn to start eating steak for the first time ever
3. Had 5 metal fillings replaced with composite, I wanted the metal out of my mouth
4. TSH dropped to 3, better but still above ideal
5. Worked on full-body nourishment with more protein and fat

# Month 8: Deeper Diagnostics + Functional Nutrition

1. Blood test showed **very high B12,** indicating poor absorption
2. Switched to a new functional medicine nutritionist who ordered:
   * DNA methylation panel
   * DUTCH CAR test
   * Heavy metals test
   * Full blood panel review (vitamin D, liver, adrenals, etc.)
3. Fully transitioned to **omnivore diet**
   * Protein at every meal
   * 100g+ protein per day
   * Liver capsules + steak
   * Nutritionist suspected 13 years of vegetarianism may have contributed to hypothyroidism
4. Used a continuous glucose monitor for 2 weeks (HbA1c was 38)
   * Tracked spikes, added post-meal walks/squats, still exploring this further 
5. Supplement overhaul based on DNA, and analysis of my results, shifted to non-methyl prenatal
6. Added support:
   * Electrolytes
   * Slippery elm
   * Sleep multi powder
   * Taurine for bile production
   * Ghee, oily fish, eggs, olive oil to support fat digestion
   * Myo inositol
7. Diagnosed low cholesterol, linked to gut/liver issues
8. Began structured meal planning to hit nutrition targets. Still struggle to eat as much as I need to.

# Month 10–11: Egg Freezing Cycle

1. DHEA for 1 month (doctor prescribed)
2. Genotropin 0.4mg daily for follicle receptivity
3. TSH down to 1.98
4. Daily visualisations connecting with my womb
5. Did all injections in a calm space with music but when I couldn't create this environment I didn't over think it 
6. Used affirmations + journaling to reframe fear and feelings of grief
7. Trusted my body to do her best

# Egg Retrieval Results

* Follicles at start: 9
* Grew to 10 by scan 3 (1 small)
* Day 13 retrieval:
   * 8 eggs retrieved
   * 7 mature

My initial reaction was a little sadness because there was a part of me that was hoping I could do one cycle and be done, with as close to 20 eggs as possible. However I let this feeling come up and it passed. Because realistically this was in line with my amh.  
However this feeling lasted hardly a few minutes and I think the mindset of 'do your best then let go and let god' has really served me especially during this time. 

My over riding feeling was that of being proud of myself, grateful to god and knowing deep down that these are good quality eggs and a positive result given my amh and Hypothyroidism.

Honestly this may sound strange but I am genuinely enjoying this journey of health, learning about my body and treating myself with more respect and care than I ever have, all down to these future children that I will meet one day I am sure. Through this preparation for egg freezing I have been kick started into optimising my health to give myself the best possible chance to get pregnant and hold a pregnancy and be there for my children. I've learned a whole new meaning for loving myself and will keep going.

I’m now preparing for a possible second round.

**Key thing I think everyone should do:**  
Get a good Functional medicine nutritionist so they can advise which diagnostic tests you need, invest in these. They are detailed and give answers you may otherwise be searching for your whole life. These guide which supplements and diet actually work for you, what the missing pieces are, how your genes work and much more. The practitioner is equipped to guide this journey for you.

**Tool I loved using**  
I tracked all my injections, supplements, scan results and more using a custom spreadsheet and phone setup I made for myself.  
It honestly kept me sane through all the appointments, meds, and emotions.  
I’ve been thinking about turning it into a downloadable version if there's enough genuine interest, probably a small paid resource (like the price of a coffee), just to honour the effort and energy that went into it.",5,1757007091.0,eggfreezing,1,1.0,False

My jaw actually dropped when I stumbled down this rabbit hole. Either I’m enlightened or I just haven’t been paying attention—seriously, is this how side hustling is supposed to feel in 2025??

So now…here I am…about to spill the tea so none of you miss out. 

Here it is: my **Top 7 Legit Apps That Pay You to Test New Features in 2025** (and yes, #4 is what totally blew my mind 👀).

---

- **1. UserTesting+**
You get asked to poke around new features and record your thoughts in real-time. They send money straight to your account after—sometimes within HOURS. Like, what?!

- **2. TryMyUI 2025**
It’s not sexy, it’s not flashy, but dang, if you have 15 minutes for a test, they're tossing cash your way. The new interface this year? 200% smoother. Still confused how this is real.

- **3. PlayTestCloud NEXT**
Gamers…why are you NOT all here? Beta games and new UI elements. No more “just playing around.” Now you’re literally profiting from trying features first. 

- **4. [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp) (YES—it’s in BOLD because I genuinely did a double take)**
Here’s the deal: They PAY you to read *and* to test upcoming reading features. That means you get access *before anyone else*. Been doing this and my coffee fund has tripled.  
Can’t believe it took me so long. Don’t miss this: [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)

- **5. BetaBound Pro**
They match you with companies desperate for testers, sometimes big brands—think smart home tech and AI gadgets. Still hyped that I got to beta a drone feature last week and got $25 for my (hardly profound) opinion.

- **6. Toluna Influence**
Thought this was just for surveys? Apparently, NOPE. Their “New Launches” tab is where you actually get paid to dig in and try beta features. It’s wild; money for just opinionating.

- **7. AppSurveys 360**
Their updates in 2025 are bananas. They ping you with new-feature tryouts and you rack up points FAST, easily turning those into gift cards or straight-up PayPal cash. I signed up last Wednesday and already snagged coffee. 

---

A few confessions:
1. I went in skeptical, expecting 97% to be trash.
2. Came out flabbergasted—most are 100% PAYING users to shape the future of apps.
3. The only real danger is that you get addicted to the side hustle grind (I’m not joking—I’ve gone full night-owl over [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)).

Still not convinced? Hit up [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp) and prove me wrong—or DM me if you find a better-paying gig!

Anyone else completely mindblown by how different things are in 2025? Or, are you already in on these and I’m just the last clueless human on the internet? Share your secret test-app gems below!

I don’t currently have an espresso machine or grinder and don’t really know anything about the hobby etc But I do use the professional grade espresso machine at work daily to make myself lattes. That’s about all I know how to do though(I’m a cook not a barista lol) 

I mainly want to be able to make myself a decent latte on my days off. 

I don’t have much experience with home espresso machines and I’m not sure if the Philips branded one would be the same quality as the breville even though it looks like the breville I’m comparing it to is in a lower tier in terms of features.

I don’t want to get sucked in by all the bells and whistles of the Philips machine if it’s a cheap/crappy machine and the simpler breville bambino(non plus) is a much higher quality product. But if they are equal in terms of quality then I’d go with the Philips as it has a grinder. 

I just want a decent steam wand and espresso shot. I don’t wanna have to spend a crazy amount of time figuring out the machine. Both these machines are near the top of my budget and I’d rather not have to buy a separate grinder if I don’t need to as I have limited counter space. 

The coffee place I buy my beans from always grinds them for me anyways, would this be sufficient if I were to go with the simpler breville one? ",0,1757006945.0,espresso,1,0.5,False
1n8gj6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n8gj6s/does_the_pentek_dgd500520_water_filter/,Does the Pentek DGD-5005-20 Water Filter Replacement Deliver? In-Depth Review,"The Pentek DGD-5005-20 Big Blue Water Filter has become an integral part of my routine, and I can confidently say it has its share of both highlights and flaws. Being immersed in daily use, I’ve had ample opportunities to explore its features extensively and assess its performance when installed as a sediment filter in my household’s water filtration system.

**Design and Build Quality**

This filter stands out with its robust construction and thoughtful design. Featuring a dual-gradient density spun polypropylene material, the product is substantial and durable. It feels well-engineered upon first handling. The dimensions are practical (20 inches tall with a 4.5-inch diameter), making it compatible with Pentek Big Blue filter housings while ensuring it isn’t too bulky for installation. The white exterior isn’t glaring but functional, helping to identify the accumulation of sediment over time. What really impresses me is how lightweight it is—just 1.7 pounds—despite its heavy-duty utility.   

**Functionality and Filtration Efficiency**

One feature that deserves applause is its dual-gradient density, which ensures that the filter targets particles of varying sizes efficiently. The outer layer tackles larger particles such as sand and dirt, while the inner layer filters finer sediments. This layered filtration mechanism improves the water’s clarity while preventing clogging prematurely. The ability to trap such a wide range of particulates safeguards my appliances—from coffee makers to washing machines—against the wear and tear caused by sediment-laden water.  

**Ease of Use and Installation**

Installing this sediment filter was surprisingly straightforward. In my case, it slid easily into my 20-inch Big Blue housing unit with no adjustments required. I was able to replace my previous filter without any tools or assistance in under five minutes. Maintenance is also relatively hassle-free; since it’s recommended to replace the filter every six months or when a drop in water pressure occurs, this feels manageable for households of most sizes.  

[Looking for Pentek DGD-5005-20 Water Filter deals? Check Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b001vxw0u8/)

**Highlights**

- Certified by NSF International, meeting NSF/ANSI Standard 42 for trustworthy and robust filtration.
- Constructed with high-purity polypropylene, ensuring no taste, odor, or color leaches into the water supply.
- Enhanced sediment containment capacity—3X more than comparable filters of its size.
- Designed for high-flow applications, performing admirably in environments requiring larger water volumes.
- Fits standard 20-inch by 4.5-inch sediment filter housing without compatibility issues.

**Areas for Improvement**

Though effective, this sediment filter has a few shortcomings worth pointing out:

- There’s room for improvement in its longevity. While six months may suffice under normal usage, heavier sediment loads could mean more frequent replacements—leading to slightly raised costs.  
- It doesn’t eliminate dissolved impurities or microorganisms. This is not a surprise since this model focuses exclusively on sediment, but pairing it with another filter type could be required.  
- Minimal packaging details or instructions may leave first-time users confused during the filter installation process.

**Competing Products**

In comparing this filter to industry peers, the Culligan R50-BBSA and Aquaboon Big Blue filters come to mind immediately. While the Pentek DGD-5005-20 excels with its dual-gradient design and filtration capacity, Culligan’s offering features a more straightforward single-gradient filter that doesn’t perform as efficiently but is slightly more affordable. The Aquaboon, while comparable in build quality, seems to lack the same certification standards as this Pentek filter, making me question its assurance of safety. Overall, while each product caters to specific needs, this option feels more trustworthy and robust when safeguarding against a range of sediments.

**Price Worthiness**

Considering the product’s certifications, substantial filtering abilities, and reliable construction, my take is that it delivers remarkable value for the price point. While not necessarily a budget filter, it justifies its cost with the performance and added protection it provides for household water systems. Its compatibility with widely-used filtration housing options like the Big Blue series further enhances its appeal.

1n8ghuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnswedish/comments/1n8ghuq/apps_i_use_to_study_swedish_from_zero/,Apps I use to study Swedish from zero,"When I started learning Swedish, I wanted apps that felt light, fun, and actually helpful. Here are the ones I use daily for both conversations and Swedex/TISUS prep:

**Conversation – Chickytutor, HelloTalk**

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about fika traditions, sometimes we discuss the long summer days or favorite Swedish music. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Foundation – Svenska för alla (Swedish for Everyone)**

Learning Swedish basics felt approachable with Svenska för alla. It's a free comprehensive course that builds systematically from A1 to B2 level. I usually work through one lesson daily with my morning coffee. What I love most is how they explain not just the language but Swedish culture - why Swedes say certain things certain ways. The exercises mix grammar with practical situations like ordering at a café or making appointments. After a few months, I noticed I could understand simple Swedish podcasts. It's quality education that doesn't cost anything.

**Vocabulary – Ling Swedish**

Swedish vocabulary seemed manageable until I hit pitch accent and tones. Ling made it fun with gamified lessons and a cute monkey mascot that celebrates my progress. What I love most is the pronunciation practice - it actually listens and tells me if my pitch accent is right. At first, the difference between anden (the duck) and anden (the spirit) seemed impossible, but the repetition with visual cues really helps. I practice during lunch breaks, and slowly my vocabulary has expanded beyond tourist Swedish. The conversation scenarios prepare me for real interactions.

**Grammar & Pronunciation – 8 Sidor**

When I needed simplified Swedish content, 8 Sidor became my daily read. It's news written in easy Swedish, originally for people with reading difficulties, but perfect for learners. What's brilliant is the audio version - I can read while listening to perfect Swedish pronunciation. The short sentences and common vocabulary make complex topics accessible. Each article takes just minutes to read, so I never feel overwhelmed. After months of daily reading, my sentence structure and word order improved naturally.

**Swedex/TISUS Preparation – Folkuniversitetet**

When I wanted to get serious about Swedish certification, Folkuniversitetet's online resources helped immensely. They provide clear information about what Swedex and TISUS exams expect at each level. I like their practice materials that mirror actual exam formats - no surprises on test day. The sample speaking topics help me prepare structured responses about Swedish society and culture. Working through their exercises weekly keeps me focused on formal Swedish alongside my casual learning.

**Dictionary – Svenska Akademiens Ordbok (SAOB)**

A good dictionary is always needed, and for Swedish I use SAOB online. It's the most comprehensive Swedish dictionary, showing not just meanings but word history and usage changes. What's special is seeing how Swedish evolved from Old Norse - it makes word connections clearer. The pronunciation guide with pitch accent markings is essential. I also use Lexin for simpler lookups with audio in multiple Swedish dialects. Together they make looking up words educational rather than just translational.

**Reading – Radio Sweden på lätt svenska**

To improve my reading, I check Radio Sweden's easy Swedish section daily. They cover news in simplified language with audio support. The topics range from Swedish politics to cultural events, so I learn vocabulary naturally. I read one article each morning, first without audio to test myself, then with audio to check pronunciation. At first every third word was new, but after some months I could understand most content without dictionary help. It's a nice way to practice reading while learning about Swedish society from Swedish perspectives.

**YouTube – Listening & Review**

I also use YouTube as part of my learning routine. There are so many channels where you can listen to natural Swedish conversations, learn grammar, or review pronunciation. I sometimes watch Swedish vloggers like Therese Lindgren or IJustWantToBeCool with Swedish subtitles, sometimes structured lessons from Fun Swedish with Daniella or SwedishPod101, depending on my mood. Swedish subtitles help me catch the melody of the language and understand when words flow together, which improves both my listening and reading. It feels less like studying and more like enjoying Swedish content, but I still pick up colloquial expressions and modern slang every time I watch.",3,1757006817.0,learnswedish,0,1.0,False
1n8ghmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n8ghmx/buy_used_for_first_espresso_machine_350/,Buy used for first espresso machine? [~$350],"Hi Everyone!  
Hi, I'm a new coffee drinker ready to upgrade from the Aeropress! We have a Commandante C40 hand grinder and it has made a huge difference in our coffee over the, *shudders*, spice grinder. A friend gave us their Amazon special Shardor grinder, but after a few cups of convenience, we'll probably save it for larger parties with regular coffee drinkers. 

I was initially looking at the semi-automatic HiBrew H10A at $200 USD, but it lacks the 3 way solenoid & some upgrades offered by their H10Plus at twice the price $400.   

Then, I joined the espresso subreddit.
Holy smokes!  Talk about a rabbit hole!

Now, I'm considering higher quality, brand name used units for $200-$450 I discovered on FB Marketplace, albeit, with unknown maintenance conditions.

Gaggia Titanium: $300 (2.5 hours away), $200 for one w water strainer gasket detached?

Gaggia Classic: $350, no info & pic indicates it's sitting in a basement.

Lelit Anna (2010): $300. ""Recently serviced"". 

Gaggia Classic Pro (2019): $400, ""new steam wand & dispersion screen"". 

Rancilio Silvia Pro: $450. ""Replaced gaskets & therm"". And a SD 40 grinder for +$75. 

Rancilio Silvia:  $200, no info posted. 

I've done a litttle research on these units online, but am looking for guidance. I haven't yet requested additional info from any of the sellers. 

I'm not sure I can convince my husband a $400-450 unit is worth it. 
Will it break the bank? No, but he's not one for luxury splurges like this. 

He can really get into a hobby. He likes cocktails & became a home mixologist who makes his own bitters.  After 50+ yrs, he taught himself to play two instruments and picked up a third last weekend (plays by ear, can't read music). He loves espresso & has tried his best to get the Aeropress to come as close as possible. He's thrilled when he can get some crema from it. 

I only started drinking coffee this year and noticed the marked difference between the Aeropress and the local coffee shop espresso.  

This is a gift for my 60th birthday that is really a gift for him (shhhh). Well, for both of us.  I'm the one in charge of the research & purchase.

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about weekend plans, sometimes we discuss cultural differences between our countries. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Foundation – Nicos Weg**

Learning German basics felt daunting with all those cases and long words, but Nicos Weg from Deutsche Welle made it manageable. It's a video series that follows Nico's story while teaching German systematically. I usually watch one episode daily with interactive exercises. What I love most is how grammar appears naturally in the story - I learn accusative and dative cases through real situations, not abstract rules. The exercises after each episode reinforce what I learned. After a few months, German sentence structure started making sense. It's free quality content that rivals paid courses.

**Vocabulary – Anki German Decks**

German vocabulary with all its compound words seemed overwhelming, but Anki made it systematic. I downloaded the ""German 4000 Words"" deck and work through it daily. What I love most is customizing cards with personal example sentences - it helps me remember der, die, das articles better. At first, memorizing felt like a chore, but the spaced repetition algorithm is incredible. I review cards during my U-Bahn commute, and slowly my vocabulary has grown to cover most daily situations. Adding images to cards makes abstract concepts stick better.

**Grammar – Der Die Das App**

When German articles drove me crazy, this app saved my sanity. It turns learning articles into a game where you swipe words to their correct article. What's brilliant is the color coding - der is blue, die is red, das is green. After weeks of playing, I started seeing colors when I thought of German nouns! The app includes the most common German words, so I'm learning practical vocabulary while mastering articles. Five minutes daily during coffee breaks has made articles feel more intuitive rather than random.

**TestDaF/Goethe Preparation – Goethe Institute Online**

When I wanted to get serious about German certification, the Goethe Institute's online resources became essential. They provide sample exams, practice materials, and clear explanations of what each level requires. I like how they break down the four skills with specific strategies for each exam section. The model answers for writing tasks show exactly what examiners expect. Working through practice tests weekly helps me identify weak areas while building exam confidence.

**Dictionary – Leo Dictionary**

A good dictionary is always needed, and for German I use Leo. The forum discussions under each word are gold - native speakers explain nuances and usage that no translation captures. What's special is the pronunciation feature with both standard and regional variations. The verb tables showing all conjugations and the compound word breakdowns are incredibly helpful. I also like how it shows phrases and idioms using each word. It makes looking up words feel like mini cultural lessons.

**Reading – Nachrichtenleicht**

To improve my reading, I check Nachrichtenleicht weekly. It's news in simple German from Deutschlandfunk, updated every Friday. The topics cover German and international news, so I learn vocabulary naturally across different areas. Each article has an audio version at slower speed, perfect for checking pronunciation. At first I needed to look up many words, but after some months I could understand most articles without help. It's a nice way to practice reading while learning about German perspectives on world events.

**YouTube – Listening & Review**

I also use YouTube as part of my learning routine. There are so many channels where you can listen to natural German conversations, learn grammar, or review pronunciation. I sometimes watch German YouTubers like Dagi Bee or Gronkh with German subtitles, sometimes structured lessons from Learn German with Jenny or Deutsch für Euch, depending on my mood. German subtitles help me parse those long compound words and catch the verb at the end of sentences, which improves both my listening and reading. It feels less like studying and more like normal YouTube browsing, but I still pick up colloquial expressions and youth slang every time I watch.",7,1757006641.0,German,1,0.89,False
1n8gefu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1n8gefu/i_dont_like_my_kids_i_dont_like_being_a_mom/,I don’t like my kids. I don’t like being a mom,"Hello, I have two kids. Ages 8 and 6.

I separated from their father two years ago after he up and left (turns out he was cheating- I don’t know how I was so blinded- anyway). I have them full time. with occasional visits from their dad when he’s in town.

The eldest has been giving me such a hard time that I genuinely do not like spending time with him. His younger brother is following his footsteps

I know it’s partly his age, partly not having a man figure, partly iPad/screen. He loves his iPad and Netflix/disney+. He’s generally a nice boy to hang with his friends. But…. With me… he’s an asshole.

And the burden of being alone, a full time corporate employee, still not over being cheated on (I know my ex got married this summer- so I am battling resentment), and my sons’ not following simple instructions is slowly draining all the love I have for them. It kills me to write this.

These boys were my world- I used to be the mom Jumping on the trampoline with them, running after them at parks, waking up at 6 am because I don’t want to miss 1 minute.

Now, they are a responsibility. Make sure they are fed and drop them at school. That’s it.

I am emotionally distant from them. They can feel it.

The behavior I can’t handle is the disrespect. The amount of times I have heard “I hate you” and “I wish you are dead” this summer is more than I can bear.

I always try to plan play dates, at least 3-4 times a week (during summer break). But getting them out the door screaming and shouting is getting on my last nerves. They don’t want to leave the house. I end up dragging them by their shirts to the outing. The eldest shouts and screams the entire drive about how I’m a horrible mom, forcing him to go out, forcing him to do things he doesn’t want, how he hates me, wishes I never existed.

Then I end up asking them 12736 times to leave the play area. Then my son would say “sorry I was mean”. But I just don’t care anymore. I would rather he doesn’t talk to me anymore.

Everything is tiring. I know it’s probably screen addiction. But without screens to distract him, I would go crazy.

The embarrassing part is my brother and his wife and my cousin look at me like I’m not a good parent when they’re on their iPads, then they look at me like I’m not a good parent when they’re having their tantrum.

I don’t know how to discipline. I don’t know how to make them follow simple instructions like brush your teeth and put on your shoes.

What angered me enough to write this post is that over the weekend, at my parent’s house (the whole family was gathered for the weekend), my kids woke up early so they sat watching tv while we were all sleeping (7 am) I woke up at 8:30 (it’s the weekend). Anyway I let them watch tv so I can drink my coffee, brush my teeth change my clothes (etc). I started telling them to turn off their iPads/tv by 9:15 and just go outside and play (this kept going). Later by 11 I gave them squares of aluminum foil and scissors and said “let’s make swords!! Or a robot!”. Shouts and screams like I had hit them. I kept turning off electronics and telling them to go play outside on the bikes, check the plants, etc. cue screams and shouts and tears. But when your son screams at the top of his lung and says the rudest meanest things infront of people, you tend to just want him to shut up and give you peace.

I gave up. Then when I was packing to go back home, they went outside to explore, and made a Huge fuss about going back home and that they wanted to check the ants and bugs outside.

I’m going out of my mind. I don’t want to be a mom.

I know it’s also probably resentment knowing that their father is living his single life while I am “trying” to parent and failing. It’s also them knowing how to manipulate the situation in their favor. But I don’t care if they spend 17 hours a days on screen anymore. They’ll live.

But the guilt is too strong",36,1757006596.0,Parenting,44,0.73,False

New York didn’t stop for it at first, because New York doesn’t stop for much. The first thing people noticed was the way the sky flickered, like the city had been put inside a broken television. Then came the sound, not loud but deep, the kind that makes your teeth feel loose. I was standing outside a bodega in Queens when a guy next to me dropped his coffee and grabbed his ears like they were burning.

Within minutes the feeds lit up. People were recording the skyline twisting, like the skyscrapers were bending in a slow arc before snapping back, no damage left behind. One tower in Midtown was tied into what looked like a knot for exactly forty-three seconds, then it straightened like nothing happened. It should have scared the hell out of us, but half the city was laughing about it before it even ended. The comments were brutal. “Nice graphics, aliens. Two out of ten.” Some kid was streaming from the sidewalk asking if anyone else’s building just “glitched.”

The news networks tried to go serious, but it was too late. Clips of the skyline loops got turned into edits with theme music. Hashtags started. Memes dropped faster than official statements. The Corith Dominion must have been watching the data traffic because they doubled down within the hour. Shadows started moving against the wind. Reflections in glass buildings didn’t match what was in front of them. The sound changed to a slow pulse, spaced evenly, like a giant heartbeat you could feel in your ribs. People stopped on the streets, not in fear but curiosity. I knew better.

I had seen people freeze like that before when the air went wrong in Afghanistan. The body knows something’s off before the mind catches up. I kept moving, because standing still in a hostile event is asking for trouble. In the middle of all this, I spotted Maya Harker for the first time since she left the service. She was leaning on the hood of a cab, filming with her phone, muttering into the mic like she was doing a live review of a bad movie. She didn’t even look at me until I was right next to her. “Cheap effects,” she said. “They want panic. Not happening.”

Maya was a horror critic now, one of those voices online who could dismantle a film scene by scene. The Corith had no idea they had just picked a fight with the wrong niche expert. She pulled me in with her without asking. Said we were going to catalog everything they did. “You can’t beat fear until you understand its tricks,” she told me. We moved to a rooftop with a clear view of Midtown and started recording. Across the river, the skyline folded again. This time it looked like the buildings melted for a moment, but people in the street just kept walking.

By nightfall the Dominion shifted tactics. They started projecting giant shapes between buildings, things that didn’t have clear edges. A train stopped in the middle of a bridge and everyone inside said they saw something in the water, breathing. No one else saw it. In Central Park, entire sections went black, like someone had erased chunks of reality. The emergency broadcasts said it was a “spatial interference event.” Maya called it “cheap haunted house tech.” We both knew they were testing how far they could push before people ran. They didn’t get the reaction they wanted.

Commander Threxal probably expected mass flight, looting, suicides. Instead, humans gathered in groups to watch the events like street theater. Vendors set up food carts. Kids were livestreaming. Every shadow thing, every sound, every visual distortion was analyzed and mocked online within minutes. Maya kept recording, breaking down patterns. She noticed the sound always came before a visual change. She noticed the shadow shapes moved slower when people were watching them directly. I handled the comms, pulling in videos from different boroughs to compare angles. The more we studied, the less threatening it looked.

The next morning the Dominion made their biggest play yet. A probe appeared over Central Park, black sphere the size of a truck, and everything inside the park went silent. The air dropped ten degrees in seconds. Then the bodies appeared. Thousands of them, scattered like they’d been dropped from the sky. No screams. No blood. Just dead eyes staring upward. People outside the park gasped, some screamed, some ran. Maya walked straight in. She stepped over a child’s body like she was crossing a puddle. I followed because leaving her alone in an event zone was not an option.

Up close, the bodies looked real. Skin tone, clothing, weight distribution, even the faint smell of decay. Maya crouched next to one, put her hand right through its chest. Holograms. Every corpse was fake. The probe hummed overhead, watching us, maybe waiting for panic to register. Maya stood up, sipped from her coffee, and looked right at it. “Nice try,” she said. I could swear the probe wavered in the air for a moment before it shot upward into the clouds. The crowd outside the park erupted in cheers, thinking it was over. Maya just started writing notes.

We stayed in the park another hour, walking the perimeter and marking positions where the holograms had the most distortion. Up close, you could see a faint shimmer around the edges if you looked past them instead of at them directly. Maya said it was lazy programming. I thought it was resource management. Either way, the Dominion had wasted a major display on a crowd that was already bored. By the time we left, the bodies had faded, the grass looked untouched, and the city moved on like it was just another day.

On the way back, we passed a group of teenagers rewatching footage on their phones, laughing about how “the aliens think they’re scary.” That laughter was going to be more dangerous to the Dominion than any rifle or missile. I knew it. Maya knew it. And somewhere, in whatever command ship he was sitting in, Commander Threxal was starting to figure it out too. They wanted to win without firing a shot. But the problem with trying to break humanity through fear is that you first have to understand what actually scares us.

The dreams were not dreams, just broadcasts injected into sleep with a soft tone. The voice tried to talk me into giving up through a series of calm statements about pain, loss, and futility. It used my own cadence and stitched in real details from my records. It told me to lie down and breathe out and think about how easy it would be to stop. I woke up with a dry mouth and a steady pulse and wrote down every line they used.

Maya had been waiting in the kitchen with a pad of paper and a pot of coffee. She did not ask if I was okay, she asked for the script. I read the lines to her while she timestamped the phrases against spikes on a cheap EEG headset we found through a buddy. We cross checked with three other guys who had the same broadcast and saw the same pattern. The calm tone hit first, then a memory hook, then the quit line. That was their sequence.

They moved daytime tactics to match the sleep push. Holograms of family members showed up in doorways and asked for help in the voice they used as kids. Street corners looped into impossible angles. A municipal stairwell in Brooklyn ran in circles for six landings and dumped you back at the lobby with no explanation. A cop walked that stairwell for twenty minutes and came out swearing at the cameras. People filmed it from the outside and argued about camera lens tricks. No one panicked.

The forums lit up with rating threads. “Two out of ten, fake crying, needed better lighting.” “Four out of ten, got me for a second, then I saw the repeat.” “One out of ten, smelled like sulfur, weak.” The clips were arranged into playlists with comments about pacing and effect. Someone made a bingo card with common alien scares and started streaming sessions where they checked off squares. The Dominion feeds surely caught that traffic and did not know what to do with it.

Maya said the next step was to treat this like an academic field study and I said fine as long as we kept it modular. We set up an underground team with people who knew trauma patterns and editing tricks. No uniforms, no suits, no badges, just guys who knew how fear messages get built and how people actually react. We called it the red cell out of habit and then dropped the nickname because we wanted clean language. We tracked events by location, signal type, trigger, and public response. We built a database with tags for repeat structures.

The first profile we wrote up was for the Xarnai, because their projections had a distinct echo in the audio and a slightly off shadow length. Their stuff liked to linger on eyes and teeth. Their sound bed ran a subharmonic that made new listeners brace for nausea while repeat listeners yawned. The second profile covered the thin tall species with the wet footfalls that showed up in subway tunnels. Those projections held scaling issues when you threw a laser grid on them. We posted the findings in private channels and watched the symmetry break.

The Dominion pushed back with noise that made animals bolt. Several city blocks lit with false fire that projected heat without flame. The hospitals logged spike numbers for stress reactions but nothing near what a real attack would cause. The funny part, if you can call it that, was how quickly people started helping each other with direct instructions learned from old disaster guides. Strangers handed out earplugs at intersections. Someone with a garage shop printed signs that said Check your angle and sold them at cost. It was not hero work. It was just organized habits.

Maya kept the tone in the briefings. She never raised her voice or made speeches. She laid out charts and clips and asked simple questions. What works on children. What works on abusers. What works on bored adults in a crowded city. Every time she did it, I felt the room shift from fear to curiosity, which is dangerous to any opponent that picked control through panic. Guys joked to release pressure, then went back to checking spectrograms and static maps.

The deserters showed up next. Not ours. Theirs. We started seeing strange figures in alleys that refused food and held position like statues. One of our contacts from the hospital called in a weird admission. A thin biped with grey skin and milky eyes had walked into the emergency entrance, sat in a chair, and made a simple hand sign that meant surrender. The thing did not collapse, it did not moan, it just sat. It flinched when someone laughed nearby. It took me back in uncomfortable ways.

I escorted two of them to a psych ward I knew from years of shuttling cases. The staff kept it quiet. The rooms were quiet because the lounge had been cleared and every camera was covered. The deserters sat on the edge of a couch and kept their hands visible. Their chests rose and fell with a tight rhythm. The only time they broke that pattern was when the evening broadcast rolled through the building and died against the shielding we had installed from hardware store parts. They relaxed when it failed to enter. That told me more than anything they could say.

Commander Threxal must have been tracking because he came in that night with a delegation under a projection of legal protocol and asked to observe. He expected chaos and screaming. He expected restraints and sedatives. He got a group session run by an Army counselor with a flat affect and an old scar across his scalp. The counselor drew a simple diagram on a whiteboard with blocks marked Now and Threat and Reaction and walked them through how to set a mental shelf. He did not move fast or slow. He spoke like a mechanic explaining a part.

The deserters watched, those black eyes fixed on the board. One of them asked a question through the translation box about how you stop the images that arrive without consent. The counselor did not sell hope. He said you do not stop them, you file them. You build a folder in your head and you put the images there. You take the folder off the line when you need to work or sleep. You open it when you choose. You do not let the enemy choose. The alien nodded once like a student.

Threxal stood with his hands behind his back and tried to remain unreadable. He scanned us like a man searching for a fuse to pull. I stayed near the door with a security badge sitting visible on my chest and a radio in my hand. He asked Mei the counselor if this is what makes humans dangerous and she said no, this is what keeps us functional. She told him what makes us dangerous is that we share. That line hung in the air without any extra weight. It was not a threat. It was a fact.

Outside the ward, New York kept treating the horror drops like a lousy street show. The infinite staircases got mapped with chalk arrows so commuters could walk them by keeping a left hand on the rail. The crying family holograms got met with sign cards that said Not real in four languages, which cut their bite by half. The dream broadcasts lost effect once we posted the standard script and people read it out loud before bed as a joke. Laughter undercuts control when the trick needs silence. The Dominion did not adapt fast enough.

Maya expanded the team into a network. We had a line into a dozen cities by the end of the week with watchers and taggers and runners. The database gained a tool that predicted pattern repeats with a decent rate of accuracy. We learned that some species copied from others, which made them even easier to counter because you could call their moves before they finished. The more they tried to scare us, the more they showed their habits. The more they showed their habits, the more the forums mocked the predictability.

I started to feel the fatigue set in, not fear fatigue but boredom. The city had been stuck in a loop of spooky light shows and soft audio tricks while we waited for something with weight. You would think that is a relief and sometimes it was, but the other side of it is worse. You begin to wonder if this is the new normal. You begin to wonder what the next switch looks like when they stop trying to scare us and start trying to break things. I cleaned my kit and checked my notes and slept in short blocks.

Threxal requested a meeting with Maya one night in a sealed room inside a municipal building with old wiring and a stubborn elevator. He wanted to understand why fear did not land. She told him it did land, it just did not decide our actions for us. She laid out footage from old films and news cycles and even her own reviews where she called out tricks by angle and sound. She said we grew up with this material on our screens and in our lives and in our family stories. We normalized the presence of fear and built habits around it.

He said that was perverse. She said that was practical. He asked if there was any boundary that would finally push us to fold in place and wait for a leader to tell us what to do. She said there were lines for each person and each community and that he would be smart to avoid finding them. He stared at her for a long time and then asked to review the database. She said no. He saw a staff of five men in a borrowed room and decided she was lying about the scale. That was his mistake.

The next day we picked up a spike in the city core. The Dominion had taken an old high rise and folded three floors into a loop and filled the loop with a repeating scene of an evacuation that never finished. People walked in circles for an hour and came out sweaty and annoyed. Our runners chalked exit paths based on camera drift while our watchers fed the loop with confusing inputs. The loop broke when a crew cut the building power at the service entrance. The projections hissed and dropped like a bad feed. The lobby smelled like hot plastic.

We logged the event and posted the fix. The forums cheered and moved on to rating the scare out of ten. I sat on the curb with my back against an engine block and watched the sidewalk fill with regular life. I waited for the next trick and tried not to start wanting it. That is the thing they did not understand at first. They thought we were numb. We were not numb. We were ready.

The sky changed color without a gradient, like a bad texture swap, and the air went thin. The Dominion had stopped playing at horror shows and started shifting the environment. The first screamstorm hit over Newark and carried into the city with a low front of clouds that rippled like muscle. The sound inside it was not human, not wind, just a rolling chant in a language that hit the inner ear wrong. The edges of my vision fuzzed like they were cutting feed. I pulled on the ear protection before my hearing went soft.

Maya was already in the van with the sensors running. The readings on the monitors shook between three different bands, none of them normal. The chant pushed under the low frequency limit like it was meant to sit inside your head instead of over it. She labeled the file Emo Weather on the dashboard and kept logging. Outside the window, people were pointing up and taking video while streetlights flickered against no wind. The front line of clouds swept through the skyline without touching a single building. That was the first pass. The second was worse.

The bioforms came in at ground level, stitched together from what looked like failed prototypes of Earth life. Long limbs with too many joints. Skin that split under its own weight. Mouths that opened on the wrong axis. They moved like marionettes in soft mud. People did not scream. They filmed and backed away. A guy with a broom shoved one off the curb and it broke into static. Holograms again, but denser. Whatever the Dominion was building for physical deployment was not ready yet.

That did not stop them from trying to layer in real hazards. Volcanic alerts pinged from Yellowstone, Krakatoa, and three ranges I had to look up. The feeds were not faked. The seismic data showed pressure building in systems that had been dormant for centuries. That was new. I checked with the geophysics contact we kept on a private channel and he said the pattern was unnatural, like heat injected under pressure. If they could wake a supervolcano, they could do more than scare us. That meant we were moving into an active threat phase.

The team doubled rotation and went to full coverage. We pushed the psychological resistance tracking to the second row and brought environmental hazard into the lead. Maya still kept her focus on the fear angle because she said the two were linked. She thought the disasters were meant to create real stakes so the fear triggers could finally work. It made sense. A screamstorm is unsettling. A screamstorm over an actual eruption could break the stable population’s willingness to adapt.

The front hit Manhattan in the afternoon. The chant came down hard enough to vibrate glass. Static images flashed in the corner of the eye, like accident scenes, war footage, dead family. All of it was stolen from our own archives. I knew the exact source of one clip because I had been there. I closed my eyes and opened them slow to avoid the reflex lock. People in the street ducked under awnings and covered their heads, not because they were afraid but because they thought something might drop. The chant faded in under ten minutes and left the air damp.

Maya said it was time to take it to them. She had been sitting on an access plan into one of their command nodes for a week, waiting for a trigger. The eruption attempts were that trigger. We built the loadout in a quiet workshop in Queens with spare drives and two hardened laptops. The payload was not a virus, just a film reel from hell. Clips from the deepest, darkest material in human archives. Crime scene reels, war zones, medical footage, horror films that pushed limits before ratings boards caught them. No polish, no context, just raw input.

We went in with four guys who had the right physical skills and no hesitation to walk through a wall of static. The node was inside a projection hub that hid as a commercial building. Inside, the space opened into angles that did not belong. The walls leaned and shifted like the load was moving. We kept our eyes on the door frames and floor lines to keep balance. The aliens inside did not attack. They watched us, as if trying to see what would happen when we reached the core.

The core room was a sphere with a control spine running down the center. Screens ran every wall, showing live feeds of cities across Earth. Maya plugged in the first drive and the walls switched from live cities to black screens. Then the reel started. It did not have a title or intro, it just hit. Scenes of human history and fiction cut together with no transition. You could see the shift in posture across the room. The nearest operator’s hands twitched on its panel. Another stepped back. The sound mix carried into every channel in the hub.

Commander Threxal came in partway through the reel. His body language was sharp for someone who usually moved slow. He asked what this was. Maya told him it was our cultural archive, the material we made for ourselves when we were not at war. He watched The Thing play in full, his jaw tightening. When the chest scene hit, he looked at her like she had broken protocol by existing. She told him that this was why fear does not own us. We make it, we watch it, we use it, we put it away.

He said there was no reason to expose a population to that much horror voluntarily. She said it was the only reason we could stand here now. He glanced at the reel still running behind her and shook his head like the meaning was slipping out of reach. Around him, his operators were pulling away from the screens and looking at the floor. Some left the room without orders. The chant from outside stopped. The feeds went black.

We walked out without interference. The screamstorm overhead dissolved like mist. Emergency alerts on the net stopped scrolling. Maya did not smile or cheer. She just told the driver to take us back. On the ride, the city was quiet in a way I had not heard in weeks. The power lines hummed. The air tasted clean. People walked without looking up. The Dominion ships started moving off orbit before we reached the bridge.

By night, the sky was empty except for stars. We got confirmation from the network that other cities were clear too. The feeds from our watchers showed calm streets, no projections, no sonic pulses. It felt like a withdrawal. No announcement. No demands. Just gone. We gathered in the workshop, not to celebrate but to log it like any other event. Maya typed the final entry, timestamped, and pushed back from the desk. She lit a cigarette and said that they would not come back soon.

Before we broke for the night, she recorded a message on one of the old cameras. She spoke into the lens without raising her voice. She said the Dominion wanted to break us, but fear made us. She said we were the species that stared into the abyss and told it to try harder. She stopped the recording, put the camera on the shelf, and left the room. No one said anything. We cleaned up the space and shut down the lights.

The next morning, the city looked the same as it did before any of this started. Traffic moved. Street vendors worked corners. Construction crews hammered away at their jobs. If you looked close, you could see chalk marks on the sidewalks and old signs taped to poles, the only visible traces of what had happened. I walked past them and kept going. There was no end date for what we had done. There was just the fact that we were still here. That was enough.

I knew it. Maya knew it. And somewhere, in whatever command ship he was sitting in, Commander Threxal was starting to figure it out too. They wanted to win without firing a shot. But the problem with trying to break humanity through fear is that you first have to understand what actually scares us.

The dreams were not dreams, just broadcasts injected into sleep with a soft tone. The voice tried to talk me into giving up through a series of calm statements about pain, loss, and futility. It used my own cadence and stitched in real details from my records. It told me to lie down and breathe out and think about how easy it would be to stop. I woke up with a dry mouth and a steady pulse and wrote down every line they used.

Maya had been waiting in the kitchen with a pad of paper and a pot of coffee. She did not ask if I was okay, she asked for the script. I read the lines to her while she timestamped the phrases against spikes on a cheap EEG headset we found through a buddy. We cross checked with three other guys who had the same broadcast and saw the same pattern. The calm tone hit first, then a memory hook, then the quit line. That was their sequence.

They moved daytime tactics to match the sleep push. Holograms of family members showed up in doorways and asked for help in the voice they used as kids. Street corners looped into impossible angles. A municipal stairwell in Brooklyn ran in circles for six landings and dumped you back at the lobby with no explanation. A cop walked that stairwell for twenty minutes and came out swearing at the cameras. People filmed it from the outside and argued about camera lens tricks. No one panicked.

The forums lit up with rating threads. “Two out of ten, fake crying, needed better lighting.” “Four out of ten, got me for a second, then I saw the repeat.” “One out of ten, smelled like sulfur, weak.” The clips were arranged into playlists with comments about pacing and effect. Someone made a bingo card with common alien scares and started streaming sessions where they checked off squares. The Dominion feeds surely caught that traffic and did not know what to do with it.

Maya said the next step was to treat this like an academic field study and I said fine as long as we kept it modular. We set up an underground team with people who knew trauma patterns and editing tricks. No uniforms, no suits, no badges, just guys who knew how fear messages get built and how people actually react. We called it the red cell out of habit and then dropped the nickname because we wanted clean language. We tracked events by location, signal type, trigger, and public response. We built a database with tags for repeat structures.

The first profile we wrote up was for the Xarnai, because their projections had a distinct echo in the audio and a slightly off shadow length. Their stuff liked to linger on eyes and teeth. Their sound bed ran a subharmonic that made new listeners brace for nausea while repeat listeners yawned. The second profile covered the thin tall species with the wet footfalls that showed up in subway tunnels. Those projections held scaling issues when you threw a laser grid on them. We posted the findings in private channels and watched the symmetry break.

The Dominion pushed back with noise that made animals bolt. Several city blocks lit with false fire that projected heat without flame. The hospitals logged spike numbers for stress reactions but nothing near what a real attack would cause. The funny part, if you can call it that, was how quickly people started helping each other with direct instructions learned from old disaster guides. Strangers handed out earplugs at intersections. Someone with a garage shop printed signs that said Check your angle and sold them at cost. It was not hero work. It was just organized habits.

Maya kept the tone in the briefings. She never raised her voice or made speeches. She laid out charts and clips and asked simple questions. What works on children. What works on abusers. What works on bored adults in a crowded city. Every time she did it, I felt the room shift from fear to curiosity, which is dangerous to any opponent that picked control through panic. Guys joked to release pressure, then went back to checking spectrograms and static maps.

The deserters showed up next. Not ours. Theirs. We started seeing strange figures in alleys that refused food and held position like statues. One of our contacts from the hospital called in a weird admission. A thin biped with grey skin and milky eyes had walked into the emergency entrance, sat in a chair, and made a simple hand sign that meant surrender. The thing did not collapse, it did not moan, it just sat. It flinched when someone laughed nearby. It took me back in uncomfortable ways.

I escorted two of them to a psych ward I knew from years of shuttling cases. The staff kept it quiet. The rooms were quiet because the lounge had been cleared and every camera was covered. The deserters sat on the edge of a couch and kept their hands visible. Their chests rose and fell with a tight rhythm. The only time they broke that pattern was when the evening broadcast rolled through the building and died against the shielding we had installed from hardware store parts. They relaxed when it failed to enter. That told me more than anything they could say.

Commander Threxal must have been tracking because he came in that night with a delegation under a projection of legal protocol and asked to observe. He expected chaos and screaming. He expected restraints and sedatives. He got a group session run by an Army counselor with a flat affect and an old scar across his scalp. The counselor drew a simple diagram on a whiteboard with blocks marked Now and Threat and Reaction and walked them through how to set a mental shelf. He did not move fast or slow. He spoke like a mechanic explaining a part.

The deserters watched, those black eyes fixed on the board. One of them asked a question through the translation box about how you stop the images that arrive without consent. The counselor did not sell hope. He said you do not stop them, you file them. You build a folder in your head and you put the images there. You take the folder off the line when you need to work or sleep. You open it when you choose. You do not let the enemy choose. The alien nodded once like a student.

Threxal stood with his hands behind his back and tried to remain unreadable. He scanned us like a man searching for a fuse to pull. I stayed near the door with a security badge sitting visible on my chest and a radio in my hand. He asked Mei the counselor if this is what makes humans dangerous and she said no, this is what keeps us functional. She told him what makes us dangerous is that we share. That line hung in the air without any extra weight. It was not a threat. It was a fact.

Outside the ward, New York kept treating the horror drops like a lousy street show. The infinite staircases got mapped with chalk arrows so commuters could walk them by keeping a left hand on the rail. The crying family holograms got met with sign cards that said Not real in four languages, which cut their bite by half. The dream broadcasts lost effect once we posted the standard script and people read it out loud before bed as a joke. Laughter undercuts control when the trick needs silence. The Dominion did not adapt fast enough.

Maya expanded the team into a network. We had a line into a dozen cities by the end of the week with watchers and taggers and runners. The database gained a tool that predicted pattern repeats with a decent rate of accuracy. We learned that some species copied from others, which made them even easier to counter because you could call their moves before they finished. The more they tried to scare us, the more they showed their habits. The more they showed their habits, the more the forums mocked the predictability.

I started to feel the fatigue set in, not fear fatigue but boredom. The city had been stuck in a loop of spooky light shows and soft audio tricks while we waited for something with weight. You would think that is a relief and sometimes it was, but the other side of it is worse. You begin to wonder if this is the new normal. You begin to wonder what the next switch looks like when they stop trying to scare us and start trying to break things. I cleaned my kit and checked my notes and slept in short blocks.

Threxal requested a meeting with Maya one night in a sealed room inside a municipal building with old wiring and a stubborn elevator. He wanted to understand why fear did not land. She told him it did land, it just did not decide our actions for us. She laid out footage from old films and news cycles and even her own reviews where she called out tricks by angle and sound. She said we grew up with this material on our screens and in our lives and in our family stories. We normalized the presence of fear and built habits around it.

He said that was perverse. She said that was practical. He asked if there was any boundary that would finally push us to fold in place and wait for a leader to tell us what to do. She said there were lines for each person and each community and that he would be smart to avoid finding them. He stared at her for a long time and then asked to review the database. She said no. He saw a staff of five men in a borrowed room and decided she was lying about the scale. That was his mistake.

The next day we picked up a spike in the city core. The Dominion had taken an old high rise and folded three floors into a loop and filled the loop with a repeating scene of an evacuation that never finished. People walked in circles for an hour and came out sweaty and annoyed. Our runners chalked exit paths based on camera drift while our watchers fed the loop with confusing inputs. The loop broke when a crew cut the building power at the service entrance. The projections hissed and dropped like a bad feed. The lobby smelled like hot plastic.

We logged the event and posted the fix. The forums cheered and moved on to rating the scare out of ten. I sat on the curb with my back against an engine block and watched the sidewalk fill with regular life. I waited for the next trick and tried not to start wanting it. That is the thing they did not understand at first. They thought we were numb. We were not numb. We were ready.

The sky changed color without a gradient, like a bad texture swap, and the air went thin. The Dominion had stopped playing at horror shows and started shifting the environment. The first screamstorm hit over Newark and carried into the city with a low front of clouds that rippled like muscle. The sound inside it was not human, not wind, just a rolling chant in a language that hit the inner ear wrong. The edges of my vision fuzzed like they were cutting feed. I pulled on the ear protection before my hearing went soft.

Maya was already in the van with the sensors running. The readings on the monitors shook between three different bands, none of them normal. The chant pushed under the low frequency limit like it was meant to sit inside your head instead of over it. She labeled the file Emo Weather on the dashboard and kept logging. Outside the window, people were pointing up and taking video while streetlights flickered against no wind. The front line of clouds swept through the skyline without touching a single building. That was the first pass. The second was worse.

The bioforms came in at ground level, stitched together from what looked like failed prototypes of Earth life. Long limbs with too many joints. Skin that split under its own weight. Mouths that opened on the wrong axis. They moved like marionettes in soft mud. People did not scream. They filmed and backed away. A guy with a broom shoved one off the curb and it broke into static. Holograms again, but denser. Whatever the Dominion was building for physical deployment was not ready yet.

That did not stop them from trying to layer in real hazards. Volcanic alerts pinged from Yellowstone, Krakatoa, and three ranges I had to look up. The feeds were not faked. The seismic data showed pressure building in systems that had been dormant for centuries. That was new. I checked with the geophysics contact we kept on a private channel and he said the pattern was unnatural, like heat injected under pressure. If they could wake a supervolcano, they could do more than scare us. That meant we were moving into an active threat phase.

The team doubled rotation and went to full coverage. We pushed the psychological resistance tracking to the second row and brought environmental hazard into the lead. Maya still kept her focus on the fear angle because she said the two were linked. She thought the disasters were meant to create real stakes so the fear triggers could finally work. It made sense. A screamstorm is unsettling. A screamstorm over an actual eruption could break the stable population’s willingness to adapt.

The front hit Manhattan in the afternoon. The chant came down hard enough to vibrate glass. Static images flashed in the corner of the eye, like accident scenes, war footage, dead family. All of it was stolen from our own archives. I knew the exact source of one clip because I had been there. I closed my eyes and opened them slow to avoid the reflex lock. People in the street ducked under awnings and covered their heads, not because they were afraid but because they thought something might drop. The chant faded in under ten minutes and left the air damp.

Maya said it was time to take it to them. She had been sitting on an access plan into one of their command nodes for a week, waiting for a trigger. The eruption attempts were that trigger. We built the loadout in a quiet workshop in Queens with spare drives and two hardened laptops. The payload was not a virus, just a film reel from hell. Clips from the deepest, darkest material in human archives. Crime scene reels, war zones, medical footage, horror films that pushed limits before ratings boards caught them. No polish, no context, just raw input.

We went in with four guys who had the right physical skills and no hesitation to walk through a wall of static. The node was inside a projection hub that hid as a commercial building. Inside, the space opened into angles that did not belong. The walls leaned and shifted like the load was moving. We kept our eyes on the door frames and floor lines to keep balance. The aliens inside did not attack. They watched us, as if trying to see what would happen when we reached the core.

The core room was a sphere with a control spine running down the center. Screens ran every wall, showing live feeds of cities across Earth. Maya plugged in the first drive and the walls switched from live cities to black screens. Then the reel started. It did not have a title or intro, it just hit. Scenes of human history and fiction cut together with no transition. You could see the shift in posture across the room. The nearest operator’s hands twitched on its panel. Another stepped back. The sound mix carried into every channel in the hub.

Commander Threxal came in partway through the reel. His body language was sharp for someone who usually moved slow. He asked what this was. Maya told him it was our cultural archive, the material we made for ourselves when we were not at war. He watched The Thing play in full, his jaw tightening. When the chest scene hit, he looked at her like she had broken protocol by existing. She told him that this was why fear does not own us. We make it, we watch it, we use it, we put it away.

He said there was no reason to expose a population to that much horror voluntarily. She said it was the only reason we could stand here now. He glanced at the reel still running behind her and shook his head like the meaning was slipping out of reach. Around him, his operators were pulling away from the screens and looking at the floor. Some left the room without orders. The chant from outside stopped. The feeds went black.

We walked out without interference. The screamstorm overhead dissolved like mist. Emergency alerts on the net stopped scrolling. Maya did not smile or cheer. She just told the driver to take us back. On the ride, the city was quiet in a way I had not heard in weeks. The power lines hummed. The air tasted clean. People walked without looking up. The Dominion ships started moving off orbit before we reached the bridge.

By night, the sky was empty except for stars. We got confirmation from the network that other cities were clear too. The feeds from our watchers showed calm streets, no projections, no sonic pulses. It felt like a withdrawal. No announcement. No demands. Just gone. We gathered in the workshop, not to celebrate but to log it like any other event. Maya typed the final entry, timestamped, and pushed back from the desk. She lit a cigarette and said that they would not come back soon.

Before we broke for the night, she recorded a message on one of the old cameras. She spoke into the lens without raising her voice. She said the Dominion wanted to break us, but fear made us. She said we were the species that stared into the abyss and told it to try harder. She stopped the recording, put the camera on the shelf, and left the room. No one said anything. We cleaned up the space and shut down the lights.

The next morning, the city looked the same as it did before any of this started. Traffic moved. Street vendors worked corners. Construction crews hammered away at their jobs. If you looked close, you could see chalk marks on the sidewalks and old signs taped to poles, the only visible traces of what had happened. I walked past them and kept going. There was no end date for what we had done. There was just the fact that we were still here. That was enough.

Here are the ones I use daily for both conversations and CILS/CELI prep:

**Conversation – Chickytutor, HelloTalk**

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about coffee preferences, sometimes we discuss favorite pasta dishes or travel spots in Italy. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Foundation – Coffee Break Italian**

Learning Italian basics felt melodic and fun with Coffee Break Italian. The podcast format is perfect for my morning routine, and Mark and Francesca make lessons feel like chatting with friends. I usually listen to one episode daily while getting ready. What I love most is how they break down phrases word by word, then build them back up. The cultural notes between grammar points help me understand not just what Italians say, but why they say it that way. After a few months, I noticed I could understand simple Italian conversations in movies. It's become my daily Italian immersion that doesn't feel like studying.

**Vocabulary – Drops Italian**

Italian vocabulary seemed easier than expected, but remembering gender and plurals was tricky. Drops made it visual and memorable with beautiful illustrations and 5-minute daily sessions. What I love most is the minimalist design - it feels more like using a meditation app than studying. At first, I doubted whether 5 minutes could make a difference, but the spaced repetition really works. I practice while waiting for my espresso to brew, and slowly my vocabulary has expanded to cover everyday situations. The themed categories like ""At the Restaurant"" or ""Shopping"" are immediately practical.

**CILS/CELI Exam – Centro CILS Online**

When I wanted to get serious about Italian certification, I found the Centro CILS Online materials really helpful. They provide sample exams for all levels with authentic listening materials and reading texts. I like how the practice tests mirror the actual exam format exactly, so there are no surprises on test day. The speaking prompts help me practice structured responses rather than just casual chat. Working through past papers weekly keeps me focused on the specific skills these exams test.

**Dictionary & Verbs – Reverso Context**

A good dictionary is always needed, and for Italian I use Reverso Context. Instead of just translations, it shows real sentences from books, movies, and news articles. What's special is seeing how words change meaning in different contexts - crucial for Italian! The conjugation tool is a lifesaver for all those verb forms. I also like how it shows formal versus informal usage, which is so important in Italian culture. It makes looking up words feel like discovering how Italians actually speak.

**Reading – News in Slow Italian**

To improve my reading, I use News in Slow Italian weekly. They take current events and present them at a slower pace with simpler vocabulary, but the Italian is still natural. The topics cover everything from Italian politics to cultural events, so I learn vocabulary naturally. I read while listening to the audio, which helps with pronunciation too. At first I needed the English translation constantly, but after some months I could follow most stories in Italian only. It's a nice way to practice reading while staying informed about Italy and world news from an Italian perspective.

**YouTube – Listening & Review**

I also use YouTube as part of my learning routine. There are so many channels where you can listen to natural Italian conversations, learn grammar, or review pronunciation. I sometimes watch Italian vloggers like Clio Makeup or iPantellas with Italian subtitles, sometimes structured lessons from Learn Italian with Lucrezia or ItalianPod101, depending on my mood. Italian subtitles help me connect the sounds with the spelling (those double consonants matter!), which improves both my listening and reading at the same time. It feels less like studying and more like enjoying Italian media, but I still pick up authentic expressions and gestures every time I watch.",6,1757006487.0,learnitalian,1,1.0,False

**Im Kiran (Kiran The Marketer)**

I’m new here — just launched my first **affiliate marketing site** on WordPress.

I bought a domain, learned WordPress from scratch, designed all the pages, and published a few posts. It’s not flashy, but it’s live — and I’m finally moving forward. 🚀

Now I’m learning that **topical authority** and **content clustering** are game-changers — especially for new sites trying to rank fast and build trust with Google.

I get the *idea*:

**Pick a niche topic → create a pillar page → write cluster posts → link them all → become the go-to resource.** 

But I’m stuck on the **“how”** — especially in WordPress.  
Most YouTube videos and blogs stop at theory. I need **real, hands-on guidance**.

# 🔍 What I Want to Learn:

* How do you **pick a profitable topic cluster** that also ranks well? *(e.g., “Best Coffee Makers” → drip, espresso, French press, etc.)*
* How should I **structure categories, tags, and internal links** in WordPress?
* Which **plugins** help with SEO and cluster linking? (Rank Math? Link Whisper? Others?)
* Can you recommend a **step-by-step tutorial** (video or blog) showing this done on a real affiliate site?

# 💡 I Can’t Pay — But I Can Add Value

I won’t lie I can’t afford courses or 1-on-1 coaching right now.  
But I **can offer my skills in exchange** for mentorship or feedback.

Here’s what I can do for you:

* ✍️ Write **SEO-friendly blog posts or product reviews**
* 🎨 Design **social media graphics, banners, or thumbnails** (Canva/Photoshop)
* 🖼️ **Edit and optimize images** (resize, compress, enhance)
* 📱 Create **Pinterest pins or content calendars**
* 🔄 Help promote your content on social or forums

👉 If you’re experienced and willing to **show me how to build topical authority the right way**, I’d be happy to **help you with content or design work** in return.

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there’s high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""I love you and no one else"" (context: lesbian couple)  
**A2)** ""Had you been there, things might have gone differently"" (addressing a group)  
**A3)** ""I wouldn't count on it, but you do you""  

**B1)** ""Sbagliando s’impara""  
**B2)** ""Saranno bell’e arrivati, no?""  
**B3)** ""Stai fresco: quello cambia idea ogni morte di papa""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 2 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Ok so I’m a single 35f.. I don’t go on a ton of first dates but when I do it’s usually through dating apps and having FaceTimed first, so I know there’s at least an initial connection and interaction. My question is, if there’s a connection in person as well, do I at least offer to pay? 

I’ve asked a few guy friends and they have said not to even offer… the whole pull out your wallet thing is awkward, and to just sincerely say thank you and let him pay. I used to at least say “can I pay for any of this?” or “can I contribute?” but my guy friends have said not to even do this. I do live in a more affluent area in Southern California so that could be a factor. But I’m just curious if it’s seen as rude for me not to even offer? And if so, what’s the best way to do it? When I’ve taken their advice and haven’t offered, I always make sure to genuinely say thank you at least a couple of times and will text a thank you for dinner/drinks/coffee later.

**September the Ninth, 1862**

**Camp along the Rolling Fork River, Kentucky**

The boys rib me for hauling a ledger near as weighty as a cartridge box. Let them talk. I reckon, if my name is carried at all, this book will bear part of it, for I aim to set down deeds along with the doing.

Here begins the account of our march with the Army of the Ohio, set to strike the Rebels that bar the roads near Perryville so the rest of our people can pass.

We broke camp with the sun climbing the ridge. Packs rode hard against our coats, rifles slung, canteens knocking tin on tin. The ground was damp with night sweat, and my boots clung heavy with mud. Still, my heart is light, for I am proud to march beneath the flag. 

Private Talley, two files ahead and forever herding us with that farm-boy grin, swung his canteen and called back, “Hartwell, keep scratching in that book. Maybe your young ones will swear you amounted to something.”

I said, “I ain’t even got a wife yet.”

He spat into the pigweed and laughed. “Then mind your spelling, or a future Mrs. Hartwell will take you for a mule.”

Corporal Dawson scuffed his heel on a rock. “Better spell ‘amounted’ for him, Private.”

Talley laughed and rang his canteen like a bell. “Spell it yourself, Dawson. Or trade me your rations for the lesson.”

Near noon we halted at a busted fence and set kettles to boil. Talk bent toward the work ahead. 

Sergeant Clay scored a line in the dust with a twig. “Word is the Rebs sit tight in a small fort. We crack it so General Buell can push the whole army through without being seen.”

Dawson scraped mud off his heel with a stick. “You ever take a fort, Sarge? Or just farmer pens?”

Clay tapped the dust-line. “They’re logs and dirt. Nothing grand. But put a rifleman behind a wall and it makes it hell to take.”

Maddox gnawed his hardtack. “Hell’s as good a name for Kentucky as any.”

A few laughed then went back to their tins.

Toward evening we crossed green pastures. Doors stood open on a string of houses, with no folk within. I thought of Ohio and of Mother sweeping the stoop, and I wondered if men in gray had tramped by her door as we were doing theirs.

As night pressed, we kindled small fires and sat around with cups in our laps. Maddox began humming some tune of the mountains, and after a time the others joined. I tried to set the words in my book, but they were many and changing. Men make songs like rivers, never the same for long.

When the fire sank low, I laid my blanket in the grass and looked upon the stars. I know little of what lies before us, yet I feel it will be remembered long.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Tenth, 1862**

**On the Road toward Springfield, Kentucky**

We marched again at first light. Wagons groaned and mules shook their harnesses. The grass wore beads of water and soaked trouser legs till they slapped at our ankles.

Men coughed, swore, then laughed at their own curses. A day’s march is little more than sore feet, thirst, and a stream of talk that keeps a man moving.

Talley called back, “Hartwell, put it down we march handsome,” and tipped his hat like a showman. “We pass like a parade.”

Dawson limped on his right foot and cursed each tenth step. “Parade of boot sores, more like.”

Sergeant Clay paced the flank his gaze stayed on the road. He did not raise his tone, yet every man caught it: “Keep your wits. Town ahead.”

We saw more women than men about. An old one in a ragged bonnet tossed dishwater off a stoop and never turned toward us, yet I knew she kept count of us by the pinch of her brow.

Nearby, a girl stood next to a smokehouse with a baby on her hip and peered from under her hair. I tipped my cap and she turned away. Such sights cling. 

It is a strange thing to be in a place that is America and yet not home, to tread a road and know half the doors along it wish you dead.

It was near midmorning when our skirmishers traded shots. It came sudden. A crack, then two, sharp as snapped sticks. We dropped where we stood. My knee found a stone and I bit my tongue till I tasted copper. 

I heard a ball clip leaves over my head and a twig fell down across my neck. Sanders crawled beside me. “You all right, Johnny?” 

I tried to answer, but my tongue did not obey.

Clay raised his arm and the front line edged forward, coats snagging briars. A hawk drifted over the hedge, easy as a boat on a mill pond. 

The world felt both tight and bright all at once. 

When we reached the fence there was a boy laid back in the shadow of a sumac. He wore butternut. 

His hat had rolled away and his hair stuck to his forehead in strands. He did not move. One of ours had put a ball through the side of his neck. The ground beneath him drank as much as it could.

Maddox knelt by the boy and took his cap up. There was a scrap of paper tucked in the sweatband. He opened it and shut it again without reading it out loud. Then he slid it back and put the cap back on the boy, neat as a brother would.

“Scout,” Clay said. “Might be more back in the trees.”

Talley rubbed the strap marks on his shoulder. “Looks as if he could be from my county.”

Dawson answered, “He’s from somebody’s.”

We eased him deeper in the shade and moved on.

By noon we halted in a patch of stunted apple trees. The fruit was small, green, worm-cut, yet we filled our pockets. Sanders fetched water from a spring that stank of eggs, and we dipped our canteens.

Maddox boiled coffee in a blackened cup. The steam lifted, giving the place an air of home. Clay unfolded a grease-stained map and spread it on his knee.

“Fort sits ahead on a knob,” he said. “High walls. A ditch on the sides. Likely a score and ten men, give or take. They keep watch along the lanes. Our task is to come near enough to bridge the ditches and find where the walls yield.”

Maddox blew on a dusted slice of apple. “What if there is no place that yields?”

“Then we make one.”

A fly worried the rim of my cup. I flicked it off and thought how strange it is to sit with coffee and apples, a man among friends, while rifle and kin wait yonder to make meat of us. 

Sanders must have thought the same. “If any of you find a Dunlop from Scott County on the other side, do not tell me after. I would rather live ignorant than know I aimed true on a cousin.”

Dawson leaned back. “Judging by your looks, I’d be lucky to tell a Dunlop from a goat.”

We laughed a little. A poor laugh, but it helped.

Talley stretched with his hat tipped over his eyes. “Fort in the morning, then. First light will find us hungry at their table.”

I set my book on my knee and write. I feel the weight of what comes, yet I am eager. A fort is a thing built by men and can be broken by men.

The next time I put pen to this page will be at the victory over the fort, or never again.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Eleventh, 1862**

**At the foot of the knob by the willow creek, Kentucky**

We rose in the black before dawn. Clay came along and tapped each boot with the end of his ramrod, and we sat up like men raised from the dead.

“Fix bayonets. No shot till I give it. Have rails ready to bridge the gap.” He took in each of us as if to set our faces in his head. “When it starts, keep your mind. There is no trick to living finer than that.”

Maddox leaned near as we neared the fort and crouched in the willow shades. “Johnny, if I die here, make me a hero.”

“That’ll be up to you,” I said.

Dawson nodded under his cap, “Hear them?” Up on the knob came a scrape of metal on wood and a cough a man could not smother.

The fort lay square on the crown of a hill, walls of rough logs and a shallow ditch cut round the place. The gate hung to the east.

We crept along the creek and up through a brushy gully where pebbles rolled and knocked. Dawn showed a thin orange line under the clouds.

Clay raised his hand and we sank. A grasshopper ticked in the dry stems by my cheek and my heart thudded in my ear. 

Clay sent two squads to the ditch with the bridge rails, and set Sanders and me with Maddox to feel the gate.

A call came from the wall, rough and tired: “Who goes?”

Another answered from within, “Hush your mouth. Ain’t no one out in this muck.”

A match flared. For a tick I saw a face turned red and strange above the logs, as if painted with foxfire. The match died.

Then a shout from the parapet. “Get up, boys! Blue at the ditch.”

The first shot split the hush like a board breaking. I could not tell if it was from us or them.

The second struck sparks from a rock above us and a shower of grit ran across my back. 

Someone on the wall cried, “Come on! Yanks in the draw. Rouse up.”

Clay lifted his palm and dropped it. We ran.

The ditch smelled of wet earth and old mulch. Two fellows shoved the bridge rails down to span the gap. In three counts there was a path of weak wood and good hope across the ditch.

Wth that we swarmed, feet skittering, the rail bridge shifting under us.

A call from above, country and hard: “Let ’em have it!” The first volley tore the gully air and rolled like thunder. Balls knocked chips from the rails and thudded into the bank with a damp thump.

Something flicked my cheek and then warmth ran wet. My lips lay with the taste of blood that wasn't mine. I looked to my left to see a man stagger with his mouth open, and when he folded down the back of his head was gone. He slid in the grass and left a black ribbon behind.

“Axes,” Dawson shouted. “Haul yourselves up.”

We rose that wall as if born for it. Maddox ran to the logs and drove his axe between two timbers, hooked, and pulled.

“Up, Johnny,” he called.

I shoved my axe into the gap till it bit, then climbed the wood like a rung. My boot slid and my foot lost the timber. For a count I hung like a fool. Sanders shoved at my hip and I got a leg over.

Over the parapet a Rebel met with me. He was a boy with pimples upon his chin and straw colored hairs upon his lip. He said, “Get, you blue sow,” and thrust so that the gun butt struck my belly. 

My body found its own mind. 

I jammed my bayonet into the space between his ribs and felt it go through until my knuckles met cloth. 

The boy sucked air and made a hurt sound. He slid down on the inside of the wall with his hands noticing the wound as if it were a new tool. I set my boot on his chest to wrench the steel free.

Then I was in hell.

The fort’s air was a hot stable of powder smoke and men. A graycoat with a beard to his breast swung his musket by the barrel and struck Maddox across the side of the head. 

Maddox dropped to a knee like a man taking a proposal and came back up with a knife. He put it once under the man's ribs, and the soldier dragged air in harsh pulls until something inside let go and he sank.

At the gate Clay, Talley, and two more worked the crossbar with an axe to free the path for the others still outside. The first blow stuck. The second chopped fresh.

Within the court a man in gray cried, “Will, where are you? Shoot the bastards at the gate.”

Maddox shouted over him, “Keep your head, Johnny,” and fired from the hip, the muzzle flash bright as a struck match in a cellar. The smoke stung my eyes. I could not stop coughing though the world did not leave time for it.

At the wall to my right, Sanders hollered, “Why is it you, Ned. God help me, why is it you.” Another voice came back, measured: “Put your gun down, Sandy.”

Sanders did not.

His musket cracked like any other and yet not like any other, for his whole frame jittered as if a coal had found his skin. 

He did not turn to see what he had done.

Ahead of me a Rebel sergeant planted his boots and cried out, “Kentucky boys, give no quarter to these Yanks!” 

He fired at me, missed, dropped his piece, drew a knife, and came on like a man wading a river.

Dawson sprinted past me to meet with him and they went chest to chest. The knife found Dawson in the side. Dawson drove his palms across the man’s throat and bore down like a vise. Both dropped to their knees and rocked as if in a rough dance.

Maddox ran up and kicked the sergeant’s knife away and brought his bayonet down. The sergeant made a short snoring sound and lay still. 

Dawson said, very calm, “I’m all right,” though blood came in little spits to his lips when he spoke.

Maddox tore a strip from his shirt, and bound Dawson. “You will not die, not yet. I forbid it.”

Dawson said, “Just a scratch,” and spat red on the trampled yard.

Then the gate broke, followed by the fort. Not by our great strength, though we made a good show of it, but because the men inside lost the will that holds a line.

One threw his hat down and cried, “I’m done. I’m done.” Another called, “Cease, for pity’s sake."" A third ran for the rear, caught his foot, fell on a piling, and lay there saying mother without any sense in the word.

Clay called over the ruin, “Hold your fire. No more wasting blood.”

Our men stood and panted like beasts after a long hill, not yet believing they had reached the top. My legs shook as if chilled for a week. My skin was black with dirt, and spots on it ran darker than earth.

It was then I noticed a bullet had cut my sleeve. I felt no pain, only numbness.

I heard a Rebel on the ground say, “Water.” 

Another joined, “You there in blue, have you a drop for my boy.” His manner was not begging so much as a plain asking, like a neighbor at a door. 

I poured from my canteen to a tin and set it to the boys lips. He drank and looked at me as if to name me for a letter home. I could not bear it and rose and walked away.

The fort seems smaller now. I thought of what I had written last night, that a fort is a thing built by men and can be broken by men. It is true, but the breaking has a cost you do not count until it stands broken in front of you.

I end here. Clay calls for a tally and for men to straighten the grounds. 

The fort is ours.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Eleventh, 1862, Evening**

**Within the captured fort upon the knob, Kentucky**

We set to making the place our own before the smoke had lifted. 

Sergeant Clay told us, “Stack arms. Gather the wounded in shade. Dead to the north ditch. Prisoners by the stables. See to water and wood.” 

Dawson would not lie down though the rag at his ribs bled through. “I can carry yet,” he said, and heaved a bundle of muskets to the yard, teeth set and steps measured.

We turned the stable into a pen for the prisoners. The place reeked of hay and horse, with a slit of daylight cutting through the leak in one corner. The butternuts were herded in and barred behind the planks.

An old fellow paused as I dropped the latch. “I wore your color in Mexico.” 

The yard wore a smear of blood and splinters. We went at it with shovels and boards until the shine left the dirt.

Flies came like a storm and sawed the air. We hauled bodies from the ditch and laid them in a row. Some still drew air, so we set those aside for the meager doctoring at hand. The rest we counted, took papers from pockets, and hunted for marks that might carry a name home.

A boy had a scrap pinned in his collar that said ‘only son’. I could not hold it in my hand long. I put it back where his mother had set it and pulled the hat down over his face.

Meanwhile Sanders moved among the dead as if parting rows of corn. He halted by one and sank to his knees without a word. His grip closed on the wrist as if warmth could be coaxed back. “Ned,” he said, flat as ash. “Ned, you dumb fool.”

Talley stepped in beside me. “You know him, Sand?”

Sanders said, very small, “It’s Ned.” Then he said the name again, lips working, but nothing else followed. He pushed the hair back from the dead man’s brow. The hair was the same. I saw it then. Brothers, sure as my own name. Sanders lifted the cap and there were the same ears, the same jaw, and a mole near the eye like a fleck of soot. The cap went back on.

Maddox stood close and fixed his attention on boots, on boards, on anything but the face. “Come away, Sanders.”

Sanders did not come. He bent over the body like a man chasing the last of a fire’s warmth. “Mama told you not to go,” he said into the coat, and then a raw sound broke from him.

Clay came beside him and set a hand on his shoulder and kept it there as if to lend weight enough to keep the man upright. 

After a short spell Sanders rose. “I will put him in the ground. I must do it myself.”

Clay gave assent. “Of course.”

We opened long trenches north of the wall where the ground turned to clay. One for ours, one for theirs. Spades rang on stone and sent a shiver along the handle. A man wearies of burying before he wearies of firing.

By sundown the dead lay under the clay, and the stables held eleven men in gray.

We gave them water and two loaves between them. A fellow with a scar along his scalp asked after a boy named William. He said, “He whistles when he walks.” I said I would listen for him. 

When I stepped from the stables, the yard met me with a grind of crickets so thick I could not have heard a trumpet if it stood beside me.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Fifteenth, 1862**

Four days we have kept this pen of logs. Mud holds our tracks as a ledger keeps ink. Fires stay low. Meat runs thin. Coffee keeps a man upright. Chores fill the yard, and talk stays to what must be said.

At first light the air turned queer. A white wet veil slid off the creek and climbed the knob. The mist lay along the ditch like wool, then swelled until the walls rode in a chalk sea and sound came muffled. Our own sentry called the hour and it sounded like he had a cloth over his mouth.

By midday a horse clattered on the road outside, then climbed the yard through the east gate. The fog opened before him like a curtain and closed again at their backs. 

The rider wore captain’s bars and a dark horseman’s jacket. His boots bore spots of creek water, yet the animal showed no mud above the fetlocks.

He drew up before the sergeant. The horse tossed its head, showing a ring of white. The captain kept to shadow under the brim though light was all around. 

Clay saluted. “Sir, Sergeant Clay acting for our company.”

The rider touched two fingers to his brim. “Captain Nicholas Scratch, messenger from Major General Don Carlos Buell. Your numbers?”

“We stand at seventeen for duty,” said Clay. “Five hurt yet fit to sit a post.”

“Prisoners,” said the rider.

“Eleven.”

The captain set a glove on the horn. “Provisions.”

“Meal for some days,” said Clay. “Bacon scant. Water by the creek. We make do.”

Scratch studied Clay. “You mean to hold this point for a week, with no meal for extra mouths and no guard to spare. By instruction of the Army of the Ohio, your prisoners are to be reduced this day.”

“Reduced how,” said Clay, though any man could read it.

“By execution.”

A hush drew across the yard.

“Captain, these men gave up the fight,” Clay said. “We can wait on the General and pass them over.”

“You cannot,” said Scratch. “You will not. I will have your name if you refuse. Those mouths will take your meal, those men will cut your throats. We have no wagon for them. You have no pickets to spare. This is the order.”

Clay reached out. “Let me see the paper.”

Scratch drew a single sheet from within his coat. I stood near enough to see a seal like a black sun by one corner. He did not pass it to Clay. He read his rank in a steady way without haste, then folded it and put it back.

Maddox, near my side, said, “Bad day when paper orders murder.”

Scratch swept us in turn. “This fort is no hospital and no prison. It is a hinge for the army’s door. You will obey your orders.”

Clay set his mouth hard, then let it slack. “We are soldiers, Captain. We will do our duty. Though I beg leave to say it is a hard duty.”

Scratch gave no answer. He turned toward the road behind. The white had thickened there like steam on glass.

“Prepare. You will hear the tramp of the army on this ground in six days.” He set his heels and the mount moved off and was gone.

Clay stood a spell, then spoke short. “To posts. No man comes to the stable unless called. I will not lay this deed upon you.”

Talley cursed and kicked a loose rock. “Turn them loose and let the white have them.”

Dawson said, “And catch them at our backs when the white lifts. You know what waits down that road, Tal.” He drew taller and winced, then faced the sergeant. “Sarge, you sure you do not want a second?”

“Yes,” said Clay. “I take the charge myself. I will keep this weight off you if I can.”

He walked to the stable and stood a count at the door. He lifted his hat, set the brim to his trouser, then put it on again. The latch rose and he went in. I did not aim to listen, yet a man cannot shut his ears.

Clay spoke from the far end. “I am sorry, men. I was not given a choice that leaves me clean.”

One of them said, “Then make it fast.”

“I will,” said Clay.

The first shot thudded like a mallet on wet wood. Then another.

I stood with my head down. The pistol clapped again. I counted the shots in my head without wishing and wished I had not. 

Clay came out at last. He closed the door behind him and leaned his head upon the wood as if to rest there. Then he faced us. “Bring a detail.” He put the pistol in his belt and walked to the north side where the clay lies close beneath the sod.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Seventeenth, 1862**

The fog held the yard through the dark and into this day, soaking the timbers and our coats. The whole fort lies sunk in a milky pond. 

A man at five paces turns to a smudge, one step more and the white eats him whole. Posts bead with damp, and our jackets take the same. Men swear the stuff has a mind to it, feeling along the mind like a blind thing feeling for a gap.

At the ration pots Maddox said, “Fog like this can make yourself hear things. When the wind stirs, it turns to talk.”

I asked, “What sort of talk?”

He pinched his mouth and said, “Men jawing over coffee. A chuckle or two. Out yonder past the wall where there ain’t a fire nor a soul.”

Talley tipped his cap back a notch. “He ain’t wrong. Heard it myself last night. Thought it was you boys playing cards.”

Maddox gave a short shake. “Cards? With Clay prowling? Not a chance.”

“No jest,” Sanders cut in. “I swear I caught the same. Sounded like two or three telling stories.” He leaned nearer as if to keep it from straying. A strange gleam rode his eyes that was not his. “They were laughing, like boys in a field.”

Dawson came along with a hitch in his step. His side pains him, yet he keeps the post. He set his back to the timbers. “Ain’t boys out there, unless you count the dead.”

Clay caught wind of the talk and waved it off. “Keep your posts,” he said. “Fog is fog. It hides sound and carries it, and that’s the end of it.” Weariness sat on him as he spoke, like he meant to convince himself first.

When he moved off, Sanders said under his breath, “Easy for him. He ain’t heard what I heard.”

Toward evening, while we took our meal of corn mush, a queer thing came. It was the sound of men talking in low cheer, as if round a fire, though there was none lit near. We heard spoons knock against tin, and a laugh that carried across the yard. 

Talley hitched his chin. “You hear that?”

“Aye,” Dawson said. “Clear as if they was on the other side of this wall.”

We drifted to the palisade and set our faces to the southwest corner. The white rose higher than the tree tops. There was movement upon the parapet to my right, a head and cap just above the log, as if a man stood outside and leaned to look in. 

“Talley,” I said, not loud. “You see him.” 

Talley eased up to the rail and settled his chin to the top. “Where?”

I pointed. 

The cap was there. It turned a little and the brim showed. We edged toward it in small steps. The white curled a thin lip over the top. When we came close, there was nothing.

I pressed my sleeve to the spot where that crown had sat and brushed a flake of bark that crumbled.

Dawson said, “I saw it.” He cleared his throat and spat. “Best we say our nerves got the better of us.”

Talley shifted in the haze. “Maybe it’s them prisoners come back to curse us.”

By nightfall the fort is sealed. The fog pushes against the gaps in the stockade like thread through a needle. The fires hiss and shrink. 

We speak little. Even the owls and crickets make no song.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Twentieth, 1862**

Sleep will not touch me.

The skull thrums like a drumhead, and a man’s own talk comes back to him from timber and ditch as if thrown off a wall. My head sits like a pot forgot on the stove, lid rattling with each turn of the watch.

Near the middle watch Sanders came along the east wall and halted with his boot on the trench lip. 

“Johnny,” he said, “Ned is not in that dirt.” 

I told him to hush such talk.

“He called to me last night,” Sanders said. “Said my name the way he did when we were boys.”

I told him that was grief working. He answered, “Grief comes in a shroud. It does not wear boots.”

Maddox came with a cap pulled down. “Sand, hush. You’ll set the boys on edge.”

Sanders drew himself in. “Ned,” he called, louder than he planned, like a man calling a stray. “Ned, you stay your hand.”

Talley heard and cut in. “You’ll bring Clay on us with that crowing. Steady yourself.”

“Listen,” Sanders said. “He limps on the left. Always did, from the kick he took in the fields.”

We held still. The fog drew close, then slid back, like wet cotton tugged by a slow hand.

A scuffing crossed the yard near the woodpile. It was a strange gait. Not quick and not square, the weight thrown to one side.

Maddox called, “Who goes there. Speak and be named.”

Nothing came back. Only that step and a small catch of air that might be a man holding pain under his teeth.

Sanders raised his musket. “Ned,” he said, and the name broke inside his mouth. “Do not come near me, do you hear. I gave you fair warning. Do not force me.”

I pressed the barrel to push it down. “Sand, it’s a fellow from the watch. Stop yourself.”

He threw me off like a horse shedding flies. “Ned,” he called. “Stand back.”

The shape came on. No face, only a cap with a tilt to it and a coat gone dark where a chest ought to be, swaying on the white like a drinker.

“Hold your fire,” Maddox said. “Hold it, Sand.”

The figure took one more stumbling step forward. 

Sand cried out like a schoolboy under the rod and fired. The figure dropped to both knees, then sideways upon the ground with a heavy thud.

Maddox hissed through his teeth. “You damned fool, you shot a man in our yard.”

We ran to it. The white split just enough to show the cost.

Dawson lay with his cheek in the mud and his hat crushed under him. He pressed at his ribs as if to hold them together. A new dark spread across his shirt.

Maddox dropped to a knee. “Daw,” he said. “Daw, look at me.”

Dawson saw nothing of us; his sight ran past us and away. His mouth worked as if to make a sound, then stilled. I put two fingers at his throat praying for a pulse. There was none.

Sanders stood there with his musket fallen loose at his thigh. He said, very small, “That’s not Ned.”

Maddox seized his collar and gave him a shake. “You have killed your own, Sanders. You put him down like a dog.”

Sanders made a dry noise and tried to sink,, but Maddox would not have it. “I saw him,” he said. “I swear by my mother’s table. I saw him as plain as that gate post. It was Ned. I know Ned.”

Clay came at a run with two men and stopped when he saw Dawson. 

He took Sanders in for a long count. “Unload that piece,” he said. “Maddox, take hold of him if he cannot trust his hands.”

Sanders’s face had gone slack as wet paper. “Dawson,” he said, and the name left him like a cough.

It was then that the whistle came. It sliced the yard like a river current. Long and clear and wicked merry. It set the small hairs upon my neck to stand. 

It sounded from above.

A figure stood on the east wall. The same boy I spitted when we took the place. I knew him by the straw hairs on his lip and the thin jaw. He had no rifle, only a mouth pursed to tune like a mockingbird.

He gave the tune the gray boys boast of, the one they call Dixie. He whistled it sweet and looked down at us with no more care than a calf at a fence.

Talley raised his musket. “Speak,” he said to it. “Speak if you are a man.” 

Clay knocked the barrel down. “Hold,” Clay said. “It may be another trick.”

The boy tipped his head, half in greeting, half in scorn, still making that tune slow and pretty. Then the white took him. There was no step, no scramble, only that one instant he was there, the next a curl of pale with nothing behind it.

Sanders broke free of Maddox and dropped to both knees before Clay. “Sarge,” he said, “help me. My mind ain’t right.”

Maddox loomed over the man and hauled him back up by the collar. “You’re a soldier,” he said, rough as rock. “Stand up and own it.”

Sand spoke with a tremor. “It’s the prisoners. They came back for us.”

Clay faced him. “There are no prisoners here.”

A man near the gate shouted, “Then what is it that whistles in our yard?”

Pandemonium took hold then.

**From the Journal of Pvt. Jonathan Hartwell, 18th Kentucky Infantry**

**September the Twenty First, 1862**

The thing that troubles us is not the boys we laid in the trench. 

A thing wears their caps, steals their tricks and tunes, yet is not them. It is a hunger that knows a man by his shame and by grief. 

It does not strike with claws. It waits. It nudges. It puts on the face you ache to see and sets you to ruin by your own free will. 

It called to me like Mother calling from the lane at dusk, and for a count I near walked toward it like a calf to salt. I set that down so that the next man knows where the devil sits. 

Not in the ditch, but in your own wanting.

I walked the east wall where Dawson fell days past. His boot left a scuff, and the yard kept the smear where he lay. Sanders studied that mark. Maddox stood behind him with his cap down and his grip cinched on the musket.

“Sanders,” Maddox said. “Say it plain. Whose shape did you see that night?”

Sanders stood fixed. “I saw my brother. I swear it. He called me by the name my ma used. None but him knew it.”

“No one else heard a name,” Maddox said, and there was a heat under his words like iron above coals. “It took Dawson because you let it. You pulled on a friend the same you did on your own kin.”

Sanders faced him then. The skin under his brow was raw, yet he kept his feet. “I will carry what I done till the dirt shuts me up. You need not add to it.”

Maddox laid his piece across his thigh. “You put Dawson in the ground.”

“What sits in this fog wears faces like a peddler wears coats,” said Sanders. “I am sorry.”

Clay stepped between them. “Lower your arms,” he said. “We will not gnaw each other like dogs. There is a watch to keep and a road to hold.”

Maddox held his ground. He went from Sanders to Clay with a hard set. “Sergeant, you put eleven men in the dark the other day.”

Clay’s jaw worked once. “Orders.”

“Whose orders?” asked Maddox. “The rider from nowhere with a black sun on his paper? You made murder on that word alone.”

Clay’s face pinched, not in fright but in grief. “I took that weight so you would not. Do not throw it back to me.”

Maddox inched the musket up. “Daw is in the cold because Sanders could not tell a brother from a trick, and because you turned this pen into a slaughter shed. That is the count I make.”

“Lower that gun,” Clay said. “I will not say it again.”

For a tick I thought the matter done. Then Sanders, who had gone still, spoke past Clay.

“Maddox,” he said, and his words came scraped. “I would trade my head for Dawson’s if I had the means.”

Maddox’s mouth went flat. He brought the piece up in one clean lift and fired.

Smoke slapped my cheek. Sanders took the ball high, near the eye, and fell without a sound. He lay on his side with one palm loose by his mouth, as if to catch a word he had dropped.

Talley threw a curse and lunged, but I caught his sleeve. Clay made no shout. He stepped to Maddox and batted the barrel aside.

“You’re under arrest,” Clay said.

“No,” said Maddox. “I am not.”

A queer stillness settled. Men came out of the white and made a half ring.

Bettis, who never had much to give but his back, stood near Maddox. Grant stepped behind him. Two more I knew by outline, not by name, took their places. Their faces were set, not wild. They had chosen a road and meant to walk it to the end.

“We are done taking your say,” Bettis told Clay. “You bled the prisoners. You set the fog on us with that deed. You aim to hang us by rules after you finish breaking them.”

Clay took in each face. A tired sorrow rode him, like a man who sees a storm break the barn he mended all spring. “Stack arms,” he said again. “For the last time.”

“No,” said Maddox again.

Clay reached for his pistol. Bettis thrust a bayonet and missed. Maddox clubbed the musket and struck Clay across the head. Clay went to one knee, rose, and shoved Maddox back with his fist set in the man’s coat. I heard Clay say, as if to himself, “Hold steady,” and then the yard broke.

Bettis fired and struck a post. Grant shot Talley through the side. Talley spun and fell, one palm to the dirt, the other pressed to his waist where the blood ran hot. I leveled on Grant and pulled. He staggered and sat down as if to rest by a stump. He did not get up again.

Men who were not with any side shot at shapes moving in the white. The fort turned to a box with lead rattling inside. I crawled to Talley and he let a small show of teeth.

“Bad?” I asked.

“Mean,” he said. “A mean bite.”

“Stay here,” I said.

He let out a short laugh and coughed. “As if I had chores elsewhere.”

Clay had his pistol now. He lifted it over his head and shouted, “Cease fire.” Few heard him.

A ball struck him in the breast and snapped him back. He seemed more surprised than hurt. He took two crooked steps, as if balancing a pail, and sat against the wall. His hat slid and showed hair gone gray in places I had not noticed prior. He tried to speak. Only air came. Then nothing.

Maddox saw him fall. He stepped over, took the pistol from Clay’s lap, and turned it on those who had not chosen a path.

“Pick a side,” he cried. “Pick now.”

“Pick sense,” I said, pushing to my feet. “Maddox, lay it down. Enough.”

He leveled the pistol at me. “Hartwell, you always liked the orders. You liked the ink.”

“I liked Daw,” I said. “I liked Sanders too, for all his mistakes. You put him down like swine. That is not soldier’s work.”

He smiled and it came off lonely. “You did not see what I saw. The thing walks and whistles and makes boys fools. It is in the timber, and in that rifle you carry, and in your book. You write it long enough and it will climb out.”

“Then stop feeding it,” I said. “Stop.”

He thumbed the hammer. Bettis and the others spread along the fence with the set of men ready to rush. I fired, and the ball took Bettis under the shoulder. He bawled like a doe and folded. That gave the rest pause.

But not Maddox. Maddox came on. 

He fired wide. The shot peeled a sliver off a post. I threw my empty rifle and took up Talley’s fallen bayonet. A man feels the world turn narrow in such moments. There is the circle where your feet stand and the circle where the other man stands, and all else is the white that eats the hills.

We closed. 

He struck across my ear with the pistol and it rang. He came again and I drove the steel into his belly. It was not like the boy at the wall. Maddox had weight. He clutched the blade as if to wrench it free and I pushed. Air rushed out of him, hot and rank. He caught my coat and we were chest to chest so near I saw the freckles flecked across his cheeks.

“You fool,” he said near my cheek. “It will wear my face next.”

I cannot say if I answered. I turned the blade and he sagged off me. He rolled to his back. His arm fell. The gun slid into the mud. He looked at me like a man who wanted to ask a question but could not remember what it was. Then his face eased the way it did when he spoke of home. A small tremor ran through him and then he was gone.

Talley called my name. “Johnny,” he rasped. “Help me sit.”

I propped him against the wood. His color had run off him, scraped bare as bark. “Listen,” he said. “Hear it?”

At first it was only the rolling in my ear from the blow. Then a murmur rose underfoot, faint, then stronger. The ground did not shake, yet it seemed to answer. A thousand feet or more, heel and toe, the rhythm of men who have walked long and will not halt for anything short of a fight.

“Troops,” I said.

“About time,” Talley said. He tried to laugh but made a face.

The white at the east gate stirred as if wind passed under a door. Shadows grew into men. An officer on a weary horse rode through with a file of blue behind.

The first of them pulled off his glove and pinched his nose at the stink.

“What in the name of misery,” he said. He fixed on me. “Who is in charge here.”

I said, “No one, sir.”

“Someone gave orders to make such a ruin.”

I pointed with a finger that would not stay still. “Sergeant Clay. He held us until this hour. He is there, sir. He is dead.”

“By whom?”

“Sir,” said Talley. Blood ran through the rag and found his belt. “Sir, hear me. My friend stood as a companion to order. Maddox lost his head and his heart both. He killed our sergeant. This man stopped him when the rest of us were too slow.”

The officer held on Talley for a steady count. “Can you swear that.”

Talley shut his lids for a tick and opened them again. “I can swear it.”

The officer weighed Talley’s wound and the stead of his words. He gave one short nod. “What is your name, private?”

“Talley.”

“And yours?”

“Jonathan Hartwell.”

He pointed two men out. “Take statements and set a guard. Get those weapons to one side. Fetch a surgeon for the wounded. You.” He faced me again. “You kept your feet?”

“I did what I could,” I said.

He turned to the gate and the line of the road. The sound of marching still ran like thunder.

“We pass this point before dusk,” he said. “We leave a detachment to hold and clean. The rest move. We are short on gunners, and you have the look of a man who can count powder. You will go to the battery.”

“I’m infantry,” I said. “Not artillery.”

“You are what we need,” he answered. “Can you step to a wheel and not flinch?”

“I can stand a wheel,” I said.

“Good,” he said. “Report to the nearest section. Captain Willoughby. Battery H. They will show you the ropes.”

Talley caught my sleeve. “Go,” he said. “Don’t sit with this place in your head till it eats you like worms.”

“I will not leave you,” I told him.

“You will,” he said, trying a grin without the strength for it. “I have had my fill of marching.” He pressed his fingers to mine for a second, then let go. The men lifted him and carried him out. He raised his hand a little to me as he passed and looked away.

The officer wheeled his horse and the column poured through, files on files, the ground giving back the beat. The white lifted in shreds that trailed along the stockade.

• repetitively petting the kittens might make them smell different to their mother (cats sometimes leave their own kittens cus they do not recognise their scent and thus think they are not their kittens)

• I've also noticed people are constantly taking photos of them (a lot of them using flash) stop doing it, you're disturbing them (ive seen many take photos while the kittens are asleep, disturbing their rest)

• Stop feeding them (random things, one commenter said coffee, and other stuff which might not be harmful to you but can be to the cats) plus it would make the cats dependent on humans which wont be good for their survival

• BONUS: I know a lot of you guys are just taking photos for the insta/snap clout so can yall stop ik a lot of yall dont actually fucking care

Sharing what I practice; please share your thoughts (and experiences, if you decide to experiment with it!).  


I do “Chess Board Fasting”: alternate eating in first and second halves of the day, e.g. 10am-3pm and 3-8pm (looks like a chess board in the calendar!).

  
Upsides:   
Full protein/caloric intake each calendar day, while creating 24h fasting window every 48h (e.g. 3pm-3pm). Several meals per day make it easier to stay in ketosis while getting high protein. Hunger peaks in AM hours, so the edge can be taken off with coffee/tea. It also allows for social flexibility: if there’s an important dinner or breakfast planned, I can just shift the plan by a day so my feeding window aligns with the event. The approach can also be modified for longer fasting: e.g. 32h with 8-11am & 6-9pm feeding windows.

  
Downsides:  
I haven’t observed any. I was worried about the circadian rhythm, but all is fine so far.



PS: I optimise for regular >>16h fasting episodes with low risk and stable energy & protein intake.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chicago White Sox vs. Minnesota Twins: A Tale of Ninth-Inning Magic and Questionable Batting Averages**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a game that’s like a box of baseball-themed cereal—some pieces are crunchy (the White Sox’s ninth-inning rally), others are just soggy (the Twins’ offense). Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire who’s never missed a call… until last Tuesday.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The **Minnesota Twins** (-149) are the favorites, which means bookmakers think they’re about 60% likely to win. The **Chicago White Sox** (+125) are underdogs, implying a 44.4% chance. But here’s the twist: the White Sox have won 36.5% of their games as underdogs this season, while the Twins have only won 48.1% when favored. It’s like the Twins are a reliable coffee maker (“I’ll get the job done, but I’m not *exciting*”), while the White Sox are a toaster oven that occasionally bursts into flames (*dramatic last-minute saves*).

Key pitching stats? **Taj Bradley** (Twins) has a 4.82 ERA, which is about as reliable as a umbrella in a hurricane. **Shane Smith** (White Sox) sports a 3.81 ERA and a 2.24 K/BB ratio, making him the equivalent of a human windbreaker—less flair, more function. The Twins’ offense ranks 24th in runs per game (4.2), while the White Sox slug 4.0 per contest. In short, these teams are like two accountants arguing over who has the better tax strategy—*boring*, but with a hint of desperation.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Rallies, and the Eternal Struggle of HR Hitters

The White Sox just pulled off a *dramatic* ninth-inning win against the Twins, thanks to Michael A. Taylor’s go-ahead double and Brooks Baldwin’s ability to steal bases like a parkour enthusiast on a coffee high. That victory gave them a four-game winning streak, which is about as sustainable as a diet consisting solely of pizza rolls.

On the Twins’ side? Their offense is sputtering, hitting just 1.2 HRs per game. Byron Buxton (.272 AVG, 29 HR) is their lone bright spot, but even he can’t outslug a team that slugs .397. Meanwhile, Tre

Some of my interests include but aren’t limited to:
- Hiking and exploring outdoors, especially dog friendly places I can bring my Great Pyrenees with me to!
- Exploring fun old buildings and places with cool architecture 
- Photography (probably my biggest passion and often gets mixed into the first two things)
- art (mostly sketching and painting)
- creative writing
- coffee, there is never enough and would really enjoy someone to explore all the little coffee places downtown with! 
- gardening (especially tropical plants and succulents!!)
- horseback riding, although my options for this are rather limited here I’m guessing 
- archery (although I’m not very good at it, and would actually enjoy some lessons if anyone knows anyone giving classes in it)


I would also be open to new activities that get me outside and around people if anyone knows of any groups that meet up regularly and could explain what the group is about. Heck, I’d even join a book club at this point 😂


If anyone knows of any groups for any of these things or is already part of a small group of friends that do any of these activities, and you don’t mind a new tag along, I would love to get out and meet some new people. I have tried looking on meet up and in other social media groups without much luck. So short of wearing a sign when I go out 😅 this is probably my last shot lol.

I'm Danica Odette Moureaux, and I just launched my debut novel, ***She Who Devours the Stars***, and I wanted to introduce myself to this community. 

# About me:

I'm that person who thinks heaven is a day spent gardening followed by hiding in a library with a good book and excellent coffee. My cats are my writing companions (and harshest critics), and my ultimate dream is to live as some eccentric witch-botanist in a secluded forest where the locals whisper rumors about the strange woman who talks to ravens. Basically, I want to be the mysterious forest witch of folklore.

# About the story:

It's a mythpunk space opera about Fern Meldin, a nineteen year old disaster lesbian who goes looking for a hookup and accidentally bonds with a sentient, emotionally volatile mythship. What starts as cosmic bad luck becomes a galaxy-spanning adventure filled with found family, enemies to lovers romance, and the kind of sapphic chaos that makes gods jealous.

# Themes I was exploring:

I'm fascinated by the idea of queer normativity in speculative worlds. What happens when being LGBTQ+ isn't the conflict, it's part of the baseline? In Fern's universe, her sexuality is never questioned (and gosh, maybe sometimes it should be, iykyk.) Instead, the tension comes from her reality-bending powers and tendency to make terrible decisions at critical moments, in a galaxy ruled by an authoritarian government bent on controlling her narrative. I wanted to dig into both nuclear family and found family dynamics, and how traumatized people (and mythships) learn to trust again.

The other big theme I jumped at was agency within overwhelming systems. How do you maintain your humanity when cosmic forces are literally trying to reshape you into their weapon? What happens when your physics-altering sex re-aligns satellites? 

# How this mess came to be:

Honestly? I sat down intending to write a simple space opera/cyberpunk love story. But the more I thought about it, the more I didn't want to write about a coming out narrative. I wanted to write the space opera I needed as a teenager, one that touched on so many different struggles I've seen in myself and younger generations.

If you're neurodivergent, it's about suddenly having a brain that works differently than everyone expects, and learning that your ""glitches"" might actually be superpowers, while navigating a world that wants to medicate or contain what makes you different.

If you're dealing with trauma, it's about that moment when something changes you fundamentally, and you have to rebuild your identity around this new reality while people either fear you, or fetishize your pain.

If you're queer in any way, it's about the exhaustion of being seen as either a threat or a curiosity, never just as a person, and finding your people among other dangerous misfits who actually get it.

If you're chronically ill or disabled, it's about your body doing things beyond your control, and society swinging between treating you like you're fragile or like you're faking it.

If you've ever felt too much anger or passion, been too intense, it's about learning that maybe the problem isn't your emotions, but a world that can't handle your full spectrum of feeling.

I wanted to write about the universal experience of becoming something the world doesn't have a category for, and finding family among other uncategorizable people. Plus, I figured if I was going to explore heavy themes, I might as well do it with really good coffee, sentient spaceships with attachment issues, street food miracles, and the kind of banter that makes you forget you're reading about a polycule of absolute disasters.

I’ve been struggling with stomach issues and reflux for over a year now. Before, I sometimes had heartburn, but only after alcohol or spicy food. In January 2024, I had appendicitis and surgery, and after that my life turned into a nightmare. Almost every meal now causes heartburn unless I stick to a very strict diet.

In the past, I had a wild youth with a lot of alcohol. But for about 4 years now I haven’t been drinking at all — before it was just on holidays, and for the past 2 years not a single drop.

Maybe stress also plays a role — heavy workload, the war in my country, my father’s pancreatic cancer and his death. I think about all of this, but I try to stay calm. Still, maybe deep down I’m under a lot of stress.

Since January of this year I started a new job, and on top of everything, I developed a cough. In the first months it was shocking — I could cough for 5 hours non-stop. I went to the ER about 3 times in a single month, and they just told me it would pass. No real explanations. The cough started dry and later became wet with clear mucus. I used to vape but then quit. Sometimes I smoke cigarettes, but never on an empty stomach. I know they make me feel worse, so I try not to smoke.

After certain foods I feel really bad: pain in the upper stomach and the sensation that food is stuck. Sometimes I feel nauseous. And when I eat something really heavy, the pain gets so bad that vomiting is the only thing that helps.

I also had pain under my right ribs. Doctors thought it might be my gallbladder, but everything looked normal. The pain went away on its own.

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with stomach pain and nausea, and I vomit white foam — afterwards I feel better, but the next day is ruined. This has happened a few times.

Sometimes I wake up in the morning feeling like I have a hangover — dizziness, nausea, stomach pain, sluggish reaction — but I don’t drink alcohol.

I tried **Reflux Gourmet**, but it didn’t really help. I’ve also taken omeprazole, famotidine, and various antacids — they all only gave short-term relief.  
Even after a barium swallow X-ray, I had gassy burping and started coughing up mucus.

Here are the tests I’ve had so far:

* **Barium swallow X-ray** — all normal.
* **Endoscopy last year** — no abnormalities.
* **Ultrasound** — normal, except they mentioned “coarse liver echotexture,” which I think was from all the painkillers I took before.
* **Bloodwork** — nothing major, except low iron saturation.

But still, I can’t drink coffee or alcohol, and even chocolate makes me feel worse. Sometimes even regular food causes severe symptoms.

I don’t know what to do anymore. If all the tests are normal but my symptoms persist — does this mean I just have a sensitive stomach? Or could it be LPR/GERD that doesn’t always show up on endoscopy? Before, I never had such strong reactions — I lived a normal life. Now, when I see people eating delicious food on TV shows, I literally cry because I can’t eat what I actually enjoy. I’m so tired of strict diets. At work I’m always hungry, because I work long hours and constant small snacks every 2 hours don’t really fill me up.

1n8fito,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1n8fito/how_do_i_deal_with_women_making_me_uncomfortable/,How do I deal with women making me uncomfortable in public spaces?,"I'm not sure how to phrase this, but my question is related to women's safety and also my well being in public spaces. I am someone who is concerned with women's safety and well being in public spaces, especially places where social interaction wouldn't really be expected; ie. library, train station, walking on the street, even coffee shops, etc. If I feel like I might be invading their space or making them uncomfortable I'll deliberately move away from them, slow down while walking, move seats, etc. The thing is I feel that women do not reciprocate this and it actually makes me uncomfortable. I feel like women don't really approach men, instead they just kind of sit close to you and awkwardly glance at you a bunch, like they're expecting you to talk to them. That's ok, but the problem I'm having is that a lot of the time I don't want to talk when this is happening. I'll be at a nearly empty coffee shop and some woman sits at the table right next to me, facing me sitting there glancing at me for like 20 minutes, saying nothing. Meanwhile I'm on my laptop, wearing headphones, trying to avoid making eye contact. I have no problem talking to anyone in public and often welcome a conversation but there's a certain body language that people have when they're open to chatting and it is not what I'm doing when I'm describing these interactions.   
  
Here's another example. I went to the library to get work done, while I was getting out of my car I made eye contact with a woman getting in her car next to mine, smiled, waved, then went inside to sit at a table and start working. Ten minutes later the same woman comes in and sits at the table right next to mine; there's at least 3 other empty tables. Ok, no big deal. I don't really look up, as I'm kind of hunched over trying to focus (wearing headphones). After about 40 minutes I look up and stretch a little and that woman is sitting facing me, it feels like watching me work. Her body language screams like someone who wants to talk. It makes me super nervous and I can no longer focus. At one point she even asked if I was using the outlet or sometime. Maybe I'm overreacting but it actually feels like this person is staring and it makes me uncomfortable.

So I guess what I'm saying is that I feel like women use rhetoric about their safety to moderate public spaces. I completely understand and try to give women space in turn, but it does not feel like that level of understanding is extended to me. I don't want to be rude to these people but I feel like if they want to talk they should approach, ask if I want to talk, and then accept a yes or no answer, instead of just waiting nearby and staring at someone. In fact it feels like women moderate public spaces with their level of comfort and not safety. I don't want to be rude or standoffish because sometimes I am open to talking with strangers but sometimes I'm really just trying to focus. I guess it's not really that big of a deal but it kind of bothers me that these people don't seem to understand body language at all, to the point where it makes me uncomfortable.

1n8feq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n8feq7/investigate_if_ispring_f9k_reverse_osmosis_water/,Investigate if iSpring F9K Reverse Osmosis Water Filter Replacement Pack is Worth It Review,"The iSpring F9K NSF Certified 1-Year Reverse Osmosis Water Filter Replacement Pack is a product I've been testing recently, and it's left quite an impression. Designed specifically for 6-stage RO systems, this replacement pack is rich in features that make it both practical and efficient. Over the past few months, I’ve been using it to maintain my home's reverse osmosis system, and I’ve got some insights to share for anyone considering it.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed about this filter replacement pack is its well-thought-out design. It includes nine replacement filters packed efficiently, wrapped individually to preserve quality and ensure longevity. The materials—polypropylene, granular activated carbon, and carbon block—scream durability and reliability. I particularly appreciate the compact dimensions (2.5"" x 2.5"" x 10""), which allow it to fit seamlessly into standard reverse osmosis housings. These filters feel solid yet lightweight, weighing just around 2.7 kilograms overall. It’s amazing how well thought out the engineering is, which makes setting them up a hassle-free experience.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**

Performance-wise, the filtration system works like a charm. I was genuinely surprised at how crisp and clean the water tasted after the installation. The pack includes sediment filters, granular carbon filters, carbon block filters, post-carbon filters, and alkaline filters—all working together to deliver water that’s not only safe but delicious. I even tested it for cooking purposes and noticed an improvement in coffee and tea flavors. Moreover, the alkaline filters manage to restore beneficial minerals like calcium and magnesium, balancing the pH levels of the water. It does wonders for ice cubes, baby formula, and simply refreshing hydration for the family.

[Check iSpring F9K price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00boasj1m/)

**Ease of Installation**

Replacing filters has always been one of my least favorite chores, but these are a different story. Updated with push-fit, quick-connect fittings, the process is quick and painless. I didn’t have to spend hours fiddling with connectors or re-reading the manual a dozen times. That said, I did have to consult the guide for the first replacement, but it was more out of caution than necessity. Anyone who has ever struggled with complicated setups would appreciate how simple the system is. Even if you’re not very tech-savvy, you should have this up and running in no time.

**Highlights**

- High-capacity cartridges provide a full year of filtration for 6-stage systems.
- Restores essential minerals such as calcium and magnesium for healthier, better-tasting water.
- Standard 10” x 2.5” size fits the majority of under-sink RO housings.
- Quick-connect design simplifies filter replacement.
- Improves taste, smell, and safety for drinking and cooking.

**Critiques**

While the iSpring F9K delivers in most areas, there are some imperfections worth mentioning. 

- The pack doesn’t include a replacement RO membrane, which could be an inconvenience for first-time users. 
- Filters are only compatible with 6-stage systems, limiting their versatility.   
- Initial installation can feel a bit intimidating to beginners unfamiliar with some plumbing setups.  
- The lack of comprehensive visual instructions in the manual might leave certain users reliant on customer support.  

**Competitive Options**

When stacked against other reverse osmosis filter replacements, like APEC ROES-PHUV or Express Water ROALK5D, this product finds itself in the upper tier in terms of build and filtration efficiency. The APEC system rivals it with its UV sterilization feature but doesn’t include the same level of pH balancing. Meanwhile, Express Water offers a more budget-friendly option, yet it's missing the same longevity and mineral restoration that iSpring provides. What iSpring excels in is balancing health benefits with reliable filtering while staying fairly competitive in cost.

**Value for Money**

Considering the features packed into this replacement filter system, it’s safe to say it represents substantial value for its price point. The inclusion of components like dual alkaline filters and push-fit connections stands out, especially when compared to other brands. This feels particularly satisfying for households that prioritize clean, healthy drinking water. However, the exclusion of the RO membrane could make the total system investment feel pricier, depending on your setup. Either way, you're investing in a product that guarantees excellent results.

I've heard the name lifetime and I looked and some of those are super nice and pretty much what I described even have bars and cafes. Im curious what you all think. Can we petition them to come if enough of us want it? I think it would be steep like $250 a month maybe for one adult and child, but idk w no family help I feel like that wouldn't be the worst, the YMCA is like $80 which is a far cry from $250 but it'd be nice for the husband to have a break too if I wanted to like get my nails done or a hair cut.",1,1757004384.0,kzoo,2,0.6,False
1n8fe05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1n8fe05/ranking_ingredients_by_importance/,Ranking ingredients by importance,"Hi all,

I wanted to come up with a way to measure how important each ingredient is, so I could prioritize which ingredient mons to hunt for that I didn't already have a good farmer for.

To do this, I used the following formula:

Importance score = sum of (weight * #ingredient needed/10) for relevant recipes.

Info as to how I decided weights and which recipes are relevant is at the end of the post.

Results:

8.0 - Coffee
7.4 - Sausage
7.3 - Apple
7.0 - Egg
6.1 - Leek
5.6 - Tomato
5.4 - Milk
4.8 - Honey
4.0 - Soybean
3.9 - Potato
3.6 - Cocoa
3.6 - Ginger
3.2 - Mushroom
3.1 - Oil
1.6 - Corn
0 - Herb
0 - Tails

------------

Conclusion

Unsurprisingly, coffee is the most important ingredient, as its release was accompanied by the introduction of the most powerful dishes of every type at the time.

Sausages and Eggs find themselves in many curry and salad dishes, and apples are involved in both dessert and salads now with the new recipe. (I think that this method overstates the importance of an apple farmer though, since many good mons like Garde, Dedenne, Raichu can find apples naturally).

Herbs are at 0 (see my later note about excluding inferno curry) - I've said this from time to time, that herbs are currently the most useless ingredient, you can go through the game entirely bypassing inferno curry and be no worse for wear, and it plays little role in salad and dessert weeks. Tails are also 0, which may not be surprising - useful for showing off big Sunday crits as filler, but in my opinion more of a gimmick than a staple.

In summary, spend the time to find a really good grubbin and aron/charizard. I believe Dragonite is currently a trap / waste of resources, as all 3 of its ingredients are low importance, although I wouldn't be surprised if they release a new herb-heavy recipe with Amber Canyon to bring Dnite back into relevance.

Curious to know what you guys think, open to any feedback regarding calculating importance! And hope this is helpful for some people trying to decide where to focus their efforts / spend their biscuits.

-----------

Methods

For weights, a weight of 1 is given to the top 2 recipes for each dish type - HP Stew, Sukiyaki, Eclairs, Zing Zap, Apple Acid, Defiant.

A weight of 0.5 is given to the strongest 2 recipes that you can cook without GCT - the Ninjas, Petal, Dream Eater, Scones. I omitted Flan since its base power is considerably behind the other options, so I don't think many people are planning around cooking this (but correct me if I'm wrong!)

For example, potatoes get a score of 1*22 for Defiant, 0.5*15 for petal, and 0.5*18 for dream eater, all divided by 10 (just to make numbers nicer) for a total score of 3.85.

Notably, Inferno curry and macarons are excluded. I wasn't sure what others do with these recipes, but my thought process was essentially, if you're using pot ups or GCT, you'd rather cook the best recipes, so these aren't actually that important to be able to cook. Open to feedback on this point. When our pot size expands to 77, their Importance will definitely shoot back up.

This is just one of 70,000 odd people's experiences. Some will be wildly different, I'm more of a daytime person.

9AM - wake up because the tent is \~85-90F. Could turn on the fans and sleep more, but feeling well rested enough.

9AM - 11AM bum around camp. Drink a liter of water with electrolytes and a coffee. Put some oats out in the sun to rehydrate, eat those around 11 with some chicken from the cooler (mixed together or not? I'll never tell...). Mainly just stare into blank space processing the day before, say hi to neighbors, people watch. Maybe read a bit or journal. No real worrying about the time passing or what the day holds. Sunscreen with 70SPF aggressively, recharge bike lights and headlamps off solar.

11AM-11:30AM run to arctica for ice and restock the coolers.

12AM crack a beer or two and 'plan' the day. Throw on some shorts or just wrap a pashmina on like a skirt. Accessorize to match my current vibes.

Noonish to 3-4PM - grab the bike, pick a direction and put around.

* Maybe go to open playa, spot something on the horizon and bike to it. Repeat for an hour or two.
* Maybe bike down some inner street stopping at any camp that's promoting something. Grab a seat at the bar if free, strike up a conversation with the people there. Get to know them a bit, have a beverage. Maybe get a cool new pendant too.
* Watch a burlesque show.
* Listen to a talk by a Sadhguru devotee on regenerative farming and how it's good for our souls.
* Pick up MOOP on the streets or playa. How did a AA battery get *here?*

4PM-5PM bum around camp again. Chatting, reading, eat lunch.

* See a zombie wondering by, check if they're OK. 20% of the time zombies need a place to sit and anchor themselves, provide that and nurse zombie back to health.
* Ruminate on how much business Dolls Kill must have done last month as flocks of filler-enhanced types zip by on ebikes. Realize they're so focused on getting to some art car I could probably be helicoptering my johnson and they wouldn't notice. Don't test the theory (this year...).

5PM through sunset, head out. Probably to a sound camp, art car or Blackrock Philharmonic. Hang out for a few hours until I get antsy. Marvel at the world's highest concentration of moon boots and consider the corollary that it's also probably the world's highest concentration of rolled ankles.

Nighttime - marvel at the city from open playa. Enjoy feeling overwhelmed by the possibilities when this many people come together to gift magical experiences to others.

* If I'm more energetic, pedal around letting my ears be the guide - if I like the music somewhere, stop and hang out and dance. See incredibly talented DJs on the side streets playing unique music. Hear the Beatport Top 100 at Playground (Yamore? Again?). Go back to side streets.
* If I'm feeling more chill, see who's gifting a bar and cruise in and get to know the people there. Peach margarita or peach aperitif? Dunno, but there's far too few assless chaps in this peach themed bar.
* See a wizard inviting me into his camp's pagan alchemist tent and check that out. They have blacklight markers so sit a bit and decorate my hat more.
* Learn about light-sensitive fabrics. Draw fun squiggles because I have no artistic training. Smile and the impermanence of my magical light squiggles and plan to get some of this stuff back home.
* Consider graciously receiving shawarma. Opt not to because the port-o-potties haven't been serviced in  a day and I am not a gambler.

2AM or thereabouts - back at camp. Wash the pits and bits with a baby wipe, spray the feet and hands with some diluted witch hazel and moisturize. Asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow and sleep like a baby to do it again tomorrow.

Addressing the Elephant in the Room, some of those new items are behind a premium gateway (akin to ""buy me a coffee a month"" pricing model) which I'll use to pay for the hosting and further development of the site...  

... Lots of the site still remains free to use (and everything that is there now will continue to be free indefinitely)... I will also continue to add items to the free tier that make sense (like the new asset types that were recently added or the ""Nominal vs Real"" switch) and provide fixes for anything in that remit too.

Obviously I welcome feedback on the above, so please post it up (again, either as reply here or on the discord community that is linked from the website).

I'll keep on plugging away at the site and adding more features!

1n8fa42,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1n8fa42/approaching_a_girl_really_works/,Approaching a girl really works,"Gonna be a long post.

So, recently I moved to a tier 1 city and was lonely asf my school friends were also in the same city so we decided to hangout.

We went to a mall and goddamn that mall was filled with people. We were roaming from one shop to other buying clothes, caps, watches.

After doing all this my friend said that he wanted buy shoes, so we went to a show store while he was busy searching for shoes and trying them on my other friend and I were checking shoes on the other side.

Then two girls entered into the store and damn they were beautiful also they were from Northeast, and I have a thing for asian looking people(no I am not being racist please understand, I grew up watching actresses like Jamie Chung and had a huge crush on Mulan).

I said to my friend ""She is so cute i think I am in love""(😭😭 please girls don't attack me that's how we boys talk with eachother), my friend saw them and said yeah they are cute.

So those two girls were checking out shoes and me and my friend were talking about whether we should approach or not, he was hyping me up and I was hyping him up (lmaooo 🤣).

They were checking out shoes and my friend and I were still hyping eachother up and I had enough and thought of approaching her myself, but before approaching (and I am not even joking 😭) I legit opened my phone and searched how to approach a girl in India 😭😭😭😭😭, I read some points lmaoooooo and some ways to compliment.

I decided to compliment her eyes at first but thought I would look racist and decided to compliment her shoes.

My heart started racing, sweating and hands shaking 😭🙏, i clenched my hands tightly and told myself fuck it I will go talk to her.

As soon as I went near her my FUCKING BRAIN FORGOT EVERYTHING 😭🥲

After 2sec like that I smiled and said excuse me, hi(yes a simple hi) she said hi back and I said I love your shoes they are samba right? She said yeah they are thanks.

I asked her how much did they cost she told me some value(I forgot Lmao), then I introduced myself and my friend to her and her friend, we started talking about ourselves(like the states we are from and our culture) and in the middle of the conversation we exchanged our insta.

We talked for a while and I asked her whether they would be ok to grab a coffee with us they said they wanted to go somewhere and it was urgent, I said it's ok and we parted our ways.

So after all this I went back to my PG and started thinking whether I should text her or not, i texted her the next day and we started having a conversation and I asked her whether she is single or not (😭😭😭😭🙏) she said she was seeing someone else, I said ok and diverted the topic (I was crying inside 😭😭) I thought I was ugly that's why she rejected me.

But my friend was texting with her friend and damn they already planned a date(😭😭😭 MF got himself a cute girl and the irony is I was the one who approached them😭) 

I told him to ask whether her friend (the one I approached) was seeing someone else, he asked her and said that she really was seeing someone else(like she met someone from a dating app) and I was relieved cause she really was dating someone else lol.

So yeah approaching a girl really works.

This wasn't my first approach tho i approached girls in my college as well and I got rejected most of the times(70% of the times) either they have a boyfriend or I was just ugly for them.

So, if you planning on approaching here are some tips:- 

1) Approach with A FUCKING SMILE (A GENUINE ONE) ON YOUR FACE.

2) Just a simple excuse me hi is enough don't overdo it 

3) Compliment her fashion sense or shoes or anyother or her eyes(kinda risky but women do have beautiful eyes)

4) SMELL NICE(USE A DEODORANT AND A PERFUME WITH CITRUS AND WOOD NOTES), MOST IMPORTANT IS HYGIENE, THE WAY YOU STYLE YOUR HAIR AND HAVE SOME SKINCARE IT WILL TAKE YOU PLACES.

5) DRESS NICELY, DON'T WEAR SKINNY JEANS 😭🙏PLEASE, A PLAIN WHITE SHIRT(PREFERABLY LINEN) COMBINED WITH RELAXED FIT JEANS(BLUE) WILL DO THE MAGIC And some shoes white ones or suede sneakers, a watch that's all.

6) and finally BE READY TO GET REJECTED, IF SHE REJECTS YOU RESPECT HER BOUNDARIES AND BACK OUT. You might have got rejected but atleast you tried.

7) Don't use DARK HUMOUR and don't say the word like fuck and shit, don't keep your hands in the pocket(i used to do this lol) 

8) WOMEN AREN'T ALIENS TALK TO THEM LIKE HOW YOU TALK TO RANDOM STRANGERS IN YOUR COLLEGE.

""He wanted to get back at me for something he'd thought I'd done, but I'm sure you noticed that no matter what your plans were, if I called him to help with Winnie, he'd come running. And I know you saw him carry me out of the club house after the shooting. Whether or not you remember it, I don't know, but it happened. He saved me, he focused on me as the mother of his child instead of looking after you.""

""And?"" I prompted her to continue since I knew there was more.

""And there's a reason he's never made you his ol' lady. He moved you in to rub you in my face, but he never once made a move to claim you. The man has a temper, and he can hold a grudge, but after the shooting and him fearing for my life, not yours, when he was faced with losing me, he apologized and told me he wanted us to get back together and try again. Those near-death experiences can change a man.""

She was looking for a reaction I refused to give.

—

""Gotta go to church, Euphemia,"" Rogue was telling me, but his face was concerned. ""There's some club business that I have to be there for, and if my presence wasn't required, I wouldn't leave you. It shouldn't take more than an hour, and Dayton's going to come sit with you while I'm gone.""

It was now four weeks post-shooting and tomorrow night, Friday night, I planned on making my escape.

""I don't need anyone,"" I said from the couch, and tomorrow I'd prove it.

Did you pick up on the subtext, there, Rogue? Notice there were no qualifiers to my statement?

For the last few days, I'd been up and walking more, and I moved from the bedroom to the living room, tired of being in one room, sick of being in such a small space with Rogue and his constant worried/concerned/pseudo-caring glances. When I'd made my move, Rogue had also moved his base of operations from the bedroom to the dining room so he could continue keeping watch over me. It almost seemed like he cared...until I remembered him covering Angelica's body with his own, of him scooping her up and running out of the clubhouse with her held carefully in his arms without even giving a single thought to me.

Her smile as he carried her away.

""I don't want you alone until you're one hundred percent, Euphemia. I feel guilty enough leaving you now.""

Now is not the time you need to feel guilty. The time for guilt would have been four weeks ago, if we want to get technical.

He seemed to be waiting for me to say something, and when I didn't, he came closer to me. ""I'll be back as soon as I can. Dayton just texted me that she'll be here in a minute, so I'm going to go.""

No response.

""Effie?""

""You're blocking the TV,"" I said.

""Sorry. I'll be back as soon as we're done.""

Stepping out of the way, he walked out the front door. About a minute later, I heard the back door open and then, seconds later, the front door did.

For a minute, I thought he'd forgotten something, but then I saw it was Angelica walking into his house. She'd probably been watching from her house, waiting for him to leave.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked her, my voice unwelcoming. There was no longer a reason to pretend since I'd be gone after tomorrow.

Her fugging smile.

""Just stopped by for a chat. I've been wanting to set the record straight, and with all the brothers at church, there's no better time.""

""You can leave,"" I said. ""After all the lies you told about me to the ol' ladies, I have no interest in your straight record.""

""A necessary precaution so you didn't get too comfortable around here, and those sycophants will believe whatever I tell them to believe, especially where Winnie's concerned.""

She stopped speaking for a minute and then she went in for the kill. ""Did Rogue ever tell you he's Winnie's father?""

All of my internal organs dropped to my gut, and it was only due to the weeks of maintaining a blank expression around Rogue that I was able to keep my face neutral. Inside, I was a complete disaster, crying and screaming. He'd saved the mother of his child. A child he'd never told me was his. I could see it, now that she'd told me. Winnie did have Rogue's hair color, the dimples just like his that were visible even when they weren't smiling, eyes that had always seemed so familiar to me.

For eighteen months, this man had never told me he had a child, but for the entire time I'd lived with him, it'd been right there for me to see. He'd prioritized Winnie whenever Angelica said she needed help with her, and I'd often wondered why, of all the men who were supposed to be helping her, Angelica always called on Rogue.

I said nothing to her, though.

She was busily swiping through her phone, and turned the screen for me to see a series of pictures.

Angelica standing with her back to Rogue's front, his arms around her, hands on her very pregnant belly. The same pose, but with her face tilted up toward his, their mouths joined in a peck.

Rogue in the hospital with her, pressing another peck to her mouth, Rogue holding a tiny Winnie in his arm, his arm around Angelica in the hospital bed.

Pictures of the three of them through the years until they stopped suddenly, and based on the age of Winnie in the pictures, it was about a year or so ago, maybe just as Rogue and I had started dating.

""We had a falling out and he hooked up with you,"" Angelica said. ""He wanted to get back at me for something he'd thought I'd done, but I'm sure you noticed that no matter what your plans were, if I called him to help with Winnie, he'd come running. And I know you saw him carry me out of the club house after the shooting. Whether or not you remember it, I don't know, but it happened. He saved me, he focused on me as the mother of his child instead of looking after you.""

""And?"" I prompted her to continue since I knew there was more.

""And there's a reason he's never made you his ol' lady. He moved you in to rub you in my face, but he never once made a move to claim you. The man has a temper, and he can hold a grudge, but after the shooting and him fearing for my life, not yours, when he was faced with losing me, he apologized and told me he wanted us to get back together and try again. Those near-death experiences can change a man.""

She was looking for a reaction I refused to give.

""He said as soon as you were healed, he'd ask you to leave so he and Winnie and I could be a family again.""

I'd thought watching him save Angelica was the worst pain I could experience, but hearing all of this was beyond even that deep pain.

""Anyway, I wanted to offer to help you leave. Him using you the way he did, it wasn't right, and if I were you, I'd want to sink through the floor and disappear. I can help you do that.""

How altruistic of her to offer to help me leave. Since she was lying about her reasons for offering to help me leave, I was going to lie right back, tell her two lies that I hoped would make this bimbo squirm.

""I'll leave when I hear it from Rogue that he wants me to leave. And maybe he won't ask me to take off once he finds out I'm going to be the mother of his second child.""

Blinking up at her, I had the satisfaction of watching her face turn red with anger.

Smile at me again as I'm bleeding out, bimbo.

""He'll never choose your child over Winnie.""

I shrugged, smiling at her now. ""We'll see.""

""If you think the lies I told the women before were bad, that's nothing compared to what I'm about to hit you with now.""

Then she left, doing the stereotypical door slam on her way out, and I sat back on the couch, feeling as if my world had just tilted and I'd gone sliding off of it.

""Effie?""

I gave a startled shout as Dayton came into the room.

""You scared me,"" I said, then remembered that I'd heard the back door open just before Angelica had walked into the house.

""I heard all that,"" she said, her face pale.

""Did you know? About Winnie being his?""

She shook her head. ""No, but I came into the club just after you did.""

And Bat had already made her his ol' lady while I had no status as anybody's anything.

""I'm sorry, Effie. I don't know what else there is to say to that, but I am sorry. Rogue...he asked me not to say anything about the shooting to you.""

""Now we know why, but no worries; that's not on you.""

""I've never liked her, never liked the power she had as the president's sister. She always gave me a bad vibe, so I tried not to spend much time around her.""

Dayton sat down beside me. ""I recorded her just now. I got almost everything except the very beginning.""

So maybe an ally, I thought. Could I trust her?

Then I took the plunge and asked for her help, which she readily agreed to give me.

When Rogue walked in an hour and a half later, I was glad he was used to me not looking at him for the last month because I actually thought I'd be sick if I had to meet his eyes.

""How was everything while I was gone? You OK?"" he asked, coming over to sit on the coffee table across from me.

Dayton had left when he texted to say he was on his way back, with a promise not to say a word to Bat until after tomorrow night's MC dinner. The club had a tradition of a weekly Friday night, family-style dinner to build club camaraderie and loyalty, Rogue had told me. I'd endured them before, and Rogue and I sat together during dinner, but after we finished eating, I told him I wanted to go help the club girls with clean up since I felt more comfortable there, behind the scenes because of my shyness.

""This many people is a lot for me,"" I'd said, and then he'd peck me and tell me to go do whatever I wanted to feel more comfortable.

""I'm fine,"" I said in answer to his question. ""I was thinking...maybe we could go to the club dinner tomorrow night? I've been cooped up a while and maybe that would be a good first step to getting back out there.""

""Anything, Euphemia. We'll go, and if you get too tired, I'll bring you home right away.""

His voice was relieved. Maybe because it was one step closer to getting me gone? Maybe Angelica had been lying, but I couldn't know and didn't intend to find out. The bottom line was, whether she'd told the truth about anything or not, Rogue still hadn't saved me, still hadn't cared enough to see if I was OK after the shooting.

The following night, we'd all just finished eating and I knew it was time. Dayton had come in a few minutes late to dinner and had given me a barely discernible nod before she'd taken her seat next to Bat.

Standing, I gathered my courage as everyone's eyes turned to me. I never drew attention to myself so they knew something was up.

""It's been four long weeks since the shooting,"" I said. ""Four long weeks of recovery. I guess dying twice takes some time to get over.""

That caused a murmur because I don't think it was widely known.

""I'd like to thank Dayton for saving my life. She found me after the shooting when I was bleeding out and if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have survived until the ambulance arrived. So thank you, Dayton. I'm eternally grateful to you for the concern and care you showed to me.""

I raised my glass to her.

""To Dayton.""

Everyone else toasted to her, and she smiled sadly at me.

""Next, I'd like to thank everyone else who came to visit me while I was recovering.""

Pausing, I looked around the table. ""I'd like to name names, but since not one of you -- not even one -- came to see how I was doing in four weeks, there aren't any to name. Even if you hated me, any decent person would have checked on someone who'd been shot and almost lost her life.""

It was like we were playing Statues, with everyone frozen in place. A Friday night dinner had never been so silent.

""And that's probably because of all of the lies Angelica told everyone about me. Lies specifically told to make it so no one would befriend me. Lies about horrible things she said I did to Winnie that I didn't do. Keep your mouth shut,"" I pointed at Angelica as she opened her mouth to pop off. ""This is my time to set the record straight and you're going to keep your lying, fkking mouth shut.""

Then the hardest confrontation of all, and I met Rogue's eyes for the first time in weeks.

Look at my pain. See what I've hidden from you.

""And Rogue. I lied when I said I couldn't remember anything because it was the only way I knew I could get through the weeks of recovery. The truth is, I remember everything about the shooting. I watched you throw your body over Angelica's to cover her. I saw you checking her over after the shooting, seeing her bloody arm and running out of the clubhouse with her to get her to the hospital. I also saw the nasty smile she gave me as you carried her out in your arms, and not the woman you'd been in a relationship with for all this time. But most of all, Rogue, I saw the way you didn't even look toward me or check on me, leaving me to bIeed out on the floor and that was because you didn't give me a single thought. It never occurred to you to check on me.""

""Euphemia,"" he said, his eyes filled with his betrayal. But what could he say to that? Nothing.

""You can shut it, too. You showed me where I ranked on your priorities, and I never knew why until Angelica came to see me yesterday while you were in church and she very kindly explained everything to me.""

I held up my phone where I had the video Dayton had forwarded to me.

""I'll let this play so you can all hear it. I'm just going to step outside while you listen because I can't bear to hear this again, and I could use some air. Then I'll be back after you figure out who the liars are. We'll have a lot to discuss, Rogue.""

That sounds like I'm coming back, doesn't it?

I put my phone in his hand and hit play. I'd already cranked the volume up.

""I'll be right back,"" I said breathlessly because being brave could steal the very air from your lungs.

As I walked out of the clubhouse, I heard Angelica's recorded voice saying ""...wanting to set the record straight, and with all the brothers at church, there's no better time.""

I pushed out the clubhouse doors while everyone was focused on the recording. Slipping into the waiting car that Dayton had loaded my luggage into, I made my escape.

Skmei 1123: a mark appeared as shown in photo, i thought it was a crack, even i don't remember bump it on anything, however the mark disappeared after few weeks. Apparently it was water that went into the space between watch face and crystal. Although i make sure just hand washing, wash  coffee mug etc because it's 30m water resist.

Skmei 1426: wore it for a few swim sessions in the pool since it's 5atm water resistant. Water went into it on the fifth swim, no diving, just normal swim though. I open the watch up and clean it. Now it's good as new.

So now my skmei watches vs water experience is:
30m WR no more messing with water,  not even hand washing. 
5 atm WR no more swimming, just rain, hand washing, doing dishes.

Your skmei watches may be different. These are just my luck with skmei.

I was in the market for a new grinder. My Kingrinder K6 is starting to fall apart.  I'm a cheap ass so I have a hard time buying things at high price especially with the tariff situation.   I saw this Normcore  v2 Ghost Burr grinder on a heavy discount on Amazon.  I got it for $64.  I love light roast and look for that clarity and love that coffee tea experience.   I noticed the grind is more uniform and round compared to my old K6.  It looks like it produces less fines.   I still think I need to dial it in, it will take me a few days.  I had a good cup of coffee but I didn't get the clarity I was hoping yet.   It does take a lot more turns to grind the coffee.  The effort is less than my Kingrinder.  Anyways it's fun to try out a different type of burr and thought someone might want to do the same.

I am scheduled for a Colonoscopy on Monday. I was under the impression my doctor would prescribe the nasty drink everyone keeps talking about, but to my surprise he recommed the following a low fiber diet and Miralax prep: 

5 days prior: stop multi-vitamins, fish oil and NSAIDS. 
4, 3 and 2 days prior: drink at least 64 Oz of fluids daily and start low fiber diet. Basically no nuts or seeds and no steak or pork, no salads, etc. 
1 day prior: before 8am have light breakfast. Eggs, white bread/toast, coffee or tea. NO FOOD AFTER BREAKFAST only clear liquids. Between 3 and 6pm drink 8oz of Miralax prep every 15 - 20 min. Finish 50% by 8pm. 
9pm take 4 laxative tablets and continue liquids. 
Day of procedure.  Drink remaining Miralax prep and finish it by 7am. Nothing by mouth by 10:30 am. 

My question is: Have any of you done this type of bowel cleanse? I work in the medical field and I have seen colonoscopies done, and I am afraid this prep will not clean my colon good enough! 
Should I ask for the nasty drink instead? 
Any advice?

1n8f437,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n8f437/economically_we_dont_want_ubi/,"Economically, we don't want UBI","Every post in the sub about economics inevitably has folks in the comments talking about how UBI is the only ""good"" future for the U.S. economy, among other options like ""the people revolt"" and ""human extinction"". While I understand that's a popular viewpoint, there are a couple issues I want to address about that that need to be dealt with.

# Work Incentives

People don't decide ""yes, I will work"" or ""no, I will not work"". Instead, people make work choices on a gradient - do I work one more hour, pick up an extra shift, etc. This actually screws UBI pretty hard.

When someone is in that position where they have to decide if it's worth working an extra hour to get, say, $15, that decision is of course going to depend heavily on how much money they're already making. If you're broke, that $15 represents food, shelter, or other things you need very badly. But if you already have $1,000 coming in each month from UBI, that same $15 is just nice-to-have money. The economic principle behind this is **diminishing marginal utility of income.** When you're getting less use out of that $15, you're far less likely to actually work that extra hour - you and all 340 million of your closest friends and neighbors. That has a big impact on our economy overall. Now you have millions of people working fewer hours, which means less goods and services are produced, which means less tax revenue is being created, which means that pie we're pulling the UBI out of is getting progressively smaller.

# We should let the government plan the economy (no, don't do this)

UBI assumes bureaucrats can determine the right amount of money for everyone. With all due respect, we probably shouldn't trust the same U.S. government that completely borked the 2008 crisis to run the economy. The economy is a useful machine because it coordinates billions of individuals' values through the setting of prices. If we simply decide UBI is 1500$ a month, we're ignoring massive variations in regional costs, the circumstances of individuals, and how much they can actually work. What works in rural Alabama might buy you a nice coffee in NYC.

You already know there has to be an ""appeal to Soviet Russia"" here. The Soviet Union tried comprehensive central planning for 70 years and collapsed primarily because it was extremely inefficient. Venezuela's government also attempted to control prices and distribute resources centrally, and all they succeeded at was turning the world's largest oil reserves into a catastrophically poor nation. The economy at present is actually pretty good at distributing resources where they are needed - something we have to supply artificially if we use UBI. Historically the government has been bad at that. I suppose there is an argument here that an AI could do this, but that seems like the sort of thing that needs to be out of the theoretical stage before implementing on a national scale.

# Redistribution of Wealth

I had an economics teacher in high school who said, ""if you redistributed all the money in the U.S. evenly amongst all its citizens, in 10 years the distribution wouldn't be very different from how it was before.""

Let's say we tax the rich at 5% annually to fund UBI. First we have to dispel the Scrooge McDuck image of giant money vaults - most wealth gets reinvested in something productive, which creates jobs and economic growth. A 5% annual wealth tax is very destructive to wealth over time.

Start with $1 million. It grows 8% to $1.08 million, then the government takes 5% of everything ($54,000), leaving $1.026 million. Next year, your wealth grows to $1.108 million, and the government takes $55,400, you keep $1.053 million. Each year the tax takes a bigger bite of your growth until eventually it's eating everything you earn. Now say it's a bad year. Say your $1 million in investments loses 20% and drops to $800,000. You still owe 5% of whatever's left ($40,000 in taxes), forcing you to sell even more. A few bad years plus steady taxes and you are no longer a rich man.

As a side note, this assumes that you *can* successfully tax the rich. That's a lot harder than it sounds, and you end up getting capital flight when you try to do this. The rich people and their businesses simply... move. To countries that don't do this. France has actually done this, and what they discovered is that wealthy French citizens would rather simply move to Belgium or Switzerland - which takes the companies with them, which takes the jobs with them, and France ended up getting less tax revenue than when they started. Oops.

# But wait, companies need consumers with spending power

This mixes up two completely different things. When the economy crashes, governments can borrow money short-term to get things moving again - that's manageable during a crisis. But UBI forever? That requires permanently higher taxes, which crushes the very businesses that supposedly want more customers. The whole logic is backwards anyway. Companies don't need people paying with their government stimulus money - they need people actually making stuff and providing services. If you give everyone $1,000 monthly but fewer people are working, you just get inflation. That $1,000 still buys less groceries if there are fewer people growing food and stocking shelves to begin with.

Again, we have to look at the actual implementations: the economy recovered from the Great Depression, 2008, and COVID not because of government checks, but because people adapted, started new businesses, and found different ways to create *actual value*. Markets are actually pretty good at bouncing back, but only when you have the self-control to let them.

If big companies actually believed UBI would help their bottom line, they'd just give cash to potential customers directly. They don't need the government to do it for them. The fact that they're lobbying for taxpayer-funded programs instead should be telling, because ultimately companies want the benefits without paying the costs themselves.

# But what about when nobody has a job?

This assumes AI will permanently destroy jobs without creating new ones, but that's not how technology has ever worked. I mean OK, *maybe* you're right, and AI is finally the super special technology that will put everyone out of work, but the odds aren't on your side. When tractors replaced farm workers, those people didn't stay unemployed forever, they moved to factories. When factories automated, people moved to service jobs. When computers arrived, they created entire new industries to employ people. The internet killed entire industries, newspaper classified ads, travel agents, video rental stores. Critics in the 1990s worried it would create mass unemployment. Instead, it created millions of jobs that didn't exist before: web developers, social media managers, e-commerce sites, coders. Twitch streamers. Ugh.

The economy doesn't have a fixed number of jobs going around. Because humans will never run out of things they want, there's always more stuff people want done. AI might eliminate some jobs, but it also makes workers more productive in other areas and creates demand for entirely new types of work. Or, we're all hallucinating that AI is a technology that makes people more productive according to MIT studies, in which case we're overhauling the economy for essentially no reason. Let's say even despite all this we somehow got up to like 20% unemployment. UBI would make it worse, not better. It removes the pressure that pushes people to retrain, relocate, or start new businesses. Instead of helping newly-unemployed workers find new opportunities, UBI pays them to *stay* unemployed.

# AI is going to lead to class warfare when the millions of desperate citizens rise up against the rich

The argument goes that AI will eliminate so many jobs that millions will be left desperate and angry, leading to social unrest and class warfare. Surely the rich are hoarding resources while regular people suffer, and without massive wealth redistribution through programs like UBI, society will collapse into violence.

This is a self-fulfilling prophecy disguised as analysis. When you constantly tell people that the rich are their enemies and that violence is justified by inequality, you're not predicting class warfare, you're inciting it. Stable societies aren't built on resentment towards those more successful than you. The ""class warfare"" framing ignores how social mobility actually works. Most wealthy people in America are first-generation rich, not aristocrats hoarding inherited wealth. The biggest threat to social stability isn't inequality itself, but the political rhetoric that teaches people to hate those who've succeeded rather than learning from them. History shows that societies with strong property rights and economic freedom have the least social unrest, even with significant inequality. Countries that embrace redistribution and class resentment - from Venezuela, to various European socialist experiments - end up with both more poverty AND more social tension.

# ""So what's the vision of the right? People starving?""

I remember seeing this comment on a David Sacks tweet a while back, and I think it's both a fair question and very telling about the mentality a lot of people are bringing to this discussion. So let's talk about the other plan.

When AI displaces specific jobs, the solution is making it easier for people to transition to new work, not paying them to stay displaced. That means removing barriers that prevent new industries from emerging. Right now, occupational licensing blocks people from tons of careers, zoning laws prevent new businesses from starting in residential areas, and regulatory compliance costs price small entrepreneurs out of existence. AI will create opportunities we can't even imagine yet, but *only if we let markets work.* AI will also make many existing jobs more productive rather than eliminating them entirely. A construction worker with AI-powered tools can build more efficiently, a teacher with AI assistance can help more students, a doctor with AI diagnosis support can see more patients, etc. etc. etc. Every time this type of displacement happens, the winning move is to let wages and working conditions adjust naturally rather than artificially propping up obsolete jobs.

For people who need time to retrain, targeted assistance makes more sense than permanent income. Unemployment insurance that includes retraining requirements. Skills programs that teach what AI-enhanced industries actually need. Maybe even temporary relocation assistance to help people move where new opportunities are emerging. The biggest opportunity is that AI should make everything cheaper. If AI really does boost productivity dramatically, that means more goods and services for everyone, not just the owners of AI companies. But that only works if we let prices adjust and new businesses form.",0,1757003707.0,singularity,33,0.26,False

I’ve been looking at different grinders and kind of fell upon the comandante c60, does anyone have experience with it? I really like the modularity of it, how parts can be replaced if anything goes wrong with it instead of buying a whole new unit (if others also do this, they don’t really market it like comandante) also it’s robustness appeals to me since I like camping, going out doors and would love to have a grinder that can handle anything I throw at it. Hopefully some of you have some extended experience with them, and can help guide me towards it or something better. I know the price is quite steep, but from what it looks like, it’s gonna hopefully last a lifetime which means I hopefully won’t ever have to buy another grinder.

She really thinks she can keep putting on this type of content and continue to have traction? Like yes, your videos of you making coffee with music that would play in an elevator in a hospice center is definitely enriching so many peoples lives. 

Mindy, you got traction because of your AGE GAP marriage, which YOU decided to put on the internet. An age gap of that size is taboo and is obviously going to have people form opinions about it. Regardless, putting yourself publicly on the internet allows people who consume what YOU decided to put out form their own opinions. If you don't like that, you need to get off the internet. It is free speech. A crazy concept, I know.

I have seriously never seen someone with such thin skin. Even when people were making little snark channels about her that were getting like 100 views, she was freaking out and reporting them like crazy. It goes to show how insecure and sad she is. Internet aside, everyone in this world is going to have an opinion and their own perspective about you. That is how the world works. You cannot control how people think. You obviously have some control issues but unless you are God, it ain't gonna happen girl. 

As for CPS.. if people are calling CPS because of what you post online, definitely time to reevaluate your priorities. And you are STILL featuring your kids in your videos? Also to blame Josh for that when the CPS visit was before his commentary is actually insane. 

And THEN to demand 100k, the actual entitlement you have is CRAZY WORK. What makes you so special? I know you are having to pinch pennies now, but that is kind of your fault? Learn to save your money. Learn to not buy 8363 sweatshirts while you live in a swamp. Just a thought. 

Everything that is happening is self inflicted. If it is truly affecting you that much, shouldnt you owe it to your children to prioritize them and your mental health? Wait.. you can't because you would die without people shouting their shallow praise in your extremely controlled comment section. It also goes to show that all you care about is yourself and money. Get a REAL job and maybe you will have more money to spend on yourself. Maybe.

1n8f0v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1n8f0v7/explore_if_the_best_portable_coffee_maker_by_oxo/,Explore if the Best Portable Coffee Maker by OXO Delivers Quality,"Testing out the OXO 8722500, I wasn’t sure what to expect from such a compact and travel-friendly coffee maker. As someone who needs their caffeine fix and often cringes at bland instant coffee, this little device immediately piqued my interest. Portable, manual, and promising barista-quality concentrated brews in minutes, it almost sounded too good to be true. Was it, though? After a week of putting it through its paces, I've got quite a bit to share on its standout features and a few quirks you might need to keep in mind.

**Design and Portability**  
The first thing that struck me was how compact and lightweight this coffee maker is. It fits comfortably in one hand and can easily slide into a backpack or carry-on, making it ideal for anyone constantly on the go. I took it with me on a weekend trip, and the convenience of brewing fresh coffee in my hotel room—without having to deal with questionable in-room coffee machines—was priceless. The sleek design is visually appealing, and I appreciated the thoughtful touches like the locking pump for safe travel. However, because it’s so compact, you’re limited to single servings at a time, which worked for me but might be a downside for bigger households.  

**Using the OXO Rapid Brewer: Simplicity at Its Best**  
Operating this manual coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets. You just add finely ground coffee to the fill line, tamp it down firmly (the built-in tamper makes it easy), pour in hot or cold water, and wait for the magic to happen. It takes about two minutes to brew a hot concentrate and around five minutes for a cold brew. Once it's ready, you unlock the pump with a quick turn and press the coffee concentrate directly into the included Tritan Renew carafe. While the process is simple, you'll need to ensure the coffee grounds are evenly tamped for the best results—a couple of my first attempts came out unevenly extracted because I rushed this step.

**Highlights**  
- The reusable stainless steel filter is a standout feature. It delivers a smooth and full-bodied brew without the hassle or waste of paper filters.  
- It can handle a variety of coffee styles, from Americanos to affogatos, so you can customize your caffeine fix however you like.  
- The rainmaker-style showerhead distributes water evenly over the coffee grounds for consistent flavor extraction.  

[Time to see OXO 8722500 cost on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)  

**Performance and Flavor**  
I was genuinely surprised by the quality of the coffee this little gadget produces. The concentrated brew is rich, bold, and smooth, easily rivaling what you'd get from more expensive machines. I found myself experimenting with different water ratios, creating everything from a quick Americano to a Vietnamese-style iced coffee. It's especially great for cold brew lovers like me—you can have a crisp, flavorful cup ready in just a few minutes without the usual overnight waiting period. However, one word of advice: stick to freshly ground beans if possible. Pre-ground coffee just doesn’t deliver the same depth of flavor in this setup.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact size is perfect for travel or office use.  
- Quick brew time ensures no long waits.  
- Easy-to-clean design with dishwasher-safe parts (excluding the pump).  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Larger households might find the single-serve capacity limiting.  
- Achieving consistent coffee tamping takes a little practice.  
- Not ideal for those who prefer traditional automated coffee makers.  

**Alternative Products**  
In comparison with other compact coffee makers, such as the AeroPress Go or the WACACO Nanopresso, the OXO Rapid Brewer offers some unique advantages. While the AeroPress Go is another fantastic travel option, it doesn’t focus on creating a concentrated brew with such bold flavors. The WACACO is better suited for those seeking an espresso shot on the go, but it requires a bit more effort and is less versatile in making larger or diluted drinks like Americanos. In my opinion, the OXO outshines competitors for those who enjoy café-like iced or hot coffee with minimal hassle and equipment.

**Value for Money**  
The price point feels fairly reasonable for the quality it delivers. Unlike many travel coffee makers, which often feel like compromises rather than solutions, this one justifies its cost. It’s not only durable but also eco-conscious with its reusable steel filter and Tritan Renew carafe made from recycled materials. Considering the amount I’ve saved on overpriced lattes in the past week alone, it’s clearly a product where cost-effectiveness matches its feature set.

I dove into some spoons a while back and tried/weighed a bunch of them. I came across these very light [wooden spoons on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0915VRBJV). They're marketed as coffee stir spoons, but the bigger one has served me well for eating. As a bonus, I prefer eating with this than a titanium spoon, and they're super cheap. If you're a cold soaker, I imagine it's also pretty easy to cut it down to fit into your jar.

There are \~two downsides. First, they're thin wood, so I imagine they could break in your pack. I've never had a problem with this (just pack with some care) and I'm OK with the risk given it's not really a trip ruiner if your spoon breaks. Second, they float! They kind of suck as an actual coffee stir spoon because they'll float and fall out. Maybe an issue if you're eating a lot of soups, or stirring drinks.

I was raised very lax catholic and never went through confirmation despite my dad being super devout but about three months ago I decided to go back to mass and it was a great bonding experience because we’d go to mass together and get coffee afterward to chat. I know he was so proud I decided to pursue conversion and signed up/starting attending ocia a few weeks ago. 

But I’ve been reading the Bible on my own for the first time and have come to realize how naive it was for me to pursue conversion first before even fully believing (I’ve been agnostic for the last 25 years and honestly never had a relationship with god before that either). I kinda thought belief would come to me by attending mass and praying and reading the Bible but I got to a point (particularly while reading Leviticus) that I couldn’t ignore my doubt and, frankly, aversion to what I was reading. I wasn’t satisfied with the church’s response to it either.

So yeah, just looking for some advice on how to approach with my dad. I don’t want to be disrespectful and I don’t disrespect the desire for religion but I was kinda swept with the realization I just don’t believe in any of this and if I’m going to read the Bible, I need to do it outside of the church where I can view it through a critical lens.

Forget what you think you know about ""prompt engineering."" It's not about magic words or secret incantations. It's about a fundamental principle of communication.

Think about the most successful people you know. They don't just ask for things; they give context, establish a persona, and define the expected outcome. They don't just say, ""Do this."" They say, ""As a leading expert in X, my goal is to achieve Y. Here's what I need you to do.""

We call this The Law of the Pithy Cyborg. It has three components: Persona, Context, and Task. Master these, and you will unlock an elite level of communication with any AI.

**Let's break it down.**

**1. Persona: The Who**

You must tell the AI who it is. Without a defined persona, the AI is a generic assistant. But when you give it an identity, it activates a specialized knowledge base and tone.

**Instead of:**

 `Write an ad about a new coffee brand.`

**Try:**

`You are a senior advertising copywriter with a history of creating viral campaigns for a new, Gen-Z-focused coffee brand. Your tone is witty and a little rebellious.`

Notice the difference. You're not just giving a task; you're giving the AI a role to play.

**2. Context: The Why**

This is the most overlooked part of prompting. Explain the situation and the ultimate goal. Why are we doing this? Who is the audience? What is the purpose of this output?

**Instead of:**

`Write a blog post about how to learn a new language.`

**Try:**

`I am creating a blog post for my personal finance website, where the audience is college students who want to travel on a budget. The goal is to show them that learning basic phrases can save them money while traveling. The tone should be friendly and practical.`

By providing this context, you've narrowed the AI's focus from the entire universe of language learning to a specific, actionable angle.

**3. Task: The What**

Now, and only now, do you give the AI the actual task. But don't just say ""write."" Use action words that define the specific output you want. Specify the format, length, and key points to include.

Instead of:

`Write me an email.`

**Try:**

Draft a concise, two-paragraph email. The subject line should be clear. The first paragraph will summarize our meeting, and the second will list three clear next steps for the team. End with a call to action asking them to reply by Friday.

You are not just asking for an email; you are programming an email.

**Putting It All Together: A Simple Formula**

To become a Pithy Cyborg, combine all three parts into a single, powerful command:

**\[PERSONA\] + \[CONTEXT\] + \[TASK\]**

Example:

`[As a veteran investigative journalist with 20 years of experience], [I am writing an article for a respected online publication about the rise of misinformation. My goal is to expose a new deepfake conspiracy and warn readers.], [Write an introduction for the article. It should be a two-paragraph hook that grabs the reader's attention with a compelling narrative and ends by stating the article's purpose.]`

This is more than just a prompt; it's a blueprint. It removes the guesswork and tells the AI exactly what to do, who to be, and why it matters.

Go forth and start engineering. I look forward to seeing the powerful outputs this community creates.",1,1757002974.0,PithyCyborg,0,1.0,False

I applied for an engineering firm in July and the staffing lead told me she wants to bring me on, and they said in an email they are going to offer me full time though didn’t have a job offer to sign.

Yesterday, I had a call with the regional staffing manager and the other staffing lead and they will be in the area meeting with clients and want to get lunch or coffee with me and discuss contracts within a week or two. What if this lunch ends in a rejection or more delay in a job offer?

However, yesterday I received a notification that I can accept a mail handler position with USPS. I have no income at the moment and would like more income. I have only two days to accept the mail handler role. I do not want to have to work overnight shifts.

Should I decline this offer or not?

1n8eq2c,https://i.redd.it/bs5j81ajb6nf1.jpeg,$ATYR – How to Spot a Bear Campaign: Lessons in Narrative and Structure,"Hi folks,

If you’ve been following $ATYR on Reddit, Stocktwits, or X, you’ve seen a sharp uptick in negative posts, “insider” sounding comments, and dramatic price targets lately. Familiar faces of biotech short selling have weighed in - bringing sponsored short reports, viral “expert” posts, and a steady stream of bearish narratives.

Just to be clear: this isn’t an attack on anyone, or taking sides. My aim here is to take an objective and analytical look at what’s been happening socially and structurally around $ATYR as a case study. My method is pretty simple - I grab a screenshot every time I spot a bearish post, short report, or negative narrative, and save it to a folder. Since late July, that’s become hundreds of catalogued examples, building a dataset that lets us look at how these patterns seem to form and spread in real time.

So what you’ll find here isn’t about saying who’s right or wrong, or predictions. Instead, I’m interested in the anatomy of what looks like a coordinated short campaign - how it can unfold in a small-cap biotech, what tactics show up repeatedly, and what can actually be learned if you step back and look beneath the noise. The goal is educational: to offer new analytical “lenses” for reading situations like this, and to help you make sense when you see a wave of coordinated sentiment - no matter what stock you’re in.

For most people, this is a new style of analysis. I offer it free, and if it brings you value - if it sharpens your process, helps you spot patterns, or just gives you new ways to think about social dynamics in small-caps—I hope you’ll consider what that’s worth for your own investment process. If you want to support more research like this, you can do so here: [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). Every bit helps keep these deep dives coming.

Let’s get into it.

**Why Now? Why ATYR?**

The $ATYR setup right now is a textbook example of conditions that attract aggressive event-driven trading campaigns - especially as the risk/reward profile tightens into a major binary catalyst. Here’s what makes this case stand out, and the important for anyone tracking micro-cap biotech to understand what’s happening under the surface.

1. **Key Facts About the Current Setup**
   - **Phase 3 Readout Imminent:**  
     ATYR is days or weeks away from releasing topline results from its EFZO-FIT Phase 3 trial, a make-or-break catalyst that could redefine the company’s future.
   - **Float Dynamics:**  
     Recent filings show over 70% of the float is held by institutions (including major index funds and specialist biotech allocators), with retail holders accounting for at least 10–12% by best estimates, and insiders holding another 2–3%. Short interest is currently above 25% of float, with open interest in the September options expiry at historic highs.
   - **Borrow Market:**  
     Shares available to short have consistently run tight, borrow rates have started to tick up, and “days to cover” ratio is high (recent data: 5-6 days). This means any short is taking on more risk as the catalyst approaches.
   - **Tape Action:**  
     Despite persistent high-volume selling attempts, $ATYR has seen regular absorption of blocks at or above $5, suggesting ongoing accumulation by long-term holders rather than a liquidation cycle. Volatility has increased, but the price has not broken down, even under pressure.

2. **Sequence of Events - How the Bear Campaign Emerged**
   - **Short Report Release:**  
     Just as the binary window opened in late July, a detailed short report was published by a group known for event-driven biotech campaigns, and quickly spread across social channels. The report was sponsored by a firm with known commercial interest in shorting micro-cap biotechs.
   - **Network Amplification:**  
     Within hours, a spike in negative posts appeared across Stocktwits, Reddit, and X. Many accounts used similar phrasing (“guaranteed failure,” “some of the worst data I’ve ever seen,” “80% downside ahead”), and some had a history of appearing in other controversial biotech shorts. Multiple new accounts (created within days of the report) began to pile on, amplifying bearish talking points.
   - **Recurring Tactics:**  
     The posts showed clear patterns:
     - Heavy use of “insider” or “industry expert” tone without providing verifiable evidence
     - Dramatic price targets ($2, $1), anchoring expectations downward
     - Framing conference presentations as proof of failure (despite decades of precedent to the contrary)
     - Minimal engagement with patient experience, trial design details, or independent scientific perspectives

3. **Why This Campaign Matters to Investors**
   - **Timing and Intent:**  
     The concentrated negative campaign began exactly as the float tightened and options positioning reached extreme levels - a telltale sign that the narrative is being driven by real market risk, not just opinion. Historical precedent in micro-cap biotech shows that these campaigns are most aggressive when shorts are structurally trapped or when high-stakes outcomes are imminent.
   - **Potential Impact:**  
     In setups like this, aggressive bearish campaigns can shake loose shares from less experienced holders, create exit liquidity for shorts, and increase volatility around news events. However, when the float is truly tight, these tactics often lose effectiveness - especially if fundamentals or structure don’t break down.
   - **Educational Takeaway:**  
     The key is to separate fact from narrative. When you see:
     - A sudden wave of negative posts just before a catalyst
     - Repetition of the same talking points, often across new or rarely used accounts
     - Lack of new factual content, and a focus on emotional language or price targets  
     …that’s usually a sign you’re looking at a narrative-driven campaign, not a substantive shift in the underlying facts.

4. **My Approach and the Educational Value**
   - **Forensic Tracking:**  
     Since late July, I’ve catalogued hundreds of negative posts, compiling screenshots and mapping the timing, sources, and content. My approach isn’t to respond to any one poster, but to objectively track the patterns, network links, and market structure overlays.
   - **Case Study Value:**  
     By analyzing $ATYR in real time, I hope to give readers a new lens for viewing high-conviction campaigns - especially how narrative, structure, and behavioral tactics interact. If you can recognize these setups here, you can use the same process across other event-driven trades, regardless of ticker.
   - **No Signal, No Call-Outs:**  
     This is not a “signal,” or a call to action, and it’s certainly not about attacking individuals. It’s an objective, fact-based look at how these campaigns emerge, propagate, and attempt to influence outcomes. The real lesson is learning how to analyze market behavior and separate structural signal from social media noise.

**Pulling It All Together:**  
What makes $ATYR such a standout case right now is the *combination* of all these factors hitting at once. You have a binary catalyst with huge implications, a float that’s effectively locked down by committed institutions and a dedicated retail base, and a short side that’s already pushed positioning to the absolute limits. Layer on top of that record options open interest and an aggressive, highly coordinated narrative campaign, and you have all the ingredients for a market scenario that’s as much about psychology and structure as it is about the data itself.

In my view, this isn’t happening by accident. $ATYR attracts this kind of attention because the risk/reward at this stage is truly asymmetric - there’s simply not enough “easy” supply left for shorts to exit gracefully, nor for longs to add in size without moving the tape. That’s why we see such intense efforts to shape the narrative right before the catalyst drops: it’s the last, best chance to tip sentiment, shake loose weak hands, or secure a more favorable exit or entry ahead of a major inflection point.

So, why $ATYR and why now? Because it embodies almost every structural feature that professional event-driven players look for in a battleground stock. And for anyone wanting to learn how real market dynamics play out around big catalysts, there’s probably no better live example right now. The key lesson here isn’t about predicting the outcome - it’s about understanding how these ingredients come together, and using that knowledge to improve your own process the next time you see a similar setup.

**What I Looked For in the Analysis**

For this case study, I approached the flood of bearish $ATYR content as a forensic investigator. My goal wasn’t to prove anyone “wrong,” but to build structural understanding of how these campaigns work - what signals are real, which are manufactured, and how to tell the difference. Here’s exactly what I looked for, why it matters, and how retail can apply these lenses to any high-stakes setup:

**1. Identifying Recurrent Themes and Narratives**

- I tracked primary themes that kept surfacing across posts, not just in isolation, but how they evolved as sentiment shifted. Early on, criticism centered around trial design and historical company performance. As the binary window neared, themes shifted toward guaranteed failure, conference skepticism, and “insider” whispers.
- Specific examples included repeated warnings that the EFZO-FIT trial “could never work” because of steroid taper complexity (ignoring protocol differences and FDA input), or that ATYR’s management had “never succeeded before” (overlooking new leadership and platform science).
- By mapping these themes, it became clear that while the surface argument appeared to shift, the core intent remained - undermine confidence and raise perceived uncertainty, regardless of what facts were actually changing.

**2. Tactics and Methods Used by Bearish Posters**

- I examined how posters tried to establish authority or credibility - often opening with “I’ve worked in biotech for decades,” “I know how these deals are structured,” or vague references to “industry sources.” Almost never were these claims backed up with specifics or verifiable credentials.
- Tactics also included mass repetition of dramatic price anchors (“see you at $1”), often without context, as well as attempts to reframe legitimate events (like a conference presentation) as evidence of impending doom, despite clear examples from other biotech winners where the opposite was true.
- There was frequent deployment of FUD memes and snarky humor, which in my view, isn’t just harmless fun - it’s a deliberate tool to lower analytical bandwidth and create a peer pressure effect among uncertain holders.

**3. Coordination, Echo Chamber, and Network Effects**

- I reviewed timing of post clusters - such as waves of nearly identical bear posts hitting within minutes of each other, often coinciding with major trading moments (e.g., options expiry, tape support tests). This is rarely random.
- Accounts often had short posting histories, were recently created, or previously participated in other high-profile bear campaigns. Sometimes, the same language appeared across multiple platforms and accounts, strongly suggesting copy-paste coordination or shared narrative packets.
- I noticed that certain posts, even when factually thin, would receive rapid engagement - likes, upvotes, replies - more quickly than you’d expect from organic conversation. This helps “flood the zone,” making bearish takes appear more credible by sheer volume.

**4. Separating Good Faith Skepticism from Bad Faith FUD**

- I looked for posts that actually challenged the thesis with thoughtful, specific questions or pointed to documented risks - like trial enrollment challenges, historical volatility in rare disease readouts, or financial burn. These posts tended to engage, debate, and sometimes even evolve their viewpoint.
- In contrast, bad faith FUD was almost always repetitive, focused on discrediting people (not arguments), and rarely engaged with substantive replies. Instead, they leaned on emotional triggers and “drive-by” certainty - sometimes flooding threads with one-liners or personal attacks.
- For me, the split was often obvious: good faith skeptics welcomed discussion and provided new context, while orchestrated FUD accounts recycled claims regardless of reply or rebuttal.

**5. Fact vs. Emotion vs. Misinformation: Deep Fact-Checking**

- I cross-referenced each major bearish claim against filings, published clinical data, and industry precedent e.g. the assertion that “no positive drug presents at conference pre-FDA” is flatly contradicted by dozens of recent high-profile approvals.
- I paid attention to posts that mixed a grain of truth (like the real challenge of steroid taper endpoints) with loaded language and emotional predictions (“guaranteed to fail”). This blend can be especially effective at shaking retail confidence if not checked against facts.
- When I found claims that simply weren’t supported by any available data - like assertions of “imminent dilution” with no new SEC filing, or “management hiding data” despite regular updates - I flagged these as clear examples of misinformation designed to create fear, not inform.

**6. Signals of Coordination and Tactical Posting**

- I matched the volume and timing of bear posts to specific trading events - options expiry, tape tests, or after-hours liquidity shifts. The alignment was too close to be coincidence, in my view.
- I also tracked bursts of new accounts posting negative takes immediately after the release of the main short report or when price support held firm. The “pile-on” was particularly pronounced during high borrow rate days, hinting at real pain or urgency on the short side.
- This pattern is a classic hallmark of tactical posting, often seen in other crowded biotech shorts where narrative engineering is as much a tool as trading itself.

**7. Novel, Real Risk Factors - Anything New?**

- I combed every bear post and short report for risks I hadn’t already seen priced in by the market or acknowledged by management. Was there any truly new negative data point? Any credible regulatory or safety development missed by the bulls?
- The answer was almost always negative. Most arguments recycled the original short report or public domain risks - nothing truly emergent, and certainly nothing with the level of specificity or data you’d expect from a real “edge.”
- For educational purposes, I stress that the absence of new risk in a coordinated campaign is itself a signal - often meaning the real fundamental bear case is running out of material and resorting to repetition and amplification.

**8. Educational Angle: How I Hope This Helps Retail**

- The purpose of this approach is not just to pick apart one campaign, but to give retail readers tools to analyze any information war - whether bull or bear. By learning to spot recycled arguments, tactical posting, and emotional manipulation, you can keep your own process grounded in facts and edge.
- I hope this also helps highlight the value of good faith skepticism, and why it’s important to engage with real, substantive critique (which sharpens your thesis), while recognizing and filtering out what amounts to professional narrative management.
- Ultimately, I believe retail investors who develop this level of pattern recognition - especially in microcap, event-driven setups - are likely to get shaken out by noise and better able to spot when facts on the ground are changing, not just the volume of social media posts.

**The Core Patterns in the Bearish Social Media Flow**

A. “It’s Failed / Insider Knows”
- **Expanded Tactics:** The most persistent bearish posts tend to lean on claims of “insider” knowledge or supposed industry experience. You’ll see phrases like “I’ve overseen multiple NDAs,” “was in the room for similar trials,” or “my contacts at the company told me…” What stands out is the lack of actual sources—these posts rarely cite verifiable evidence, often defaulting to generalities (“trust me,” “seen this before”).
- **Behavioral Impact:** In my experience, this approach preys on the worry that retail is “late to the news,” subtly pushing anxious holders to sell before the main event. The authoritative tone is designed to make failure feel inevitable, even though, in reality, genuine leaks in tightly regulated trials are exceedingly rare.
- **Pattern Variations:** Sometimes, the rhetoric escalates—hinting at regulatory leaks (“the FDA already decided”), or referencing “industry chatter” that’s impossible to cross-check.
- **Fact-check:** After extensive review, none of these posts have surfaced real new trial data, regulatory communications, or even credible third-party KOL opinion. In nearly all historic biotech setups, “insider certainty” without evidence has turned out to be bluster.
- **Case in Point:** This pattern was especially visible before the positive surprises in high-profile stocks like Reata and Madrigal, where “certainty” about failure peaked right before the stock exploded upward.

B. Conference = Failure
- **Expanded Tactics:** Another favorite narrative is that presenting data at a scientific conference proves a drug “failed” or that management is “avoiding” regulatory filing. Posts often assert, “good data never goes to conference,” or “if this worked, they’d file instead.”
- **Fact-based Reality:** I’ve followed this sector for years, and dozens of pivotal datasets are presented at major meetings like ERS, ATS, ASCO, and AHA, often before or alongside regulatory submissions. Conferences are the gold standard for peer review and clinical buy-in. It’s not just common, it’s smart science.
- **Behavioral Play:** This talking point often works on newer investors who aren’t familiar with how biotech companies build scientific credibility. It sows doubt through process confusion, and tends to pop up right as anticipation and tension is highest.
- **Counterexamples:** Mirati’s adagrasib, Madrigal’s resmetirom, Reata’s omaveloxolone, and many other drugs all saw key data go to conferences before approval.
- **Pattern Signal:** When “conference = fail” shows up everywhere in a short window, especially across new or recently active accounts, I interpret it as a narrative push rather than an evidence-based critique.

C. Ad Hominem Attacks
- **Expanded Tactics:** Once arguments about data or trading lose traction, I often see the bear narrative pivot to personal attacks. This can mean jabs at management (“they’re only in it for themselves,” “history of failure”), but also at visible bulls (“attention seekers,” “cult”) and even the patient community.
- **Behavioral Context:** I’ve noticed these attacks tend to rise when the narrative can’t move the price, or when block trades are consistently absorbed. It signals a degree of narrative frustration.
- **Escalation Pattern:** When ad hominem attacks become especially sharp or emotional, it often reflects real market stress - tight borrow, high open interest, or technical support holding firm.
- **Historical Parallels:** This exact pattern cropped up in the bear raids against $SAVA and $CYDY, with attacks peaking just as the campaigns lost traction.

D. Price Anchoring (“See you at $2”)
- **Expanded Tactics:** Extreme downside targets (“see you at $2,” “headed to $1”) are a staple of the bear toolkit. These posts rarely include serious valuation or risk modeling. The repetition of these anchors - across replies, new threads, and usernames - makes the downside feel more probable than it really is.
- **Behavioral Effect:** In my view, this tactic reframes expectations for nervous holders or casual observers, making any weakness seem like the beginning of a collapse. It can nudge weak hands to sell even on routine volatility.
- **Amplification:** Price anchoring is most effective when echoed by several accounts at once, particularly during high-tension periods like option expiry or just ahead of catalysts.
- **Contextual Note:** In the most coiled setups, I’ve seen anchors peak precisely when the short side is most at risk - a sign that narrative is being used tactically rather than analytically.

E. Echo Chamber & Copy-Paste Narratives (Additional Core Pattern)
- **Pattern Detail:** One of the clearest tells of coordination, in my view, is the presence of near-identical posts - same wording, same spelling quirks - across multiple accounts and platforms. Sometimes, new accounts join the chorus, amplifying the impression of “consensus.”
- **Behavioral Effect:** This manufactured echo chamber can drown out genuine debate, making it harder for new investors to access independent analysis.
- **Signal to Watch:** If you see the same phrases (“insider knows,” “see you at $2,” “conference = fail”) repeated across several accounts in a matter of minutes or hours, it’s almost certainly a narrative push, not spontaneous skepticism.

F. Selective Use of Facts & Omission
- **Pattern Detail:** A subtler tactic is to focus only on dated negatives or isolated issues, ignoring new developments, independent KOL research, or management engagement with regulators. This is designed to keep the conversation negative and limit any nuanced debate.
- **Behavioral Signal:** When you see a refusal to acknowledge new evidence or to engage on opposing points, it’s a strong sign that the goal is persuasion, not exploration.

G. Tactical Posting Windows
- **Pattern Detail:** It’s also common to see bursts of negative posts at thinly traded times—pre-market, after-hours, or during option expiries. In my opinion, this is done to maximize psychological and tape impact, hoping to trigger forced selling when liquidity is low.
- **Signal:** If bearish chatter intensifies at odd hours or just as the float tightens, it’s likely a tactical move by those with significant short exposure.

---

**Behavioral and Psychological Markers**

- **Overconfidence and Absolutism**
    - A consistent signal I’ve noticed in event-driven setups is the shift toward absolute certainty in the bear narrative. When commentary starts moving from “could fail” to “will fail” or “100% guaranteed,” it’s usually less about new information and more about crowd psychology. In my view, this tone shift reflects a need to reinforce group conviction - especially as uncertainty grows. It’s a kind of self-soothing, both for posters who are short and for anyone nervous about their position.
    - In previous high-squeeze setups, I’ve observed that the most aggressive, certain language from bears often shows up just before major inflection points. When everyone is shouting “guaranteed fail,” it’s usually a moment of maximum uncertainty - sometimes even right before a squeeze or reversal.
    - *Example:* “Trust me, this is a guaranteed failure - no chance it gets approved. The FDA has already decided, you just don’t know it yet.” I’ve seen this style of post in many high-stakes biotechs - very rarely does it precede an actual leak.

- **Copy-Paste, Redundancy, and Narrative Herding**
    - Another telltale marker is the wave of near-identical posts that start to flood different platforms. You’ll see the same phrases, sentence fragments, and even typos show up across multiple usernames, often within minutes of each other. In my experience, this is rarely organic. It usually indicates some kind of coordinated effort - whether through Discord channels, private DMs, or just a handful of motivated actors copying each other.
    - From an educational perspective, I find it useful to track both the timing and the phrasing of posts. When a handful of talking points or memes are repeated in tight succession, it suggests a deliberate push to crowd out alternate narratives and establish a manufactured consensus.
    - *Example:* Multiple accounts posting within minutes: “See you at $2,” “Conference = instant fail,” or “Anyone holding this is delusional.” Even down to repeated misspellings or odd syntax - these are classic tells for a narrative campaign.

- **Absence of Human Dimension**
    - What stands out to me in this setup is the almost total absence of patient stories, KOL opinions, or any clinical/real-world context in the majority of bearish posts. It’s all about the trade, the price, and “proving” the failure of management. I’ve seen this before in other setups where the goal is to de-risk the long case by stripping away the human element - removing anything that could inspire conviction or emotional attachment in the bull community.
    - I think this is especially important for new investors to recognize: If a conversation never touches on real-world clinical or patient impact, and is focused entirely on doom and trading, it’s a sign that the narrative is being engineered to drive fear and disengage holders, not to promote substantive debate.
    - *Example:* In all the bearish flow I’ve tracked, you almost never see a post asking “How did patients in the trial actually do?” or “What’s the latest from independent KOLs or support groups?” Instead, it’s all “dump incoming,” “management is a fraud,” or “bagholders will be left holding the bag.”

---

**Market Structure Synchrony**

- **Aggression Rises as Float Tightens**
    - One of the most revealing signals in the current $ATYR setup is the direct correlation between float tightness (as measured by record-high open interest, persistent block buying, and rising borrow costs) and the increase in aggressive, coordinated FUD posts. In my view, this isn’t coincidence. As shorts run out of available shares to borrow, and days-to-cover ratio climbs, there’s more incentive to drive negative sentiment via social channels to shake loose shares and create exit liquidity.
    - I’ve seen this pattern across other micro-cap biotechs: when the float is fully locked and the tape starts to resist downward pressure, volume and intensity of bear posts almost always spike. It’s often a last-resort lever when structural risk (short squeeze potential) is building and the fundamentals aren’t breaking down as expected.
    - *Example:* In recent weeks, every time ATYR’s borrow availability tightens and support holds around $5, there’s a parallel uptick in negative posting and “guaranteed fail” language. To me, this suggests market-driven pressure, not new negative information.

- **Discrepancy Between Social Narrative and the Tape**
    - Another key marker I look for is when the narrative on social media (i.e., “the price will collapse,” “institutions are dumping,” “no one wants to hold this”) completely diverges from what’s actually visible in trading data. On $ATYR, bearish posts rarely acknowledge the continued accumulation at key levels, record options OI, or the tight float confirmed by filings. Instead, they focus on narrative points disconnected from the reality of the order book.
    - In my experience, this disconnect is often a tell that the loudest voices online may be trying to manage risk or unwind positions that are going against them, rather than expressing genuine conviction. When support levels hold despite persistent bear raids, and blocks continue to be absorbed by new buyers, it’s usually a sign that the structure is working against the shorts.

- **Reflexivity – The Squeeze Trigger**
    - An important lessons I’ve learned from event-driven setups is that when sentiment and tape diverge this dramatically, risk of a violent squeeze or price reversal increases. This is the essence of reflexivity: social media and price action start feeding off each other, and when the narrative overplays its hand, even a small positive catalyst can lead to a rapid, self-reinforcing rally.
    - The louder and more coordinated the bearish narrative gets as float risk builds, the more likely it is that the campaign is not only losing effectiveness but is setting up a “trap” for overconfident shorts. The tape, not the tweet count, will usually provide the real signal.
    - In multiple biotech setups, squeezes have occurred right after periods of peak bearish certainty and aggressive FUD, especially as tape and sentiment diverged.

**Network Analysis: Who’s Pulling the Strings?**

- **Observed Origins & Narrative Triggers**  
  One thing that’s stood out in the ATYR setup is that bearish narratives typically *seem* to begin with a very small set of coordinated accounts or posts - amongst other tactics, perhaps dropping a extended “short report” and a viral, categorical thread almost simultaneously. Initial posts often position themselves as objective research, but the timing - landing just as $ATYR approached its binary readout - raises questions about strategic intent.

  The posts tend to use dramatic language, reference prior high-profile biotech trades, and set very specific downside targets. To me, the style and sequence *echo* what’s been seen in other event-driven setups.

- **Rapid Network Amplification**  
  In the hours following these origin posts, it’s been hard not to notice the same themes appearing repeatedly across Reddit, Stocktwits, and X/Twitter. The volume of negative posts spikes almost instantly, and there’s a strong sense of repetition - both in the actual words used and the talking points selected.  
  - A flurry of new accounts tends to show up, many echoing the language and thesis of the initial report.
  - Accounts with a history of participation in other controversial biotechs start replying or amplifying, usually referencing the same core points: “guaranteed failure,” “worst data I’ve ever seen,” or “headed to $2.”
  - Sometimes, the posts appear nearly word-for-word, or share the same screenshots, all within tight timeframes.

  It *gives the impression* of manufactured consensus - making it easy for anyone searching for $ATYR to find mostly bearish sentiment, at least in those early waves.

- **Patterns of Time-Based Posting and Market Tactics**  
  Another noticeable feature has been the timing of these posts. The biggest waves tend to appear:
    - Right before the market opens, when liquidity is thin and price can be moved more easily.
    - After hours, following block trades or news releases, when fewer eyes are on the tape.
    - Around options expiries or on high-volume days, when narrative can have the most effect on nervous holders.

  These surges in posting *often* line up with key tape events - options open interest spikes, institutional block buying, reports of tightening borrow. While this could be coincidental, in my view, these windows are the most sensitive for price action and sentiment shifts.

- **Legacy Campaign Tactics and Playbook Overlap**  
  For anyone who’s tracked prior microcap biotech campaigns, many of the tactics here *bear a strong resemblance* to what’s played out elsewhere:
    - “Credential signaling” (claims of industry expertise or insider info, rarely backed up with checkable detail)
    - Aggressive price anchors (“headed to $2,” “down 80% soon”), sometimes with little valuation context
    - Selective use of negative science or old publications, while skipping over new developments or balanced regulatory context
    - Word-for-word copy-paste posts, often from newly created or event-driven accounts

  When you see these elements together, it *suggests* deliberate narrative-building effort rather than spontaneous market debate.

- **Social Network Mapping – What’s Been Observable**  
  From my own tracking (hundreds of screenshots catalogued since late July), here’s what’s been visible:
    - Most bearish posts *trace back* to a handful of core “starter” accounts or threads.
    - Amplification comes from a mix of new and legacy accounts, many of which have low post history or a background in other event-driven biotech discussions.
    - Posting clusters seem to coincide with key market moments - market open, after major trades, and during times of visible tape stress.
    - Entire blocks of text, images, and even chart overlays are recycled and repeated, creating a kind of “echo chamber” effect.

  While it’s impossible to know with certainty how organized it all is behind the scenes, the observable behavior *lines up with* networked messaging campaigns seen in similar high-stakes situations.

- **Practical Takeaways for Investors**
    - If you notice bursts of negative posts, all echoing the same themes or phrases, particularly right after a catalyst or short report, it’s worth pausing to consider whether you’re seeing coordinated sentiment or genuine information flow.
    - Identical screenshots, images, and claims across multiple accounts - especially by posters with little history - should raise questions about narrative management.
    - Posting surges in thin-liquidity windows (pre-market, after-hours, post-block trades) tend to have more to do with short-term tape influence than fundamental changes.
    - The true test is whether a post adds new, credible information - or simply repeats the existing bear case more loudly.

**What’s Missing from the Bear Case?**

- **Lack of Granular Trial Analysis**  
  A striking thing I’ve noticed is absence of any detailed discussion around the actual design, conduct, or specifics of the current Phase 3 trial. There’s almost no engagement with trial protocol, how endpoints are defined, or what FDA alignment has looked like up to this point. Instead, bearish posts tend to recycle generalizations about past studies or baseline imbalances, rather than going into what actually makes this study tick. In my view, this is a major gap, especially since regulatory detail and trial mechanics are often where the real signal is found.

  *Example: You rarely see posts breaking down the primary endpoint, or discussing how patient selection and steroid taper protocols were structured in alignment with regulatory feedback. These are details that fundamentally drive the odds of success.*

- **No Human or Clinical Perspective**  
  Another pattern is almost complete absence of the patient voice, real-world impact, or the role of advocacy groups. I haven’t seen much - if any - reference to how patients have experienced the drug, what treating physicians are saying on record, or the sentiment among support networks. In high-stakes rare disease trials, that context matters. Bears here focus almost entirely on the drug as a “trade,” not a clinical intervention.

  *Example: Not a single widely circulated bearish post I’ve seen addresses the feedback from sarcoidosis patient advocacy groups, or references published commentary from trial investigators or KOLs. Lack of clinical color stands out to me as a sign of a market-driven rather than science-driven narrative.*

- **No Balanced Risk/Reward Framing**  
  Tone is overwhelmingly “all or nothing” - almost never discussing scenarios where the drug could be incrementally positive, approvable with a narrower label, or create platform value even if not a total home run. Every bear post tends to frame the situation as guaranteed failure or catastrophic downside, rather than nuanced risk/reward where multiple outcomes are possible.

  *Example: Posts almost never engage with the real-life probabilities of a “soft win” (e.g., hitting secondary endpoints, regulatory alignment, or strategic interest) that could still drive significant value, even if the headline result is not a slam dunk.*

**What Can Retail Investors Actually Learn?**

A useful thing about short reports and bearish posts isn’t necessarily the conclusions they reach - it’s the process of using them as a kind of “risk checklist.” Almost every major campaign, no matter how orchestrated, does sometimes surface real risk factors. But it’s up to you to sort genuine process risk from the noise. Here’s how I approach it:

- **Use Bear Content as a Risk Checklist:**  
  • Are there real process risks being surfaced? Occasionally, yes - sometimes you’ll see reminders about tricky trial endpoints, statistical power, or regulatory precedent that are worth stress-testing.  
  • Is this campaign surfacing genuinely new, actionable negatives? At this stage in the $ATYR setup, almost none of the loudest posts are actually bringing new information to the table.  
  • Do the most vocal accounts seem to be recycling the same “packaged narrative” rather than debating real data? In my view, yes - most posts follow the same playbook, rather than engaging in open discussion.

- **Stay Aware of Narrative Structure:**  
  • Dramatic price predictions, claims of insider certainty, and rapid-fire, repetitive posting should all be recognized as *narrative tools*, not signals of truth. The louder and more frequent these tactics, the less likely they are to offer genuine new information.  
  • In a setup like this, I always return to fundamentals - study the filings, clinical trial endpoints, the commentary from KOLs and clinicians, and the tape itself. Market structure (who’s buying, who’s selling, float, options) will tell you more than a thousand posts.

- **Don’t Outsource Conviction:**  
  • It’s easy to get caught up in the noise, especially if you’re new to biotech or haven’t seen a coordinated campaign before. But the best use of bearish content is to use it to check your own thinking - stress test your model, revisit the risk factors, and make sure you’re not missing something real.  
  • That said, don’t let sheer volume of posts or certainty of tone shake your process. When you’re uncertain, look for unique, good faith critique - people willing to ask tough questions and debate the data, not just declare an outcome.

In my view, this is a valuable skill you can develop as a retail investor: learning to separate structural signal from the narrative noise, and building conviction based on facts, not sentiment.

**Key Takeaways**

- For anyone following $ATYR - or any microcap, binary, or event-driven stock - these last few weeks have been a real-time lesson in how social media campaigns can shape sentiment, sometimes without adding any genuine information. The core signals outlined here aren’t unique to this ticker. In my experience, they show up time and again around high-stakes catalysts, especially when the float is tight and the setup is polarized.

- What I’ve tried to show in this case study is not just how to recognize a bear campaign in action, but how to use that recognition to sharpen your own process. The tactics - authority signaling, recycled narratives, emotional price targets, and timing around illiquid windows - are all red flags that should prompt closer inspection, not blind reaction.

- The real lesson isn’t just about $ATYR; it’s about developing a toolkit for any trade. When you see repeated messaging, packaged narratives, or dramatic “insider” calls appearing all at once (often right as the catalyst window opens or the tape tightens), pause and ask yourself: Is this organic debate, or does it look more like a coordinated push?

- A valuable way to use bear reports and negative commentary is as a checklist. Test your own work: Are they raising new, specific risks, or just recycling the same talking points? Are they introducing evidence, or mostly emotion? If you find holes in your own thesis, tighten it up. If not, stay disciplined and avoid letting noise shake you out of your process.

- The most actionable “tell” is always in the market structure - float, borrow, block trades, options, and real trading behavior. Social sentiment can move fast, but when it diverges from structural setup, the opportunity (or risk) is usually greatest.

- Remember that your conviction should be built on evidence, not just the volume of voices online. Use both sides of the debate to strengthen your own thinking, but don’t outsource your decisions - especially when the social media chorus is at its loudest.",38,1757002848.0,ATYR_Alpha,11,1.0,False

so i recently started drinking white monster and sugar free redbull and i noticed some amazing hunger suppression thats aiding my weight loss!

so it got me wondering, what exactly is in these energy drinks that give them this property? Because when I drink coffee, or zero coke, or any other caffeinated beverage, i dont get this effect, even if i drink the same amount of caffeine.

is it the taurine? or l-carnitine? is it cus its carbonated? or maybe its something in the coffee that actually causes an opposite effect on my appetite?

has anyone tried to add supplements with coffee and got the same effect on appetite that energy drinks have? i already add l-theanine to my coffee to get rid of the jitteriness and to help with focus and relaxation, but doesnt do much to my appetite.

1n8entp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1n8entp/stop_leaving_on_the_table_ai_monetization/,Stop Leaving 💰 on the Table! AI Monetization Opportunities Expiring FAST,"Hey AiContentAutomators! 🌟 

So, let’s chat for a sec. Are you tired of watching others cash in while you’re just sitting there thinking, “Hmm, maybe I’ll get to that later”? Well, I’ve got something important to throw your way: **Stop Leaving 💰 on the Table!** 

With all these amazing AI advancements popping up faster than my morning coffee kicks in, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But guess what? While you’re waiting for the “perfect” moment, opportunities are slipping through your fingers like that last slice of pizza at a party (you know someone snatched it up before you could even get to it!). 🍕

Let’s break it down a bit. Here are some *sneaky little ways* to start monetizing your AI skills before they become yesterday’s news:

1. **Freelance Work:** 
   - Are you using AI content generation tools? Why not offer your services on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr? 
   - *Tip:* Start small! Offer a few free samples to build your portfolio and watch the orders roll in.

2. **Online Courses:**
   - If you’ve mastered how to leverage AI for writing, marketing, or anything else, could you teach it? Create a course on a platform like Teachable or Skillshare.
   - Just imagine: you could make money while you sleep! (Can I get an amen?! 🙌)

3. **Affiliate Marketing:**
   - Share your favorite AI tools and get rewarded for every friend who joins! It's like sharing your Netflix password but even better because you actually get paid. 🎉
   - Seriously, have you tried affiliate links? Do it once, and you'll be hooked!

4. **Consulting:**
   - Companies are scrambling to adopt AI but often don’t know where to start. If you're savvy, offer your insights to businesses willing to pay for your expertise.
   - Remember, even simple advice can save them *time and money*! That’s adding *real* value, my friends.

5. **Content Creation:**
   - Use AI to help create blogs, social media content, or even scripts! There’s a whole world of brands and influencers looking for engaging content.
   - Plus, you get to flex your creative muscles while cashing in on that sweet, sweet moolah.

👉 But here’s the kicker: The AI landscape is evolving at lightning speed, and opportunities can dry up faster than my patience for loading screens during gaming marathons. ⚡

So ask yourself: Are you ready to get off the sidelines? 

It’s true that the gold rush of AI monetization is hot right now. Like, *really* hot. The early birds are definitely getting the worms (or rather, those sweet dollar bills), and there’s no reason you can’t join them. 

Have you tried any of these methods? Or are there other golden nuggets of opportunity you’ve discovered? Let’s inspire and challenge each other to stop leaving money on the table and start making it rain (okay, maybe just a light drizzle for now, but you get the idea)! 💸",1,1757002710.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
