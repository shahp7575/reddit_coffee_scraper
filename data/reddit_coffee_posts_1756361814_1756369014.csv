Drank a little too much coffee today. I‚Äôm feeling restless and unable to sleep. I Googled the effects of drinking coffee while on Zoloft‚Ä¶ come to find out coffee counteracts/absorbs the positive effects of Zoloft and worsens side effects.

I'm a third year math student, and this semester I'm thinking of taking 15 units (possibly 18). This is because I'm a little bit behind on my degree and so this way I can still graduate on time. Four of the classes are math classes, the fifth is an English class, and the sixth one I'm considering adding to my schedule is a philosophy class (the four math classes are not not optional since they are all only offered in the fall, but the other two are negotiable). So far the most units I've ever done at once is 12.

I know this seems undoable, but I have a pretty solid plan for getting through this (admittedly it involves lots of coffee) and I intend to get no less than a B in all these classes. What I want to know is, what was your experience with a full course load? How much time did you dedicate to each class, and did it have a substantial impact on your life outside of school? Based on the responses, I'll probably cut the non-math classes from my schedule. ",1,1756368340.0,simonfraser,0,1.0,False
1n26bvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lowcarb/comments/1n26bvu/stuck_at_198204_lbs_on_lowcarb_keto_postpartum/,Stuck at 198‚Äì204 lbs on low-carb keto postpartum while breastfeeding ‚Äî advice?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm looking for some insight.

I‚Äôve been on a strict low-carb/keto diet since February and have been very consistent ‚Äî no sugar, no fried food, no seed oils, and I don‚Äôt snack. My daily meals are mostly:

Breakfast: 6 eggs, some goat cheese, olive oil, black coffee

Lunch: Greek yogurt with blueberries, strawberries, almonds, and a drizzle of coconut milk

Dinner: Varies, but always low-carb (e.g., homemade beef burgers with veggies)

Drinks: Water only during the day


I was pregnant until May and gained only 12‚ÄØkg (~26‚ÄØlbs) during pregnancy. I gave birth and continued this diet while breastfeeding. I initially lost the 12‚ÄØkg (~26‚ÄØlbs) the first week after delivery, but now my weight is stuck around 90‚Äì93‚ÄØkg (‚âà198‚Äì204‚ÄØlbs). My height is 1.74‚ÄØm (~5‚Äô8.5‚Äù). I have no cravings and I‚Äôm not snacking.

I know postpartum hormones and breastfeeding can slow weight loss, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experience with low-carb/keto while breastfeeding and can shed light on why fat loss seems slow even with strict adherence.

Is this plateau normal for breastfeeding women?

Could my body be holding onto fat due to milk production?

Any tips for steady postpartum fat loss on keto without affecting milk supply?


Thanks in advance for your insights!",1,1756368326.0,lowcarb,0,1.0,False

The evening settled into a quiet calm after we said goodbye to Susie and Mike. Stanley and I sat on the sofa, the small box holding our secret still on the dining table, a silent witness to the joy that had filled our home hours before. I smiled at him, touching my belly, and began to speak of all the dreams and aspirations dancing in my mind.
""We have to plan everything, Stanley. Our little princess deserves a world of her own, full of colors and beauty.""
Stanley smiled, gently running his fingers through my hair. ""Yes, our little princess deserves the best. What are your ideas? Let me hear every detail, big and small.""
""I think the color we chose will be perfect for the walls, with some quiet little drawings that sparkle like stars. And the crib, let's make it a pure white, with lace curtains to give the room a dreamy touch, like something from a fairy tale.""
My eyes shone as I described every detail, from the stuffed animals to the small shelves where I would place storybooks. He listened intently, smiling now and then as if he could already see the room. As I talked about the toys and dolls, he gently covered my eyes with his hand. I stopped speaking, and he leaned in, pressing a tender kiss to my lips. It was a long, deep kiss, full of love and longing, as if it held all the emotions he hadn't been able to express all day.
When he pulled away, he whispered in a low voice I hadn't heard from him in a long time: ""I'm sorry.""
I sat up, my curiosity piqued. ""Sorry? What for, Stanley?""
His eyes held a cautious hesitation, as if he were weighing his words. ""Sorry that I didn't tell you two days ago. I had to wait for the surprise you planned with such passion, so I wouldn't ruin your happiness.""
I frowned, my heart beating fast. ""What do you mean? You saw...""
He interrupted me softly. ""Yes, I saw it. That evening, when I got back from work. I saw the envelope by chance on the kitchen table, and somehow, the paper slipped out when I picked it up. I didn't mean to pry, I swear, but I saw the word written there. 'Girl'.""
I was stunned for a moment, a mix of joy and annoyance with myself for not being more careful. Then I sat up straight, taking it all in. ""So you knew the whole time... and you were pretending with me all this time?""
""Yes. And that's why I was so happy today, Mew. It wasn't an act. My happiness was doubled, because I got to share your joy twice. Once when I found out, and again when I saw you so happy when we discovered the surprise with Susie and Mike.""
His smile was sincere. I patted his chest with my hand on his shoulder, as if reassuring myself. ""You're wonderful, Stanley. It doesn't matter how you knew now, what matters is that you shared this moment with me.""
His expression suddenly changed, and he returned to a serious tone, as if remembering something important that had been troubling him. ""There's something else I have to tell you, Mew. I don't want to hide anything from you.""
I looked at him with clear concern. ""What is it? Is everything alright?""
""Yes, it's fine... But I'm going to be very busy in the coming period. We might be apart for a little while, not emotionally, but physically, because of my work.""
My heart sank, and a cold feeling ran through my veins, but I tried to stay calm. ""What's happening? Please don't leave me in suspense.""
""These are work secrets, my love, I can't talk about the details. All I can say is there's a huge project combining NASA and the military, and I'll be busy with some missions that require a lot of time and effort. But don't worry, Dr. Zeno will be with me at work.""
I took a deep breath to absorb the sudden shift. The news was heavy, but my trust in him was stronger than any feeling of worry. ""I trust you. As long as you told me in advance that you'll be away for a bit, I'll be fine.""
Then I added playfully, to break the seriousness between us: ""As long as Dr. Zeno is with you, I'm sure you won't be able to flirt with any girls, Stanley. I'll be watching you through him.""
Stanley laughed out loud and kissed my forehead. ""There's not a single female hair on this project! Are you suggesting I flirt with men, huh?""
We exchanged laughs, and the atmosphere returned to normal, but behind the laughter was a silent promise that no matter how far apart we were, our hearts would stay close, and our little princess would be the bond that connected us forever.
As we talked, and I felt the warmth return to my heart from his laughter, I placed my hand on my belly, wondering what the coming days would hold. Suddenly, I felt something strange, like a tiny, gentle kick, but it was very clear.
I stopped talking and my eyes widened in surprise, then I looked at Stanley. He was laughing, but he noticed the change in my expression.
""What's wrong?"" he asked, worried.
I couldn't say a word. I just grabbed his hand and placed it on my belly. My heart was pounding, and a wide smile began to form on my lips.
A few seconds later, I felt it again. A small, gentle kick, right under his palm.
Stanley's laughter stopped, and his eyes widened in wonder. He looked at me, then at my belly, then back at me, his eyes gleaming with gratitude and emotion. Silence filled the room, a sacred and blessed silence.
""Did... did you feel it?"" I whispered, my heart racing.
He nodded slowly, unable to speak. He reached with his other hand and placed it on my belly too, as if he wanted to feel it again, to make sure it wasn't a dream.
""Yes... I felt it,"" he whispered, his voice trembling, then he leaned down and pressed a long kiss to my belly, as if greeting his little princess for the first time.
That moment was the most beautiful and honest in our lives. A moment that confirmed that everything we were planning, every feeling we held, and every difficulty we would face, was worth all the trouble for that little soul that was beginning to announce its existence.
I looked into his eyes filled with emotion and said with mock indignation: ""Next time, I'll be careful not to let you see the envelope, and I won't let you keep a secret to yourself.""
Stanley laughed, and life returned to his face, then he suddenly stopped. He smiled a deep smile, and left his hand on my belly.
""What is it?"" I asked, curious.
He looked at me with deep affection and said: ""When you said, 'next time,' I felt like our family, which was just you and me, will become a lot louder, and will be filled with laughter and love with our children.""
The conversation ended with a quiet smile. Stanley gently lifted his hand from my belly, taking my hand in its place, running his thumb over my knuckles. In silence, I understood everything. I understood that this moment, which combined the joy of the surprise, the excitement of the first kick, and the fear of the coming distance, was a turning point in our lives. We were no longer just a couple, but a family, with love as its foundation and its future growing within me.
I closed my eyes, holding his hand, and imagined the laughter of our children and the commotion that would fill this quiet house. The news of Stanley's upcoming absence no longer worried me, because I believed that this little soul was proof that we would overcome any hardships together. The night had drawn its curtain, but in my heart, it was the beginning of a new story, much more beautiful than any dream.
Two weeks passed since that special night, a time of adjusting to Stanley's frequent absence. His days started early and ended late, and often he would return long after midnight, finding me asleep on the sofa waiting for him. I would wake to the smell of his coffee brewing early in the morning before he left again, leaving a small note on the kitchen table with a simple phrase like, ""I love you, don't worry, I'll be back soon.""
Work was weighing heavily on him, which I saw clearly when he returned one evening with Dr. Zeno. They sat in the living room, and I served them coffee as I watched the papers covering the entire table. They were complex plans and diagrams I didn't understand, and I felt that their scientific world was very far from the quiet world I was living in now.
Their faces were pale, and the signs of exhaustion were visible, as if the past months had been a fierce battle they were fighting.
""My goodness, you both look completely exhausted,"" I said as I placed the mugs in front of them.
Dr. Zeno smiled faintly, looking at me warmly. ""The project requires a great deal of effort, but Stanley works non-stop. I don't blame him, he has a great motivator right here.""
Stanley didn't comment, lost in his papers. A bit of tightness settled in my chest. The time we spent together wasn't much anymore, and I knew it wouldn't get better soon.
The days passed slowly, and one day, Susie was on the phone, and we were planning a fun day of shopping. She was also feeling bored; her husband Mike was on a business trip, leaving her alone in the last days of her pregnancy.
""Looks like we'll be sharing our boredom and our shopping,"" Susie said cheerfully. ""You'll be buying things for your princess, and I'll be buying for my prince who will arrive soon.""
I laughed. ""Yes, finally we'll get to have some fun away from the loneliness of home and busy husbands. How about we go tomorrow?""
""Great! I'll be ready first thing in the morning,"" Susie replied excitedly.
I hung up, feeling overjoyed. The thought of spending a whole day with my best friend was exactly what I needed.
The next day, I woke up early, contrary to my habit, and started getting dressed, preparing myself for a fun-filled day. But as I was checking for Stanley's bank card in my bag, I heard a familiar voice from behind me.
""Where are you off to this early in the morning?""
I turned quickly to find Stanley standing by the bedroom door, dressed in his casual clothes and wearing a quiet smile I hadn't seen in a while.
""Stanley! What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to go to work?""
He came over to me, placed his hands on my shoulders, and looked deep into my eyes. ""I took a day off. Just one day, to be with you. To make up for all the time I've been away.""
A mix of happiness, joy, and surprise washed over me, as if my heart wanted to leap out of my chest. I smiled happily, not revealing my plans. His sincere smile and tired eyes were more important than any plan.
""This is wonderful, Stanley... I never expected this.""
We sat down for breakfast together, the air filled with calm and warmth. Our small smiles were more valuable than any conversation. After we finished, I discreetly called Susie.
""Hello Susie, good morning.""
""Good morning... I'm about to leave, are you ready?""
""Susie, listen, I'm so sorry... But actually, Stanley came home. He didn't tell me beforehand, and he took the day off so we could spend it together.""
Susie was silent for a second, then said in a slightly disappointed voice: ""Oh my... I was really looking forward to this outing. This is so frustrating."" Then she added with false enthusiasm: ""But... do you want my advice? Tell him you were going out and had planned to spend the day with me. Maybe he'll understand, since he's been leaving you alone all this time.""
A tightness formed in my chest, and I frowned a little. ""No, Susie. He didn't ask me where I was going, and that makes it harder. He postponed everything for me, to make up for his absence. If I left him now, it would be a cruel thing for me to do. I'd feel guilty all day.""
Susie sighed. ""As you wish, my dear, but I'm sure he'll understand.""
""I truly hope so,"" I said in a low voice. ""I'm genuinely sorry, he said it was only a day off. What do you say we go shopping tomorrow?""
""Yes, great idea! I'll be waiting for you,"" Susie replied.
We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone. I returned to Stanley, who was smiling at me as he washed the dishes. Before I could reach him, he asked calmly: ""Who were you talking to?""
I was surprised. I had thought I was whispering in the bedroom and that he hadn't heard me. I didn't show my surprise and asked innocently: ""How did you know I was on the phone?""
Stanley laughed, not looking up from the dishes: ""My senses are well-honed, especially my hearing, like a hawk's.""
I laughed back: ""Isn't a hawk known for its vision?""
He smiled his usual smile: ""Then I used the wrong expression. My sight is like a hawk's, but my hearing is like an owl's.""
We laughed together, then I told him: ""It was Susie. She called so we could go shopping together as we had planned, but I told her you were here and I apologized to her.""
Stanley was surprised by what he heard and stopped washing the dishes. ""But... if you both want to go out, that's fine. At the end of the day, it's my day off, I can just get some rest.""
I refused immediately and moved closer to him. ""No, Stanley. Seeing you relaxed here at home made my heart flutter with longing for you.""
I approached his side with shy steps, tapping his shoulder gently. My words stumbled, and my face flushed with shyness. ""And... we can spend some time alone... can't we?""
He smiled and winked at me. ""Yes, whatever you want.""
That moment, which came unexpectedly, was more precious than any day of shopping in the world. It was a true surprise, carrying within it all the love and care I had been missing. It was the moment I felt that we had never been truly apart, and that love could overcome any distance, even the distance of work and business.

\- TRIP TO TOLEDO OR SEGOVIA? Which of the two would you recommend?

\- Is it possible to visit Ronda and Setenil in one day? I've seen that there aren't any easy connections.

\- Is it worth going to Albufera for lunch?

\- I already have an endless list of foods I want to try and places where I can do so, but if you have any MUST-visit places in mind, I'd love to hear about them.

So I popped in boots and bought one of those gift cards that can be used on generic food places etc. Very grateful and off we go.

As a retiree I've found that staying active and engaged is key to a continuing life which is happy and fulfilling. I wanted to share a few things that have really helped me, and maybe they'll resonate with some of you as well.

# It is as simple as building a routine that's a mix of different activities. Reading is a huge one. I try to read a little bit every day, whether it's a good novel, a non-fiction book, or a few articles online. It's a great way to relax and learn something new.

I've also found it so important to make and maintain **social connections**. My wife and I make it a point to regularly meet up with friends for breakfast or morning coffee and a chat. It's amazing how a simple conversation can brighten your day. **Staying in touch with family**, even with just a quick phone call or video chat, is also an important part of our routine. Pictures of youngsters from the wider family and friends as they grow up flood our inboxes - it's lovely to see. It keeps us feeling connected and supported.

To keep my brain sharp, I'm a fan of **puzzles and games**. We do Wordle, crosswords, sudoku, and play board/card games with friends. I also make an effort to **stay abreast of current affairs**. Knowing what's going on in the world, no matter how bad it gets, keeps me feeling relevant and gives me plenty to talk about with friends and family.

# I have also tried to stay creative. I have taken up drawing and watercolour painting. I also like to make puzzles as well as solve them.

I've had a lot of fun creating a new project. I developed a free daily online word puzzle called **GramGrid**. The idea is to give the brain a gentle workout by challenging you to fit four 4-letter words in to a 3x3 grid making row and column sums meet targets. Then find a 9-letter word.

I've been playing it myself for a while now, and I find it's a perfect little daily ritual. I wanted to share it with this community because it's something I've found truly helpful in my own retirement journey, and I hope some of you might enjoy it too.

You can find it at https://gramgrid.net. There are no ads, cookies or trackers

Thanks for letting me share. I'd love to hear what helps you all stay happy and active in your retirement.

It caught me of gaurd and i kind of froze I hope there's a moment tomorrow to tell her and confirm a time I feel so stupid for not holding her tight in my arms and comforting her like she did when I went though my brake up I don't have any way of contacting her .my heads spinning so much I don't think iv every felt like this before I wanna skip coffee and go straight to dinner she's so amazing and so caring and loving and shows it in everything she does.

1n266pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1n266pq/online_dating_in_2025_over_it_a_rant/,Online Dating in 2025: OVER IT (a rant),"**TLDR:**¬†I'm done with online dating forever.

**Background:**¬†38 Female, no children & never married. Homeowner, solid career in tech, and a dog mom. Always looking for friends, traveling companions, or possibly a relationship.

**Disclaimer:**¬†I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôm a woman on the spectrum, extremely high masking, and I can have a unique communication style and way of connecting with others. Unfortunately, I can share too much initially, be overly trusting, blunt, honest, and vulnerable. I seem to think that by getting all of my potential deal-breakers and TMI out of the way first, that's less time wasted for us both... but this may be biting me in the butt. These are things I am always, and will always be, working to manage. And yes, I am a longtime lover of therapy.

I have been using dating apps for 15 years now, and I‚Äôm ready to hang them up for good. Although most of my long-term relationships have formed from them (which are stories of their own), as well as a handful of lasting friendships, the landscape has changed. In the past, I‚Äôve been able to overlook the bad, because there has been enough good to outweigh it... but this past summer has broken me.

Where to start‚Ä¶ Maybe the initial messages, all in acronyms? ‚ÄúHRU‚Äù or ‚ÄúSUP‚Äù or insert random emoji here. Or all of the main profile pictures of oversized iridescent/oil slink lenses, often hovering over a fish‚Ä¶ usually some kind of bass.

I had a good chuckle to myself recently while crabbing in an early morning tide with some guy friends. One of them commented on how all of the women on the apps are ‚Äúduck-faced‚Äù or using filters. I quickly recounted all of the profiles I‚Äôve swiped left on that were shirtless out of context or contained these dark, edgy stares into the camera at all angles without so much as a smirk in sight.

I have, unknowingly of course, dated many types of men at this point: married men, engaged men, men in long-term relationships, men with children after stating that they didn‚Äôt have children, and straight-up catfish. And all of this is aside from the countless times I‚Äôve been ghosted, which unfortunately comes with the territory of dating these days‚Ä¶ even though I find that behavior to be a clear sign of emotional immaturity in most cases (sometimes justified though).

The initial blow of 2025 came in April. I had been texting a man for about a month, and we were hitting it off. We had much in common and eventually set a date to meet. Once the date was set, he started showing an unusual interest in my assets and future endeavors in a way that raised an orange flag. I figured it was time for a quick call to ‚Äúcatch his vibe‚Äù. And folks, as someone who is experienced in tech, he was using a voice changer.

I thought I would step up my game, so I required a video call with the next guy. He was able to wriggle out of our set time two or three times, and the flags came up. Eventually, he conceded. He had a very thick accent and was here on a work visa. Nothing wrong with either of those things of course, except that it proved his entire backstory leading up to that point to be false. Through forced tears, he tried to tell me that he just wanted me to give him a chance‚Ä¶ luckily, I‚Äôm not that stupid.

The following ‚Äúmatch‚Äù ended up being a new father, with a literal newborn at home. And I randomly got a text in the middle of the night, ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù after an embarrassing exchange of nudes.

Then enter the man who was in a relationship with a woman for three years who had recently been disabled.

Then enter the fianc√© who was supposed to be married in November of this year.

And I get it, the common denominator is me. If you were to line up all of my exes in a row, they would all look completely different. Short, tall, fat, thin, harry, bald, all sizes and colors. And this is still happening, so I need to examine more closely what‚Äôs going on here. That's why I‚Äôm removing myself from the world of online dating, potentially for good.

I‚Äôm sure you have questions‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhy are you swiping left on the nice guys?‚Äù That‚Äôs the problem. These predatory men are exceptional at pretending to be nice guys. Believe it or not, I pay much more attention to a person‚Äôs bio and profile details than I do to their profile pictures. And you know what, most of yours suck.

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt all 6‚Äô tall.‚Äù Shut up. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10‚Äù. Anything taller than me works.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably fat.‚Äù You got me there. I‚Äôm overweight and on a serious weight loss journey. Exercise and nutrition have become passions of mine, and I‚Äôm hitting my goals every month. So to be honest, I‚Äôm probably in better health than most of you are.

And I repeat what I said above, I‚Äôm not perfect. There‚Äôs plenty of things to dislike about me. I‚Äôm not for everyone, and there's two sides to every story. But these most recent experiences have breached the boundaries of mere incompatibility. Online dating has become a terrifying place, and I‚Äôve had enough.

Gary: You drink too much, you are too physically forceful when trying to flirt, even after I told you you were hurting my elbow and were making me uncomfortable, and I hate your mustache.

Michael: Please stop interrupting women when they are trying to answer your questions, or making comments about what a catch you are and that you should be sending yourself flowers for how achieved you are‚Ä¶ freaking narcissist.

Christopher: You should have been upfront about having kids instead of waiting so long, because I would have been more open-minded about it. I also wish you had disclosed that you chew so much, because I really don‚Äôt like tobacco and I could taste it on you.

Travis: You really creep me out. Some of the things you say about others are dark and hateful. You call yourself a ‚Äúsad boy‚Äù, and I worry about you being alone. I can‚Äôt be with someone I worry about like that.

Ben: You should have never lied about your past before drunkenly confessing to me that you had anger issues, especially when drinking (ironic).

Cody: If a woman asks for a quick chat over the phone for a vibe check, please oblige. And do it right away, it will show her you are interested and care about her feeling safe, especially when plans are being made to meet. At the very least, I think we could have made great friends on our fitness journeys together.

Saxon: I hate that you wasted so much of my time, even though I know how lonely you are. You could have just told me that you weren't interested. I can handle it. Also, texting is a horrible way to communicate.

To all women: Please, please, please stay safe out there. Always let your circle know who you are talking to, where you are going, ESPECIALLY when meeting up.

To all the genuinely ""good guys"": I swear we're out there, and we're looking for you. The reasons aren't what you think, and it's so hard to hear you through all the noise and danger.

To everyone else: Feel free to roast me, lecture me, advise me‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôve had enough.

I‚Äôm going to be making an effort to hit up more coffee shops, parks, bookstores, etc. I‚Äôm going to go back to speed dating in the city. I‚Äôm going to put more focus on meeting people out in the real world and hoping my luck will change while continuing to work on myself. This has all been too hard on my heart.

We enedd up chatting for horus at this cute coffee shop and, without even realizing it, I started copying her posture and even her hand gestures. At one point, I noticed myself chuckling in the same way she did, and it was kida eeire. I mean, I didn't even notice I was doing it until she pointed it out and we both had a laugh about it.

Apparently, this tendency to mirror someone else uncoonsciously is called the ""chameleeon efect."" It's something we do as humans to create rapport and build socizl bonds without even thinking about it. Psychologists say it's all about empathy and connection, which makes sense because I'm super close with Sara.

Apparently this new paper is way slower. No matter the grind size, the draw down takes always around 3:30 min and the taste does not  change like and as much as I am use to with different grind sizes.

Let‚Äôs talk about the glorious hellscape that is estimate reconciliation. That magical workflow stage where we all morph from ordinary adjusters into forensic accountants, hostage negotiators, and part-time comedians just to keep our sanity.

If you‚Äôre reading this at 7:59 AM, coffee in hand, already with four voicemails from the same PA all saying ‚Äúper our previous conversation‚Ä¶‚Äù, welcome home. If you‚Äôre not already tracking, hit save draft and duck, because the mitigation contractor just submitted a 54-page supplement for demoing a closet.



**Claim Drama With More Plot Twists Than Netflix**

For the blissfully unaware, estimate reconciliation is where the insurance company‚Äôs ‚Äúfair and reasonable‚Äù meets contractor ‚Äúestimating logic.‚Äù In theory, it‚Äôs comparing an Xactimate or Symbility number to whatever spreadsheet masterpiece shows up from the contractor or PA, ironing out the gaps so the homeowner can get their checks.

Best part? No two reconciliations are ever the same. The only constants:

* Xactimate
* Endless back-and-forth
* The urge to set your phone on fire



**The 3 Stages of Estimate Reconciliation Grief**

1. Denial: ‚ÄúSurely the contractor‚Äôs $72,000 estimate to repaint the powder room was a typo.‚Äù
2. Anger: ‚ÄúWhy does this mitigation estimate include 23 man-hours to move one appliance?‚Äù
3. Acceptance: ‚ÄúWell, at least this estimate only has prime and paint the house three times, not four!‚Äù



**The Silver Lining**

The upside is this: reconciliation sharpens skills no training ever could. Pattern recognition, negotiation tactics, patience under fire‚Äîthose come standard after your first hundred reconciles. The chaos forces precision, and the grind quietly turns rookies into veterans. You may want to throw your phone, but you‚Äôll also catch things no one else sees.

Aisha was being slowly engulfed by the vines tightening around her blanket cocoon. I moved forward with surprising agility, trying to free her from her prison. All four of my arms were working clumsily, trying to rip the vines apart. I didn‚Äôt know how they moved, but the urgency of the current situation made me push those thoughts back. I tried to focus, tried to make my arms move in some semblance of coordination.  



Aisha looked at me, the horror in her eyes replaced with sleepiness. She had no reaction to me becoming an almost alien creature. She had no reaction to her current predicament as well.  



‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù she whispered in a small voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so peaceful. I can feel the sun, the humidity, and soil. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Just buzz off and let me sleep.‚Äù  



‚ÄúAisha, you have to fight it,‚Äù I almost screamed at her. ‚ÄúThis thing, this change‚Ä¶. it reacts to your deepest desire. If you give in‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen.‚Äù A silent sob escaped from my mouth.  



‚ÄúDesire? That‚Äôs okay. Just let me be a tree,‚Äù Aisha whispered, not even making an effort to think about it.  



‚ÄúI know you like to relax and be one with nature. But there are people who need you. I need you. So please fight back.‚Äù I felt my voice tremble. She was a lazy and annoying neighbour. But she was also a friend, my best friend, even though I would never admit it to her.  



She looked into my eyes for a full minute, while I wrestled to keep the vines from engulfing her. Then, with a resigned sigh, she tried to break free. The vines heeded her command, freeing her from her cocoon. She lazily got up and looked longingly at the nest-like structure created by the vines using pillows and blankets.  



‚ÄúI will come back to you, my love. Some people just can‚Äôt live without me,‚Äù she said lovingly to the vines, and they shook. She now had two butterfly-like wings coming from her back. A single vine wrapped around her arm like a bracelet.  



‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou look like the blue alien from Avatar had a baby with an idiot.‚Äù  



‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. Have you even seen that movie? Anyway, these things have been happening all over the world. I need to go see what happened to the tiny people. Wanna come with me?‚Äù  



‚ÄúLet me make herbal tea first. I don‚Äôt wanna even see your cheap-ass coffee.‚Äù  



I sat back on the couch while Aisha carried a basketful of herbs to my kitchen. I was curious to see what was happening to other people.  



A lot had happened while I was rescuing- I liked the sound of that- Aisha. The tiny couple, the ones the size of mice but with the strength of peak athletes, had started creating videos of tiny living spaces for other people like them. They had repurposed a doll house they had with them. They were trying to fit LEDs from toys into the doll house. There was also a shoe box that was stuffed with a small cushion. It was comical seeing two people working hard among dolls bigger than them. I felt jealous of how comfortable they looked.  



There were other posts. Someone had become a superhero and flew with his father to a hospital when his gun misfired. The guy had the biggest smile on his face.  


Some became their true selves, without the boundaries of gender or shape.  



The guy who had a snake-headed tail was trying to feed it different food. He was still scared. He was still praying while he did it. But they had become odd companions during this confusing time.  



There was a small community of giants, all roughly 10m tall, sharing tips on how to be safe around people. Everyone was supporting each other. But I couldn‚Äôt shake off the anxiety I was feeling inside me.  



If it was people‚Äôs deepest desires giving them form, what happens if it‚Äôs something evil? What was the meaning of my form? What was my desire?

1n25t3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n25t3x/the_art_of_curating_your_lifes_inner_circle/,The Art of Curating Your Life‚Äôs Inner Circle üë•‚ú®,"

Think about the five people you interact with the most. Now, consider this: their mindsets, their habits, and their energy aren‚Äôt just background noise‚Äîthey are actively shaping your own. We become a blend of the people we spend our time with. This isn't about magic or osmosis; it's the practical reality of human psychology. We unconsciously mirror the language, ambitions, and attitudes of our inner circle.

This makes the act of choosing who gets a front-row seat in your life one of the most significant decisions you will ever make. Curating your inner circle isn't about being exclusive or dismissive. It's about being intentional. It's the conscious art of surrounding yourself with people who challenge you to grow, support you when you stumble, and reflect the values you aspire to live by. Your network is your net worth, not in money, but in personal growth and well-being.

This is your guide to becoming the conscious curator of your most valuable social environment.

The ""Why"": Your Circle is Your Ecosystem üå±

Every person in your life is part of your personal ecosystem. Each one contributes something to the environment:

¬∑ The Uplifters: They add energy, optimism, and support. They make you feel capable and valued.
¬∑ The Grounded: They offer stability, honesty, and practical wisdom. They keep you rooted.
¬∑ The Inspirers: They challenge you by their example. Their curiosity, ambition, or kindness motivates you to be better.
¬∑ The Drainers: They consistently subtract energy through negativity, criticism, or drama. They leave you feeling exhausted or doubtful.

A healthy ecosystem needs diversity‚Äîuplifters, grounded folks, and inspirers all play a role. But it cannot sustainably support constant drainers.

The Audit: Taking Stock of Your Current Circle üìã

The first step of curation is assessment. You must know what's already on your shelves.

1. The Energy Audit: After you interact with someone, how do you feel?
   ¬∑ Energized & Elevated? This person is a keeper. They belong in your inner circle.
   ¬∑ Neutral? These are good acquaintances. They form your valuable outer circle.
   ¬∑ Drained & Diminished? This is crucial data. It tells you this relationship may need to be re-evaluated, distanced, or have stronger boundaries.
2. The Values Alignment Check: Do the people closest to you generally respect and understand your core values, even if they don't share them all? A friend who values honesty can support your value of ambition, even if they are more laid-back. The key is mutual respect.

The Art of Curating: Actionable Steps üñºÔ∏è

Curating isn't a one-time purge; it's an ongoing process of mindful selection.

1. Prioritize Proximity with Intention You have limited time and energy.Be deliberate about who gets the most of it. This means consciously investing more time in the people who make you feel energised and aligned. It doesn't mean you have to formally ""break up"" with others; it often just means gently demoting them to a more outer circle and investing less one-on-one time.

2. Learn the Gentle Art of Boundary Setting üöß Curation requires boundaries.This is how you manage the ""drainers"" in a respectful way.

¬∑ Actionable Step: You can limit a relationship without ending it. For a frequently negative friend, you might say, ""I love you and want to support you. For this conversation, can we focus on solutions rather than the problem?"" Or, simply limit the duration of your catch-ups. Protect your energy.

3. Seek Out ""And"" People ü§ù Curate your circle toward""And"" people. These are people who can sit with you in a hard moment and celebrate your wins with genuine joy. They can challenge your idea and still make you feel respected. They are complex, whole humans who allow you to be one, too.

4. Be the Curator, Not the Critic This process is about taking responsibility foryour choices and your energy, not about judging others. Someone might be a drain for you while being a wonderful, uplifting friend to someone else. It‚Äôs not about their worth; it‚Äôs about compatibility with your current path and needs.

5. Don't Forget to Add New Pieces üé® Curating isn't just about subtracting;it's also about actively seeking new additions. Want to be more creative? Seek out and connect with creative people. Want to learn a new skill? Find a community that shares that interest. Be proactive in inviting new, positive influences into your life.

You Are the Curator of Your Own Experience üèõÔ∏è

You hold the keys to your own gallery. The people you allow into your inner circle are the exhibits on display, and they shape the entire experience of your life.

Your invitation is to take a gentle, honest look at your current collection. Appreciate the masterpieces already there. Consider if some pieces need to be moved to a different room or stored away. And be open to discovering and acquiring new art that inspires the person you are becoming.

This is an act of profound self-respect. By curating your inner circle, you are not building walls; you are building a foundation for a more supportive, positive, and growth-oriented life.

The shot ends at 36 grams on the input (i do not have a bluetooth scale), which is the setting of the pour. But the thing is that it should not include the water going in during pre-infusion, so total should be like \~58. From the graph, it seems that the preinfusion phase ends for whatever reason too early (at 2bars), before the pressure reaches 4 bars (which is the default setting). As a result the puck in not fully soaked, majority of the additional water ends up in the puck and the whole shot terminates prematurely.

This is how it worked previously:¬†[https://visualizer.coffee/shots/13c70ab2-cb9b-4704-b062-a33c54787c00](https://visualizer.coffee/shots/13c70ab2-cb9b-4704-b062-a33c54787c00)

1n25qqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n25qqq/the_symphony_of_life_harmonizing_work_love_and/,"The Symphony of Life: Harmonizing Work, Love, and Play üéªüé∫üéπ","
Imagine your life as a grand symphony. It is not a single, repetitive note, but a rich and complex composition made up of many different instruments and movements. Three of the most powerful sections in this orchestra are Work, Love, and Play. When they are all playing their own tune without any coordination, the result is noise‚Äîa chaotic, stressful clamor that leaves us feeling overwhelmed and out of tune. But when they are harmonized, each supporting and enhancing the others, they create a masterpiece of a lived experience. This is the art of integration, not balance. It‚Äôs about weaving these elements together into a cohesive and beautiful whole.

This isn't about achieving a perfect, static 50/50/50 split. That‚Äôs an impossible and frustrating goal. Instead, it's about learning to be the conductor of your own orchestra, knowing when to let one section swell to a crescendo and when to let another rest, all while keeping the overall piece moving beautifully forward.

Here‚Äôs how to listen to your life‚Äôs music and start conducting a more harmonious symphony.

Meet Your Orchestra Sections üéº

First, let's define these sections in practical, modern terms:

1. The Work Section: The Rhythm and Structure üé∫ This isn't just your job or career.""Work"" is any effortful, productive activity that creates value‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a paid project, maintaining your home, studying, volunteering, or dedicated practice toward a goal. It provides the rhythm and structure to your days. Without it, the symphony can lack direction.

2. The Love Section: The Melody and Heart üéª ""Love""encompasses all deep, meaningful connections. This is the emotional core of your symphony‚Äîyour relationships with family, partners, friends, and even community. It‚Äôs the melody you hum long after the music has stopped, the part that gives the piece its heart and meaning.

3. The Play Section: The Improvisation and Joy üéπ ""Play""is any activity done purely for the joy of it, with no external goal or necessary outcome. It‚Äôs hobbies, creativity, laughter, exploration, and fun. This section brings the improvisation, spontaneity, and pure joy that prevents the symphony from becoming too rigid and predictable.

The Conductor's Tools: How to Harmonize Your Life üé∂

A conductor doesn‚Äôt play every instrument but guides them all. Your tools are your intention and attention.

Tool 1: Listen for the Dissonance üëÇ The first step is awareness.Where does your life feel out of tune? Are you working so much that your relationships (Love) are suffering? Are you so focused on family that you‚Äôve lost all sense of personal fun (Play)? Dissonance feels like stress, resentment, boredom, or exhaustion.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Once a week, do a quick ""orchestra check-in."" On a scale of 1-10, how fulfilled do you feel in Work, Love, and Play? You don‚Äôt need to even the scores, just notice which section feels neglected or overbearing.

Tool 2: Compose with Intention, Not Guilt üìù You are the composer of your score.Instead of feeling guilty for not doing ""enough"" in one area, consciously allocate your energy based on your current ""movement"" in life. A demanding work project might require a temporary crescendo in the Work section, with simpler, sustaining notes in Love and Play. That‚Äôs okay, as long as you consciously bring the other sections back in later.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Plan for harmony. If you know you have a big Work push coming up, schedule a specific, protected time for a Play activity afterward and a dedicated, phone-free connection moment with a loved one (Love). This ensures no section goes silent for too long.

Tool 3: Look for Blended Notes üéµ The most beautiful music happens when the sections aren‚Äôt separate but blend together.Can you find ways to weave Play into your Work or Love into your Play?

¬∑ Work + Play: Turn a tedious task into a game. Listen to a favorite podcast while doing chores. Approach a challenge with a spirit of curiosity rather than dread.
¬∑ Love + Work: Collaborate on a project with a partner or friend. Ask a loved one for their input on a work problem.
¬∑ Love + Play: Try a new, fun activity with your partner or family instead of just defaulting to the usual routines.

Tool 4: Embrace the Rests üé∂ A rest is a purposeful pause in the music.It is not empty space; it is part of the composition. Schedule deliberate rests‚Äîmoments of true stillness and doing nothing. This prevents burnout and allows you to appreciate the music that has just been played and prepare for what comes next.

Your Symphony is Unique to You

Your ideal symphony will not sound like anyone else‚Äôs. Someone else‚Äôs composition might have a grand, powerful Work section, while yours has a softer, more intricate melody of Love. Theirs is not better; it‚Äôs just different. Avoid comparing your orchestra‚Äôs sound to another‚Äôs.

Your invitation is to pick up your conductor‚Äôs baton today. Don‚Äôt try to rewrite the entire score at once.

Start by listening. Where does the music sound off?

Then, make one small adjustment. Maybe it‚Äôs introducing five minutes of Play into your day. Maybe it‚Äôs being fully present in a Love moment instead of thinking about Work. Maybe it‚Äôs taking a real rest without guilt.

You are the composer, conductor, and audience of your own life‚Äôs symphony. Make it a piece you love to listen to.

# How is it possible at all? üßê

**Meet MCP!**

MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?!

You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for¬†**Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan**¬†only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a¬†**game changer**.

# But what is the business opportunity here? ü§î

>***To use all of these services from any device (including your IPhone) you need to connect it to an MCP Server***

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere (in a server in your basement or in cloud).

*And unless you have:*

* *A PhD in Computer Science*
* *10+ years of software development under your belt*
* *Or a license in certified¬†black magic programming*

‚Ä¶**you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.**

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

We are building¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/)¬†is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

**Why will every person need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone.

**Why will every company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

# How is it possible at all? üßê

**Meet MCP!**

MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?!

You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for¬†**Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan**¬†only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a¬†**game changer**.

# But what is the business opportunity here? ü§î

>!***To use all of these services from any device (including your IPhone) you need to connect it to an MCP Server***!<

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere (in a server in your basement or in cloud).

*And unless you have:*

* *A PhD in Computer Science*
* *10+ years of software development under your belt*
* *Or a license in certified¬†black magic programming*

‚Ä¶**you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.**

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

We are building¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/)¬†is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

**Why will every person need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone.

**Why will every company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

# Where do we stand now

Imagine standing at a crossroads. Every path looks possible, but you feel unsure which one to take. This is what life can feel like when we face difficult decisions, big or small. Without a clear sense of what truly matters to us, we can feel lost, swayed by outside opinions or short-term pressures. What we need isn‚Äôt a rigid set of rules, but a reliable inner compass‚Äîone that always points us toward what feels right, meaningful, and true for us. This compass is built from our personal values.

Your values are your core beliefs‚Äîthe principles that guide your behavior and choices. They are like a compass because they don‚Äôt dictate the exact path, but they always show you your true north. Whether it‚Äôs honesty, kindness, courage, creativity, or fairness, your values help you navigate complex situations with clarity and confidence. This isn‚Äôt about being perfect. It‚Äôs about having a tool that helps you stay aligned with who you are and who you want to be.

Living by your values makes decision-making easier, strengthens your relationships, and builds self-trust. Best of all, it‚Äôs a practice that belongs to everyone‚Äîno matter your background or beliefs. Here‚Äôs how to find, refine, and follow your own compass.

---

How to Discover Your Core Values üîç

You might already know some of your values, but others may be hidden beneath the surface. Here‚Äôs a simple way to uncover them:

1. Think of Peak Moments üìÖ Recall times when you felt proud, fulfilled, or truly yourself. What were you doing? Who were you with? What values were you honoring in those moments? (e.g., creativity, connection, achievement)
2. Notice What Bugs You üò† Irritation can be a clue. When you see something that feels unjust or frustrating, it often points to a value being violated. (e.g., if disorganization bothers you, you may value order; if gossip upsets you, you may value loyalty)
3. Imagine Your Ideal World üåç If you could change one thing about your community or the world, what would it be? Your answer often reflects a deep personal value.
4. Try a List üìù Review a list of common values (easily found online) and circle the 10 that resonate most. Then, narrow it down to your top 3‚Äì5. These are your compass points.

How to Use Your Values Compass in Everyday Life üß≠

Once you know your values, the real work begins: using them.

When Making Decisions: Let your values guide you.Faced with a tough choice? Ask:

¬∑ Which option best aligns with my values?
¬∑ Which one would make me feel most at peace tomorrow?

When Setting Boundaries: Your values help you know what to say‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù to. If you value family, you might decline extra work on weekends. If you value growth, you might say yes to a challenging new project.

When Dealing with Conflict: In disagreements,return to your values. Instead of reacting angrily, ask:

¬∑ What value of mine feels threatened here?
¬∑ How can I express this value without dismissing the other person?

When You Feel Lost or Stuck: Reconnect with your values.They are your anchor. Ask:

¬∑ Am I living in a way that reflects what matters to me?
¬∑ What‚Äôs one small step I can take today to honor one of my values?

---

What to Do When Your Compass Wobbles üåÄ

No one follows their values perfectly all the time. You‚Äôll have moments of doubt, distraction, or compromise‚Äîand that‚Äôs okay. The compass isn‚Äôt there to judge you. It‚Äôs there to guide you back.

¬∑ Reflect gently: ‚ÄúWhy did I act against my value? What was going on?‚Äù
¬∑ Learn and adjust: ‚ÄúHow can I honor my values better next time?‚Äù
¬∑ Be kind to yourself: Values are a practice, not a performance.

---

You Already Have What You Need üå±

You don‚Äôt need someone else‚Äôs map. You don‚Äôt need permission to choose your direction. Your values are yours‚Äîand they are enough. Start small. Pick one value this week and consciously live by it. See how it feels. Adjust as you go.

Your inner compass is always there, waiting to guide you. Trust it.

1.‚Å† ‚Å†The startup time is painful. It takes several minutes just to initialize the agent every single time.

I've probably lost hours this week for it to load before I can even run my next test.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†It's basically coding blind. The agent has no access to:

Your actual database (can't query to verify schema or test data)

Can't run the app to see if the code actually works

No access to logs or debugging output

Can't interact with your local dev environment at all

This leads to so many accuracy issues. It's making assumptions about your data structure, guessing at API responses, and writing code that looks right but breaks the moment you actually run it. You end up in this endless loop of:

Agent writes code

You run it

It fails because of some environment-specific issue the agent couldn't see

Back to the agent with error messages

Repeat

Don't get me wrong, it's still useful for boilerplate and general logic, but the lack of real environment access means you're constantly playing telephone between the agent and your actual codebase.

A buttery croissant or a slice of cake is the classic companion to a cup of espresso. 

But coffee, especially espresso, has so many layers of flavor that it can be paired with a wide range of foods you may not have thought of. For home baristas and coffee lovers, experimenting with pairings is part of the fun of perfecting your skills and discovering new tastes.

Below are some interesting and creative ways to go beyond pastries and expand your coffee pairing experience at home.



# 1. Cheese and Espresso

Cheese and coffee may sound unusual, but they share surprising flavor chemistry. Strong, nutty cheeses like aged gouda or parmesan can complement the bold intensity of espresso. The sharpness of the cheese balances the bitterness, creating a smooth aftertaste. On the other hand, creamy cheeses like brie or camembert bring out espresso‚Äôs fruity and floral notes, offering a rich yet mellow contrast.

For a small tasting experience, prepare a cheese board with two or three different styles of cheese and taste each with a sip of espresso. Notice how the coffee flavor changes with each bite: sometimes highlighting sweetness, sometimes accentuating smokiness. This is one of the simplest ways to turn a home coffee break into a more memorable ritual.



# 2. Fresh Fruits for Bright Contrast

Fruits can highlight the natural acidity and sweetness in coffee. Berries such as raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries pair beautifully with lighter espresso roasts, enhancing their floral and citrus notes. For a bolder contrast, try pairing a rich, dark espresso with slices of orange, grapefruit, or even a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. The balance of sweet and tart creates a lively contrast to the strong coffee base.

Another fun experiment is to pair espresso with dried fruits such as figs, apricots, or dates. Their concentrated sweetness and chewy texture complement espresso‚Äôs depth and leave a satisfying finish. This kind of pairing works especially well as an afternoon snack when you want something light yet flavorful.



# 3. Savory Bites with Coffee

Coffee doesn‚Äôt always have to be paired with sweets. In fact, savory foods can bring out espresso‚Äôs hidden flavors. 

Smoked salmon on toast, prosciutto, or even roasted nuts make interesting companions. The saltiness cuts through the espresso‚Äôs bitterness and brings out its depth. A slice of sourdough with olive oil and sea salt is another simple but elegant option.

For a more substantial pairing, try a small plate of charcuterie with cured meats, olives, and pickles. Each bite interacts differently with the espresso, giving you a mini flavor journey. Think of it as balancing flavors the same way wine pairs with cheese, meats, and savory dishes.



# 4. Chocolate Beyond Dessert

Chocolate and coffee are natural partners. 

Instead of a slice of cake, try pairing a square of dark chocolate or even a piece of chili-infused chocolate. The bitterness of dark chocolate mirrors the boldness of espresso, while the chili adds an exciting kick. Milk chocolate works well with milk-based drinks like cappuccinos or lattes, making the pairing feel comforting and familiar.

For a unique twist, white chocolate can highlight sweeter notes in espresso, giving an almost caramel-like balance. Coffee beans coated in chocolate are also a fun, bite-sized way to enjoy the pairing without extra preparation. By experimenting with different chocolate intensities (from 40% cocoa to 90%), you can see how each interacts differently with espresso‚Äôs rich flavors.



# 5. Global Inspirations

In Scandinavia, some people dip cheese into their coffee, blending salty and bitter flavors in one sip. In Mexico, spiced coffee with cinnamon and chili is paired with savory snacks or sweet bread. In Italy, espresso is often enjoyed with small bites of biscotti, while in Japan, delicate sweets like mochi are paired with coffee to balance its bitterness.

These cultural traditions show how versatile coffee can be. By exploring them, you can bring new dimensions into your home routine. Try setting aside one morning or evening a week for a global-inspired pairing. This not only broadens your flavor horizons but also connects you to coffee lovers around the world who enjoy similar rituals.

# Why Enthusiasts Love Double Boiler Machines

Pairings are all about enjoying coffee at its best. That‚Äôs why some home baristas invest in double boiler espresso machines. Unlike single boiler models, which require switching between brewing and steaming temperatures, a double boiler allows both to happen at once.

* **Consistent Shots**: One boiler keeps brewing temperature stable, ensuring every espresso is reliable in flavor.
* **Better Workflow**: The second boiler handles steaming milk without waiting, so your cappuccino or latte is ready faster.
* **Caf√©-Quality Experience**: This setup mirrors the professional workflow, which matters when experimenting with pairings like cheese plates, savory bites, or global-inspired recipes where timing and temperature make a difference.

For enthusiasts who see coffee as more than just a drink, a double boiler machine is less about status and more about creating smoother, caf√©-level experiences at home. Popular models such as the [Breville dual espresso machine](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/breville-bes920xl-dual-boiler-espresso-machine/) give hobbyists an accessible way to enjoy the benefits of two boilers without stepping into fully commercial setups. It becomes a tool that helps you experiment more freely with pairings, since you can focus on flavor instead of waiting for equipment to adjust.



# Final Thoughts

Coffee is versatile enough to pair with far more than pastries. Cheese, fruits, savory bites, chocolate, and cultural traditions all bring out different sides of espresso. With the consistency of a double boiler machine, these experiments become easier and more enjoyable. 

Next time you brew at home, try an unexpected pairing... you may discover a new favorite ritual worth sharing.

1n25k3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n25k3z/life_in_the_present_tense_the_antidote_to_anxiety/,Life in the Present Tense: The Antidote to Anxiety ‚è≥‚ú®,"

Have you ever noticed where your anxiety lives? It almost never resides in the now. It thrives in the imagined futures of ""what if?"" and the replayed pasts of ""if only."" We spend so much of our mental energy time-traveling to stressful places that don't currently exist, while the only moment we actually have‚Äîthe present‚Äîslips by unnoticed. This constant mental evacuation from the current moment is exhausting and is the primary fuel for anxiety.

Living in the present tense is not a mystical state of enlightenment. It is a practical, learnable skill of mental focus. It is the conscious decision to anchor your attention in the current hour, the current task, the current sensation. When you are fully engaged in the present, there is simply no room for the swirling ""what-ifs"" of anxiety to take root. The present moment is almost always manageable; it's the projected future that feels overwhelming.

This is your guide to reclaiming your attention, grounding yourself in the here and now, and building a natural defense against anxiety.

The Anatomy of Anxiety: A Time Travel Problem üï∞Ô∏è

Anxiety is a trick of the mind. It convinces you that you are in danger when, in the vast majority of cases, you are physically safe. Its power comes from pulling you out of the present.

¬∑ Worry is future-based anxiety. It's the mind's attempt to solve problems that haven't happened yet (and often never will).
¬∑ Rumination is past-based anxiety. It's the mind's attempt to rewrite history, replaying events with a critical and unforgiving lens.

The antidote to both is to firmly, gently, and repeatedly return to the present moment.

Your Toolkit for Present-Tense Living üß∞

These are not one-time fixes but practices to be used throughout your day, like mental exercises to strengthen your focus muscle.

1. The Anchor of Your Senses ü¶ª Your five senses are the most direct line to the present moment.They can only perceive what is happening right now. When you feel your mind start to spiral into the future or past, drop an anchor.

¬∑ Actionable Step: The 3-2-1 Grounding Technique. Wherever you are, pause and identify:
  ¬∑ 3 things you can hear (the hum of a fan, distant traffic, your own breath).
  ¬∑ 2 things you can feel (your feet flat on the floor, the texture of your shirt).
  ¬∑ 1 thing you can see (notice a specific detail in an object nearby). This simple act forces your brain out of its worried narrative and into sensory reality.

2. Single-Tasking: The Art of Deep Focus üéØ Multitasking is the enemy of presence.It fractures your attention and makes it easy for anxious thoughts to creep in. Single-tasking is the deliberate practice of doing one thing at a time with your full attention.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Choose one routine activity today to make a ""single-task ritual."" It could be drinking your morning coffee, washing dishes, or walking to your car. During this time, do only that. Feel the warmth of the mug. Notice the scents. Feel the water on your hands. When your mind wanders (which it will), gently guide it back to the task. This is a workout for your present-tense mind.

3. The ""Right Now"" Check-In ‚úÖ Anxiety often manifests as a vague,overwhelming feeling. Breaking it down with a simple question can instantly reduce its power.

¬∑ Actionable Step: When you feel anxious, ask yourself: ""Am I okay right now, in this exact moment?"" Not an hour from now, not tomorrow, but right now. Almost always, the answer is ""Yes, I am physically safe and okay."" This doesn't dismiss your concerns, but it contains them to their appropriate time and place, freeing you from their overwhelming grip.

4. Taming the ""What-If"" Monster üê≤ You can't stop""what-if"" thoughts from appearing, but you can stop yourself from following them down a dark hole.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Acknowledge the thought‚Äî""Ah, there's a 'what-if' story."" Then, challenge it with a practical question: ""What is within my control right now about this?"" If the answer is ""nothing,"" consciously let the thought go (visualize it floating away like a cloud). If there is a small action you can take now, do it. This shifts you from passive worrying to active problem-solving.

Weaving Presence into the Fabric of Your Day üßµ

Living in the present isn't about moving to a mountain top. It's about weaving small threads of awareness into your existing life.

¬∑ Tech Boundaries: Designate tech-free zones or times (e.g., no phones during meals, the first 30 minutes after waking up). This prevents the constant pull into other times and places.
¬∑ Breath as an Anchor: Your breath is always with you. Taking three conscious, deep breaths is a mini-reset button you can press anywhere, anytime to return to the now.
¬∑ Reframe Boredom: Instead of reaching for your phone the second you have a spare moment, allow yourself to just be. Look out the window. Notice your surroundings. Boredom is often the doorway to noticing the present.

The Present Moment is Your True Home üè°

Anxiety tells you that safety and peace are found in figuring out the future or fixing the past. The truth is, peace is only ever available in one place: the present moment. It is the only tense in which life is actually happening.

Your invitation is not to eliminate anxiety completely‚Äîthat‚Äôs not the goal. The goal is to build a new habit: when you feel the pull of worry, you recognize it as a signal to return, not to run. You have the tools. Anchor yourself in your senses. Focus on one thing. Ask, ""Am I okay right now?""

The more you practice coming home to the present, the more you will find that it is, and always has been, a place of quiet strength and manageable calm.

And it just made me think about how I (F21) have never felt any comfort in my own mother. As a college student, I see tiktoks all the time about how girls in college miss their moms and they just want their moms. When they‚Äôre failing, when they‚Äôre sick, when they‚Äôre lonely. And I‚Äôve never felt that way. I don‚Äôt know how that feels. Never once in my life have i ever thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in distress, I wish I had my mom.‚Äù The opposite is more true, I‚Äôve only ever thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in distress, my mom can never know or she‚Äôll make it worse.‚Äù And it has to be my fault by process of elimination. I have to be unlovable.

I have no literal recollection of my mother being comforting or truly feeling loved by her. I like to think she did when I was a baby to toddler, but not at any age I can actually remember. All I‚Äôve ever understood about her is that she thinks im ugly, annoying, and hates me. There was never like a ‚Äúoh my mom and I were close and then I hit puberty and she didn‚Äôt like me‚Äù or ‚Äúoh my mom and I were close and then my parents got divorced‚Äù or ‚Äúmy mom liked me and then I came out of the closet and she hated me.‚Äù I just came out the womb and she hated me.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what I say or want to talk about, she hates hearing the sound of my voice. If my dad asks me a question and she‚Äôs around, she tells me to stop talking. When she comes home and walks in the door, she doesn‚Äôt bother saying hi to me, she just runs to my brothers room to start talking to him. If my mom wants to go somewhere, like to get coffee or buy shoes or really anything, she‚Äôll ask my older sister to go and literally roll her eyes and stomp her feet if I ask to come.

If someone says I look like her she genuinly takes offense to it. You cannot say ‚Äúyour daughter looks just like you‚Äù to her, she‚Äôll immediately shoot you down and insist I look exactly like my dad and his family and nothing else. My sister was looking at baby pictures of us and my mom said ‚Äúshe looks exactly like your dad‚Äôs mom there.‚Äù I was a year old in the photo and she‚Äôs never even seen a picture of my dad‚Äôs mother before the age of 50. I objectively looked like my mom the most from ages 1-5. I don‚Äôt look exactly like her in all honesty, but it‚Äôs not like I look NOTHING like her either. My parents aren‚Äôt divorced or separated or anything, they‚Äôve been married 20 years and they like each other fine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm like, THAT ugly? I‚Äôm not beautiful by any means but I‚Äôm not hideous.

And I guess the problem is that she doesn‚Äôt hate my siblings? She only doesn‚Äôt like me? She loves my brother and supports him whenever he‚Äôs in trouble or hurt or anything like that. She‚Äôs openly proud of my sister and all her accomplishments. Like many Mexican mothers of her generation, she did slap me multiple times when she was angry at me. But ONLY me. It wasn‚Äôt even like a ‚Äúoh I recognized I was wrong and didn‚Äôt wanna hit the younger kids‚Äù situation. I‚Äôm the MIDDLE child. She never hit my older sister. Or my younger brother. She only ever slapped me. To the point where my sister vividly remembers me being hit, but never remembers being hit herself. I don‚Äôt remember her being hit either.

I didn‚Äôt notice how badly it affected me until I got to high school. I went to an all girls school so it was popular to have mother daughter events. I would see all the girls with their moms and realize I didn‚Äôt know what it was like. To be hugged and be told I love you so casually and have cute affectionate pet name or nick name. My mom only ever called me my legal name or Gorda growing up (I was actually a scrawny little kid. I didn‚Äôt reach 100lbs until college). She hated touching me. Still avoids it. If we were in a public place she would hold my wrist instead of my hand. Being hugged by my mother feels inappropriate and wrong to me now. Like hugging your boss or something.

She shows her distaste for me like it‚Äôs the most logical thing in the world. She has no qualms about making fun of me or telling me to shut up in front of her adult friends and family, even if they call her out cause it makes them uncomfortable. When other people noticed her being mean to me, it just made her hate me more.

It‚Äôs not even that she hates kids. She‚Äôs an elementary school teacher! Students she had like twenty something years ago make TikToks looking for her because she had such a positive impact on their life. When the pandemic hit and she taught on zoom from our house, I would hear her everyday speaking so sweetly and laughing with those kids who she‚Äôd never even seen in real life. She hugs them so happily. She‚Äôll say ‚Äúmy favorite, MY Johnny‚Äù or ‚Äúmy favorite, MY Mary‚Äù to talk about students he has years ago because she had such a fondness for them. I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúher‚Äù anything.

It‚Äôs not even that she‚Äôs a boy mom. She likes my sister just fine. She just doesn‚Äôt like me. I‚Äôm the problem.

I wasn‚Äôt like a troublesome kid growing up I don‚Äôt think? I never had any intense medical problems, not even a broken bone. Didn‚Äôt get sent to the principals office. Went to an elite private all girls school in full scholarship so she wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the school she wanted me to attend.

I‚Äôve heard a lot of people say that pre-ground coffee starts tasting worse than even decent instant coffee (like Davidoff Espresso 57) after about 2-3 weeks once you open the pack. Is that actually true? And if so, does it mean I‚Äôd basically need to buy a new pack every 2 weeks to avoid drinking stale stuff?

What about whole beans . how long do they usually stay fresh after opening, assuming I grind per cup?

08:55 AM ‚Äì The Attempt
Security placed three layers of checkpoints at the council doors.
John walked through all of them without stopping. One guard swears he saw John tip his hat to the laws of physics as he passed.


---

09:10 AM ‚Äì The Arrival
John entered the hall wearing a cape stitched from shredded inter-agency reports. Steve #001 followed, holding a clipboard and a very smug penguin.
Every delegate went silent.
Every coffee mug trembled.


---

09:15 AM ‚Äì The Chaos Begins

All microphones replaced with kazoos.

All chairs swapped for inflatable flamingos.

All agendas converted into Penguinopolis dance schedules.
The Secretary of Treasury actually cried.



---

10:30 AM ‚Äì The ‚ÄúDiplomatic Solution‚Äù
Two rival nations were mid-argument.
John handed them a giant inflatable flamingo and declared, ‚ÄúJoint custody or eternal penguin shame.‚Äù
They agreed instantly.


---

11:45 AM ‚Äì The Aftermath
The council floor turned into an impromptu parade. Delegates waddled in rhythm. Steve #001 took notes. John threw Flapcoins into the crowd like confetti.

By noon, international relations had mysteriously improved.
By 12:05, the coffee supply was completely gone.

‚Äì42 Flapcoins ‚Äúmisplaced‚Äù by Steve #014. He claims they waddled away.

John: ‚ÄúHighly regular is boring.‚Äù
Delegate: ‚Äú‚Ä¶.‚Äù
John: hands them a penguin in sunglasses



Final Note Left on Podium:

We all have them: those heavy, dull, difficult moments that feel like lead weights in our pockets. They drag us down‚Äîa project that fails, a difficult conversation, a plan that falls apart, a day where nothing goes right. Our instinct is often to discard these moments, to view them as useless mistakes or pure misfortune to be forgotten as quickly as possible.

But what if we could transform them? What if, with a shift in perspective and a few practical tools, we could perform a kind of modern alchemy? Not by magic, but by a conscious process that extracts invaluable lessons, strength, and clarity from the raw, base metal of our struggles. This is the art of turning life's leaden moments into gold.

This isn't about pretending hardship is fun. It's about recognizing that within every challenge lies a potential ingredient for a stronger, wiser, and more capable you. The crucible for this transformation is your mindset, and the heat required is your willingness to engage.

Here is your practical guide to becoming a modern alchemist.

The Alchemist's Toolkit: Essential Equipment üîß

You can't transform materials without the right tools. For inner alchemy, these are mental frameworks.

Tool 1: The Crucible of Reflection üß™ A crucible is a container that can withstand intense heat.Your crucible is a dedicated space for honest, non-judgmental reflection. It‚Äôs where you hold a difficult experience up to the light to examine it, rather than immediately throwing it away.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Create a ""Reflection Ritual."" When something goes wrong, schedule 15 minutes later that day. Sit quietly with a notebook and ask: ""What actually happened? What was my part in it? What can I learn from this?"" The goal is understanding, not self-criticism.

Tool 2: The Heat of Curiosity üî• In traditional alchemy,heat is applied to transform matter. In your practice, curiosity is that heat. It melts away the solid block of ""This is a disaster"" and allows you to ask, ""What are the possibilities here?""

¬∑ Actionable Step: When faced with a leaden moment, consciously ask three curious questions:
  1. ""What is this situation trying to teach me?""
  2. ""How could this unexpected outcome open a door I hadn't seen?""
  3. ""What skill is this forcing me to develop?""

Tool 3: The Filter of Perspective üïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è Alchemy involves separating valuable elements from the dross.You must filter the unhelpful, catastrophic story from the neutral facts and the potential insights.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Separate the story from the event. Write down the pure facts of what happened (e.g., ""I sent the proposal; the client said no.""). Then, next to it, write the story you're telling yourself (e.g., ""I'm bad at my job and will never succeed.""). See the difference. Challenge the story and look for the factual gold nugget hidden within.

The Transformation Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

The philosopher's stone wasn't a single object; it was a process. Here is yours.

Step 1: Acknowledge the Lead üèãÔ∏è You cannot transform what you refuse to acknowledge.Start by naming the difficulty for what it is, without sugarcoating it. ""This is disappointing."" ""This is frustrating."" ""This feels like a failure."" Giving it an honest label is the first step to changing its nature.

Step 2: Apply the Heat of Inquiry ‚ùì Once acknowledged,begin the inquiry. This is where you use your curiosity.

¬∑ Ask: ""What worked, even a little?""
¬∑ Ask: ""What didn't work, and why?""
¬∑ Ask: ""What would I do differently with the knowledge I have now?""
¬∑ Ask: ""What did I learn about my own strengths under pressure?""

Step 3: Identify the Golden Nugget ü•á Within every challenging experience,there is at least one tiny fleck of gold. Your job is to find it. This is never the hardship itself, but what it produced in you.

¬∑ The gold could be a lesson: ""Now I know a better way to structure a proposal.""
¬∑ The gold could be a revealed strength: ""I discovered I can handle rejection without falling apart.""
¬∑ The gold could be a new connection: ""This problem forced me to ask for help, and I deepened a relationship.""
¬∑ The gold could be clarified priorities: ""This failure showed me what I truly value in my work.""

Step 4: Integrate the Gold üî® The final step is to take that golden insight and weave it back into your life.This is what completes the alchemical process. A lesson unapplied is just a nice thought.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Turn your insight into a new rule or a tiny action. For example: ""Gold: I learned I need to double-check data before sending. Integration: I will now add a 15-minute review step to my process for all important documents.""

The Goal is Not a Life Without Lead

The goal of this practice is not to create a perfect, shiny life free of heavy moments. That is impossible. The goal is to build your skills as an alchemist so that when leaden moments inevitably arrive‚Äîas they do for everyone‚Äîyou see them not as curses, but as raw material. You have the tools and the process to begin the work of transformation.

Your invitation is to take your most recent ""leaden"" moment‚Äîmaybe from just today or last week‚Äîand run it through this process. Acknowledge it, get curious about it, and see if you can find just one small, gleaming fleck of gold within it.

This practice turns you from a victim of circumstance into an active participant in your own growth. It‚Äôs the ultimate form of empowerment: the ability to create value from anything life throws your way.

""You have at least read the manual, haven't you?""

  
Two years following the original release and an uncounted amount of time in the making, the Insectarium Official Fanbook now has a fan translation available for download! 

Translated where necessary by yours truly, with proofreading and quality assurance checks completed by fans both here on the Subreddit and on Discord, this translation seeks to close the gap for fans interested in the world of Insectarium by importing content that had previously been restricted to the Japanese language, while also seeking to up Caramel Column Inc.'s monthly earnings by encouraging sales of the product. 

https://preview.redd.it/ijauy35liplf1.jpg?width=719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe6992aa60e8bf7b28b696ba2164667258e43c47

Created with input from the Japanese fans, the book is a near-comprehensive encyclopedia, detailing not only information that would have been found through completing the game, but also plenty of bonuses as well. Behind the scenes concept art, in-development images, and scrapped concepts are included, of course, but more importantly are juicy details about all of the Insectarium's workers. The book contains profiles on all of the characters present in the game, including never-before-seen full-body renders of every employee, and plenty of trivia to really flesh out these characters.

https://preview.redd.it/wbxc3mm1jplf1.jpg?width=719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=898e674e025b785c8b09531abed5f2bdfbc4b877

The urbanites aren't forgotten, either. All of the game's urbanites are cataloged in this book, with a glossary of terms and past events that can help the most dedicated of fans in piecing together the timeline and underlying story of the world of Insectarium. For fans, this is not something to be missed!

HOW TO OBTAIN

This unofficial translation will be distributed through an online download link, which would be distributed upon my reception of a screenshot from the reader, denoting that they have purchased a copy of the book. Screenshots can be sent via Reddit Chat.

A PDF copy can be purchased on BOOTH

[https://gamescaramel.booth.pm/items/4869438](https://gamescaramel.booth.pm/items/4869438)

Upon submission of a purchase confirmation, a download link to the PDF of the book will be provided in the same chat space, hosted on Google Drive.

The locking of this translation behind a pay wall is a decision came from many factors. Sketchy legality issues in performing image-heavy unofficial translations like these aside, the decision also comes down to a verbal agreement I offered to Caramel Column during my visit to their offices. The intent is to minimize any all possible copyright infringement while using this free fan effort to boost their sales and make the English-speaking fandom's voices more audible. 

With any luck, this fan translation will be rendered obsolete by the creation of a fully official translation in the future. Should that day not come, however, then at least this piece will be a way for fans to know the information that previously Japan had exclusive access to. 

TRANSLATION NOTES

The translation for this book was done based on the English-localized version of Insectarium, originally written as ""Mushikago"" in English for the Japanese release. As such, this translation follows the localization performed by the translators for the game, mostly in terms of name changes when applicable. 

As stated prior, this translation was done without the involvement of Caramel Column Inc. and should not be considered an official publication in any way. The document exists as a reading aid/referential guide in assisting readers with reading the original Japanese document. 

Thank you for your time, and I hope to see you join me on this journey.

""Now, go on and take your station.""

I wanted to share information about the range of resources and groups that exist here, since I don‚Äôt think everybody knows about them. Hopefully some of you find it helpful!

GENERAL RESOURCES

The [Safer Community Program](https://safercommunity.unimelb.edu.au/support-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-community) offers specialist support for trans and gender diverse people (both staff and students). This **includes an advisor that anybody can contact confidentially**, whatever stage you are in -- from questioning and/or completely closeted (and needing someone to help you figure out what to do next) on up to fully transitioned and out (and needing someone to help navigate university systems or specific situations). Scroll down to the bottom of the link above to find all the details.

This [administrative guide](https://safercommunity.unimelb.edu.au/support-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-community/information-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-staff-and-students) has a bunch of information about how to do things like change your personal details, access services, what to do if there are problems, what university policies there are (including the official [gender affirmation policy](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1364/) and [LGBTIQA action plan](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/diversity-inclusion/lgbtiqa-inclusion)), etc.

[CAPS and the university counselling](https://services.unimelb.edu.au/counsel/making-an-appointment/lgbtiqa) offers LGBTIQA-specific support services. There is a group program and links to other support services (including queer-friendly GPs, family supports, and supports specific to people of colour, intersex, asexual, bisexual, etc).

COMMUNITY

The [Pride in Action network](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/diversity-inclusion/pride-in-action-ally-network) is a group of staff and students whose role is to build and support the university‚Äôs LGBTIQA+ community. They have a monthly newsletter that anybody can sign up to at the link above, which has information about upcoming events all all types ‚Äî coffee catch-ups, board game nights, symposia, parties, etc. For instance, tomorrow (Friday) afternoon there is a [free screening of the 2014 movie Pride](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/diversity-inclusion/pride-in-action-ally-network/wear-it-purple-2025) which any university-affiliated people are invited to attend - a great way not just to unwind after a long week but also meet other queer people!

The [UMSU queer department](https://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/communities/queer/) organises social events (like fortnightly G&Ts with LGBTs event in Ida Bar in Building 168), hosting collectives for different identities and experiences, and advocating on behalf of the queer community at the university. They have the Queer Space (Level 3 of Building 168, Student Precinct) where all students are encouraged to come hang out, relax, or even take a nap. It's full of free resources like tea, coffee, snacks, menstrual products, and more! Primarily geared toward undergraduates but open to all.

There are a bunch of smaller groups in specific schools and faculties (many of which I don't know about! -- if you run one or know of one please reach out to me or the Pride in Action Network so we can spread the word). I'm also always willing to hear from people more generally if they have issues or ideas.

1n25dsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n25dsn/cultivating_resilience_the_bedrock_of_a_sturdy/,Cultivating Resilience: The Bedrock of a Sturdy Life üõ°Ô∏èüå≥,"

Imagine two structures facing a powerful storm. One is rigid and brittle, shattering under the force of the wind. The other is flexible, rooted deeply, and designed to bend‚Äîit sways and strains but remains standing when the storm passes. Resilience is not the absence of storms in our lives; it is the flexible, sturdy architecture that allows us to withstand them and continue growing.

This isn't about being emotionally invincible or never feeling pain. It's about developing the practical, learnable skill of navigation and recovery. Resilience is the bedrock upon which a sturdy, adaptable life is built. It‚Äôs the quality that allows you to face a challenge, learn from it, and keep moving forward, stronger and wiser for the experience. It's the difference between being broken by change and being shaped by it.

Here‚Äôs how to actively cultivate this essential skill, turning yourself into a flexible, durable structure capable of handling any weather.

The Pillars of Resilience: Your Inner Support System üèõÔ∏è

Resilience isn't a single trait but a structure supported by several key pillars. You can actively strengthen each one.

Pillar 1: Emotional Regulation üßò‚ôÄÔ∏è This is the ability to manage your emotional responses,not suppress them. It‚Äôs about feeling the frustration, fear, or disappointment without letting those feelings dictate your actions.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Name to Tame. When you feel a strong negative emotion rising, pause and silently label it. Say to yourself, ""This is anxiety,"" or ""This is anger."" This simple act creates a small space between the feeling and your reaction, allowing you to choose your response rather than being hijacked by it.

Pillar 2: Realistic Optimism ‚òÄÔ∏è This is not about pretending everything is fine.It‚Äôs about honestly assessing a bad situation while maintaining a belief that you can handle it and that the future can be better. It‚Äôs the balance between ""This is really hard"" and ""I can find a way through this.""

¬∑ Actionable Step: Practice ""But"" and ""And."" Challenge catastrophic thoughts. ""This project failed, but I learned what doesn't work."" Or, ""I feel overwhelmed by this task, and I have solved difficult problems before."" This language acknowledges reality while opening the door to possibility.

Pillar 3: Problem-Solving & Agency üõ†Ô∏è Resilient people focus on what they can control.Instead of dwelling on the problem, they shift their energy to actionable solutions. This sense of ""agency""‚Äîthe belief that your actions matter‚Äîis critical.

¬∑ Actionable Step: The Control Box. Draw a small box on a piece of paper. Inside it, list all the factors of a challenging situation that you can actually control (your effort, your attitude, asking for help). Outside the box, list the things you can't control (other people's actions, past events, the weather). Dedicate your energy solely to the items inside the box.

The Daily Work: Building Resilience Brick by Brick üß±

Like any skill, resilience is built through consistent, small practices, not grand gestures.

1. Build a Shock-Absorbent Routine üìÖ Predictable routines and habits act as shock absorbers for when life gets chaotic. They create pockets of stability and automaticity, preserving your mental energy for dealing with the unexpected. A simple morning or evening routine can be an anchor in a turbulent day.
2. Strengthen Your Connection Corps ü§ù Resilience is rarely built alone. Strong, supportive relationships are your reinforcement beams. They provide practical help, emotional comfort, and different perspectives.
   ¬∑ Actionable Step: Proactively nurture your relationships. Send a check-in text to a friend. Be willing to be vulnerable and ask for support when you need it. Offer your support to others‚Äîhelping someone else is a powerful way to build your own sense of strength.
3. Reframe the Narrative üìñ How you tell yourself the story of a setback has a huge impact on your resilience. Avoid casting yourself as the victim of a tragic tale. Instead, frame yourself as the protagonist who faces challenges and learns and adapts.
   ¬∑ Actionable Step: After a difficulty, write down the story of what happened. Then, rewrite it from the perspective of a neutral, compassionate observer. Highlight your strengths, the choices you had, and the lessons learned. This practice builds a resilient self-identity.
4. Prioritize Your Foundation: Health üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Your physical health is the literal foundation of your mental and emotional resilience. You cannot navigate stress effectively if you are exhausted, malnourished, and sedentary.
   ¬∑ Actionable Step: Protect your sleep, move your body daily (even for a short walk), and fuel yourself with nutritious food. View these not as luxuries, but as non-negotiable maintenance for your most important tool: you.

The Goal is Not to Avoid the Storm üåßÔ∏è

The goal of cultivating resilience is not to create a life without challenges. That is an impossible and fragile aim. The goal is to build a life that is sturdy and flexible enough to handle challenges without breaking‚Äîto be the tree that bends in the hurricane rather than the rigid signpost that snaps.

Your invitation is to start with one pillar. Pick one actionable step from above and practice it this week. When a small challenge arises, use it as a training ground. With each practiced response, you are pouring a stronger foundation and building a more resilient life, one that can not only withstand the storms but eventually find strength in them.

Imagine for a moment that your life is not a predetermined path, but a vast, beautiful map‚Äîone that is still mostly blank. The borders are drawn, representing your core circumstances, but the interior is a thrilling expanse of uncharted territory. This map is yours to explore, and its potential is limited only by your courage to venture into the unknown. We often look for pre-written directions or follow someone else‚Äôs route, but the most fulfilling journey is the one you design yourself.

This isn‚Äôt about finding a hidden destiny. It‚Äôs about creation, not discovery. It‚Äôs about using your values, curiosities, and actions as tools to chart a course into possibility. The blank spaces aren‚Äôt voids to be feared; they are opportunities to be shaped. Your potential isn't a fixed point you must reach; it's the ever-expanding landscape you create with every choice you make.

Here‚Äôs how to become the cartographer of your own life and start filling in those blank spaces.

Your Cartography Tools: What You Need to Begin üß≠

Every explorer needs reliable tools. For mapping your potential, these aren't physical objects, but mental frameworks and practices.

Tool 1: The Compass of Curiosity üß≠ Your internal compass doesn‚Äôt point north;it points toward ""what if?"" and ""I wonder."" Curiosity is the engine of exploration. It pulls you toward new experiences, ideas, and skills.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Once a week, follow a ""random thread of curiosity."" See a documentary about deep-sea exploration? Read an article about it. Hear a friend mention a fascinating book? Download the sample. Let one small question lead you to a place you wouldn't have otherwise gone.

Tool 2: The Pencil of Self-Belief ‚úèÔ∏è You must believe you are capable of drawing new lines on your map.This isn‚Äôt about arrogant certainty; it‚Äôs about the quiet confidence that you can learn, adapt, and figure things out as you go. It‚Äôs believing that misdrawn lines can be erased and redrawn‚Äîthey‚Äôre just part of the process.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Challenge one ""I can't"" statement this week. Change it to ""I can't do that... yet, but I can learn."" This small linguistic shift opens the door to potential instead of closing it.

Tool 3: The Legend of Values üóùÔ∏è Every map has a legend that explains its symbols.Your personal legend is defined by your values‚Äîwhat truly matters to you (e.g., connection, creativity, security, impact). These values help you decide which paths are worth taking and which territories are worth exploring.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Define your core values. Ask yourself: ""What principles do I want to guide my decisions?"" When faced with a choice, consult your legend. ""Does this option align with my value of creativity or growth?"" This ensures your map is authentically yours.

Navigating the Blank Spaces: How to Chart Your Course

The blank spaces on your map represent your untapped potential‚Äîthe skills you haven‚Äôt learned, the connections you haven‚Äôt made, the experiences you haven‚Äôt had. Here‚Äôs how to start charting them.

1. Acknowledge the Known, Then Look Beyond üëÄ Start from where you are.acknowledge your current ""known territories""‚Äîyour skills, routines, and comfort zone. Respect them; they are your base camp. Then, consciously look just beyond the edge. What‚Äôs one small step into the unknown you can take this month? Maybe it‚Äôs a class, a conversation with someone different from you, or visiting a new part of your city.

2. Redefine ""Wrong Turns"" as ""New Data"" üîÑ In uncharted territory,there are no wrong turns, only discoveries. A path that seems to lead nowhere still tells you something: ""This route is rocky,"" or ""This doesn't align with my values."" This is invaluable data for refining your map. The goal isn't to avoid ""mistakes""; it's to continuously gather information about your landscape and yourself.

3. Draft in Pencil, Not Ink üìù Your first draft of a new goal or plan should always be in pencil.Be flexible. The terrain might change, or you might learn something new that makes you want to adjust your course. Holding your plans lightly allows you to adapt and incorporate new learning, making your map more detailed and accurate over time.

4. Look for Landmarks, Not Just Destinations üèîÔ∏è We often focus on big,distant destinations (the ""perfect job,"" ""financial freedom""). While these can be guiding stars, it's the landmarks along the way that make the journey meaningful. Landmarks are achievements, moments of joy, lessons learned, and connections made.

¬∑ Actionable Step: Celebrate landmarks. Finished a challenging project? Landmark. Had a deeply meaningful conversation? Landmark. Learned to cook a new recipe? Landmark. Acknowledging these moments makes the exploration itself rewarding.

The Adventure is Yours Alone üåÑ

Your map is unique. It cannot be compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Someone else‚Äôs map might have more mountains, while yours has more rivers. Theirs is not better; it‚Äôs just different. The only waste of potential is to leave your map blank out of fear of drawing the wrong line.

Your invitation is to pick up your tools and make a mark. Today. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a grand gesture. Draw one small, new path.

What is one tiny ""unknown"" you can explore this week? Let that be your starting point. The map of your potential is waiting. It‚Äôs the most important project you will ever work on, and the adventure lasts a lifetime.

I (24F) moved back in with my parents at the end of last year from a big city because everything went a bit wrong all at once. I lost my job, my toxic relationship fell apart, my roommate was becoming difficult to deal with and I was completely broke lol. My parents really kindly took me in and I‚Äôm loving being back home in my nice house with my nice room. They also have waived rent which has meant I can save save save and hopefully maybe actually one day get on the property ladder, so I‚Äôm extremely grateful. 

2025 has been a real year of rebuilding. I have gone an successful weight loss journey, found a job I really love that is what I trained in at college and have been able to reconnect with friends that my ex isolated me from, I‚Äôve even been able to be a more active and involved aunt to my friends‚Äô babies.

I generally get on really well with my parents, we watch shows together and have lots of things in common (obvs because I‚Äôm half of both of them) but there‚Äôs just one point of contention between me and my mom (53F) which is causing arguments. 

I cannot stress how generally good I get on with my parents, they are my guys, but if I argue with my mom it‚Äôs such a rough time because she‚Äôll cry which makes me cry or I‚Äôll very carefully put forward my reasonable argument in a measured way and she‚Äôll make a snippy little comment under her breath which is massively incendiary and causes me to snap. She‚Äôs had a really rough time with work and we‚Äôve been talking a lot about how she‚Äôs struggling with the hormones that come with being a ‚Äòwoman of a certain age‚Äô if you catch my drift. She has been kind of checked out because she is so stressed and often just looks at her phone and doesn‚Äôt really engage in the way she used to. I‚Äôve been trying to help by keeping the house tidy and try and book us relaxing experiences like a spa for her birthday, but I heard her get very upset to my dad about feeling like she‚Äôs not pulling her weight which literally broke my heart. I sat her down and suggested getting therapy, because it‚Äôs really helped me in the past and she‚Äôs a yapper like me, but she says she‚Äôs too busy and it ended in a really emotional argument, but I just want my mom back. Shes been dealing with her ailing mom who is so nasty to her and who constantly lies so she just has a lot going on. 

Anyway sorry for the massive amount of probably unnecessary context. 

Our current point of contention is my seemingly tragic love life. My mom really wants me to date one of my male best friends (27M) and while he gets on really well with my family and we have such a laugh together, we are just friends. I may have once had feelings for him like 5 years ago, but it is very clear that he has no romantic feelings for me whatsoever, that was a tough time because I felt a little used but I‚Äôve worked through it and we‚Äôre all good now and I‚Äôm much better at putting boundaries in with him. My mom is like me in that she LOVES LOVE, so of course she locks in to any time I mention a male friend or colleague or even acquaintance, but we don‚Äôt really talk about anything else, which is sad because we‚Äôre both interesting women with rich inner lives. Every day she‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou need to speak to [male friend]‚Äù or ‚Äúhas [male friend] been in contact?‚Äù Or ‚Äúany boys message today?‚Äù. Sometimes when I upload an Instagram picture she‚Äôll look through my likes and ask me who all the boys are. 

Both my parents come from traditional religious backgrounds, they‚Äôve only ever been with eachother and got married when they were younger than me, and growing up in that environment means I know so many people who are married and I am always going to weddings. Even my non-religious friends are moving in with their partners and having babies and I‚Äôm like we are so young I don‚Äôt understand the rush. My younger sister (21F) who is my best friend has a serious boyfriend and she‚Äôs far away at college so I guess I‚Äôm the desperately single project at home who needs help. My parents have changed their opinions on a lot of things and they are far more liberal than I think I give them credit for. My lgbt friends see them as a source of support and they have changed their opinions on sharing a bed with a partner who you‚Äôre not married to and whatever. 

However, both my parents have a real issue with dating apps, I know it comes from a safety and protection standpoint, but I don‚Äôt really go many places where I‚Äôll meet someone organically, like a knitting group with my younger cousins or to a coffee shop with my friend and her baby. When I‚Äôve mentioned having dating app dates in the past, my mom has freaked out and my dad has been nervous about it. My mom keeps trying to get me to go to church or the gym or something saying I‚Äôll meet people, but I don‚Äôt want to meet people there. 

This brings me to now, I have been going on secret dates with a man (26M) from a dating app. Guys, he is so cute!!! We get on so well together, he books us nice dates and calls me pretty. He is so switched on to social justice which is so important to me, we have really deep talks and we make eachother laugh, plus he owns his own place and drives a nice car and has a good job and oodles of ambition. I am really excited about where it‚Äôs going, but it‚Äôs also nice to feel like a grown up going on grown up dates, even if it doesn‚Äôt work out. 

I have been telling my mom that I‚Äôve been hanging out with my friends when we go on dates, I tell her the location so if she checks find my phone I am there, but I say a friends name instead of his, both my parents know nothing about him. The problem is I am running out of friends to use as excuses and I have a good feeling about this guy, and I‚Äôm excited and want share that with them. 

The irony is: my mom would be really pleased for me, but I just wanted to have this one thing that‚Äôs mine and she‚Äôd be devastated knowing I kept it from her. 

The longer I keep the lies up, the worse the fallout is going to be because my mom HATES lying because my grandmother is a compulsive liar. But equally I know the second I say anything there will be a big argument and she will get super involved and there‚Äôs something quite hot about a secret rendezvous üòâüòâ

My sister agreed that it‚Äôs best to keep it a secret for now because she knows what my mom is like, but she thinks this guy is great for me and she‚Äôs really excited and she‚Äôs helping to lie for me. 

Sorry this was so long, but I guess I want to know AITAH for lying to my mom about who I‚Äôm meeting and WIBTAH if I carried on lying to my mom and dad or is it best to just rip the bandaid off?

1n257w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n257w8/embracing_the_seasons_of_life_growth_through/,Embracing the Seasons of Life: Growth Through Change üçÇüå±,"

We often talk about life as a journey, but perhaps a more accurate metaphor is that of a year, constantly cycling through distinct and inevitable seasons. Just as nature doesn't cling to a single eternal summer, our lives are not meant to be static. They ebb and flow through periods of vibrant growth, quiet introspection, challenging decline, and hopeful renewal. The frustration and anxiety we often feel don't come from change itself, but from resisting it‚Äîfrom wishing for endless sunshine while denying the purpose of the rain.

Learning to embrace these seasons, rather than fight them, is one of the most practical skills we can cultivate. It‚Äôs about understanding that each phase, whether comfortable or challenging, has a specific role to play in our long-term growth. This isn't a spiritual surrender; it's a strategic alignment with the natural rhythm of existence. By recognizing what season we are in, we can learn what to plant, when to harvest, and when to simply let the ground rest.

Here‚Äôs how to identify your current season and work with its energy, not against it.

Mapping the Seasons: Identify Where You Are üó∫Ô∏è

First, let's define the seasons in practical, observable terms. You might be in different seasons for different parts of your life (e.g., Spring in your career, Winter in a personal relationship).

üåº Spring: The Season of New Beginnings This is a time of planting seeds,of high energy and new ideas. It‚Äôs characterized by curiosity, opportunity, and a sense of potential.

¬∑ Signs You're in a Spring Season: You feel motivated to start new projects. You're saying ""yes"" more often. You're meeting new people and learning new things. There's a palpable sense of optimism.
¬∑ Your Actionable Guide: Plant! This is not the time to hesitate. Channel that energy into action. Take the course, apply for the job, schedule the first meeting. Your key task is to initiate. However, be mindful not to plant too many seeds at once; focus your energy on a few strong saplings with the most potential.

‚òÄÔ∏è Summer: The Season of Growth and Maintenance The initial excitement of spring settles into the steady work of growth.This phase is about nurturing what you've started, protecting it, and putting in the consistent effort required for it to thrive.

¬∑ Signs You're in a Summer Season: Your projects are underway and require daily attention. You're building routines and systems. You might face ""weeds"" like distractions or competition. The work is hot and demanding but also deeply satisfying.
¬∑ Your Actionable Guide: Nurture & Protect! Focus on consistency. Establish routines that support your goals. Protect your time and energy from distractions. Water your plants diligently‚Äîshow up even when you don't feel like it. This is the season for hard work and celebrating small, incremental progress.

üçÅ Autumn: The Season of Harvest and Release The energy begins to change.This is a time of reaping what you have sown, evaluating what has grown, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîletting go of what didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a season of gratitude and release.

¬∑ Signs You're in an Autumn Season: Projects are concluding. You're seeing the results of your summer labor. You feel a need to declutter and simplify. You might outgrow old habits, relationships, or ideas that no longer serve you.
¬∑ Your Actionable Guide: Harvest & Release! Take stock. What worked? What are you proud of? Celebrate your harvest. Then, be brutally practical: what didn‚Äôt work? What is weighing you down? This is the season to gratefully let it go. Release guilt over failed projects; they were lessons, not life sentences. Simplify your commitments.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter: The Season of Rest and Reflection This is the most misunderstood season.Winter is not a void or a failure; it is a necessary period of rest and internal preparation. Growth happens underground, unseen.

¬∑ Signs You're in a Winter Season: You feel lower energy. You crave quiet and solitude. Big, new actions feel overwhelming or forced. You might be processing a loss, a setback, or simply integrating the lessons of the past year.
¬∑ Your Actionable Guide: Rest & Reflect! Do not fight the urge to slow down. This is not laziness; it is incubation. Your task is to be still. Reflect on the past cycle. What did you learn about yourself? What would you do differently? Dream and plan for the next spring, but don't force it to come early. Trust that this quiet time is essential for your next burst of growth.

How to Work With Your Season, Not Against It üîß

1. Diagnose Before You Act: When you feel stuck or out of sync, pause and ask: ""What season does this feel like?"" Don't try to build a snowman in the summer or plant a garden in the winter. Align your actions with the season's energy.
2. There Are No Bad Seasons: A winter of rest is just as valuable as a summer of growth. Judging a season as ""bad"" creates resistance. Instead, ask: ""What is the unique opportunity of this phase?"" Winter offers depth and reflection, while autumn offers clarity and release.
3. Seasons Are Temporary: This is the most comforting truth. No season lasts forever. If you're in a challenging winter, know that spring will inevitably come. This knowledge makes difficult times more bearable and good times more precious.
4. Your Toolbox for All Seasons: Some practices are always in season.
   ¬∑ Self-Compassion: Talk to yourself like a wise friend who understands cycles. ""It makes sense you're tired; you've been in a long summer of hard work. Rest is okay.""
   ¬∑ Observation: Regularly check in with yourself without judgment. Just note your energy levels and desires as neutral data.
   ¬∑ Patience: Trust the process. You cannot rush the harvest.

Your Invitation to Flow üåä

The goal is not to control the seasons, but to learn their rhythms and dance with them. By embracing the season you are in, you reduce resistance and find a more graceful, effective way to move through life.

Look inward today. Not with judgment, but with the curious eye of a gardener assessing their land. What season are you in? Honor it. Do the work it asks of you. Trust that the next season will arrive right on time, bringing exactly what you need to continue growing.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

My younger sister (21F) who is my best friend has a serious boyfriend and she‚Äôs far away at college so I guess I‚Äôm the desperately single project at home who needs help. My parents have changed their opinions on a lot of things and they are far more liberal than I think I give them credit for. My lgbt friends see them as a source of support and they have changed their opinions on sharing a bed with a partner who you‚Äôre not married to and whatever. 

However, both my parents have a real issue with dating apps, I know it comes from a safety and protection standpoint, but I don‚Äôt really go many places where I‚Äôll meet someone organically, like a knitting group with my younger cousins or to a coffee shop with my friend and her baby. When I‚Äôve mentioned having dating app dates in the past, my mom has freaked out and my dad has been nervous about it. My mom keeps trying to get me to go to church or the gym or something saying I‚Äôll meet people, but I don‚Äôt want to meet people there. 

This brings me to now, I have been going on secret dates with a man (26M) from a dating app. Guys, he is so cute!!! We get on so well together, he books us nice dates and calls me pretty. He is so switched on to social justice which is so important to me, we have really deep talks and we make eachother laugh, plus he owns his own place and drives a nice car and has a good job and oodles of ambition. I am really excited about where it‚Äôs going, but it‚Äôs also nice to feel like a grown up going on grown up dates, even if it doesn‚Äôt work out. 

I have been telling my mom that I‚Äôve been hanging out with my friends when we go on dates, I tell her the location so if she checks find my phone I am there, but I say a friends name instead of his, both my parents know nothing about him. The problem is I am running out of friends to use as excuses and I have a good feeling about this guy, and I‚Äôm excited and want share that with them. 

The irony is: my mom would be really pleased for me, but I just wanted to have this one thing that‚Äôs mine and she‚Äôd be devastated knowing I kept it from her. 

The longer I keep the lies up, the worse the fallout is going to be because my mom HATES lying because my grandmother is a compulsive liar. But equally I know the second I say anything there will be a big argument and she will get super involved and there‚Äôs something quite hot about a secret rendezvous üòâüòâ

My sister agreed that it‚Äôs best to keep it a secret for now because she knows what my mom is like, but she thinks this guy is great for me and she‚Äôs really excited and she‚Äôs helping to lie for me. 

Sorry this was so long, but I guess I want to know AITAH for lying to my mom about who I‚Äôm meeting and WIBTAH if I carried on lying to my mom and dad or is it best to just rip the bandaid off?

1n255gh,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7vl097jd8eo,Jacqueline Wilson calls Picture Imperfect 'the easiest and hardest book I've ever written',"**Jacqueline Wilson has been writing for more than five decades and has published hundreds of books. She describes her new novel Picture Imperfect - her adult sequel to the The Illustrated Mum - as ""the easiest and the hardest thing"" she's ever written.**

Published in 1999, The Illustrated Mum tells the story of two sisters - Dolphin and Star - who struggle to cope with their unstable and heavily tattooed mother Marigold, whose bipolar disorder threatens to pull their family apart.¬†

The sequel focuses on Dolphin, 33, still looking after her mum and feeling dejected with life living in a bedsit and working at a tattoo parlour.¬†

""It was easy because I loved that book,"" Wilson tells me over a cup of coffee in a room at the Penguin Random House office, piled high with her books.

""But it was hard because people carry their own ideas of what might have happened to those characters.¬†

""Some wanted Marigold to have recovered, or Dolphin to have a wonderful career, or Star to be the perfect big sister but real life doesn't always work that way and I've always wanted my books to be true to life.""

Truth, even when uncomfortable, has always been Wilson's trademark. From Tracy Beaker to Dustbin Baby to The Illustrated Mum, she has written about messy families, mental illness, poverty and the resilience of children navigating it all.

  
The much-loved author, who was made a dame in 2008, admits she has long felt a particular affection for The Illustrated Mum and it ""is one of my favourite books"".

""It's upsetting in some ways, but I had so many letters from children saying, 'that's just like my mum or my dad',"" she says.

""Recently at a concert, a woman hugged me and said 'thank you for helping me deal with my mum' and it almost made me cry. To think a book could matter like that all these years later, that's why I wanted to revisit them.""

The three women's lives have unfolded in ways both expected and painfully believable - Marigold is still not managing to take her medication or settle into stability. Star has qualified as a doctor and lives in Edinburgh, detached from Marigold's mental health problems.

And then there is Dolphin, who Wilson sympathises with most as ""she's always the go-to person, the one holding things together when Marigold gets into bizarre scrapes"".

""She's caring but resentful, struggling with relationships and not fulfilled,"" she explains. ""In this book, I wanted to give her choices in love and in work so she could figure out what she really wants.""

  
When The Illustrated Mum was first published, Wilson was warned that a particular scene - where Marigold covers herself in toxic white paint to hide her tattoos - might be ""too stark"" for children.

""I was told it was scary, maybe too much,"" Wilson recalls. ""But I thought, no, that moment was what would push Dolphin to finally get help. It had to be there and luckily, I got my way.""

Wilson insists she has no regrets about the tougher themes in her books, despite occasional criticism that she was going too far.¬†

What makes her laugh, though, is remembering a complaint from a furious mum who accused her of ruining her daughter's childhood because one of her books implied that 11-year-olds no longer believe in Father Christmas.¬†

""You can't please everyone,"" Wilson chuckles.

Yet, for all her boundary-pushing, she is clear about where she draws the line.¬†

She acknowledges young people now are exposed to far more than readers were in the 1990s or 2000s, with conversations about misogyny, online abuse and even incel culture filtering down into classrooms.

But she says those darker realities belong in her adult fiction rather than her children's books.

""If I were to put something as troubling as the whole incel thing into a children's book, it would only ever be implied,"" she explains. ""With adult books, you can more or less write what you want. With children, you have to balance being honest without overwhelming them.""

  
Wilson's commitment to honesty - sometimes shocking, but never gratuitous - remains intact in Picture Imperfect.

""It's not a self-help book,"" she says. ""I'm not saying if you're Dolphin, this is what you should do, but I wanted to show the reality of being the child of a parent with mental illness.

""Often one sibling ends up carrying the burden - sometimes you feel it's your duty, sometimes you feel bitterly resentful. There are no easy answers.""

The author knows a thing or two about life's imperfections herself. Having married young, she speaks frankly about the mismatch with her ex-husband and the lonely years that followed.

""I remember a day when my marriage had just broken up, my boiler nearly caught fire, I had no food in the fridge and I was up at dawn to do four school visits. A teacher said to me that she envied my glamorous life and I thought: 'If only you knew'.""

For the past 23 years, the 79-year-old has been happily partnered with a woman, and¬†[last year she told me she was ""delighted"" to be viewed as a gay icon.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxlqdpx0pyo)

One of the most touching themes in Picture Imperfect is Dolphin's attempt to understand love. Wilson says she used to be cynical about what love felt like, but that changed when she met her now partner.

""I thought the overwhelming feeling of love was a myth but when I was first dating my partner I really did get butterflies and it was just astonishing.

  
Given that tattoos are central to both Marigold's flamboyant character and Dolphin's chosen career, I ask Wilson if she would ever get inked herself?¬†

She chuckles. ""I thought maybe a tiny dolphin would be a nice way of advertising the book but my skin's too fragile so maybe I'll just get a henna one.""

Last year, Wilson released her first adult novel, Think Again, a sequel to the Girls series. It became the bestselling adult debut hardback of 2024.

She tells me she relishes the freedom of adult fiction. ""In children's books, you can't go too far - you don't want to frighten or bore kids with adult details. With adult books, you can put in whatever feels true so it's like getting two bites of the cherry and I feel very lucky.""

So will more beloved characters reappear in her adult novels? Wilson is coy, but hints she is already 30,000 words into another sequel.¬†

I spend the next ten minutes guessing which character will be the protagonist of the new novel but Wilson only laughs along, giving nothing away.¬†

She appeases me by telling me I will be the first person to know when it's finished.",7,1756363715.0,JacquelineWilson,0,0.9,False
1n25552,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1n25552/online_dating_in_2025_over_it_a_rant/,Online Dating in 2025... OVER IT (a rant),"**TLDR:** I'm done with online dating forever.

**Background:** 38 Female, no children & never married. Homeowner, solid career in tech, and a dog mom. Always looking for friends, traveling companions, or possibly a relationship.

**Disclaimer:** I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôm a woman on the spectrum, extremely high masking, and I have a unique communication style. Unfortunately, I can share too much initially, be overly trusting, blunt, honest, and vulnerable. I seem to think that by getting all of my potential deal-breakers and TMI out of the way first, that's less time wasted for us both... but this may be biting me in the butt. These are things I am always, and will always be, working to manage. And yes, I am a longtime lover of therapy.

I have been using dating apps for 15 years now, and I‚Äôm ready to hang them up for good. Although most of my long-term relationships have formed from them (which are stories of their own), as well as a handful of lasting friendships, the landscape has changed. In the past, I‚Äôve been able to overlook the bad, because there has been enough good to outweigh it... but this past summer has broken me.

Where to start‚Ä¶ Maybe the initial messages, all in acronyms? ‚ÄúHRU‚Äù or ‚ÄúSUP‚Äù or insert random emoji here. Or all of the main profile pictures of oversized iridescent/oil slink lenses, often hovering over a fish‚Ä¶ usually some kind of bass.

I had a good chuckle to myself recently while crabbing in an early morning tide with some guy friends. One of them commented on how all of the women on the apps are ‚Äúduck-faced‚Äù or using filters. I quickly recounted all of the profiles I‚Äôve swiped left on that were shirtless out of context or contained these dark, edgy stares into the camera at all angles without so much as a smirk in sight.

I have, unknowingly of course, dated many types of men at this point: married men, engaged men, men in long-term relationships, men with children after stating that they didn‚Äôt have children, and straight-up catfish. And all of this is aside from the countless times I‚Äôve been ghosted, which unfortunately comes with the territory of dating these days‚Ä¶ even though I find that behavior to be a clear sign of emotional immaturity in most cases (sometimes justified though).

The initial blow of 2025 came in April. I had been texting a man for about a month, and we were hitting it off. We had much in common and eventually set a date to meet. Once the date was set, he started showing an unusual interest in my assets and future endeavors in a way that raised an orange flag. I figured it was time for a quick call to ‚Äúcatch his vibe‚Äù. And folks, as someone who is experienced in tech, he was using a voice changer.

I thought I would step up my game, so I required a video call with the next guy. He was able to wriggle out of our set time two or three times, and the flags came up. Eventually, he conceded. He had a very thick accent and was here on a work visa. Nothing wrong with either of those things of course, except that it proved his entire backstory leading up to that point to be false. Through forced tears, he tried to tell me that he just wanted me to give him a chance‚Ä¶ luckily, I‚Äôm not that stupid.

The following ‚Äúmatch‚Äù ended up being a new father, with a literal newborn at home. And I randomly got a text in the middle of the night, ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù after an embarrassing exchange of nudes.

Then enter the man who was in a relationship with a woman for three years who had recently been disabled.

Then enter the fianc√© who was supposed to be married in November of this year.

And I get it, the common denominator is me. If you were to line up all of my exes in a row, they would all look completely different. Short, tall, fat, thin, harry, bald, all sizes and colors. And this is still happening, so I need to examine more closely what‚Äôs going on here. That's why I‚Äôm removing myself from the world of online dating, potentially for good.

I‚Äôm sure you have questions‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhy are you swiping left on the nice guys?‚Äù That‚Äôs the problem. These predatory men are exceptional at pretending to be nice guys. Believe it or not, I pay much more attention to a person‚Äôs bio and profile details than I do to their profile pictures. And you know what, most of yours suck.

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt all 6‚Äô tall.‚Äù Shut up. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10‚Äù. Anything taller than me works.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably fat.‚Äù You got me there. I‚Äôm overweight and on a serious weight loss journey. Exercise and nutrition have become passions of mine, and I‚Äôm hitting my goals every month. So to be honest, I‚Äôm probably in better health than most of you are.

And I repeat what I said above, I‚Äôm not perfect. There‚Äôs plenty of things to dislike about me. I‚Äôm not for everyone. But these most recent experiences have breached the boundaries of mere incompatibility. Online dating has become a terrifying place, and I‚Äôve had enough.

Gary: You drink too much, you are too physically forceful when trying to flirt, even after I told you you were hurting my elbow and were making me uncomfortable, and I hate your mustache.

Michael: Please stop interrupting women when they are trying to answer your questions, or making comments about what a catch you are and that you should be sending yourself flowers for how achieved you are‚Ä¶ freaking narcissist.

Christopher: You should have been upfront about having kids instead of waiting so long, because I would have been more open-minded about it. I also wish you had disclosed that you chew so much, because I really don‚Äôt like tobacco and I could taste it on you.

Travis: You really creep me out. Some of the things you say are dark. You call yourself a ‚Äúsad boy‚Äù, and I worry about you being alone. I can‚Äôt be with someone I worry about like that.

Ben: You should have never lied about your past before drunkenly confessing to me that you had anger issues, especially when drinking (ironic).

Cody: If a woman asks for a quick chat over the phone for a vibe check, please oblige. And do it right away, it will show her you are interested and care about her feeling safe, especially when plans are being made to meet. At the very least, I think we could have made great friends on our fitness journeys together.

Saxon: I hate that you wasted so much of my time. You could have just told me that you weren't interested. I can handle it. Also, texting is a horrible way to communicate.

To all women: Please, please, please stay safe out there. Always let your circle know who you are talking to, where you are going, ESPECIALLY when meeting up.

To everyone else: Feel free to roast me, lecture me, advise me‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôve had enough.

I‚Äôm going to be making an effort to hit up more coffee shops and bookstores. I‚Äôm going to go back to speed dating in the city. I‚Äôm going to put more focus on meeting people out in the real world and hoping my luck will change while continuing to work on myself. This has all been too hard on my heart.

1n25510,https://youtu.be/_GeFEwNfLZg?si=LE3mxBZYpel12uYQ,Espresso today: a new/old definition,"# Why am I doing this?

I hesitate to make this post because of all the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù espresso purists about to *reeeeee* at me:

""1:2 in 30 seconds!"", ""Espresso should be dark roasts!"", ""Bla bla blabidy blah!""

Ok I made that last one up. It all starts to sound the same, especially in the reddit echo chamber. Point is, many would tell you these things, and they'd all be wrong.

The original espresso from the early 1900s was made using steam pressure, more similar to turbo or Soup shots in terms of peak pressure than what the ***1:2 in 30s*** folks claim as ""traditional espresso"". It wasn't until mid-century that we got spring pressure machines, which is why the resulting high pressure shot style is called ""boomer spro"".

So really, slow flow, high pressure shots are at one extreme, at the fringe of what ""espresso"" can be. At the other end we have high flow, low pressure shots. For example...

# Turbo Shots

Five years ago, [the ""turbo paper""](https://strivefortone.com/blogs/coffee/low-pressure-turbo-shots-and-the-perfect-espresso) was published and what had previously only been talked about by some small online groups was now being spread to larger communities like here. And turbos got the same response then as Soup is getting now (see above).

There's [an excellent blog post](https://pocketsciencecoffee.com/2022/06/28/the-case-for-turbos/) about turbo shots by pocketscience. He asks:

* What is espresso, really?
* Who decided it?
* If it‚Äôs a drink that‚Äôs prepared by passing water under pressure through a puck, with the grind of the puck and flow of water providing the resistance to build pressure, why should anything two bar and above with no lower limit on time, not be considered espresso?

# Can we go further?

Two years ago, DC posted his description of a shot style he'd been doing on the Cafelat Robot manual espresso machine for some time to the EAF discord. Since then, Soupers have been Souping on manual machines, flow-controlled pump machines, even the modest aeropress.

**Enter the OXO Rapid Brewer.** Although not designed with this shot style in mind, the RB turned out to be almost the perfect Soup machine because of it's pressure-limited pumping mechanism. Now, Lance Hedrick has been making several videos on the OXO RB and Soup shots (see video link above).

**Some quick Soup FAQs:**

* Yes, Soup can reach the same EY and TDS of boomer spro.
* Yes, Soup shots taste good (to those whose preference aligns with the style).
* Yes, the grind is really that coarse.
* No, you don't need (appreciable) pressure to make tasty spro, just a gentle soak followed by fast (\~6ml/s) flow.

# The Definition (tl;dr)

**Espresso is forcing water through coffee quickly.**

That's it; that's the whole definition.

""Heyyy, isn't that straight out of the etymology of the word '*espresso*'?""

That's right, this is where *'espresso'* comes from and this is what it means. No limits on pressure, time, ratio, grind, roast. Just a simple description of the brew method.

If you like thick, gooey spro, that's great. If you like high clarity, high acidity spro, like Soup, also great. Two opposite ends of the spro spectrum. They don't invalidate each other. Just two different shot styles.",6,1756363669.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1n25464,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n25464/life_as_a_classroom_lessons_in_every_experience/,Life as a Classroom: Lessons in Every Experience üìö‚ú®,"
We often think of learning as something that happens in a formal setting‚Äîschools, universities, workshops. But what if we shifted that perspective? What if we viewed every single day not just as a sequence of events, but as an ongoing, dynamic learning experience? Life itself is the most comprehensive classroom you will ever attend. The lessons are constant, the curriculum is tailored just for you, and the goal isn't a diploma, but a deeper, more resilient understanding of how to navigate the world.

This classroom has no walls. Your teachers are everyone you meet. Your homework is lived experience. And the pop quizzes? They're the unexpected challenges that life throws your way. Adopting this mindset transforms frustration into curiosity and mistakes into valuable data. It‚Äôs a practical, powerful way to engage with the world that remains relevant no matter how much time passes.

Here‚Äôs how to become an active, engaged student in the classroom of everyday life.

The Core Curriculum: Foundational Subjects for Life üß†

Just like in school, there are core subjects that provide the foundational knowledge for everything else. In life's classroom, these aren't math or science, but fundamental perspectives.

Subject 1: Self-Awareness 101 This is the most important class.It's the study of you: your patterns, your reactions, your triggers, and your joys. You can't solve a problem you don't understand, and you can't navigate the world effectively if you don't understand your own navigation system.

¬∑ Your Daily Assignment: Spend five minutes at the end of your day in reflection. Ask yourself: ""When did I feel most frustrated today? What was the root cause?"" or ""What moment brought me genuine satisfaction?"" Just note the answers without judgment. You are collecting data on yourself.

Subject 2: The Science of Others üë• Other people are your walking,talking textbooks on human behavior. Every interaction is a lesson in communication, empathy, and conflict resolution.

¬∑ Your Daily Assignment: In one conversation today, focus entirely on listening to understand, not to respond. Watch their body language. Hear the emotion behind their words. Afterward, ask yourself what they might really need or want from that interaction. This practice builds invaluable social and emotional intelligence.

Subject 3: Resilience and Adaptation üîÑ This class teaches you how to handle the inevitable pop quizzes and final exams‚Äîthe setbacks,failures, and unexpected changes. The lesson isn't about avoiding them, but about developing the tools to get through them and learn from them.

¬∑ Your Daily Assignment: The next time a small thing goes wrong (you spill your coffee, you miss your bus), pause. Instead of reacting with frustration, say to yourself: ""Okay, this is a practical lesson in adapting. What's my next best move?"" This reframes problems into puzzles to be solved.

Your Teachers Are Everywhere üë®‚Äçüè´üë©‚Äçüåæ

In this classroom, authority isn't limited to those with titles. Your teachers include:

¬∑ The Colleague who annoys you: They are teaching you patience and tolerance.
¬∑ The Stranger who holds the door: They are teaching you about small kindnesses.
¬∑ The Project that failed: It is teaching you about process, planning, and perseverance.
¬∑ A Walk in the Park: It is teaching you about biology, ecosystems, and the importance of quiet observation.

The key is to approach everyone and everything with a question in your mind: ""What can I learn from this?""

Turning Experience into Education: A Practical Guide üõ†Ô∏è

Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes real power when applied. Here‚Äôs how to actively synthesize lessons from your daily experiences.

1. Embrace a Beginner's Mindset üßí Assume you don't know everything. Approach familiar tasks with curiosity. ""How could I make my morning routine more efficient?"" ""Is there a better way to commute?"" This opens you up to continuous, micro-lessons throughout the day.
2. Conduct a ""Lesson Log"" üìì You don't need to write an essay. Once a week, jot down a few brief notes:
   ¬∑ This week's biggest challenge was: [Write a sentence]
   ¬∑ What it taught me: [Write a sentence]
   ¬∑ One thing I want to try differently next week: [Write a sentence] This three-sentence practice solidifies learning and turns it into actionable intelligence.
3. Don't Fear the ""F"" Grade In life's classroom, there is no failing grade, only feedback. A ""failure"" is simply a lesson that was harder than others, or one you weren't ready for the first time. It provides the clearest, most direct feedback on what doesn't work, which is incredibly valuable information for figuring out what does.
4. Find a Study Group üëØ‚ôÇÔ∏è You don't have to learn alone. Your friends, family, and mentors are your fellow students. Share your lessons and listen to theirs. Ask for help when you're stuck on a problem. Teaching a concept to someone else is also one of the best ways to understand it yourself.

Your Graduation Day is Today üéì

There is no final exam in life's classroom. The learning is the point. The goal is to graduate every day with a slightly better understanding of yourself and the world than you had the day before.

Your invitation is to walk outside, or simply look around your room, and see the endless opportunities for learning. Ask questions. Be curious. Make mistakes and mine them for their lessons. This approach turns mundane tasks into fascinating experiments and challenges into opportunities for growth.

The classroom is always in session. Are you ready to learn?

I had just arrived into a conference room with my colleague and boss. Just ad we were starting a large (mostly broadcasted) meeting, I started having vision issues. 
I left the room saying I needed some air because I didnt feel well. 
I stayed out for 10 minutes as I thought I was going to faint (vision going flashy is one of my pre-faining symptoms). But realising it was not that. I returned to the meeting because i had a lot of sections to cover during meeting,  and just carried on. I presented my sections and had little vision to the right with wavy blurred lines across my vision. 
I told my colleague who got me a coffee and water. No real headache - slightly dull ache after my vision recovered. I was tired last night and felt bit sick. 

Is that an ocular migraine? Does anyone know what can be a trigger? I felt fine before that and it really felt like it came out of the blue.

Ever wonder why some people seem to have it all figured out while others drift through life feeling like something's missing? The secret isn't luck or special talents‚Äîit's intentional design. Just like constructing a building, creating a fulfilling life requires planning, the right materials, and consistent effort.

Think about it: you wouldn't build a house without blueprints, quality materials, or a solid foundation. Yet many of us approach our lives haphazardly, hoping things will just work out. Today, that changes. You're about to become the architect of your own existence.

**Laying the Groundwork: Understanding What Drives You** üß±

Before any construction begins, you need to know what you're building and why. This isn't about finding some cosmic purpose‚Äîit's about understanding what genuinely energizes you and makes you feel alive.

**Try This Today:** Instead of overwhelming yourself with big existential questions, start small. Set aside 15 minutes this weekend and ask yourself:
- When do I feel most energized and engaged?
- What problems around me do I genuinely want to solve?
- What would I regret not trying if I looked back in 20 years?
- What activities make me forget to check my phone?

Write down your answers. These insights become your compass‚Äînot pointing to one final destination, but guiding your daily choices toward what truly matters to you.

**The Four Pillars: What Holds Everything Together** üèõÔ∏è

Every well-built life stands on four essential pillars. Think of these as the load-bearing walls of your existence‚Äîstrengthen them, and everything else becomes more stable.

**Pillar One: Making a Difference** ü§ù

Humans are wired for connection and contribution. A life focused solely on personal gain often feels hollow, while one that includes helping others feels rich and rewarding.

**Start This Week:** Look for small ways to contribute daily. This doesn't mean volunteering for hours or donating large sums. Hold the elevator. Give genuine compliments. Share useful information with a colleague. Help a neighbor carry groceries. These micro-contributions build the habit of thinking beyond yourself.

**Advanced Move:** Identify one local problem that bothers you‚Äîlittered parks, lonely elderly neighbors, stressed parents at school pickup. Commit to one small action monthly to address it. You're not trying to solve everything; you're building your contribution muscle.

**Pillar Two: Continuous Learning** üå±

Stagnation kills fulfillment. Your brain craves novelty, challenges, and growth. When you stop learning, life starts feeling repetitive and meaningless.

**Daily Practice:** Dedicate 20 minutes each day to learning something completely new. Read an article about a topic you know nothing about. Watch a YouTube tutorial on a skill that intrigues you‚Äîorigami, basic car maintenance, a new language, cooking techniques from different cultures.

**Monthly Challenge:** Pick one skill quarterly that you'll focus on developing. It could be practical (photo editing), creative (sketching), or social (better listening). The key is consistency, not perfection.

**Pillar Three: Bouncing Back Stronger** üîÑ

Life will knock you down. Count on it. The difference between those who thrive and those who barely survive isn't the absence of problems‚Äîit's how quickly and effectively they recover.

**Reframe Your Setbacks:** Next time something goes wrong, resist the urge to catastrophize. Instead, ask two questions: ""What can this teach me?"" and ""What's one small step I can take right now to move forward?"" This simple shift transforms obstacles into opportunities for growth.

**Build Your Recovery Toolkit:** Identify three activities that reliably help you bounce back from bad days. Maybe it's a 10-minute walk, calling a supportive friend, or listening to a specific playlist. Write them down and use them intentionally when you're struggling.

**Pillar Four: Present-Moment Awareness** üßò‚ôÇÔ∏è

Meaning isn't just about future achievements‚Äîit's about appreciating the construction process itself. The ability to notice and appreciate what's happening right now is what transforms ordinary moments into fulfilling experiences.

**The 60-Second Reset:** Once daily, pause for a minute. Notice one thing you can see, hear, feel, and smell. This simple practice anchors you in reality and breaks the autopilot mode that makes days blur together.

**Mindful Transitions:** Use daily transitions as awareness cues. Before starting your car, take three deep breaths. Before opening your laptop, set an intention for the next hour. Before entering your home, appreciate having a safe place to return to.

**Designing Your Daily Experience** üõãÔ∏è

Now comes the practical part: translating these concepts into your actual schedule. Your daily habits are the living space within your intentionally designed life.

**Audit Your Week:** Track how you spend your time for seven days. Don't judge‚Äîjust observe. Does your time allocation reflect what you said mattered most in your foundation work? If not, where can you make small adjustments?

**Create Meaningful Rituals:** Transform mundane routines into intentional rituals. Your morning coffee becomes a moment of gratitude. Your commute becomes learning time with podcasts or audiobooks. Your evening routine becomes a transition that helps you appreciate the day's accomplishments.

**Curate Your Information Diet:** Just as you choose quality materials for construction, choose quality information for your mind. Replace mindless scrolling with intentional content consumption. Subscribe to newsletters that inspire action. Choose books that challenge your thinking. Engage in conversations that expand your perspective.

**The Weekly Design Meeting** üìÖ

Every Sunday, hold a 30-minute meeting with yourself. Review the past week: What felt aligned with your values? What felt off-track? What would you like to focus on in the coming week?

This isn't about harsh self-criticism‚Äîit's about thoughtful course correction. Think of yourself as a pilot making small navigation adjustments to stay on course.

**Monthly Life Maintenance** üõ†Ô∏è

Once a month, step back and look at the bigger picture. Are your four pillars strong? Do you need to reinforce your contribution practices? Enhance your learning routine? Strengthen your resilience toolkit? Deepen your present-moment awareness?

Life design isn't a one-time project‚Äîit's ongoing maintenance and occasional renovation. Your priorities may shift, new opportunities may arise, or unexpected challenges may require structural adjustments.

**The Compound Effect of Small Actions** üìà

Here's what makes this approach powerful: small, consistent actions compound over time. Reading for 20 minutes daily becomes 120+ hours of learning annually. Daily micro-contributions create a network of positive relationships. Regular resilience practice builds emotional strength for major challenges.

You're not trying to revolutionize your life overnight. You're making small, sustainable improvements that accumulate into significant transformation.

**Your Construction Starts Now** üéâ

You have everything you need to begin building a life that truly matters. No special credentials required. No perfect plan necessary. Just the willingness to start where you are with what you have.

Choose one action from this guide and implement it this week. Maybe it's the 60-second awareness practice. Perhaps it's dedicating 20 minutes daily to learning something new. Or it could be identifying your first small contribution opportunity.

The blueprint is in your hands. Your life is the construction site. The tools are available. All that's left is to start building, one intentional choice at a time.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Every meaningful life started with a single conscious decision to begin building something better.

What will you construct today?

I (24F) just moved to Paris Monday for my masters. I am originally from Serbia but have lived in the US for 14 years. I speak Serbian, Italian and English and have between a B1/B2 level of french, which I have found to be an extreme advantage. 

I live in the 16e but have become comfortable with the metro & bus. I would love any recommendations of places to visit, especially to meet new people, and things to visit. I am an introvert at heart and my Slavic RBF can make me unapproachable, but I'm very kind once I warm up ! 

My interests: fitness/wellness, history, art, live music, reading, comedy, going out (but I do not drink), shopping (but I'm not nearly that stylish), walking around, and sitting outside for an obscene about of time drinking coffee. 

If anyone is in the same boat and would like to connect or if you're a native Parisian looking for a new foreign friend or someone to practice English or Serbian  with, I'm your person. Any/all recommendations are appreciated !

The chest pain from reflux could honestly feel just as scary as cardiac pain sometimes too, which could be even more stressful.

Now let's get the obvious stuff out of the way. Sleep 6-8 inches above, avoid eating within 3 hours of bed, and perhaps even cut back on the usual triggers such as coffee, spicy food, [beans](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/bloating/bloating-after-beans-preparation-methods-that-reduce-gas) (article linked is specified for bloating), etc. for like a week or two and see if it does any help. It might not but always worth a try since gut health is incredibly personalized.

But tbh, if you are getting significant chest pain you might want to push for some proper testing. For example, a GI doc could do an upper endoscopy to see what is happening, and perhaps a pH study to measure how much acid is coming up. 

The chest pain specifically could be esophageal spasm caused by the acid or even referred pain from inflammation.

Ever walk through the door after a long day and immediately get greeted by your cat going *ham* on the nearest scratching post (or worse, your couch)? It almost feels like they‚Äôre sharpening their weapons and sending a message: *‚ÄúWelcome back, human‚Ä¶ prepare yourself.‚Äù* üòº

But don‚Äôt worry, your cat isn‚Äôt actually plotting to murder you (probably). Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going on when they go full Wolverine the moment you come home:

**1. Waking themselves up** üò¥‚û°Ô∏èüòº  
Cats sleep‚Ä¶ a lot. When you‚Äôre gone, they‚Äôve probably been napping the day away. When you walk in, they stretch, rub up on you, and then scratch like crazy. It‚Äôs their version of chugging a coffee to shake off the drowsiness.

**2. Post-‚Äúhunt‚Äù stress relief** üéØ  
In your cat‚Äôs little brain, you weren‚Äôt just at work or Target ‚Äî you were out hunting. Hunting is dangerous business, so when you return alive, they‚Äôre both relieved and hyped. Scratching helps them burn off that energy and calm down, kind of like popping bubble wrap after a stressful day.

**3. Their weird way of saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù** üíï  
Yup, sometimes scratching right when you walk in is just excitement. They‚Äôre happy you‚Äôre home, so they rub on you, flop around, then go claw something as if to say: *‚ÄúYou made it back alive, let‚Äôs celebrate!‚Äù*

**So next time your cat digs into the couch as soon as you come home, don‚Äôt panic. They‚Äôre not preparing to stab you in your sleep ‚Äî they‚Äôre just thrilled to see you.** It‚Äôs messy, dramatic, and a little violent-looking‚Ä¶ but honestly?

Almost 2 months ago I applied for a financial analyst role at a reputable company in the Netherlands and had an interview with the hiring manager that went surprisingly well - I only spoke 10 for minutes and he spoke for 50 minutes, it felt very casual and it was almost as if he was selling both the role and the company to me saying that my profile is very interesting and that the company should capitalise hiring young and ambitious people like me. 

Fast forward a week and I was rejected on the base of not being senior enough for this role which I wasn‚Äôt surprised about, but he and the VP both thought it would be a good idea to have a coffee and discuss my ambitions. 

Yesterday I had the coffee with them and met the VP for the first time, again they were positive about my profile and whether I‚Äôd be interested in working in Finance as part of another domain to which I was positive and they want to plug/refer me to the director of that domain (currently she still reports into the VP but this domain will be separated as of next week).

My question is how should I take all of this? Truth to be told, I never really had to interview for ‚Äòadult‚Äô jobs apart from my internships, for reference I work for a big FMCG company that I interned at and they offered me a role right after University - and now that I had an interview I feel I barely elaborated on my skill set and experiences as part of my current role yet I seem to be getting their support which I do really appreciate as they didn‚Äôt need to do this at all.

This is my first time posting something like this, so not totally sure how to start,  but I guess the easiest way is just to say why I‚Äôm here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we‚Äôre still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt help the situation much. Back then I put most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up the process of losing touch with people. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up over it, I figured it‚Äôs better to finally do something about it, so here I am.

I‚Äôm looking to make new friends in or around Delft / Amsterdam (I work in Amsterdam). I‚Äôd describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I‚Äôm comfortable with people. But when I don‚Äôt know anyone in a group, I tend to shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect. I‚Äôm aware of it and working on it, though!

A little about me:

- Studied computer science and I‚Äôm a bit of a geek I guess 

- Super into AI, love following new advancements and building little projects with it

- Love biking and long walks around the city

- Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking

- Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards

- I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night together?)

- Don‚Äôt game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and still keep up with gaming news

- I also really enjoy watching stand-up comedy (though I‚Äôve never been to a live show yet!). Lately I‚Äôve been into Rogier Bak, who often performs in Amsterdam ‚Äî would be fun to go to one of his shows if you‚Äôre into stand-up or his style!

- I love travelling, and one of my goals is to go on a trek around the Eibsee loop in Germany. Haven‚Äôt made it yet though ‚Äî turns out getting there with just public transport is trickier than I thought üòÖ


And so much more, this list is just what I could immediately think of while on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don‚Äôt exactly align, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm open to trying and exploring new stuff :)

Next is rose buds, and that‚Äôs about the same, subtle sweet rose smell, tastes like‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ nothing! Rosebud tea tastes literally like I‚Äôm sipping on hot water while a rose incense blows somewhere.

I did try lemon with Lavender but that just becomes lemon tea with the slight minty ness off lavender.

So I‚Äôve recently ordered hibiscus as the picture shows. Before anything, this is my FIRST Amazon tea, I usually buy loose lavender and rosebuds from a Chinese store here in Dearborn Michigan.


Now I‚Äôm really hoping some of you can share some healthy herbal tea that has fresh flavours, can be used as a morning tea or pre sleep bed tea, or just evening tea. Something with a delicate but definitive taste and flavour

I tried the basic Chamomile and that tastes oddly‚Ä¶ damp and like the tea is old and just damp and blegh! Hated it

So I‚Äôd really prefer nice fragrant ones! 

I don‚Äôt need sweet stuff, any flavour (not a damp rug lol) will do. 

Also I don‚Äôt use anything else with tea nor do I miss stuff. No sugar no honey. But I just got honey and I‚Äôm about to try things out soon",1,1756362650.0,tea,3,0.67,False

1n24t16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n24t16/oc_the_sweetness_of_change_and_a_fear_of_snakes/,[OC] The sweetness of change and a fear of snakes,"I remember when the world changed. We were once a species arguing because we were a shade darker or lighter than each other. We hated each other for being born a certain way. For trying to look different from our labels. For loving or not loving. That seems so stupid now.  



That changed after the event. An anomaly that we still don‚Äôt understand. I woke up that day, dreading going to work. I stayed in bed for a few more minutes than usual. I didn‚Äôt want to get up. I didn‚Äôt want to feel my back ache trying to stand. I didn‚Äôt want to skip breakfast and lunch just so I could afford to go to the doctor. I didn‚Äôt want to listen to Susan talk about how the‚Ä¶. What was it that she always complained about, some group causing all her problems. Man, they must have really hated her.  



I got up from bed and made my favourite brand of cheap coffee. It would be my only meal until dinner. I took the glorious first sip. I hoped to forget the bitterness. Mom threw all my sugar away, telling me to look after my weight. An unexpected feeling filled my mouth. It was a pleasant feeling, but it was slightly different from the sweetness, like feeling a completely different flavour, yet having the comfort and familiarity of eating a chocolate cake.  




That feeling woke me up from my drowsiness. Everything was different. Everything felt different. My usual white mug was now white with a hint of hotred. A shade, apparently in the infrared. I called it that because it was the colour of hot things and it feels adjacent to red, but not quite red. I can guess how hot something is by the shade of it.  



Then I noticed another pair of arms dangling underneath my arms. Something I definitely didn‚Äôt have before. I ran to the mirror to examine myself and saw a humanoid I have never seen before. My body was a glowing shade of cyan, with spots of royal blue. My face looked human, except for a dark tear-shaped stripe running sideways on my cheeks. I had four arms, that felt like I had had them my whole life. But I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to move them. I was about the same size I was, maybe a bit healthier. I ran to my phone to open Reddit, to search for what was happening.  




There were thousands of posts about how people had changed. Some had shrunk to the size of mice. Some grew to the size of houses.  




Some who were awake saw a massive UFO, sending beams of light throughout the world. Then they witnessed their bodies change in real time. No pain nor panic. It was as if their bodies were always meant to be that. Some didn‚Äôt change at all.  




One person woke up scared of their tail, which also happened to be a snake.  




I looked at the multiple thick snake-like appendages hanging from my hair.  


‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be snakes,‚Äù I remember praying to the aliens. Oh, how naive I was.

For breakfast the family collectively decided to go to dunkin donuts and once we were there we called her and asked what donut she would like from dunkin donuts. Now when we asked this question she kept replying ""dunkin, i want a dunkin donut."" We meant what flavor as dunkin was the name of the coffee shop and not a flavor of donut. But we played along assuming she was fucking bonkers and just got her a chocolate donut. We gave it to her and she was visibly pissed but didnt complain Seven years later i am almost seventeen and just now learning that back in the 50s dunkin got popular since they sold hand cut donuts with a handle so it is easier to dip your donut in coffee without burning your fingers. As per the brand, these special donuts were called ""dunkin donuts"" donuts made specifically for dunking in coffee. Now around 2003 dunkin discontinued these donuts in place of regular donuts as they took longer to prepare and costed more to make. Now wether she didnt know as she never left home when she was alive or just forgot they were discontinued 15 years prior due to old age, i am not certain but when dunkin still made these donuts she would have been in her 30s to her late 80s when they were discontinued so there is a good chance she frequented dunkin for these donuts.
