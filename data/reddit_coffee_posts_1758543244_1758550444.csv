Tbf it was, to my horror, actually pretty good and I did actually pair it intentionally since the Kona I had had very distinct notes of passionfruit, but there isnt really any shaking that I made myself a $16 cup of cold brew and then put cold foam on it.

1nnniyx,https://i.redd.it/oyn0b2vo4qqf1.jpeg,Misjudged a Lorry,"Bit of a frustration post with myself really!Driving home from work today I made a silly mistake - I misread a situation and accidentally cut up a lorry on a roundabout.

I arrived at the roundabout (red on image) and saw a lorry to my right (yellow) at the give way line going about 10mph and seemingly turning left - he had no indicator on and was steering harshly left. However, after I got onto the roundabout he cut his wheel right and I realised he was going around the roundabout and was just giving a wide berth.

I was out of his way a while before he reached where I’d come from but got caught in a queue coming off (there’s a badly placed junction right where you come off & the roundabout quickly clogs). When he got closer he started yelling - which I assumed was at me. I apologised but he likely didn’t hear.

I feel awful for misjudging this! I work on a brutal industrial estate notorious for nobody indicating on roundabout so have gotten used to having to judge a vehicle’s “body language” but choosing to do that completely screwed me here! Next time I’ll make sure to pay more attention and give lorries much more wiggle room.

If anyone has any tips on visually assessing lorries and larger vehicles differently to normal cars etc I’d really appreciate it :)",1,1758550226.0,drivingUK,1,1.0,False
1nnnio1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungAdultStruggles/comments/1nnnio1/is_there_any_purpose_of_the_human_lyfe/,is there any purpose of the human lyfe,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

The south is a lonely place.,"My name is Sarah, I’m a 28 year old trans woman living in Clemson, South Carolina with my cat. I’ve been on HRT since 12/09/23.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership. Something uncomplicated for once that makes me really feel content & safe, and feel like I’ve got a competent trusted person next to me who won’t break my heart for the millionth time. A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won’t hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration.

I’m pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it’s mostly under control with medication.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I’m only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 30 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity. 

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

1nnni9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyersNotes/comments/1nnni9j/what_is_the_trick_to_keeping_up_with_pet_hair/,What is the trick to keeping up with pet hair when you have two dogs that shed all the time?,"https://i.redd.it/ldvjkmvh4qqf1.gif

I remember coming home from work and seeing that tumbleweed of dog hair drift across the floor like some kind of furry ghost. My two goldendoodles would be there, wagging their tails, completely oblivious to the fact they were shedding their entire winter coats onto my hardwood floors. It felt like a never-ending cycle: I’d vacuum on Saturday, and by Monday afternoon, it was like I’d never lifted a finger.



I used to keep a sticky roller by the door, and another one in the car. My dark rugs would tell the story of exactly where each dog had napped. I’d joke that pet hair was a condiment in our house, but honestly, it was a little defeating. You want to enjoy your pets, not feel like you’re constantly battling their existence.



Then, my sister mentioned something offhand. She said she’d finally found a way to stay ahead of the fur from her cat without spending her whole weekend cleaning. She described this little disc that would just trundle around her apartment while she was at work, minding its own business. I was skeptical. How could something so small compete with the sheer volume my dogs produced?



But the real shift happened about a week after I decided to try it. I was making coffee and I heard a quiet whirring sound from the living room. I peeked in and saw it, diligently navigating around the chair legs. The true test came when I had a friend over unexpectedly. For the first time, I didn’t feel a wave of panic about the state of the floors. I just let them in. That was the victory, right there—not the spotless floor, but the absence of that low-grade stress. It just handles the background noise of mess, so I can actually enjoy the foreground with my dogs.

1nnndze,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nnndze/i_keep_wanting_to_go_back_to_coffee/,I keep wanting to go back to Coffee,"I've been caffeine sober for almost exactly 3 months now. I've also quit weed and alcohol, so im not using any substances aside from the occasional cookie or sugary snack here and there. 

Sometimes when I'm upset generally or feel down because of how my relationship is going or when I don't show up with my kids the way I want to, I find  myself craving a coffee to boost my mood or to soothe away the pain. I committed to my wife and myself that I'd stay off of caffeine because of all the negative effects it causes me and yet, I feel like im often doing the same negative crap when I'm clear from it,  so the I think, why am I still abstaining then?

I keep feeling the pull to drink caffeinated coffee and wish I could go back to it but I'd really anger my wife and I'm pretty sure I'd get back to the same place where I feel I need to stop again after a semi-long ""binge"".

I'm kind of ranting but also also seeking support and reassurance maybe? Anyone else struggle with this after only 3 months? The pull to coffee is worse than weed or alcohol. Im content being sober from those but caffeine is a whole other monster, I just don't want to give it up but I know I have to and also don't need it in order to thrive.

But, trying to do any hobbies with him is fucking miserable. 
Never upkeeps his dirtbike, wants to play with the big dogs but won't put money into his horse, bald tires, no brakes, basically slapping duck tape on things to get it to work and in the end it slows us down because he's pissing with stuff constantly. 
One day I picked him up ""becuase he didn't want to drive the hour drive on his own"" and we stopped and got gas and drinks, and he would not buy himself a $1.50c coffee becuase it was to expensive, I was pissed and threw him 2 dollars and told him to stop complaining, and he took it harsh. 

I just can't wrap my head around living like this when having hobbies especially a dirtbike is one of the more expensive hobbies. 

I guess sacrifice now, and be well off later is a big part of it, but he could die of a heart attack tomorrow and never truly experience life ig. 

How do you guys deal with that stuff? Ive put the brakes on with hanging out with him since every time everyone gets together it's basically a game of how much money can I save instead of actually having fun, littarly every thing from how long we ride equates to how much gas has been used which = x amount of dollars spent, ride sharing even though i have a baby and could have to leave any second if somthing arises etc. 

Am I over reacting? By all means I'm not pocket watching nor care what he does with his money but it's affecting people around him .

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am a long-time participant in this sub helping others learn the ropes of espresso (shout out to my ""grind finer"" brethren).   I am excited to share with you a new project we just launched for the coffee community -- [BeanDeals.com](https://beandeals.com).

I hope this doesn't fall into Sunday Self-Promotion -- BeanDeals is a completely free site (no ads!) that tracks 1,500+ specialty roasters so you don't have to.  We sift through tons of deals and offers every day and pick only the best ones to feature on our site.  Right now you can find 8 active deals ranging from 20% to 32% off.

All promo codes are human verified with accurate expiration dates.  We analyze each deal for the best way to optimize for free shipping or stack other discounts (e.g. variety packs).  We are not your typical deal site that is a graveyard of expired deals.

Our mission is to save you time and money.  We believe in a ""no gimmicks"" approach to coffee buying.  No hiding promo codes.  No paywalls, fees, commitments or subscriptions.  No annoying taste quizzes or weekly mystery boxes.  Just awesome bean deals.

See a deal you like?  Just click on the code to copy it to clipboard and take you straight to a roaster's site.

Want to see our deal analysis to understand the best way to get free shipping, see some other helpful metrics, or dive into the comments section?  Just click the ""read more"" button.

We built this site because it's something we always wish existed.  We love trying new roasters, and it can be overwhelming deciding which one to try.  Sometimes a good deal is all you need to nudge you in the right direction.  We're hoping to streamline that process for coffee buyers and save you a few bucks in the process.

In the near-term our focus is going to be to continue to add more roasters.  We see tons of deals every day already, but more deals to choose from = better deals for you.

We appreciate any feedback the community has to offer, either here or privately to us by PM or email.  To support our mission, please help spread the word to your friends.

It’s still cooling, but the sound is totally new and a little unsettling. I’ve checked the filter and it looks fine. Is this something I should be seriously worried about?","The coffee pot sound is a great description! We've heard that one before. When an AC makes a gurgling or bubbling noise, it's usually a sign of one of two things, and you're right, it's probably not a DIY fix you want to take on. To answer what the noise is:

1. **You're low on refrigerant.** This can cause the cooling coil to freeze up. As the ice melts, you get that weird noise as the air and water mix. A low refrigerant level means you have a leak somewhere, and an AC technician needs to find and fix it properly. Just topping it off does not fix anything.
2. **Air or moisture in the system.** If air gets into the refrigerant lines, it can cause those sounds. This is a big no-no for the long-term health of your unit.

Either way, you want a pro to check it out. They can hook up their gauges and diagnose the problem in minutes. Trying to DIY with refrigerant is a bad idea boss. You're dealing with pressurized gas, and it's a regulated substance. Better to have someone with the right gear and know-how take a look before it turns into a bigger, more expensive problem.",1,1758549739.0,LockportHomeServices,0,1.0,False

1nnnb8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCSpend/comments/1nnnb8u/should_you_choose_the_poly_voyager_4210_uc/,Should You Choose the Poly Voyager 4210 UC Bluetooth Headset for Work,"The Plantronics 211317-02 Voyager 4210 UC intrigued me with its promise of effortless Bluetooth connectivity and sound isolation for professionals. I’d heard whispers of its reliable performance in busy office settings, and over the past few weeks, I’ve had the opportunity to test it extensively. This wireless headset doesn’t aim at audiophiles but targets business users—folks like me who often dart between calls, video conferences, and focus work. The sleek design, portability, and range all caught my attention initially, but there’s a mix of upsides and room for improvements that I’ll share.

**Design and Comfort That Works for Long Hours**

The first thing I noticed was the headset’s angular earpiece design paired with a flexible microphone boom. It’s incredibly lightweight at just 3.5 ounces, making it ideal for extended wearing. I regularly use headsets for hours during project meetings, and this one felt comfortable, with no pressure on my head or ears. The leather material on the earpiece added a sense of sophistication while preventing sweating. I also appreciated the foldable speakers—a thoughtful touch for portability when on the move.

What wasn’t perfect for me, though, was the headband’s adjustability. While it generally fit snugly, I can see how someone with a larger head might find it slightly less adaptable. Also, I’d have liked a bit more padding around the headband itself, as the current setup prioritizes minimalism over plush support.

**Wireless Performance and Bluetooth Range**

If you’ve ever struggled with a headset cutting off mid-call because you ventured 15 feet away from your desk, you’ll understand how impressed I was with this product’s Bluetooth range. It boasts an impressive 30-meter (or 98 feet) connectivity radius from a Class 1 Bluetooth device. I tested this by wandering across my apartment—kitchen, balcony, even down to the lobby—and the headset delivered seamless audio with zero interruptions.

That said, the Bluetooth version, 4.1, is a bit dated when compared to newer models which support versions 5.0 or even 5.2. Don’t get me wrong, the range and performance were commendable, but I can’t help but wonder if the connectivity speed or stability might be further enhanced with an updated version.

**Highlights**

- Flexible, lightweight design for prolonged use  
- Exceptional 30-meter Bluetooth range  
- Foldable portability with included carrying case  

[Check Plantronics 211317-02 Voyager 4210 UC price on Amazon.](https://mincopc.com/p/b07hpdmg2q/)  

**Battery Life that Keeps Up with Busy Days**

One of the more critical factors for me is battery life. Between back-to-back calls and occasional music listening, I need a headset that won’t die mid-day. The Voyager 4210 UC delivered well here. With up to 12 hours of talk time and 15 hours of listening time on a 1.5-hour charge, this headset kept up without breaking a sweat. I loved the quick-charging feature, too—plugging it in for just under 30 minutes gave me nearly half a day of use.

A small complaint, though—there’s no battery indicator on the headset itself. While the connected device (like my laptop) provides details, I’d prefer an independent indicator for better planning. Sometimes, I just want to check the battery status without pulling out an app or device settings menu.

**Sound Quality and Noise Isolation**

Sound performance isn’t on the level of high-end audio equipment, but then again, this headset wasn’t designed with audiophiles in mind. For office calls and video conferencing, the sound clarity was excellent. Voices were crisp, and the noise isolation feature did its job surprisingly well. I tested this during loud coffee shop calls, and the person on the other end never had trouble hearing me.

The bass and dynamic range for music listening were decent but not outstanding. This is where the single-earpiece design, style, and monaural setup affected the overall music experience. Professional communication is clearly the priority here—not recreational listening.

**Areas of Concern**

- Headband adjustability might not suit all users  
- Bluetooth 4.1 lacks the cutting-edge appeal of newer standards  

**Competing Brands**

I’ve used other competitors in this space, like the Jabra Evolve 65 and Logitech H800. In terms of comfort, the Voyager 4210 UC edges slightly ahead due to its light build and flexible boom arm. Its 12-hour battery life is comparable with Jabra, although Jabra offers a more modern Bluetooth version. Logitech, on the other hand, falls behind on Bluetooth range, only delivering up to about 33 feet. Where Jabra and Logitech slightly outshine the Voyager is the inclusion of stereo sound options, especially more immersive for multimedia usage.

That said, if your focus skews towards extended phone use, Bluetooth stability, and portability for business needs, the Voyager 4210 UC still holds its ground exceptionally well.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

While not the cheapest headset available, its price matches the market positioning. You’re paying for the assurance of quality, comfort, and practicality. I’d describe it as a case of “get what you pay for.” Sure, newer Bluetooth versions or stereo headphones might provide added value for hybrid users (think work and entertainment), but for professional environments where clarity and convenience matter the most, this headset delivers.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

[**My wife admitted to having a drunken one night stand last week and it has turned me into a robot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1dqj4ey/my_wife_admitted_to_having_a_drunken_one_night/)

I (32M) have been married to my wife Kate (30F) for 4 years, together for 9. Our relationship has been amazing, loving and supportive. We have good communication, hardly ever argue and our bedroom life has gone from strength to strength over the years. We discussed cheating in the past and I was always clear that we would be over if it ever happened.

Kate went home to visit her family last weekend which was fairly normal. Before she left on the Friday night, we had a minor argument about keeping the house tidy so our communication was limited on Saturday but I knew she was going out to meet some friends at a bar. I trusted her 100% so didn't think anything of it.

Before I fell asleep, I text her saying that I hope she had a nice night. When I woke up on Sunday morning I had a missed call from Kate at 4 am so I immediately called her to check if she was okay but no answer. After a few hours I tried again a few times but still no answer. Around an hour later I got a message saying she was fine and was driving back soon.

Kate got home late afternoon and looked awful. She had clearly been crying, was not wearing any makeup (unusual for her) and looked like a shell of a person.

I knew right away something was wrong but she wouldn't let me hug her and would barely speak. I sat her down on the couch and made her some tea. I gently encouraged her to tell me what was wrong and she burst into uncontrollable tears for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to comfort her.

She then proceeded to tell me, stopping every few words, that she had slept with someone last night after the bar.

At that moment, something in my brain broke. I can't describe it any other way. I immediately got up and jumped in my car and drove off. I went to a park and walked around it for about an hour. Kate was calling my phone constantly and I turned it off.

When I got home, I grabbed two suitcases from the garage and went to our bedroom. I threw some of Kate's clothes and shoes into them and left them by the front door.

Kate was lying on the floor in the living room, curled up into a ball sobbing. I called her best friend who lives nearby and told her that Kate needed a place to stay and a ride to her place and that Kate could explain everything to her later.

I told Kate I was leaving for an hour and that her friend was coming to pick her up. She grabbed on to my legs trying to stop me from leaving. When I returned home again, Kate was gone and so were the cases.

On Monday, with a clearer head, I answered one of Kate's many calls and told her that I needed her to send me an email with as much details as possible of that night and if she leaves anything out, there will be no hope of reconciliation. I received this email on Monday night but still haven't opened it.

Since then, everyone has been trying to contact me but I have just been working, exercising and sleeping. One of her friends turned up at my house with an attitude demanding an explanation, I told her to speak to Kate and closed the door in her face.

I have also been speaking to divorce lawyers, have moved money into separate accounts and blocked Kate and all of her friends on everything.

Everything I have done since I found out seems like I have been on autopilot. I don't feel angry, upset or overly emotional. Just numb.

Kate posted a note through the door yesterday asking me to meet tomorrow but I'm conflicted.

Should I meet her? Will it change anything? Is there any point in trying to reconcile?

Is it normal to feel like a robot and how do I snap out of this?

**Edit:** just to add that when I came home the first time, Kate confirmed it was consensual. She was drunk but knew what she was doing.

[**Update-My wife admitted to having a drunken one night stand last week and it has turned me into a robot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1dsrvqt/updatemy_wife_admitted_to_having_a_drunken_one/) 

After reading your comments, I decided to meet with Kate but not read the email.

Kate came to the house yesterday and when I opened the door she looked terrible. She tried to hug me and started mumbling apologies but I stopped her and we sat down to talk.

I started by telling Kate that I would be recording the audio of the conversation and she agreed. I then asked her to explain what happened and told her that I haven't read the email she sent

Kate said she had been at the bar with 2 friends (I know and like both of them) and told me what she had to drink. I was surprised at how little she drank because it was the same amount we would normally drink when going for dinner, a few glasses of wine and a cocktail. She admitted she was only slightly tipsy.

One of her friends Sarah, has a younger brother Max (27M) who came to pick them up around midnight. It's a running joke in their group that Max has had major crush on Kate since highschool and I had heard them joke about this.

The four of them went to get some food and Max then dropped each one off until it was just him and Kate. Kate said she didn't want him to drive the 20 mins to her parents place after working all day so would just order an Uber from his apartment. She went into his apartment to order the Uber but couldn't get one. Max suggested she should crash in his bed and he would take the sofa, he would then drop her off in the morning. Kate refused and continued to try to find an Uber.

They were sitting on Max's bed and he kissed her. She kissed him back and they ended up having sex. After that she broke down crying from guilt and Max took her home. She cried for another hour then tried to call me to tell me what she had done.

We had to stop a number of times because Kate kept breaking down and crying hysterically. She told me it was a huge mistake, she got caught up in the moment, it was terrible, she only loves me blah blah blah.

After she was done, I told her that her story didn't make sense but it didn't matter at this stage because I was done. This caused another breakdown.

I told her I was going to continue with the divorce preparations but for the next month we would be separated with no contact. I also told her that we would both remain faithful, would get a full STD panel and she would tell our mutual friends and family what happened. If she sticks to these conditions, I would be willing to meet again to see if there was any way forward other than divorce.

She enthusiastically agreed to this but made it clear that she did not expect me to stay faithful to her.

I know many of you will criticise this decision but I need to be sure that divorce is the right option after I have had time to process everything that has happened. I am still 99% sure that is where we are heading but I need to be 100% certain.

# **Update 2 - 10 days later (7 days from the last update)**

[**Update 2- My wife admitted to having a drunken one night stand last week and it has turned me into a robot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1dy5jnp/update_2_my_wife_admitted_to_having_a_drunken_one/) 

A few things have happened in the last week so I thought I would make an update post if anyone is interested.

First of all, I'm not in robot mode anymore. I have been having bursts of intense feelings of anger and betrayal but have been keeping busy with work and exercise. My friends have also been great since they found out and have been dragging me out of the house to hang out.

I decided to read the email and wish I hadn't. The story Kate told in the email was mostly the same but there was no mention of going into Max's apartment to order an Uber. There were also pretty explicit details of what they did, for how long and that they had apparently used a condom. I will never be able to forget this description.

Many people who were originally criticising me for kicking Kate out of the house have now apologized but they can keep it. Kate's parents reached out to apologize and I spoke to them because we had a good relationship before all of this. They begged me to try to work it out but said they understood if I decided to get divorced. I didn't commit to either option.

Kate's other friend, that was there that night, contacted me to tell me her side of the story. It mostly matched up, bar-food-home. She said Kate could stay over at her house but she refused saying she was driving home early the next morning. Max apparently insisted that he would take Kate home. The version of the story that she told didn't mention Kate trying to get an Uber, only that Max invited her in and she accepted. I asked her if she had ever suspected anything before and she told me that about a year ago, she went to meet Kate for coffee but found Max sitting with her when she arrived. Apparently Kate looked guilty but when asked about it she said they just met by chance.

Sarah (Max's sister), also reached out to me and I spoke to her too. She was angry with both Max and Kate and told me a similar story. Apparently her whole family are angry with Max and she had not spoken to Kate since she found out. She apologized on behalf of her ""idiot"" brother and said she had warned him to stay away from Kate since high school. She didn't think anything else had happened between them.

I have had zero contact from Kate but heard that she was going to be moving into an Airbnb near our house. Apparently she is not coping well and called in sick from work a few times over the last few weeks. She does have support from the friend she is currently living with and I asked her parents to keep an eye on her. Her parents came up to see her this past weekend.

I went out with some friends at the weekend and ended up drunk at a bar. I was talking to a girl there who I probably could have gone home with but I stopped myself because I wanted to keep my self respect.

Reading the email and hearing what they had done made me give up hope of repairing this. Especially when I know she is not being truthful with me on other things so who knows.

I will be moving ahead with the divorce and might not even wait a month before telling Kate that this is my final decision.

# **Update 3 - 17 days later (7 days from the last update)**

[**Update 3- My wife admitted to having a drunken one night stand last week and it has turned me into a robot.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1e3rqt5/update_3_my_wife_admitted_to_having_a_drunken_one/) 

I debated posting this update but a lot of people seem to be invested in this mess so here it is. Apologies in advance if this is TMI.

Kate sent me an email last week asking to pick up some things she needed for work. My lawyer told me not to prevent her from having access to the house or her possessions so I reluctantly agreed that she could come over on Thursday night when I would be at the gym. I told her to be out by 7:30 but when I got home at 8 she was still there.

When I walked in, she had left a few work related items next to the stairs and she was chopping vegetables for dinner. She looked amazing with her hair and makeup done, wearing one of the dresses I like. The whole place had been tidied and cleaned. I calmly asked her to leave immediately and she made her way to the door but stopped and asked if we could speak. I should have said no but I eventually agreed.

We sat down and had a conversation for around an hour which jumped from topic to topic. Again I told her I would record the audio and she agreed.

I started by asking her if she had kept her side of the agreement we made the last time we spoke. She said she had taken an STI test which was all negative (mine was too thankfully) and a pregnancy test which was negative. She had hadn't been with anyone else and also told a few friends and family what happened and many of them were angry and were not speaking to her.

I asked a lot of questions that had been turning over in my mind for the last few weeks. She confirmed that her reason for going into Max's apartment (the Uber story) was BS and she said he invited her in for a drink and she agreed knowing at some level that something was going to happen. She can't explain why she did this other than being selfish and enjoying the attention.

She also confirmed that she had texted with Max a few times over the years because he would shower her with compliments and make her feel good. He would always initiate and she was apparently careful not to lead him on and said she had never sent him explicit messages or pictures.

Kate also told me that they had hooked up about 6 months before we got together but never had sex. She admitted that she was always a bit curious. Her story about being caught at the coffee shop was that Max had text her asking what she was up to and she had told him where she was, he then turned up.

She swore this was the first time they had ever done anything since we had been together. She said there was nothing missing in our relationship and she hates herself for ruining her ""perfect"" marriage and causing me so much pain.

I told her that I still don't believe her story and that there was no point in continuing the conversation. She calmly asked what she would need to do to make this right, offering up her phone, location sharing, not going out without me etc ( she had clearly been doing some research). I said that I had no plans to become her prison guard, especially when I would never get over the betrayal.

Things then took an unexpected turn which caught me completely off guard. She asked me to turn off the audio recording because she had something private she wanted to discuss and didn't want other people hearing it. I refused and she reluctantly continued.

She asked if I had been involved with anyone else sexually since all of this happened, making it clear she was fine with it. I told her no and she said that I must be going crazy (we used to have sex almost daily) and started talking dirty about all of the things I could do with and to her. This involved a lot of kinky things that I had wanted to try or had only done a few times. She said she wanted to meet my needs, even if we did not get back together.

She said we could have as many threesomes as I wanted from now on or we could be open on my side only and she would even find partners for us/me. She was trying very hard to turn me on and I stayed silent until she asked who I wanted to have a threesome with. For some reason, I mentioned the name of her coworker who is 5 years younger than Kate and a total knockout. This surprised her but she was in too deep and asked me what I wanted to do with her. I went into detail about a pretty hardcore scenario and Kate was encouraging me until I said that she would just be watching. This again caught her off guard but she went along with it. (Later on, I realised that I only said all of this as a petty attempt to hurt Kate which I don't feel good about)

She was obviously convinced that her plan was working so she pulled up her dress and got into my favourite position on the couch, begging me to have sex with her.

I'll admit that for a few seconds my body reacted even though my head was not in the game. Everything suddenly came into focus and the content of her email came flooding into my head. I can't explain why but I started to laugh. Not just a chuckle but a full on belly laugh. She looked hurt and moved away then started to cry.

I told her it was time for her to go and she left quickly, probably due to the embarrassment. I also said she needed to hurry up and get a lawyer because we are getting divorced. The post nut clarity after she left confirmed that I had dodged a bullet.

I have a meeting with my lawyer later this week and want to move forward with the divorce as quickly as possible.

# **Final Update - 2.5 months later (2 months from the last update)**

[**Final update- My wife admitted to having a drunken one night stand last week and it has turned me into a robot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1fi21h4/final_update_my_wife_admitted_to_having_a_drunken/) 

Thought I would provide a final update on the situation for anyone that is interested.

The last few months have been tough and I have only seen Kate in person a handful of times.

After a few weeks of no-contact I decided that we should discuss things with a clearer head. We went for lunch and had a calm, respectful conversation about everything that had happened and what reconciliation might look like. Kate said she would do anything to get things back on track and I believe her but didn't commit to anything.

After that, Kate asked me to go with her to see her therapist who is also experienced in dealing with married couples. I thought about it for a few days before agreeing. The session was tough with a lot of tears but I didn't get a straight answer on why Kate had decided to cheat. The therapist was surprisingly fair to both of us and was not judgemental. We again discussed reconciliation but I told her that I thought it was best to proceed with the divorce.

Last week, I drove up to her parents house to drop off some tools I had borrowed from her dad. We had arranged for Kate to be there and for her parents to go out for a few hours to give us a chance to talk. I spoke with her parents alone who were heartbroken which was hard but they were both very supportive.

During the conversation with Kate, I told her clearly that I had given it a lot of thought but I wanted to move ahead with the divorce. It came down to the fact that, in my view, we would never get back to where we were and I realistically can't see myself ever getting over the betrayal. Even if we could regain the trust, it could take a decade of hard work and that is too big of a risk for me.

Kate finally accepted this and we had calm discussion about how we would divide assets, sell the house etc and wrote an email to our respective lawyers. We left each other on good terms.

The divorce should be finalised by the end of the year and the house will be put up for sale soon.

In the meantime we will go no contact and agreed not to start dating until everything is finalized. I have had a few casual hookups and it feels strange to be going back to being single after all this time. I have been hitting the gym, spending a lot of time with friends and family and getting back into my hobbies.

I'm optimistic about the future and although I'm still devastated by the loss of my marriage, I feel that this has made me grow as a person. Thanks to those of you who have offered advice and support.

1nnn9yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nnn9yz/delve_into_whether_amazon_basics_pet_stain/,Delve Into Whether Amazon Basics Pet Stain Remover Really Works,"**Amazon Basics 104764AMZ Pet Stain Remover Review**

I've had my fair share of battles with pet stains and those lingering odors that seem to hang around long after the mess is gone. Between my puppy's accidents and the occasional coffee spill (let's be honest), I needed a reliable cleaning solution to keep my carpets looking fresh. That's when I came across the Amazon Basics 104764AMZ Pet Stain Remover. Testing this product over the past few weeks has honestly been an adventure worth sharing.

**Deep Cleaning and Stain Removal Performance**

One thing I immediately noticed with this cleaner is its exceptional performance when it comes to tackling tough stains. It doesn't just glaze over the problem; it has this uncanny ability to dive deep into those carpet fibers, obliterating stains and odors at their core. My dog had a bit of a rough training phase (understatement of the year), but this formula worked wonders on those unsightly spots. It’s not just about removing stains—the cleaner also leaves this refreshing scent behind, which feels like a small reward after the headache of cleaning up.

[Check Amazon Basics 104764AMZ Pet Stain Remover price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0cdch9kh2/)

**User-Friendly Formula and Versatility**

The thing I appreciate most is how easy it is to use. Mixing 2.5 ounces per gallon for light stains or 5 ounces per gallon for heavy ones may seem precise, but after a couple of uses, it felt second nature. I tried it with both a rental carpet cleaner and my go-to, at-home deep cleaner, and the formula worked seamlessly with both. This compatibility really makes life simpler because not all cleaning products work across different machines.

**Good Points**

- The EPA Safer Choice certification is a standout feature, making it a safer option for both families and pets while being environmentally conscious.  
- It successfully discourages pets from re-soiling areas, which is a game-changer for those of us in the middle of house-training chaos.  
- Concentrated formula—so a little goes a long way, saving both time and money.  
- Works for different types of stains, not just pet-related ones. Coffee spill? Handled. Red wine? No problem.

**Drawbacks**

- While the cleaner is effective, it does require a bit of patience for tougher stains. You might need to go over the area twice in some cases.  
- The scent, though fresh, might be a bit too strong for those sensitive to fragrances.  

**Challengers in the Market**

When stacking this product up against giants like Bissell or Hoover's proprietary cleaning formulas, it's clear that its affordability gives it an edge. However, those competitors often include additional features in their solutions, like specialized enzymes for pet-related odors. That being said, those mixtures can sometimes feel overly harsh, whereas the Amazon Basics 104764AMZ strikes that delicate balance between being tough on stains and gentle on your home environment. It might lack some of the ""fancier"" selling points of competitors, but it gets the job done with less flash and more substance.

**Bang for the Buck**

Talking about affordability, this product exceeded my expectations without inflating costs. Considering the results I’ve seen—fresh carpets, no pet odors, and retained softness—this cleaner holds its own, even alongside pricier alternatives. If you're like me and you’re watching what you spend while also demanding quality, it fits the bill perfectly.

1nnn7uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1nnn7uk/just_got_the_oracle_jet_loving_it_but_have_a_few/,"Just got the Oracle Jet — Loving it, but have a few beginner questions","Hey everyone,

So I recently made the leap from Nespresso to the Oracle Jet, and I have to say — it's a massive step up! Until now, I was just using Nespresso-style capsules, so getting real espresso from freshly ground beans has been a bit of a revelation.

The main reason I chose the Oracle Jet was because I wanted the *simplest* way to get great espresso from beans — **without turning it into a whole new hobby** (as James Hoffmann puts it 😄). I’ve learned that being a barista is no easy task, and I appreciate how this machine tries to make things more approachable.

What really blew me away was the *Barista Assistance* feature during the initial setup. The way it guided me through dialing in the grind size and dose — especially for the double shot basket — was super helpful and made the whole process much less intimidating.

This is my first semi-professional espresso machine, so please bear with me if some of my questions sound dumb. I haven’t done any mods and I’m still using all the original equipment. Btw even though I am posting this in BrevilleCoffee, I am actually using a Sage Oracle Jet, as far as I know, these machines should be identical.

I'm now on my **third bag of beans**, and here are some questions I’m running into:

# 1. Barista Assistance only worked once?

It worked beautifully the very first time I turned on the machine and helped me dial in for espresso. But when I switched to a new bag of beans, the Barista Assistance didn’t kick in again. I ended up manually restarting the startup tutorial from the software menu to go through the process again.  
**Is this the normal way to do it when switching beans?** Or am I missing a feature/setting?

# 2. Switching beans: best practice?

With Nespresso, changing flavor just meant popping in a different capsule. With the Oracle Jet, switching beans feels like a bigger process. There are always a few leftover beans from the previous bag, and I either have to vacuum them out, or grind them without having a full dose — which messes up the tamping and leads to waste.  
**Is there a better workflow for switching between beans without wasting coffee or messing up the process?**

# 3. Other drinks (e.g. coffee crema) not turning out great

Espresso works *really* well on this machine — I'm very happy with that. But for some other drinks, like Coffee Crema, I haven’t had much luck. It always turns out watery, and it seems like the machine ignores the volume setting.  
**Anyone else experience this? Is there a workaround or better method for these drink types?**

# 4. Software updates: is there a changelog?

When I first connected the machine to Wi-Fi, it updated to version 2.8.1.  
**Is there an official site or page that lists changes/fixes for each software version?** I couldn’t find anything online.

# 5. Tamp process — should I be worried about the puck?

I’ve read that the tamping process on the Oracle Jet isn’t perfect. My pucks look a bit like this (borrowed from another user here on Reddit, but mine are similar).  
**Is this something I should worry about?** Would it help to tamp manually after the machine does its thing, or is it safe to ignore the puck appearance as long as the espresso tastes good?

Really appreciate any tips or insights you all can share. This subreddit has already been super helpful while I was researching the machine!

Thanks 🙏

HELLO, GISING GISING, BAGOONG KULTO WARRIORS! What Loveandera is doing is still a form of bribery. SUHOL. SUMISIPSIP. And for what? Just to have her street style photos taken? She has zero substance talaga! 

And she must have learned this “strategy” from the expert - her corrupt husband! 🤢🐊 Instead of donating to flood control victims, inuuna pa niya ang dayuhang photographers. Yuck! ",8,1758549041.0,HeartEvangelistaSnark,3,1.0,False

1nnmzx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1nnmzx0/h_450_steam_games_everspace_2_anger_foot_rogue/,"[H] 450+ Steam games (EVERSPACE 2, Anger Foot, Rogue Legacy 2, Laika, Noita, INDIKA, Caravan Sandwich, Citizen Sleeper 2, Oblivion Remastered, Bō, Shardpunk) [W] Traveler's Refrain, Into the Restless Ruins, wishlist","**Looking for games on** [**my wishlist**](https://lestrades.com/@febrik/wishlist/Some)**.**

I'm usually also interested in Fanatical slots. When it comes to games from previous Humble/Fanatical bundles, I've picked up almost all the ones I'm interested in from the last few years, but some I'm still looking for are:

*9th Dawn Remake / Transistor / Super Blood Hockey / Lunacid / Warplanes: WW1 Fighters / Vampyr /* *Yaga* */* *Dark Pictures Anthology: Devil in Me /* *HeistGeist / Star Shelter /* *The Almost Gone / The Outer Worlds + DLC (not Spacer's Choice Edition) / VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action / Into the Restless Ruins / Sol* Cesto / Deathless. The Hero Quest / Traveler's Refrain / BeatSlayer

I prefer to trade bundled games for bundled, and unbundled for unbundled. If you're offering bundled games for my unbundled ones, I won't expect 2x gg value like resellers, but it will still have to be a pretty damn good offer ;)

Only trading for Steam games (not interested in GOG/EA). May be interested in PayPal/TF2 trades, but not crypto.

1nnmzo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1nnmzo8/obtaining_real_stories_advice/,Obtaining Real Stories Advice,"Hey guys! I’m starting a series where we interview real people about their creepy stories and recreate them with actors. Think short format Unsolved Mysteries or a video version of Radio Rental. I have the crew to film it, an interview set, and all the equipment we need. However, I’m having a hard time finding people locally that would want to have their story told. Ive gone to local subreddits (not with much luck bc of soliciting rules) and facebook groups but no luck. Ive asked all my friends and family and I’m starting to put up flyers around local coffee shops.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

We recently parted ways I’m 27, she’s 29.

When she first moved in, I was stuck in a very toxic long-distance relationship. Over time, as we got more comfortable, I started venting to her and asking for a female perspective. She told me straight up that my girlfriend was toxic and just using me for attention and validation. Eventually, in May, I broke up with my ex. The first couple of months were rough, but I’m in a much better place now.

Here’s where things get tricky: while I was still in that relationship, I noticed myself comparing the way my roommate treated me to how my girlfriend did. And honestly? It shocked me. A roommate, a roommate was more caring and supportive than my partner ever was. She’d initiate plans for dinner, suggest fun things to do, and always checked in on me. She’s a homebody, very passionate about her career, super philosophical, and always sparks deep conversations that make me see life differently. Basically, she has all the qualities I’d want in a partner.

Since moving out, it’s been about a month, but she’s already invited me to dinner twice and also told me to visit her place for tea, coffee anytime(just being genuinely polite I think) Both times felt like informal dates we had a great time. It was my birthday on 7th of this month, she gave me a thoughtful gift with a note that said: “Hope you find a kind, loyal, and caring 10.” That one kinda threw me off.

I also just bought a sports car, and she was super excited about it. Yesterday we grabbed dinner(she asked if I was down) went to her fav dessert spot and then went for a drive together it honestly felt amazing having her in the passenger seat and the 0-60 really made her laugh with excitement cuz its her first time sitting in a car like this. But here’s the thing: I’m completely clueless when it comes to knowing if a girl is dropping hints or just being friendly. She does keep asking me if I'm going on dates or seeing someone quite a few times

She hasn’t dated in about 5 years after being in a 8 year long term relationship and has told me she wants to meet someone organically when we first met, not through apps. That’s why I’m stuck part of me feels like there’s a spark, part of me feels like I might just be imagining things. All my friends say that “the way y'all hangout is almost identical to being in a relationship but its just informal right now”",1,1758548767.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1. Your phone isn't unwinding—it's a distraction. Using your phone before bed fills your brain with noise right when it needs to rest. Give it a break.
2. Multitasking is a lie you tell yourself. You aren't doing two things at once; you're just doing two things poorly. Focus on one thing at a time to get more done.
3. You can't run on coffee alone. Your brain needs fuel. When you skip breakfast and rely on caffeine, your mind literally starves and gets anxious.
4. A full day of work is a bad day. Sitting for hours straight starves your brain of blood flow and oxygen. Get up and move every hour. Your mind works better when your body moves.
5. Constant consumption is a killer. Filling every quiet moment with a podcast or video is killing your mind's ability to think on its own. Your brain needs silence to process what it's learned.
6. Willpower is not a strategy. Focus isn't a mindset—it's a system. The people who are productive don't have more willpower than you; they have better habits.

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 09/08/25-09/14/25.  

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's busy shopping schedule...

Takeout & Shopping 

09/08 SHEIN Haul for Kylea: floral print split thigh dress, rib knit black lounge set, grey denim dress with pockets, Bohemela patchwork long sleeve shirt, oversized short sleeve knit top (pink & white horizontal stripes), 3 pack black high waisted leggings

09/10 Target: 2 Laurie Gilmore Books (The Cinnamon Bun Book Store & The Pumpkin Spice Cafe) 

09/11 The Human Bean smoothie for Kylea; SHEIN Haul for Kylea: oversized short sleeve knit top in hunter green & caramel, 10 packages shown on counter (most are dresses) horizontal striped pink and red dress (her followers thought were pajamas), Emery Rose summer plaid short sleeve dress, Eden V-neck flutter hem print dress, Brillora V-neck A-line print dress, Bohemela patchwork half-zip long sleeve shirt, Lune 2 pc set in light gray, EZ Wear brown patched overall dress, high neck floral green dress, floral dress

09/13 Billy Sims BBQ takeout for 2 (only part of Kylea's meal shown); hunter green long sleeve lounge set for Kylea; color blocking hooded long sleeve top for Kylea (cream, maroon and brown)

09/14 Taco Bell dinner for 2 (only Kylea's meal shown)

Travel

09/09 Kylea & Joe will walk across the Royal Gorge bridge during their Colorado trip

09/13 Kylea announced they'll stop halfway to Colorado on Saturday night.  She showed their roadtrip snacks and beverages

Pets, Family & Religion

09/08 Video of Birdie playing on the couch (background of Kylea's try-on video)

09/09 Kylea claims they keep a 3 month supply of litter in their apartment

09/10 Kylea claimed the extra soda in their home is for family dinners every weekend

09/14 Kylea allegedly went to church alone. There were no posts about Joe attending the late service.  No family came for a meal this weekend.

*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk, playing with her puzzles/ball pit or swimming pool.  The cats, Alice & Oliver, were not shown in images or on video, and there were ZERO posts dedicated to them.

Health & Fitness

09/09 Kylea posted a reminder that Joe's been training for the Manitou Incline.  In recent comments, Kylea shared she completed the hike with no training.  Kylea stated, ""I'm going to see an allergy specialist soon."" No additional details were shared.

09/10 Kylea clapped back at followers and posted 2 Facebook stories defending her use of marshmallow creme in diet sodas.  Announced she'll use her weekly WW points on Taco Bell Sunday (09/14).

09/11 Claims she repeats herself due to anxiety.  Announced she'll go darker blonde in a few weeks for fall. In response to her SHEIN haul content, due to daily bullying and harassment, she prefers oversized clothes.  In general, Kylea denies gaining any weight.

09/12 She claimed to read her new book the last few mornings.  Interestingly, she does not have time to read her Bible. 

📢 Her 09/11 post about Tyson microwavable chicken nuggets went viral today.  Kylea ignored all inflammatory and UNkind comments...this was a major change from her usual arguing, blocking, publicly shaming, and doxxing behaviors... 🤔 

09/13 Joe got a haircut and beard trim for vacation

09/14 New photo of Joe at the gym

*No videos of Joe at the gym; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate

Final Thoughts

Behind the scenes, Kylea was in court 09/10 for multiple cases involving protective orders (she and former friends filed against each other). The other attorney requested continuances, and they were granted. Her next court date is 10/15. IMO, Kylea could give 💩 💩's about this Colorado trip.  In general, what she cares about is treating herself to more clothes, accessories, home decor, and chemical coffees. No matter how many times she calls her followers friends or claims she loves them, her actions speak louder than words.  Money and greed drive her decisions.✌️

1nnmucq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PotentPath/comments/1nnmucq/heres_4_cannabis_friendly_countries_tourists_can/,Here's 4 Cannabis Friendly Countries Tourists Can Light Up In,"Combining cannabis and adventure is a perfect way to get the most out of your travels, and with the recent rise of legalization happening across the globe, countries are slowly becoming open to tourists flying over and getting involved in the legal cannabis scene.

Below you can find four cannabis friendly countries that are opening their doors to visitors:

**1. Canada**

In 2018, Canada legalized the recreational use of cannabis, making it a dream destination for weed tourism. Now, tourists can purchase their favourite strains, edibles, and concentrates from licensed dispensaries both in-store and online.

* **Legal Status:** Legal for both medical and recreational use.
* **How Much You Can Possess:** You can possess up to 30 grams of cannabis.
* **Legal Age:** The legal age for consuming cannabis is 19 in most provinces and territories, 18 in Alberta, and 21 in Quebec.
* **Where You Can Use It:** You can use it in private residences.

When it comes to the public consumption of cannabis, the rules depend on the province or territory. In most provinces and territories, cannabis can be used in public wherever tobacco can be used and as long as it's away from schools, playgrounds, and children's facilities. However, some provinces and territories prohibit cannabis use in public for both recreational and medical marijuana. 

Where You Can Buy It: As long as you are above the legal age and can provide a valid form of ID, like a passport or driver's license, you can purchase cannabis from licensed dispensaries both in-store and online.

**2. Thailand**

No one would have ever thought that Thailand would legalize medical cannabis in 2019, from being a country that was widely known for having some of the strictest cannabis laws on the planet, to now having medical cannabis clinics across every major hotspot of Bangkok.

* **Legal Status:** Legal for medical use and illegal for recreational use. Cannabis extracts like CBD containing less than 0.2% THC are legal.  
* **How Much You Can Possess:** People who have a valid medical prescription can possess up to 30 grams of cannabis.
* **Age Restrictions:** The legal age for consuming cannabis is 20.
* **Where You Can Get It:** As long as you are above the legal age and have a prescription, you can purchase cannabis from licensed medical clinics.
* **Where You Can Use It:** You are allowed to use cannabis in private residences and cannabis-friendly accommodations.

Public use of cannabis is illegal and can result in a fine of up to 25,000 Baht and/or imprisonment for up to 3 months. 

**3. Netherlands**   

The Netherlands has had very relaxed weed laws for decades, however, not many are aware that weed isn't entirely legal for recreational use in the nation, it's tolerated. Tolerance in the Netherlands basically means that cannabis is still technically illegal, but it's decriminalized and operating in a legal grey area.

* **Legal Status:** Legal for medical use and tolerated for personal use.  
* **How Much You Can Possess:** Possession of up to 5 grams of cannabis is tolerated.
* **Legal Age:** The legal age for purchasing and consuming cannabis is 18.   
* **Where You Can Use It:** Using cannabis in public areas is prohibited, but you can use it in private residences, cannabis-friendly accommodations, and coffee shops.  
* **Where You Can Buy It:** As long as you are above the legal age and can provide a valid form of ID, like a passport or driver's license, you can purchase up to 5 grams of cannabis from licensed coffee shops.  

**4. Jamaica**    

In 2015, cannabis was decriminalized for personal use, allowing citizens, residents, and lucky tourists to possess up to 2 ounces (56 grams) of cannabis without facing any charges. Bear in mind that cannabis is still technically illegal in Jamaica, so if you don't have a medical card, you may get a fine of J$500.

* **Legal Status:** Legal for medical use and decriminalised for up to 2 ounces (56 grams) for personal use.
* **How Much You Can Possess:** Possession of up to 2 ounces (56 grams) of cannabis is decriminalised and may result in a fine of J$500. 
* **Legal Age:** The legal age for purchasing and consuming cannabis is 18.   
* **Where You Can Use It:** You are allowed to use cannabis in private residences, cannabis-friendly accommodations, cannabis friendly lounges, and places that are for medical or therapeutic purposes.
* **Where You Can Buy It:** As long as you're above the legal age and can provide a valid medical card, you can purchase cannabis from licensed dispensaries, which are known as herb houses in Jamaica.",1,1758548573.0,PotentPath,0,1.0,False

OK enough for the pity party.



JCB states in the PM chapter he had never been to a “CITY LIKE New Orleans” Clue.  
That is not in New Orleans and that the trip went “Past the Ozarks”.

I solve this with the City or St. Louis. It is “like” New Orleans, it was a part of the historical Louisiana Purchase –we know how much JCB loves history-- He also states this hotel is compared to the Empire State Building or Eiffel Tower- The St. Louis Arch is often compared to these two monuments. He writes about being “filled to the brim” a reference to a coffee commercial. St. Louis was a major coffee hub receiving beans on riverboats, roasting and distributing to the Midwest. Later in the chapter he describes his search for a location to be “a FAIR bit of work” – St Louis hosted worlds fair in 1904; the fairgrounds are now a part of Forest Park. He also mentions the Jayco popup camper. Three words, Six syllables- JPC initials. More on that later.  
  
He also visits a Jazz Bar and a pet store. There is a New Orleans style jazz bar -Evangeline's Bistro and Music house as well as two pet stores, Wolfgang’s and Treats Unleashed; all on Euclid ave just east of Forest Park.  
He mentions seeing raccoons – The park has a tag and follow program for various wildlife occupants in the park. One raccoon is called Frankie. You can look at this on an app on line.  
In the park there are many things that children would love. The Zoo for example. The merry-go-round has paintings on the interior wall. One of them is a Asian looking child with a magnifying glass looking at bugs.

He has mentioned JOY in other parts of the book. There is a famous sculpture (currently not on display) called Joy De Vivre (joy of living ) by Jacques Lipchitz in the park. I know this clue is not contained in the chapter, but he is insistent on mentioning it other places.

(I will post a discussion about the ""not under a body of water"" instructions from JCB about what a ""body of Water"" is probably on discord.

He describes a journey in the park, goes around stuff (Round Lake/Fountain) and finally decides to hide the treasure after getting information from a pokemon Golem – A Golem is a creature from Jewish Mythology. In pokey man they are mysterious and often associated with historical sites. The location in the park is near to Barnes Jewish Hospital. A coincidence? Maybe not.



He hides the treasure near a place that locals visit from time to time. There is an Ice Skating Rink just south of my solve Steinberg Skating Rink – Currently under construction. The Joy De Virve sculpture has a spot in this area.  
  
He mentioned Jayco Popup Camper in the beginning of the puzzle. Three words, six syllables an JPC as initials. One of the historical figures in St Louis is Jean-Pierre Cabanes – A French trader who lived in New Orleans then moved to St. Louis. He has a home currently inside Forest Park, St Louis AND there is another feature named for JPC- The Cabanne Spring – It is north (near) the Skate Park.



I believe the Pokemon treasure is located in and or around the historical spring.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

By [Orlando Sentinel](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/author/orlando-sentinel/) and [Orlando Sentinel Editorial Board](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/author/orlando-sentinel-editorial-board/) | [insight@orlandosentinel.com](mailto:insight@orlandosentinel.com)

A two-year Department of Justice investigation into the Lowell Correctional Institution near Ocala has confirmed what anyone who cared already knew.

America’s largest women’s prison has been a hellhole of sexual abuse and corruption for at least 15 years. But as disgusting as the [34-page report](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1347811/download) is, the most disturbing thing isn’t the rapes or beatings or cover-ups.

It’s how few people in power cared. And that indifference has left inmates in danger to this day.

“Our investigation found that staff sexually abused women incarcerated at Lowell and that these women remain at substantial risk,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband said in a[ press release.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-alleges-conditions-lowell-correctional-institution-violate-constitution)

*Remain at substantial risk.*

That line should ring like an air raid siren throughout the legislative halls in Tallahassee.

Four female legislators have called for the removal of prison administrators and introduced a[ bill ](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/165)that would improve treatment of prisoners. That’s a start, but the rot in Florida’s prison system calls for a major reckoning.

It should start at the top. Ron DeSantis has paid scant attention to Lowell’s problems. Of course, neither did Rick Scott, Charlie Crist or Jeb Bush when they served as governor.

Fingers could also be pointed at all the legislators and administrators who should have detected the scandalous stench emanating from the 2,200-prisoner facility.

The Florida Department of Corrections has been aware of the abuse at least since 2006, the DOJ report said. But the department “failed to take timely action to remedy the systemic problems.”

State officials can’t plead ignorance. A Miami Herald [investigation](https://www.governing.com/archive/tns-lowell-florida-womens-prison.html) in 2015 was based in part on FDOC documents and public records requests.

The Herald also interviewed more than 30 inmates. People like Casey Hodge, who was sentenced to three years in prison on a drug trafficking charge in 2012. She was legally blind and had a glass eye.

When Hodge showed up at Lowell, guards made her remove the prosthetic eye and pretended to vomit. Hodge said a guard threatened to send her to solitary confinement if she didn’t regularly have sex with him.

“I did what he said because I didn’t know what would happen,” she told the Herald. “I didn’t know what he was capable of.”

Other inmates said guards slammed inmates against walls, spat in their faces, ogled them as they used the bathroom and poured coffee or bleach on them.

The Herald’s stories prompted the FDOC to replace Lowell’s warden and hire more than 100 new guards. That didn’t stop the abuse.

The DOJ report said prison authorities did not properly investigate a long list of abuse complaints. The lax atmosphere explains how guards beat inmate[ Cheryl Weimar](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/florida-prisons/article245146350.html) in 2019 after she told them a chronic hip problem kept her from scrubbing a toilet as they’d ordered.

Weimar ended up with a broken neck and is a paraplegic. She filed a federal lawsuit that was settled last August, with the state paying Weimar $4.65 million.

You’d think lawmakers would notice such a case. You’d think it might put the fear of God or DeSantis into Lowell officials. But the DOJ report said abuses continued into 2020.

And those were just the complaints prisoners actually filed. There’s no telling how many were coerced into silence over the years. Inmates were even told not to speak openly to the DOJ.

“During the Department’s onsite visits to Lowell, we received information that supervisory staff had threatened prisoners against cooperating with our investigation, and in one case retaliated against a prisoner for providing us with information,” the report said.

The DOJ is threatening to bring a civil rights lawsuit if the prison doesn’t make changes by Feb. 8. The “minimal remedial measures” include educating prisoners on complaint procedures, new training for staff and improved video monitoring.

Those are baby steps. The Lowell travesty calls for drastic measures and a huge dose of accountability.

Of 161 sexual abuse investigations the DOJ reviewed, only eight resulted in the arrest of an officer. The FDOC put out a statement saying it cooperated with the DOJ and will crack down on any employee who violates the law.

“FDC has zero tolerance for staff who act,” Secretary Mark Inch said.

Given the prison system’s history, such assurances mean nothing. Sen. Janet Cruz (D-Tampa) has called for Lowell warden Stephen Rossiter [to resign](https://www.ocala.com/story/news/2020/12/30/lowell-womens-prison-sexual-abuse-warden-stephen-rossiter-florida/4078648001/).

Prisoner-rights advocates want a special prosecutor appointed or the state to create an independent agency to oversee Florida’s prisons. From staffing to budgets to policies, the whole system needs a serious overhaul.

Whatever actions are taken, potential crimes are not the only things that need to be investigated. Somebody needs to find out how so much abuse could go on for so long — and why state leaders barely even looked Lowell’s way.

If they had, they’d have seen a sign outside the prison gate. It says, “We Never Walk Alone.”

Tell that to Cheryl Weimar.

Here's the system that changed everything.,"Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Tools are your best friend. I use the normal notes app on my phone to write down gratitudes and other things on my mind all the time. For planning my day, I use an [app ](https://link.purposa.app/4)which lets me plan everything and actually get my shit together.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

1nnmkdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1nnmkdo/constant_suicidal_ideation_and_general_nihilism/,Constant suicidal ideation and general nihilism,"This might be fairly triggering to some people. Those who are sensitive to talk of suicide and overall pessimism should scroll away. 

I’m going to start this off by saying I am not actively suicidal. I have been before and can tell the difference. I have no intention of crashing my car or jumping off of a bridge or whatever. 

But I am tired. 

The idea - the urge, but not really an urge, just the instantaneous thought of “I wish I was strong enough to kill myself” - has existed within me since I was 12 or 13. I’ve checked all my boxes: I’ve gone to therapy, did my time in-patient, have been on and off various meds. I’ve always idealized the notion that eventually, when I move on to the next milestone (be it moving out, graduating college, getting a job) that I would feel a sense of fulfillment and happiness and gratitude towards my still-here life and it would go away. To my profound disappointment, it doesn’t. It lingers and rears its ugly head whenever I find myself stuck in a loop of remembering things I’d rather not. 

The general state of the world further makes me feel like none of it is worth it. Little things, of course, I find meaning in: petting my dog every day, enjoying my coffee, reading a good book. But outside the borders of my little apartment and work office, I see nothing. Our planet will collapse in on itself and people will continue to in-fight until there are none of us left. 

I have lost hope in most things. And to circle around to the reasoning for this subreddit, I have lost hope in getting better. In healing. In a metamorphosis, if you will. At the end of the day, after all the love in the world I get from my friends and family and coworkers and boyfriend and dog, the trauma will never go away. I will always carry the weight of feeling like a terrible person, like I don’t deserve anything. I tried and tried and tried to make it seem the opposite. It felt like a mask and a lie, but I told myself to keep lying and eventually it would become true. 

Newsflash: it doesn’t. No amount of love from the perfect relationship can touch it. The trauma still lingers. No amount of crying ceaselessly in the shower after finishing a self-help book will touch it. No amount of self-forgiveness, forgiveness towards those who hurt me, or hearing the birds in the morning will ever, ever make it go away. I am stuck with the sting of my trauma for the rest of my life. It simmers 24/7 for a few months because I manage to suppress it, then it boils over and burns everything it touches. A few mal-intended words in an argument (which the other person does not mean, and never means, and I know this) and I’m stuck in a loop again. I’m imagining myself standing on a bridge while knowing I never would, even though I wish I had the strength to. 

I have decided not to have children because I know I would become my parents. And I refuse to do to someone else what they did to me. They say that motherhood is all about sacrifice, and that is mine. 

I’m sorry if this seems dreary. These are thoughts I don’t usually say out loud, because they’re ugly and off-putting. I don’t talk about them to my friends or family because I don’t want pity and I don’t want to guilt trip anyone into walking on eggshells around me. This burden is mine and mine alone.

Here are a few perks that many employees no longer value as much in 2025:

**1. Free Snacks and Coffee:**  
While once a popular perk, free snacks and coffee are now often seen as minor or even wasteful compared to benefits that impact wellbeing or work-life balance.

**2. Rigid Office Hours:**  
Strict 9-to-5 schedules are increasingly unpopular. Employees prefer flexible hours or hybrid work options that fit their lifestyles better.

**3. Long Commutes Paid by the Company:**  
With remote and hybrid work becoming the norm, commuting perks are less relevant for many.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I am seeking help with a damaged PCB (voltage spike). I got no comments so far in a post I made, this is why I am calling for help here (thanks in advance).   
[Here is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1nchffp/breville_bes870xl_pcb_damaged_after_voltage_spike/) I wrote in the coffee machine subreddit.   
You can [check this for more context](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/help_with_bes870xl_pcb/).  
  
Before jumping into the adventure of soldering (something I have very minimal experience with), I thought it would be a good idea to share my case here and ask:  
Do you think this repair is feasible, or is the damage to the PCB too severe, making replacement the better option?  
I cleaned the PCB, and from what I can tell, these appear to be the only damaged components, as everything else looks okay (image below).

**Damaged components that I believe need replacing:** ZNR1, R39, R37, R103, R19, R30, R104? (not sure about this one)

I’m also not sure about the part in the red circle — it looks like it may have melted. What do you guys think?

For context:  
As soon as I plug the BES870XL machine in:  
\- It seems that the standby mode is failing.  
\- All buttons in the front panel are on, and no matter what I press, nothing happens.  
\- It starts pouring coffee (hot water makes it to the portafilter).  
\- If the hopper bean is in place, it starts grinding instead of pouring coffee.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

You know how I’d just accept that the area around the litter box would feel like a tiny, gritty beach? I’d wear slippers just to avoid that sensation on the hardwood. It was this whole little ritual of sighing and getting out the vacuum again before I even had my coffee.



I remember thinking there had to be a better way, something simple that didn’t involve building a special room for the cat. I pictured those sticky rollers at the entrance of a fancy store, but for a tiny, furry patron. It felt like such a small, silly problem, but it was one of those constant, low-grade annoyances.



Then a friend mentioned she’d started using a textured mat that sits right outside the box. She described it almost like a doormat that works like a trap; the rough surface catches the litter from their paws as they step out. The granules just sort of fall into the grooves instead of bouncing onto the floor.



It was one of those things I never knew I needed until I tried it. The first morning I walked over and didn’t feel that familiar crunch under my feet was a minor victory. It’s not a miracle cure—the cat still has her own ideas—but it cut down on the daily cleanup so much. It just makes that corner of the house feel a little more intentional, a little less like a sandbox.

How did you break out of it?","I recently had to quit my job at Starbucks because my manager was allowing bullying and harassment to occur because she had favoritism for the people doing the bullying. 10 people alone have reported this person and she still works for the company. She has made racist and homophobic comments and my managers did nothing about it. They didn't even speak to her about it. I was also confronted by someone who I reported (I'm a supervisor, it is literally my job) and she shouldn't have known I reported her. Either my manager told her what I said, ruining confidentiality, or the girl that I mentioned earlier. So, I had to leave.

1nnmc1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalBussinessHelp/comments/1nnmc1e/how_does_proximity_affect_local_search_rankings/,How Does Proximity Affect Local Search Rankings?,"Proximity to a user's location has become increasingly important in local search rankings. In fact, it is one of the top factors that influence where a business will show up in search results. As more and more people rely on their mobile devices to find business locations, proximity has become a key element in providing relevant and accurate information to users.

For businesses, this means that optimizing for local search is no longer just about traditional SEO tactics. It also requires strategies that take into account the user's location and proximity. This can include using location-based keywords in content, optimizing for Google My Business, and monitoring your online reviews.

So why is proximity so important in local search rankings? One reason is that it helps search engines provide the most relevant results to users. For example, if someone is searching for a coffee shop nearby, they are more likely to visit one that is in close proximity to their current location.

Another reason is that proximity can help improve user experience. If a business is closer to a user, it is more likely to meet their needs and provide a convenient solution. This can lead to higher engagement and ultimately, higher conversion rates.

1nnmb1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nnmb1p/showcase_the_best_coffee_espresso_machine/,Showcase the best coffee espresso machine Nespresso Vertuo Next worth it,"If you're anything like me, coffee isn't just a morning ritual – it's a lifestyle. I recently got my hands on the Nespresso ENV120BCA, and boy, has it changed my perspective on at-home brewing. Like most caffeine enthusiasts, I want quality, simplicity, and variety. The ENV120BCA swooped in like a hero in rose gold armor. But before committing, let me walk you through the highs and lows of this coffee machine journey.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek and compact design of this espresso machine is an immediate head-turner. It fits neatly on my rather crowded kitchen counter, with room to spare. The rose gold finish is upscale, modern, and surprisingly resistant to fingerprint smudges – a huge win for people like me who hate constantly cleaning appliance surfaces. The minimalistic approach to buttons keeps things visually appealing, and the build feels surprisingly robust for a machine partly crafted from recycled materials. The engineers have done a stellar job blending aesthetics and sustainability into one package.

**Performance and Versatility**  
This coffee machine is more like a barista trapped in a robot’s body. It impressively caters to seven different cup sizes ranging from the potent Ristretto shot to a large, sharable Carafe Pour-Over style. You simply pop in a recyclable Nespresso capsule, and the machine reads the encoded information, adjusting settings accordingly. Whether I needed a quick espresso shot during a break or a larger cup to fuel my evening brainstorming session, this machine had my back. The crema on every cup is pure magic—thick, frothy, and oh-so-luxurious.

**Advantages**  
- Accommodates seven cup sizes for great flexibility.  
- Recyclable capsules score high on sustainability.  
- Convenient one-button operation simplifies mornings beyond belief.  
- Consistent brewing quality with natural crema.  
- Complimentary tasting set included to jumpstart your coffee adventure.  

[Check Nespresso ENV120BCA price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0866qtz3n/)

**User Experience and Technology Integration**  
The machine is fully automated, making the brewing process incredibly seamless—just one button and a few seconds of waiting. On top of that, its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities ensure software updates seamlessly enhance the coffee experience even further. However, I don’t know how often I need these updates, but hey, it’s nice to have! Setting it up was a breeze, and the instruction manual was surprisingly clear. Even my tech-averse mom had no problem making herself a cappuccino during her visit last weekend.

**Disadvantages**  
- Compatible only with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, which limits coffee options if you’re a fan of using ground coffee or other brands.  
- The capsules are on the pricier side, making it a less cost-effective long-term choice for daily drinkers.  
- Occasionally, capsule recognition can falter, requiring a manual reset.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this coffee maker to alternative offerings like the Keurig K-Supreme or Breville Bambino, a few things stood out. The Nespresso Vertuo Next delivers consistently richer coffee with its perfect crema, whereas the Keurig machines struggle to replicate that premium feel. Breville's machines, known for their pro-grade espresso, are a significant step up in quality but come at a much higher price and are more hands-on. If you’re okay limiting yourself to Nespresso’s capsule ecosystem, then this machine nails convenience and quality over competitors. Conversely, Keurig’s broader coffee pod options could appeal to someone less particular about their brew.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This machine isn’t the cheapest, but its features justify the price tag. From automatic capsule ejection to versatile coffee styles, the convenience offered could rival this machine against high-end brewing systems. For casual drinkers who savor flavor and ease of use, it’s worth every penny. However, those looking to cut back on costs may need to reconsider due to ongoing capsule expenses.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nnmamd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nnmamd/ive_automated_50_tasks_heres_what_everyone_gets/,"I've Automated 50+ Tasks, Here's what Everyone Gets Wrong.","Everyone's was talking about automation these days, and I was feeling left out. Seriously, my Twitter feed was full of people showing off their fancy workflows while I was still using almost no automation.  
Therefore I started to learn & automate small tasks.

**My First Attempts Were Messy**

I was using coding tools like [V0 ](https://v0.app/)and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). They're cool for building stuff, but they didn't solve my daily grunt work. I was still drowning in emails, forgetting meetings, and spending hours on boring tasks.

Then I tried [n8n](https://n8n.io/) . Everyone said it was amazing. And yeah, if you know how to code, you can figure it out. But man, it felt like building a rocket ship just to make toast. Every simple thing needed multiple steps, connections, and constant tweaking when something broke.

I spent more time fixing my automations than actually working.

# What Actually Worked

That's when I discovered prompt-based tools. Instead of connecting boxes and writing code, I could just tell the AI what I wanted in normal English.

I started using [BhindiAI ](https://bhindi.io/)for my daily stuff:

* Sorting through emails and writing replies
* Setting up meetings without the back-and-forth
* Updating my project tasks automatically
* Following up with people who went quiet

For my side projects, Clay AI became a game-changer. It finds potential customers for me and gives me their info plus what to talk to them about. No more spending weekends researching leads.

# Other Tools That Actually Help

Here's what I use now for different things:

**For repetitive computer stuff:** I use [Zapier ](https://zapier.com/)for simple connections (way easier than n8n) and Shortcuts on Mac for things like file organizing and quick calculations.

**For content:** I have ChatGPT write first drafts of emails, social posts, and even help brainstorm project ideas. Notion AI helps me clean up my messy notes.

**For scheduling:** Calendly handles meeting bookings, and I use Reclaim.ai to automatically block time for focused work.

**For research:** Perplexity is like having a research assistant. I ask it to find information about competitors, market trends, or technical solutions.

**For social media:** Buffer schedules my posts across platforms, and I use Canva's AI to create quick graphics without spending hours in Photoshop.

**What People Get Wrong**

Most people try to automate everything at once. That's backwards.

Start small. Pick one annoying thing you do every day and automate just that. For me, it was email replies. Once that worked, I moved to the next thing.

Also, don't automate broken processes. If something is messy when you do it manually, automation will just make it messier faster.

And honestly? Sometimes the ""automation"" is just using a better tool. I switched from complex project management apps to simple ones that actually work for how my brain operates.

# The Real Change

I'm not saying I never do manual work now. But the difference is huge. I used to start each day with a list of boring tasks. Now I start thinking about what I actually want to build.

My brain isn't constantly interrupted by ""oh, I need to email that person back"" or ""did I update that spreadsheet?"" Those things just happen in the background.

The best part? Most of these tools are either free or cost less than a coffee subscription. You don't need to be a tech wizard or spend thousands on fancy software.

Just start with one annoying task and make it go away. Then move to the next one.

- I had a grocery shopping worth of 117£ (50+ items) and i only received a 20£ worth of items because the delivery people stole my bags. I was refunded after a lot of support discussion, but they said it was an act of ""goodwill gesture""
- I had drivers deliver my food, and 5 minute before reaching my place, they cancel the order. This happened 4 times. Got refunded, but the time was lost.
- I had drinks spilled almost everytime. Drivers don't tell you it's spilled (or that the bag is destroyed in a part), and they run quckly to the exit while i am stuck with drinks on my floor or on my food. Not sure why restaurants can't find better cups to hold the coffee/soda.
- For other grocery shoppings, items are always missing. 
- In more cases I get annoyed that they have to deliver someone else's order first, so I have to wait a lot for mine, and usually they give me the bag of the other person with the wrong food.
- Support experience is horrible in some cases.
- Drivers do not match the photos 33% of cases and they don't know english.

I will only keep Deliveroo and only order from it in case I get sick. Never had a problem with that platform and their drivers.

Context on why I order this much: I had a habit of working a lot while being in university (job, paid side project + studying for scholarships). Since I did not want to sacrifice my sleep, I sacrificed the cooking time. Now that I am out of uni, I had this habit of ordering food for a while, but I will start cooking again and going grocery shopping, even if I do not have a car.",1,1758547053.0,UberEATS,13,0.53,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Now I miss my manager and the free office coffee.,"Look, I’m not here to give financial advice. Mostly because I clearly have no idea what I’m doing. But if you're new to crypto, please read this before you YOLO your rent money into a coin because a TikTok influencer called it the ""next BTC.""

I got in during the 2021 bull run. Everything was green. I felt like a genius. Dog coins? Yes. Gaming tokens? Absolutely. That weird project that promised to “decentralize teleportation”? Count me in.

Fast forward:

* I learned what a rug pull feels like.
* I learned what *gas fees* are... the hard way.
* And I learned that ""buy the dip"" doesn’t mean ""keep buying every time it drops."" Because sometimes it just keeps dipping. Forever. Like my will to live.

I used to mock banks. Now I miss their boring, predictable interest rates. At least they didn’t vanish overnight with my life savings.

To be fair, I met some amazing people in this space. Learned a ton. But also learned that the phrase “do your own research” often just means “read 30 contradicting posts on Twitter and pray.”

So yeah, crypto is exciting. But it’s also wild, unregulated, and full of memes disguised as investment strategies.

My advice? (Not financial advice™):

* Don’t invest more than you’re willing to see evaporate.
* Don’t trust anyone who says ""this can’t fail.""
* And if someone offers you a “sure thing,” run. That’s what I *should* have done.
* Also, maybe call your mom. She probably misses you.

Anyway, back to applying for jobs and pretending I know how Excel works.

She, in my opinion, was never ready to support children emotionally, but alas, she had me and my older brother. Fast forward a lot of life events (divorce, lots of moving, death), and ultimately, I ended up being me and her living in the same small, cramped room for almost 2 years. My mother, all my life, was never really my mother. I never saw her or myself attached yk? More like sisters or roommates? She worked almost my whole childhood; she had to get a degree to get a good-paying job, and so on. So she was there, but not all the time. I spent a lot of time around my grandparents and everything and experienced a lot of things on my own. But anyway, idk if that is all important. But their power imbalance or a power struggle was hard. It's not like I resent her as a mother, but she started demeaning who I was and what I've been through. (that's how I feel) If someone would make a sly comment like ""what trauma do you have, what issues do you have"" in a mocking tone, she would laugh and agree. This was almost hundreds of occasions where she demeaned what we went through TOGETHER. Funny enough she doesn't believe in the childhood or teen growth experience, nature vs nurture, AND on top of that, she works in early childhood development..... award.... but moving on. We fought A LOT. More than I'd like to admit. We fought A LOT!!!! So much so, I've developed some type of permanent headache. In my early teen years, things went better, but still, nothing was healed. She is VERY immature emotionally, often behaving in a way that's more like a teenage girl than an actual mother. If I make her upset, she'll take my phone and a laptop (I need them both for college). If I don't clean up after everyone when they make a mess, then just yell to the skies about how ungrateful ""people"" (me) are. And once I confronted her and asked why she preaches but never does anything, and she told me how dare I ask if she could clean her own house if she was the one paying the bills, and so on. It seems silly to be offended that someone is asking you not to leave your coffee station filthy, or leaving cabinets open of cooking huge breakfast before work and leaving a dirty kitchen. But yea, I was in the wrong. This one time she kept calling my name over and over, and I know im in the wrong for this, but she KNEW I had bad cramps but made me hand over my devices because somehow that's distracting me and I need to clean the kitchen. So she takes my devices and is upset iewht me. One thing that's very unfortunately common is her never seeing me where im at. She never meets me where I am. Im 18 but she can't understand or see that im chronically depressed, im overly burnt out, and im just tired (lots of health changes and diagnosis this year especially). Ill probable come off as bratty but I need everyone to understand there is A LOT of very complex trauma and nuance to my situation. I love my mom, but I wouldn't die for her. I love her but there is a lot I wouldn't do for her and that makes me sad. She is the only present parent I have but she Is the most absent. She is SO emotionally absent it's like talking to someone who's never had any experience loving. I understand I was in the wrong when I didn't answer her call or come to her, cause islam teaches ""obey your parents, your mother 3xs"" but idk. She is demanding respect and EVERYTHING she has never taught me. shell be like ""what do I always says?"" and im like girl idk. She always point out what I do wrong or what I need to improve. Shell constantly tell me im not ready for certain things (mostly marriage or maintaining certain things) and I agree I need to grow, but she has this ""thats embarrasing you don't have that"" tone and its like okay.... Shell always say ""well I got married at 16 so I don't really understand that, or I don't really relate to that cause I was wayyyyyyyyy more mature than you were at that age"" and blah and blah and blah, And im just like all this talk of growth and maturity and our relationship has nothing to show of you highly praised intellect. It's so draining to exist honestly. I have no one to talk to, I feel so sheltered and capped, and im leaning towards just obeying her every whim without listening to myself. Its a lot more to it I think and ill most definitely delete this later cause its sound dumb but yea.

P.s this seems a little vague to offer any advice so whatever. Any women who grew up with single parents ever dealt with this? Also this is effecting my relationships. I have friends but I feel I heavily trauma dump on them. they don't say I do and im constantly begging them to tell me if im doing to much. like ill tell them bout my day and a whole other stream of things regular friends talk about but I can't help but feel its overbearing. I try to always ask about them first and always ask and ask and ask about their lives things they are going through. one of my close besties said she wished I told her more an didnt hold back, but idk what that means I feel like I tell a lot. and another on (I only have 3 best friends) told me sh feel sweet vent and share hardships equally and to not feel burdened, and my 3rd friend is kinda like my humor joke friend but were close and she suspects something is going on and im just o distraught and down wanna tell her. I sent out a message to all 3 of them (separately) asking if they could forgive me while I work through something offline, which later I deactivated my socials and they were more worried esp the 3rd friend but anyway. I just feel I down know how to show them true friendship lov,e or that I don't know how to be there for them. I don't wanna keep going to the same people for advice and to vent cause ik that's draining but idk. All the things my mom says makes me think im too overbearing for anyone to understand.

It was a for-profit farm, as all the proceeds from the farm produce went to the owner. I got food and accommodation for my work. I am still not sure if I was in the wrong in this one specific situation so I decided to make 
this post and let reddit decide. 
The accomodation that my host provided was a little kitchen and a bathroom, but nothing was working properly and I was sleeping outside in a tent. My host was buying me most of the food I ate.
At the start, it wasn’t bad, I did hard work in the mornings for about 4 hours, but basically had the remaining time of the day free. Some days I did only 2 hours with lots of sitting around waiting for orders from my boss/host. After each workday we agreed upon what time we’ll start the next day. While I was usually ready at the agreed time, my boss was late almost every time while I was just waiting around, but I didn’t mind it too much. At some point when the work tasks started to be more vague and the nature of the work more relaxed we also incorporated a morning coffee with our boss before starting work, which was their idea.

Then one day, when I was ready at the given time but hadn’t eaten breakfast. As my boss wasn’t there yet, I decided to quickly make breakfast and eat. This was like 10 minutes after the time we were supposed to start working. As I was in the middle of eating my breakfast, my boss came and greeted me as usual. Then they were doing some stuff (I was waiting for them to tell me the plan for the day while I was eating). Finally, they looked at me and scolded me that they expected me to be ready at the hour we agreed upon, that this is the second time I was late and they expect me to be ready to work when they arrive. I quickly finished the breakfast, washed dishes and then waited for them to tell me what to do, which they proceeded to do after about 5 mins. When I recieved the orders, I got up immediately and started working. The whole day they were talking to me a bit unpleseantly, there was again lots of sitting around waiting for them to tell me what to do. 
This made me feel a bit off about the whole experience, as I began to feel like I am being a bit used and not treated too well. For example, when my boss had friends or family over at the accomodation where I was also staying, they would always leave dishes on the table. But in the morning, I was expected to have it all clean, so of course I did the dishes, but no one ever acknowledged that. 

So am I the asshole for not being ready to work and still eating breakfast when my boss arrived at the farm?",2,1758546728.0,AmItheAsshole,14,0.75,False

I used to think that a bit of grit at the bottom of the cup was just part of the deal, like the crumbs at the bottom of a chip bag. My morning brew always had this final, surprising layer of sediment that made the last sip more of a chore than a pleasure. It felt like a small, daily imperfection I had to accept.



Then, a friend who’s a bit of a coffee enthusiast was over one morning and watched me make a pot. He didn't say anything at first, just observed with a quiet smile. When I poured us each a cup, he finally asked, ""You ever try letting it sit for just thirty more seconds after you press it down?"" It was such a simple suggestion, but it had never occurred to me.



The real trick, he explained while warming his hands on his mug, isn't in the pressing, but in the waiting. After you push the plunger down, all those fine grounds need a moment to settle peacefully to the bottom. If you pour immediately, you agitate them right back into your cup. It’s a lesson in patience, really. That tiny pause makes all the difference.



So now, after I press, I use those thirty seconds to grab a spoon or just look out the window. It’s a small ritual that transformed my mornings. The coffee is noticeably smoother from the first sip to the very last, which now feels just as rewarding as the first. It’s funny how such a minor adjustment can solve something that felt like an unsolvable puzzle.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nnlygr,https://i.redd.it/77alp2h5tpqf1.png,A burned-out 40-year-old haunted by a fatal mistake stumbles into a broken gaming den called CHESSNUTTS and becomes an abrasive conscience for a clan of young online grandmasters who worship rankings the way others worship God — until his secret threatens to break them all.,"Bridge08 found CHESSNUTTS by accident—literally. He was following the wrong street home and the wrong kind of night, ducking rain and old neon, when a flicker of blue letters buzzed: CHESSNUTTS. The bulb in the first H was blown, so it read like a joke. He laughed at that, which is how he let himself go in.

Inside smelled like tape glue and burnt coffee. The place had been a meeting hall once—an AA circle, maybe—then repurposed by someone with a taste for flame-retardant couches and bad posters: Fischer in a halo, Stalin in a crusty frame, a naked Snap-On girl tucked like a sacrament above the snack table. There were ten flat-screens—five back to back—each glowing with chess boards as if they were altars. No physical sets. No clocks you could wind. No one used real names. Everyone had handles and ELO scores like a credit rating in a ruin economy.

Bridge08 sat on a sagging couch and pretended not to notice the way the room measured the new meat. He watched a kid with a hoodie like a crown—Tony77—ruling the signup clipboard like a petty king. Tony’s skin was still soft with privilege. He had the easy authority of someone who didn’t need to explain why he belonged in any room.

“Handle?” Tony asked, pen poised.  
“Bridge08,” he said. He liked the cadence of it. It was an online name that sounded like a bridge you cross when you have no intention of going anywhere.

“ELO?” Tony asked. He said it like a greeting.  
“1137,” Bridge08 said, and the room did what rooms of men do—it evaluated, sorted, spat a little laugh like a judgment. The boys on the screens didn’t get to be gentle. They were clean and precise as code and cruel about it.

“You here to play or to preach?” one of them called, glass fogging on a vape. Bridge08 smiled thin, accepted the laugh. He wasn’t shy. He liked a room that knew how to bite.

What the place wanted—what everyone there worshipped with the soft intensity of late-night devotion—was ladder movement. Moves were currency. Ranks were maps of the self. Wins were small, crystalline coronations. Losses, public demotions. They lived inside those numbers. Even the couch-drunk kids who drank Slurpees had ELOs with decimals and resentment.

Bridge08 didn’t know much about the complex algebra of chess ratings. He knew grief. He knew how numbers could feel like nails in the coffin of your life. He’d been cheap at betting on himself. He’d been better at being loud and right and wrong in all the wrong rooms. He’d been something else once—a city worker with a license for driving that used to pay the rent. And then one night he’d made a stupid calculus about green lights and one shot too many. The calculus hadn’t worked. A minivan went quiet. A kid called Daria was folded into broken glass and an airbag and a grief that might last the rest of her life. Police had taken his license. The threat of court hung above him now like an unspent storm.

That story sat in his chest like a bone. It was the rust under his ribs. He let the boys see the jagged edge of it, because if there’s one thing chess kids hated, it’s someone who looked them in the mirror without a respectably high ELO.

“Why are you here?” they asked in variations—taunt, curiosity, bored cruelty. He told them, because he could tell. Because it was a good fight to shove at them: the game was small, and life kept getting eaten in the margins. He told them with a voice that didn’t soften for pity.

He told them about three green lights—the lie his body had told itself the night the van rolled—how the mother had screamed, how a child’s shoe had skittered across the wet pavement. He said it like confessing a sin or an accident he could not unmake. He wanted them to hate him, to pity him, to be real with him. He wanted them to stop pretending that a pin on a screen was armor.

They didn’t know what to do. One of the high ELO boys, a narrow man with the grammar of algorithms, said, “You carry guilt like a position. Make an endgame of it.”

He called himself Sal, and he said it like a proposition. Bridge08 wanted to throw the table at him.

“You’re confusing a rating with a life,” Bridge08 said. “You think a number proves anything about your worth. You think if you own the room, you own yourself. You don’t. You’re building a religion of checks and moves. You’re altar boys with keyboards.”

“You sound old,” Tony said, which is what twenty-something means when they try to sound wise. “You sound drunk.”

Bridge08 laughed, then stopped. “I was drunk.”

They gave him a match—he lit it. He’d be their conscience, for a while, at least. He cracked jokes until it was too tired to be anything but true. He shouted truth until they graded him as another flavor of entertainment. He pushed the ones who were publicly gentle to prove they weren’t ghosts in the shell of social media bravado. He offered insults that were honest rather than clever.

At night, Tony’s uncle—the one who smelled like cigarettes and old coins—would come downstairs with a whiskey. He’d sit with Bridge08 in a tiny kitchen upstairs, the kind of kitchen that had been used to roll bills or promises, and tell stories about Tony’s mother. She was a currency trader, frenetic and brilliant, a woman who had smashed her share of ceilings and left a ledger that meant everything to someone young with nothing. She’d saved like a giant in secret; she’d died before she could teach her son how to be anything but fast. The uncle said the money had been left to Tony at eighteen. He said it with a kind of shame—how the trust held a man like the uncle at the bones while keeping the boy sheltered.

Tony believed, like many young people believe, that the room was a gift. He thought the screens were an altar his uncle set up for him. The uncle let him think that, because why not? The uncle needed the company the room brought. He needed the rhythm of people who came and left. In the little apartment over CHESSNUTTS, whiskey and secrets blurred.

Back downstairs, things escalated the way a small culture does when its absolutes are threatened. Bridge08 called them out more than they liked. He laughed at their expensive contempt for the poor rankings. He took the room’s cruelty like a test, and he failed it more than once. It would have been easy to leave. Instead, he stayed. He chose—ridiculously—to stay and build stakes in their petty world because his outside world had no oxygen and he wanted to show them something they hadn’t yet learned: consequences.

One night, the room’s top player—famous in that little economy—lost spectacularly to someone else. The screen flashed, the laughter was mechanical, and a boy named Victor stood and snarled like an animal with numbers in his teeth.

“You think you’re something?” Victor barked. “You think you can tell us what to do with our lives?”

Bridge08 stood. He smelled of cheap cigarettes and a life spent on rails.

“You fools,” he said gently. “You are building a cathedral of pixels. One day, the power will go out. The servers will be sold. The screens will black. What are you then? Who will tell you you’re a man?”

Silence. Then, from the corner, a laugh—but it was a thin thing. The boys collected themselves, pretended to be amused, like the way people pretend at funerals. They shuffled their cards and their keyboards, and the room kept on playing.

Then, like a plot twist that somebody wrote with a cruel pen, a plain white envelope slid under the door. It landed at Bridge08’s feet as he was leaving, the fuzz of it catching the light like evidence. He picked it up with fingers that had been made steady by practice. Inside was a notice, official and small: a court appearance date. The paper was not a metaphor. It was a summons. The kid Daria’s mother was suing. The state was pursuing restitution. The number in the corner of the summons was large and unforgiving.

On the street, rain had started again. Bridge08 looked up at the neon that hummed CHESSNUTTS in half words. The room behind him laughed, argued, played. They were stubbornly, insistently alive inside their small numbers. He tucked the summons into his jacket like a bone he was still not ready to bury.

“Checkmate,” someone said—the word a dumb chess pun and an omen.

Bridge08 walked away with the sound of the screens behind him, and the knowledge settling like a stone: he’d come to show them what life costs. He’d stayed long enough to learn the part he didn’t bargain for—how the room could hurt you, and how your past could get mailed under a door with a courier’s indifferent efficiency.

He had no plan. He had a summons and a bar of cheap whiskey upstairs and a room full of children who measured themselves by a score that would do nothing for the thing he needed to pay. He had, finally, something that would force him to choose publicly: run, as he had before, into the small deaths that hide in bottles and empty rooms, or sit and make his ruin a lesson, and maybe—if the world was generous enough—make the boys there learn what mercy looked like when it had to cost you something.

The neon buzzed CHESSNUTTS as if spelling the word back into the world. It felt like a challenge. Bridge08 put his hands in his pockets and walked toward the ferry terminal and the hard light at the end of the pier, thinking of Daria’s small shoe and a board where every piece mattered, whether the guys on the screens knew it or not.

He did not know how to win. He only knew he could not play like he had before.",1,1758546366.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

It is street opera, sesame, smoke, ocean spray and history pressing in so close you taste it. Turkey welcomed over 52.63 million international visitors in 2024, up 6.9 percent from 2023, according to RoadGenius and Turkish Statistical Institute data. Revenue from tourism hit USD 61.10 billion that year, a record shift toward appetite and discovery, not postcard perfection.

This is how the walk works. Begin at sunrise, the horizon fragile and new. Simit vendors fling golden loops of sesame bread into eager hands for about USD 0.50 each. Dockside fishermen flip sizzling balik ekmek, grilled fish sandwiches, steam curling into salty air, costing USD 5 for the sandwich near Eminönü as the ferry cries in the distance. Then stuffed mussels, midday treats served from tiny push carts along the water, filled with herbed rice, citrus, spices, about USD 3 a handful but exponential in joy.

Adventure lodges itself in motion. Cross continents with each step. Two feet in Europe, two in Asia. Ferry across the Bosphorus for USD 2-USD 3, ride rooftops over Galata, skateboard steep alleys, haggle in the Spice Bazaar where the weight of cardamom, saffron, and dried rose petal jars feel more valuable than gold. Evening cruises under moonlight cost USD 20-USD 30 and add salt kisses to your shirt collar.

The best season to float through these flavors is spring (April through June) and autumn (September through October). When weather is clement, humidity soft, crowds hesitant enough to let you claim a terrace. Summers burn bright, prices rise, shadows stiffen with heat. Winter, cold and busy with local holidays, can dim the delight. According to GoWithGuide tourism figures Istanbul welcomed over 17 million international visitors in 2023 with growth continuing into 2024.

Food here is urgent. Sip Turkish tea from squat tulip glasses at waterside cafés, USD 1. Balik ekmek stacked high with crisp lettuce, charred fish, lemon at dusk for USD 5. Meze plates dripping with smoked aubergine, yogurt, olives cost USD 8. Strong Turkish coffee, sweet and sharp, USD 2 to set your guts right. Pair the walk with a cold Efes beer at sunset. USD 4-USD 5 but feels like perfect punctuation.

Stay where rooftops catch the last light. Rooms in Old City guesthouses hover around USD 70 per night midweek. Boutique hotels looking over the domes charge USD 150-USD 250 in high season. Galata, Sultanahmet, Karaköy. Your neighborhoods of choices with smells that fight for attention.

Istanbul is not a photo op. It will burn past reservations. The Bosphorus Bites walk hits the senses and lingers in memory. Taste salt. Smell history. Follow the ferry horns. You will wander unsatisfied and full.

1nnlvoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nnlvoz/diet_for_picky_eater/,Diet for picky eater?,"I'll start with some background before I get into my question! So I personally don't have gastritis but my girlfriend of 2 years does, she has since a couple months before we started dating. She watched her diet a bit early on but ended up giving up and asking me not to press her too much about it. We were also in high school and neither of us had jobs, so she didn't really have the opportunity to purchase the foods she needed to effectively change her diet and was pretty limited to whatever her mom made and cheap gas station food. This whole time she's still been dealing with pretty severe stomach pain, heart pain, a lot of burping, etc, but she has gotten used to it. I'm not sure how much her doctors have actually told her about her condition, but I do know she was told not to eat spicy food, caffeine, or super acidic foods, and that the day she was diagnosed she had all of those things haha. The caffeine part isn't too hard because she doesn't really like coffee, but she pretty much exclusively eats spicy food.

Finally getting to my question, I think she could change her diet if I cooked up some meals for her to have every day(only if she agrees to my interference of course). She's a pretty picky eater though and doesn't like a lot of the foods she would be able to eat (chicken, eggs, dairy, she's sort of vegan without the full commitment to it haha). I also want to know how adding flavor to meals would work and how much sodium she could take (I know everyone's body is different but I'm sort of looking for an average just as a starting off point and me and her could adjust based on how she's feeling). Any good meals you guys managed to make with your diet restrictions, excluding poultry and dairy?

1nnlu43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nnlu43/the_great_coffee_conspiracy_and_other_housemate/,The Great Coffee Conspiracy (and Other Housemate Mysteries),"I was ready to declare a full-blown investigation. My morning ritual, sacred and non-negotiable, had been violated *again*. The communal coffee jar, which I’d sworn was half-full just yesterday, was now a sad, empty husk. Honestly, I couldn't believe it. This wasn’t just about the caffeine; it was about the principle. We had a system, or at least, we were *supposed* to.

Our little urban apartment, which I shared with Chloe, Liam, and Maya, usually felt like a pretty chill space. Chloe, our resident artist, was super creative but lowkey lived in her own world sometimes. Liam, bless his hyper-organized heart, was basically our human spreadsheet, tracking everything from utility bills to who used the last almond milk. And Maya, a grad student, was always hustling, either at the library or planning our next spontaneous potluck. We were a good crew, but the shared supplies situation was starting to get… tense.

It wasn’t just the coffee. It was the dish soap that mysteriously vanished after someone cooked a huge pasta dinner, the toilet paper ghosting us on a Tuesday, and the passive-aggressive messages in our ""House Vibes Only"" group chat that were starting to feel less vibes, more thinly veiled accusations. Liam once posted a picture of an empty paper towel roll with just the eye-roll emoji. I'm dead, but also, valid. I knew we all noticed it, but no one wanted to be the one to bring it up directly.

One evening, after I found myself staring at a completely empty olive oil bottle while trying to make dinner – the *second* time that week – I realized we couldn't keep doing this. I messaged the group: ""Hey fam, can we do a quick house meeting tonight after Maya gets back? Just wanna chat about shared stuff."" Surprisingly, everyone was on board.

Sitting around our slightly-too-small kitchen table, it started a little awkward. But then Chloe admitted she often forgot to check what was low, and Maya realized she’d been using a lot more coffee during her all-nighters. Liam, ever the pragmatist, had already done some research. He pulled up an app he’d found for shared expenses and shopping lists. ""Look,"" he said, ""we can just track everything here. Whoever uses the last of something adds it to the list, and we can even set up a shared fund for household essentials."" It felt so simple, yet we’d let it become such a big deal. We agreed to try it for a month.

The change was almost immediate. No more whispered accusations or passive-aggressive emojis. The coffee jar stayed full, dish soap appeared as if by magic, and our group chat returned to actual house vibes, sharing memes and planning movie nights. We even started doing a weekly ""shopping run"" together, which turned into a fun excuse to grab takeout afterward. It wasn't just about the supplies; it was about the relief of clear communication and knowing we were all looking out for each other. We weren’t just housemates anymore; we were a proper team.

As someone who tries to maintain an eco-conscious household, I was keen to test these out. Annoyingly, many so-called ""compostable"" bags tend to rip at the slightest touch or fail miserably at keeping kitchen waste contained. Let me tell you, these bags had a lot to prove in my very chaotic kitchen environment where banana peels, coffee grounds, and the odd scrap of pasta seem to multiply like rabbits.

**Ecological Attributes Stand Out**

One of the features that immediately caught my eye was the certification list. These bags aren't just labeled ""eco-friendly"" as a gimmick. With certifications like ASTM D6400 and OK Compost Home (under European standard EN 13432), it's hard to doubt their environmental integrity. They even follow the standards of the Compost Manufacturing Alliance, which is vital for composting compliance in real-world settings. Knowing they decompose into CO2, water, and biomass within 6–12 months made me feel less guilty about generating kitchen waste. It’s one thing for a product to sound sustainable, but this one really walks the walk.

**Daily Usability and Durability**

Using these compostable trash bags daily, I was a little skeptical about their durability. Compost bags often feel paper-thin, as if they're about to disintegrate the moment you hold them. To my surprise, these came with exceptional tensile strength. I tested them with wet coffee grounds (known for being horrendously messy) and they held up just fine—no leakage or accidental spill disasters. The bags are thick enough, at 0.8 mil, and can handle regular kitchen waste or small bathroom bin trash without tearing. Bonus: the dimensions, 15"" W x 15.7"" H, fit most small countertop or bathroom bins perfectly.

[Check T.FORING 1.2 Gallon Compost Bags price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0db7ysq86/)

**Advantages**

- Certified by multiple organizations for quality and biodegradability
- Sturdy and resistant to tearing, even with heavier or wetter waste
- Perfect size for most small trash cans, making them versatile 
- Made from corn starch and plant-based material, with zero polyethylene

**Pitfalls**

- The bags, once full of food waste, can emit a slight odor—investing in a compost bin with a lid helps minimize this.
- These bags aren’t suitable for larger waste bins since they’re limited to 1.2 gallons.

**Who Benefits the Most?**

For anyone big on home composting, these trash bags are a fantastic choice. They're also perfect for small households, single-person apartments, or city dwellers tight on space but heavy on waste-conscious living. I use them in my kitchen, bathroom, and even for the random disposable waste in my bedroom or living room. If you’re running an office, these could even work for collecting small-scale recyclables. That said, they're not a great fit if you have family-sized waste—larger gallon bags would be more convenient.

**Merits Compared to Market Rivals**

Having tried other compostable bags before, particularly some cheaper brands, it's evident that T.FORING 1.2 Gallon Compost Bags outshine them in quality and durability. Many alternatives either rip upon the slightest stretch or begin biodegrading a bit too early—yes, I've had compost bags fall apart ON the way to the bin. One competitor, for instance, claimed to be compostable but was noticeably weak against wet or liquid waste. Unlike those, these bags hold firm while maintaining their eco credentials. However, premium competitors that offer multi-gallon options might give this a run for its money when size is a concern.

**Value for Money**

Comparing the performance to their price point, these small compost bags offer great value for their quality. They may cost a bit more than the low-tier competitors, but you get a sturdier, greener product that genuinely fulfills its eco-friendly promises. While I'd love slightly more quantity in a roll, the fact it’s 80 bags means one package lasts decently long unless you’re excessively disposing of waste. I think of them as a smart way to spend on something consciously.

1nnlnq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1nnlnq0/am_i_just_another_fool/,Am I just another fool?,"Once I decided to have an affair, I found my AP almost immediately on Ashley Maddison. It was so easy. We spoke multiple times a day. There were FaceTimes, phone calls, daily cute pictures. Then we slowly started having phone sex. It was amazing. He works for an airline so he was always on the road and had hotel rooms so we had a lot of time to talk. He made me feel so important to him. But he seemed to put off an in person meeting. 
The day finally came where we met in person and it was electric. We were all over each other. It was honestly amazing. 

The week after we talked even more. It seemed like our connection just grew and he kept telling me how shocked he was at how amazing we were together. 

Then his wife got some bad medical news. Immediately he shut down. I noticed right away and he said he thought he just needed to focus on his family. I honestly agreed based off how it was affecting him. We agreed I wouldn’t wait on him but once everything thing at home was better, if I was still available, we would talk. 

Two days later he messaged me. Just a normal hello. Nothing flirty. So we began just chatting, almost like friends. Nothing was mentioned about his wife, sex, or affairs. I was honestly confused but just happy to get to talk to him. 

After about two weeks of this his wife got worse news and he said he couldn’t mentally find the time even for a friendship. I felt like I had whiplash but understood. After a bit of time I began the frustrating search for a new AP. I think I was almost self sabotaging because I had hope he would come back. It didn’t help that the process was a lot harder this time. I wasn’t as lucky to find someone so quickly. 

A few weeks after I began looking again he reached out. Again just very occasional chat. No calls, no FaceTime, no flirting. I put aside any search for an AP just waiting each day in hopes to hear from him. I mentioned grabbing lunch, a quick call, and I always was told he’s too busy. Then I have a trip away for the weekend and he all of a sudden says he’s going to try to get a flight to where I’m going. I was confused. Was he just coming to have dinner, were we hooking up? He never mentioned anything. The flight didn’t work out but he called me and immediately began flirting and mentioning how things at home were still a lot but he had needs. This led to phone sex. We ended with him saying he was at the hotel all the next day with nothing to do and he wanted to FaceTime. It never happened. I barely heard from him. When I finally messaged and asked if he wanted to chat he said he was just so busy. 

Then the day I was flying home he was also flying back. He would be at the same airport for about two hours. I asked if he wanted to get coffee and he said he’d be too busy with work. I flew home and heard nothing. Not even asking if I made it home. So I messaged him just to say hi and he quickly said he’s made it back but needed a nap. But he made sure to mention he was off that week and maybe we could get a hotel. 

Again we are back to nothing. Just occasional friendly quick messages and him busy all the time. The hotel was never mentioned again. 
I’m a fool right? I should block him and move on? The thing is, I know this stuff with his wife is real and is genuinely taking a toll on him. But I can’t be the fill in when he is wanting to get off. I need the emotional connection. I need the flirting and the attention too. I’m not getting that anymore. I feel a little used. I feel like this started with good intentions but now I’m just there for when it’s convenient. Even as I write this I realize I’m a fool. If he wasn’t such a honestly great guy it would be easier. 

Do I block him? Do I tell him how I feel? Or do I just ghost out? I don’t want any of those options. I want the romantic guy who couldn’t wait to hear from me.

*Coffee > INCL REMNANTS > Water > BOARD > Brush teeth*

So the way I use this particular alarm is that it is initially inactive because coffee is the first thing I do in the morning but I don't wake up at the same time every day so instead I keep the alarm inactive but the first thing I do after starting the coffee maker is to look at my alarms and I'll see the above alarm.

Seeing this alarm reminds me to set a 3-minute timer which I'll repeat to remind me to drink my coffee (which I need esp if I'm working bc I'll forget to drink) until I'm done drinking my coffee.

The next step reminds me to drink the remaining coffee in the carafe (that continues to empty after the brewing cycle is complete; I need every bit of caffeine, haha).

Once that's done, I fill my ""extra cup of water for the day"" (the water I drink outside meals) and place it on my desk and it becomes it's own physical cue to remind me to drink it throughout the day as I work) and I change the time for the *Coffee > INCL REMNANTS > Water > BOARD > Brush teeth* alarm to 30 minutes from now, which is when it's ""safe"" to brush my teeth bc the acidity in my mouth from the coffee is no longer softening my teeth enamel.

In the meantime, ""BOARD"" reminds me that I can work items from my whiteboard inside that 30 minutes (lest I just squander that whole 30 minutes; thinking that I'm just waiting to brush my teeth, which I will surely do without the ""BOARD"" nudge).

Once the alarm sounds (for the first and only time; unless I legitimately need to snooze it, e.g. to finish up or note where I left off in whatever task I'm performing when the alarm sounds) after the 30 minutes, I can now brush my teeth and move on with my day until the next ""task chain"" alarm sounds.

I also store chains that I don't use every day (I know I can disable them or repeat them on specific days but I don't want to clutter today's alarms with alarms not applicable to today; that said, I WILL keep inactive INFORMATIONAL alarms that apply to today, etc. but I digress...) by scheduling them at 10pm and making them inactive.

I liked an old friend's picture on facebook this morning, we hadn't spoken in 20 years.

She quickly messaged me to say hello and we got chatting, sending several texts back and forth all morning, we still had lots in common.

She said we should catch up and was very enthusiastic. We discussed where we should go and decided on her place for a cheap coffee hang.

I'd already mentioned that we would need to stay outside but hadn't elaborated yet, I just said it was a long story.

When we were actually planning the catch up, I decided it was time to explain why I wanted to stay outside.

I told her that I'm immunocompromised and my first bout with covid was so bad, that I decided to take simple steps to protect myself.

After briefly going over my medical reasons, I ended with these exact words. ""I basically just avoid indoor spaces and wear a mask to protect myself""

That was nine hours ago and she hasn't said a word. I was quite excited to catch up with an old friend, but I don't need people like this in my life.

I'm going to wait a day and ask her what the problem is, but it really feels like I dodged a bullet.",47,1758545418.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,10,0.96,False

Did the whole deal of emptying every cabinet, they sprayed and blew out under the cabinets but didn’t place bait or traps because he said he didn’t see any…….. 

This dude spent the whole time telling me things I’ve learned about Germans is wrong. He said their feces is not like coffee grounds (and that it wouldn’t be on my counters like I’ve found?), they don’t live in microwaves, they aren’t gonna be in my laptop etc. Basically cut me off every time I asked a question to be like that’s not what that is, you’re wrong. Told me they wouldn’t ever travel between these houses cause our walls aren’t connected. Also told me they wouldn’t ever hitchhike in my belongings and I probably picked it up from a store? 

I have no idea what to believe and what to do from here. I feel like I just got charged $250 to be yelled at and told everything I’ve learned about spotting activity and an issue was wrong?

You know that little morning dance, right? One hand is clutching the coffee filter, the other is fumbling for the mug, and your fingers are all damp from rinsing the carafe. The last thing you want to do is touch your phone screen to check if you need a jacket. It always feels like a tiny, modern-day dilemma.



I remember my grandma’s kitchen had a little transistor radio permanently tuned to the weather station. It was just always on, a low hum of forecasts and farm reports. I sometimes miss that simplicity—information just being there in the background, without you having to go and fetch it.



It’s funny how a small thing can change a routine. My partner just placed a compact little sphere on the kitchen counter. At first, I didn't think much of it, but one morning, mid-coffee-pour, I just thought out loud, ""I wonder if it's going to rain today."" And from the corner, a calm voice just answered. No buttons, no searching, no sticky phone screen.



It was one of those small surprises that just makes the start of the day feel a bit smoother. That tiny moment of friction, that wet-handed pause, just vanished. Now, the forecast, my timer, even a quick question about a measurement—it’s all just there, floating in the air between the scent of coffee and the clinking of mugs. It feels less like a piece of technology and more like a natural part of the kitchen’s rhythm.

1nnlfos,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightlossJourney/comments/1nnlfos/i_stopped_dieting_and_built_tiny_daily_wins_lost/,I stopped “dieting” and built tiny daily wins — lost weight without feeling deprived (my 6-month experiment),"I want to share something that worked for me because I got sick of the all-or-nothing approach. For six months I quit “dieting” and instead committed to one tiny, pleasurable change each week. No rules about exact calories, no punishment — just stacking tiny wins that I actually wanted to keep doing.

A bit of background: I’d tried every crash diet and tracking app, and eventually I always burned out. This time I wanted consistency first — not perfection. So I made one small change per week and focused on three things: sleep, movement I enjoyed, and making food taste great without excess.

What I did (examples from my 6-month run):
• Week 1: I stopped buying sugary drinks and replaced them with sparkling water + lime. Tiny pleasure, huge calorie drop.
• Week 3: I added a 10-minute “movement snack” after lunch — a walk, a quick cycle, or 10 minutes of stretching. No gym pressure.
• Week 6: I learned one simple high-flavor, low-effort recipe (roasted veg + spiced chickpeas) and made it once a week. It became my go-to.
• Week 10: I set a realistic bedtime and honored it 5 nights/week. Sleep improved my cravings and energy.
• Week 14: I swapped one snack for a high-protein option that I actually liked (Greek yogurt with a little honey + nuts).

The key: every habit had to be tiny and irresistible — something I’d actually choose instead of feeling forced. If it didn’t stick that week, I didn’t shame myself; I picked another tiny win next week.

Results (what changed for me):

I lost weight steadily (not a dramatic crash) and kept energy steady.

I stopped mentally vilifying foods — I still ate pizza, but less often and with more intention.

I stopped obsessing over daily scale fluctuations. I tracked trends: clothes fit better, mood improved, workouts got easier.

Mini-rules that helped:

No “always/never” rules — permit treats; schedule them so they don’t derail you.

Pick habits you’d actually enjoy — flavor, movement, or rest that’s pleasant.

Design your environment — make the easier choice the default (drinks in the fridge, fruit on the counter).

Celebrate micro-wins — one extra walk, one good night’s sleep = progress.

Two-week patience rule — try a tiny habit faithfully for two weeks before deciding it “doesn’t work.”

If you want something new to try: the “80/20 micro-swap” — keep 80% of your normal life but swap 20% each week with a tiny habit (replace one snack, add one 10-minute movement, swap one cup of coffee with herbal tea, etc.). It’s easy to do and doesn’t feel like punishment.

I’m not a coach or doc — just someone tired of quick fixes. If you’re burned out by the usual advice, give tiny, pleasurable changes a run for 4–8 weeks and see what adds up. Happy to share exactly what I ate or my weekly checklist if anyone wants it.

1nnleyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1nnleyg/my_gerd_was_soy_allergy_histamine_overload/,My GERD was soy allergy + histamine overload.,"I've been lurking here often because reading other peoples stories can be helpful in trying to find some comfort with GERD ruining your life. So now when I've been pretty much cured, I make this post because something similar can happen to someone else.

I've had acid reflux since I was 20. Probably caused by stress and ibuprofein (migraine and endometriosis makes you eat them like candy). I managed with Rennie and such, it could be gone for years at times, then activated again. I  knew I couldn't eat anything with capsicum and sometimes I had to stop drinking coffee for a time, but others it wasn't bad and I could live normally.

10 years ago I went vegan. I had also a very stressful life situation. Constant reflux, at this point it is GERD because it is daily. All usual triggers were my triggers. I stopped being vegan because my diet got so damn difficult as it was, and took dairy back to menu. But, I also kept soy in my diet this whole time because I do not eat meat or fish. I also replased dairy with soy every time it was possible. 

I went to doctor, zero help. ""It is not dangerous, just unpleasant, here is a recipe for Somac"". I told the doctor that I won't take PPI, period. They just made me more ill and did not help at all. At least I got tested for celiac disease and HPylori, both negative. So I kept trying to manage the reflux with diet.

Then one day, two years ago, I woke up with a sore throat and realised the shit hit the fan and now I had a throat reflux. I had all the classic symptoms, but I NEVER had nose drip or mucus formation. I took supplements, I took Aloe, I drank chamomile tea, I took Pepcid and Gaviscon, I kept even tighter diet. Pepcid actually helped some, because tadaa, it is a histamine blocker! I took enzymes every evening, and that helped some. I followd Dr. Kaufmann's acid reflux diet to the T, and I still had sore throat and face pains. **At this point I never had stomach pain or heartburn, thanks to the corrective measures I took against the GERD-symptoms.** 

Sometimes I noticed I had flu-like symptoms, and I sneezed a lot, and STILL I didn't count 1+1 = 2, to realise it happened right after I had eaten my lunch or dinner. My history with reflux, and my symptoms being so classic GERD and LPR, just kept me blinded. For example, if I drank a cup of coffee, I lost my voice. My throat pain was one sided which is classic LPR. 

Then, a month ago I saw a post here in Reddit about LPR having a connection with histamine intolerance. Taking DAO (diamine oxidace) might help. I was ready to try anything (save going to another doctor because I could not afford to go to private sector and public sector is just useless here right now). DAO is an entzyme that is used to metabolize histamine. 

So iHerb it is ( you can't even get DAO in my country) and I got a Life Extension DAO. Took one capsule every day. After two days my throat got better, I also realised my nose is not stuffy anymore. I also slept better, did not wake up three times a night, only once. Then the throat pain came back with a vengeance, my whole throat was burning, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW, I REALISED I GOT STUFFY NOSE AFTER EATING TOFU. Finally my thick brain managed to produce the realisation that I actually might have either a food allergy, or histamine intolerance. Histamine has a role in producing stomach acid, and too much histamine in your system can lead to too much acid.

I decided to do a test to eliminate the usual allergenics, starting from soy because it was easiest to drop. I also took DAO now twice a day. Three days and I was cured. It was a week ago. It is insane how fast I got better. I'm not 100% yet, but I have zero pain. I can eat a youghurt now, something I haven't eaten in half a year because it burned my throat.

I still take one DAO before lunch because the long exposure to soy caused histamine overload in my body, and it has to be cleared out but I don't think I have histamine intolerance and this is soon resolved because I don't eat anything with soy anymore. 

So if you have GERD symptoms that are resistant to everything and no physical reason can be found, food allergy is one thing to concider. I've never been allergic to any food item in my life and I'm not exactly young, so it just didn't occure to me that actually I might be allergic to something I eat. And when I introduced this new item to my diet, soy, it just didn't compute in my head that it was the sole reason for all my misery.

I know how horrible GERD is. LPR is hell. I wouldn't wish it to my worst enemy because I'm not that evil. This disease takes so much energy from you, and then there is the worry of getting cancer because of it one day. So I hope my experience with it will help someone.",11,1758544970.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

What’s fucked is that I can easily go 5 or so days without it if I go on a family or friend trip. This is because I have been hiding my smoking habit from everyone I love, and here I am, admitting why I have to use a throwaway. No one knows how much I smoke or that I even do and I don’t know how I have been able to hide it so well, but I’m disgusted with myself and hope I can one day forgive myself. 

I don’t want to wake up one day and have my life resemble some of the tragic stories I read on here as I am a long time lurker.

If anyone else feels really alone in their journey, please feel free to reach out. This will be my dedicated account to quitting. 

I’ve tried the patch a few times but for fucks sake why can’t they make a better adhesive. I haven’t tried gum, and I’ve been resisting the Car book, maybe because deep down, I fucking love to smoke but the shame and disgust I feel, plus the deep fear of illness and death scare me too much.

I used to feel like had little to live for, and sometimes with the state of the world I still feel that way and so I smoked like a chimney and drank like a fish (no longer a drinker which is great? but every other aspect of my life has become everything I ever wanted it to be and I constantly feel physically and mentally like shit over how much I want to quit but seemingly can’t. 

I once read on this sub how someone lived the first half of their life being a heavy smoker and now they want to know what it would be like to live the second half of their life as a non smoker. I want to be someone who wakes up and goes for a run, not picks up a cigarette and chain smokes with their coffee (as fucking nice as that sounds right now, god damn it)

I’m here and I’m trying and the patch is on, it’s day one. I will not smoke. I’m even having a coffee and instead of smoking with my coffee, I’m writing my feelings out.

She didn't even tell me, I found out by an announcement on Facebook. There were a lot more things that had happened previous to this which was making me think perhaps we'd grown apart, or we were just in different places or whatever. We'd had a falling out not long after her wedding too, but whilst I was debating cutting her off at that point, I found out I was pregnant and it was twins. I was THRILLED. I told Julia, who honestly had hardly any reaction at the time, but then I unfortunately lost both of them at separate times within the pregnancy \[October 2022\].

  
I have been grieving of course and I'm working on it. I have PTSD around pregnant people or co-workers, and I'm fully aware that I'm not 100% over it or finished dealing with it all, but I'm in therapy. In May 2023, which was my babies due date, I found out Julia was heavily pregnant \[26 weeks\] through a Facebook post that she had put on, announcing the pregnancy and subsequent baby gender reveal. I was FLOORED. Not only did I not know she was pregnant, I wasn't even invited to the gender reveal party. I asked my husband if he knew, as some of our mutual friends were in attendance, and he had no idea either. I was obviously hurt, disappointed and damn right shook. I broke down, in the kitchen, found by my then five year old daughter. It almost sent me to be sectioned, I couldn't believe the betrayal.

  
I'll give a full story in another post, explaining everything further as to what lead me to cut her off before this etc.**\]**

  
**ANYWAY, on to the title**

It's been almost three years since I lost the twins, and therefore almost three years since I cut Julia off.

Since cutting her off, I've been healing and trying to move on with my husband and daughter. We're doing great, my husband is just about to start his own dream business and I am doing extremely well at work. Our daughter is perfect, I know I am biased, but she is. I honestly, couldn't be luckier with my foundation.

  
I've also noticed that I actually like who I am now, without Julia.

  
A couple of weeks ago, our third (mentioned in the top, there were three of us before it dropped down to just Julia and I) lets call her Harriett, reached out to me on Facebook noticing that Julia and I weren't friends anymore. We reconnected and although I was very hesitant at first, given my history with Julia, its as if the ten years we drifted apart never even happened. We met up for drinks, dinner and I've even introduced her to my husband and daughter. Harriett doesn't have a spouse, she was engaged previously (which I knew, as Julia had told me) and revealed to me that she is actually infertile. I was devastated for her. With her sharing, I explained the whole loss I had been through and the subsequent dropping of Julia done whilst I was at the height of grief. Harriett told me she wasn't surprised at Julia's actions and I asked her to elaborate.

  
Harriett told me that when we stopped speaking, about 10+ years previous, it was because of Julia. Julia had been purposely leaving out Harriett with all plans we were making etc. and didn't even give her my new mobile number (I had to change it due to my ex, again thats another story) and that's basically why Harriett totally dropped off my radar.

  
Thats not all though... Julia had been periodically in touch with a mutual friend of Harriett, updating how I was doing and everything. For years. She had shared the news about my new boyfriend (now husband), my pregnancy with my daughter, my planned wedding and most of all.... how much she disapproved and HATED my now husband.

 

**More background, sorry! \[**In the beginning of my relationship with my husband (I'm not proud okay...) but I was the other woman. I didn't ask him to leave his ex or anything, I am younger than my husband and bare in mind, this was around 9-10 years ago, so I was young and stupid. My headspace was ""its not my relationship, I'm just in it for a bit of fun"". We started as friends with benefits and after about a year he left his girlfriend for me. Again, I was FLOORED, I'd been trying to date other guys (nothing intimate, just coffee and getting to know you type dates) but kept coming back to him. I finally confronted, that yes, I'm in love with him. Flash forward, we went official and I got pregnant. Soon after, he proposed. We're now happily married with an eight year old daughter and I couldn't be happier. Of course, his ex absolutely ***despises me***. I get it, I would hate me in that situation. And again, I'm NOT proud of how it all happened. But, it is what it is and we're so happy now. It was pretty rough in the beginning, with his ex and all however.**\]**

  
I asked Harriett if she had more details from her mutual friend about this, and Harriett introduced me to the mutual friend, lets call her Sarah \[31F\]. Sarah had TONS of messages to show me. Harriett, Sarah and I all went to Harriett's place one night, got some wine and discussed fully. It was like we were decrypting a murder mystery. Sarah told me (and had supporting evidence) that Julia was the one who told my husbands ex about everything about the affair.

  
Don't get me wrong, like I said, it was rough in the beginning. His ex sent me a HUGE message saying I had ruined her life and how dare I and that I was nothing but a child. He'd be running back to her in no time etc. etc. I had major trust issues, I had her in my head and her family and friends coming for me. It got so bad, I was terrified that one day I was going to come home to ""SLAG"" spray painted on my front door. That never happened thankfully.... but you can get where I am coming from. The ex got so bad, we had to take a restraining order out against her. I figured she just had her friends watching me or something like that, but I never suspected the eyes were so close to me.

  
Anyway, Julia didn't just stop at the affair, she was feeding her everything. She told his ex where I lived, where we were moving to, how far along I was, where I was looking at for wedding venues etc. Every small thing I told Julia, Julia fed it back to her. During my pregnancy with my daughter, I got very sick \[29 weeks\] and it was touch and go whether my daughter was going to live. Whilst in my hospital bed, I got a message from an unknown number saying ""I hope you baby dies"" which I KNEW was the ex. Now I know how she knew all of this.

  
I consulted my husband and told him all of this and he was floored also, he said out of everyone, he never suspected her. We of course, had our theories, even stretching to my sister in law being the culprit which lead me isolating myself from family events.

  
I'm so heartbroken. On the one hand, I wish I never found out, but on the other, I want her to know that I know. I'm so mentally exhausted at all of this, and I'm even keeping myself away from Harriett and Sarah now too out of fear that they might betray me also.

  
More therapy for me now I think.

  
Thanks for reading, sorry its such a long post. I just needed to get this out somewhere.

* Parking must be a problem at places like Manek chowk and law garden

I’m going on 12 years of heavy smoking, in the past easily a pack to pack and a half, and I hate myself every day for it. I have tried quitting many times but usually can’t get past day 3. What’s fucked is that I can easily go 5 or so days without it if I go on a family or friend trip. This is because I have been hiding my smoking habit from everyone I love, and here I am, admitting why I have to use a throwaway. No one knows how much I smoke or that I even do and I don’t know how I have been able to hide it so well, but I’m disgusted with myself and hope I can one day forgive myself. 

I don’t want to wake up one day and have my life resemble some of the tragic stories I read on here as I am a long time lurker.

If anyone else feels really alone in their journey, please feel free to reach out. This will be my dedicated account to quitting. 

I’ve tried the patch a few times but for fucks sake why can’t they make a better adhesive. I haven’t tried gum, and I’ve been resisting the Car book, maybe because deep down, I fucking love to smoke but the shame and disgust I feel, plus the deep fear of illness and death scare me too much.

I used to feel like I had little to live for, and sometimes I still feel that way and so I smoke like a chimney and drank like a fish (no longer a drinker which is great) but every other aspect of my life has become everything I ever wanted it to be and I constantly feel physically and mentally like shit over how much I want to quit but seemingly can’t. 

I once read on this sub how someone lived the first half of their life being a heavy smoker and now they want to know what it would be like to live the second half of their life as a non smoker. I want to be someone who wakes up and goes for a run, not picks up a cigarette and chain smokes with their coffee (as fucking nice as that sounds right now, god damn it).

I’m here and I’m trying and the patch is on, it’s day one. I will not smoke. I’m even having a coffee and instead of smoking with my coffee, I’m writing my feelings out. The patch I have at 21mg doesn’t feel like it does anything. I’m on the name brand nicoderm stuff. If anyone has any better recommendations for patches let me know.

I’m originally from South America . My mom was in medical school but sadly passed away from cardiac arrest when she was only 26 and I was 4, before she could graduate. That loss shaped a lot of who I am.

I came to the U.S. to work with kids, and against all odds, I was accepted into nursing school. I’m studying full-time now, paying out of pocket. It hasn’t been easy with no insurance, lots of stress, and recently I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. My doctor recommended I get checked, but I just can’t afford it right now.

At the coffee shop where I work, a woman who comes in regularly was wearing an Oura ring. I asked if it was worth it and told her a bit about my situation. This week, out of the blue, she offered to buy me one , and even ordered the sizing kit.

The timing couldn’t have been better. I’d just been diagnosed with IBS from juggling work and nursing school, and her kindness completely lifted me. I still can’t understand how someone can be so generous to someone they barely know.

I hope that one day, when I’m a nurse, I’ll be able to pay that forward to someone else.

I’d also love your advice: when she comes back to the coffee shop, I’d like to give her a little thank-you gift. Nothing big, just something thoughtful to show how much it means to me. Do you have any ideas?

I’ve narrowed it down to these 3 ideas:

1. **Loaded Spuds:** Spud bros style baked potatoes stuffed with toppings. Afaik, only Lahore has this rn.
2. **BYOB (Build Your Own Bowl):** Customizable bowls. I know a couple ppl in Isb alr doing this tho so not sure if ppl want more of it.
3. **Bagels on the Go:** Fresh bagels w/ fillings + coffee/iced drinks. More like a grab-and-go setup.

Also just to clear it up, it’s not gonna be some unhygienic dhabba type scene😅 I’m going for clean, a bit cutesy and something you wouldn’t mind snapping a pic of lol.

1nnl50m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1nnl50m/why_the_stand_up_pouch_dominates_snack_and_coffee/,Why the Stand Up Pouch Dominates Snack and Coffee Aisles,"When you stroll through the snack or coffee aisles of any store, one packaging trend stands out – the stand-up pouch. Its sleek, upright design doesn’t just look appealing; it’s revolutionizing the way brands deliver freshness, convenience, and sustainability to customers. But what exactly makes this package such a standout favorite?

First and foremost, stand-up pouches offer **unmatched versatility**. Whether it’s crunchy trail mix, gourmet coffee beans, or even dried fruits, this packaging adapts to a variety of textures and product types. The flexible material molds around the contents, minimizing air pockets and optimizing shelf space. That means more products on the shelf and less wasted packaging material.

Another winning feature is the **resealable zipper**. Consumers love convenience, and the ability to open and reseal a bag keeps snacks and coffee fresher for longer. No need for clips or transferring contents to other containers. The resealable function not only prolongs shelf life but also boosts customer satisfaction by maintaining flavor, aroma, and texture – especially important for sensitive products like coffee.

**Portability** is another big win. Compared to bulky jars or boxes, stand-up pouches are lightweight and compact. This makes them ideal for on-the-go snacking or tossing into a bag for a day out. And let’s not forget – the upright position also enhances **visibility on the shelf**, making it easier for consumers to spot their favorite products at a glance. The large front-facing surface offers ample space for vibrant, eye-catching designs that attract attention and communicate key product details clearly.

On the sustainability front, these pouches score high marks. Many are now made using fewer materials than rigid packaging, which reduces waste. They also take up less space during shipping, lowering transportation emissions and costs. Brands seeking to lessen their environmental impact are increasingly turning to this efficient format.

At the heart of this packaging evolution is the **stand up pouch**, a quiet hero in modern retail. Its blend of functionality, aesthetic appeal, and eco-friendliness has earned it a prime spot in snack and coffee aisles everywhere. As consumer preferences continue to shift toward convenience and sustainability, it’s no surprise this pouch continues to rise – standing tall in more ways than one.",1,1758544201.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1nnl4el,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1nnl4el/tipping_the_traditions_and_rules_in_france_and/,Tipping : the traditions and rules in France (and most of Europa),"There are numerous threads about tipping in France and Paris, with the emergence of new methods that resemble scams. This deserves clarification.

Tipping is an old and established French tradition. When the service is good and the product is good (whether in a restaurant or a bar), it involves leaving a few cents, often just the change. In truly special situations, if you are very satisfied, you can leave a few coins or an extra bill. So far, I don't think anyone is lost. But:

\* Tipping is never obligatory, even socially. You leave one, or not, as you wish. No tip shaming; it's shameful for the establishment.

\* A tip is not asked for, not even suggested. The server must offer change, which you should decline if you wish with a regal ""Thank you, keep the change.""

\* You can also leave a little change on the table, but with the increasing number of robberies, this is done less and less.

\* A tip is not calculated in %, but in euros.

\* In France, servers are paid like all other employees. Tips are paid in addition to a salary at least equal to the minimum wage (€1,426.30 per month).

\* You don't tip with a debit/credit card. You give cash. If necessary, go to the nearest ATM to get some money. Machines that offer American-style ""tips"" should be avoided. I always cause a scandal, and I urge you to do the same.

\* These traditions are more or less the same throughout Europe, with a few variations. For example, cutlery, bread, and water are not included in Italy. But the service, however, is!



Finally, a quick reminder: in France, if you order something (even just a coffee), tap water must be provided upon request, good, fresh, and drinkable. If you eat, cutlery, tap water, and bread are also provided.

Chapter 16: Returns.

Earth, August 24, 2115.

Exactly 18 years and 25 days had passed since Battle Group ""Arrow"" left Earth's orbit. Now, it had returned after a victorious battle.

The office of the Grand Admiral of the Guard, Marcus Thorne, was the embodiment of the new world. It was devoid of luxuries or art. The only adornment in the ascetic, metal room was a gigantic, holographic tactical map of the Solar System, gleaming with thousands of icons symbolizing ships, defense stations, and military outposts. This was the altar before which Thorne worshipped his one and only god: power.

Rear Admiral Volkov, still in his worn, battle-scarred uniform, stood in the middle of the office. His face was purple with rage, and the tension around him almost crackled in the sterile air. He had just left the deck of his legendary ""Ivan the Terrible,"" and instead of pride, he felt only a burning anger.

""Damn it, Marcus! I turn on the television to see what home looks like, and I see propaganda like something out of North Korea!"" his voice, accustomed to barking orders over the roar of cannons, now trembled with fury. ""It’s a theater! Some puffed-up peacock, Alistair Finch, and that fanatic Vance, talking about 'sacred scars' and 'genetic destiny'! What have you done to this world?! What has your government done?!""

Thorne stood in silence at the map's control console, his back to Volkov. His posture was rigid, almost motionless, as if he were suppressing every reaction by sheer force of will.

""Have you lost your fucking mind?!"" Volkov continued, stepping closer. Each footstep echoed in the tomb-like silence. ""I have the perspective of someone who said goodbye to a halfway normal world! There were disputes, politics, but there was freedom! And I've returned to some totalitarian nightmare where children recite war doctrines on the streets! My people… my officers, who fought and bled for nearly two decades, are looking at all this and they don't understand. We fought for Earth, not for this… this labor camp on steroids!""

Thorne finally turned around slowly. His face looked older, despite the nanites. It was not how Volkov remembered it; it was marked not by age, but by the terrible weight of decisions.

""I know, Volkov… I know,"" he said quietly, his voice devoid of arrogance, filled only with a bottomless exhaustion. ""Do you think this is what I wanted? I had to. I had to accelerate the fleet's construction. I had to increase productivity by a thousand percent. I had to silence the malcontents and traitors of Earth…""

""Thorne! What the hell are you talking about?! We won the civil war against the loyalists! There were no traitors!""

""Weren't there?"" Thorne raised an eyebrow. ""Yes, we defeated their fleet. But ideas are more durable than armor. After the first five-year plans, after the drastic lowering of living standards for the entire population and the complete transformation of the economy to a war footing, discontent arose. Riots in the factories. Sabotage. People wanted their comforts back, their TV shows and cheap food, while the axe of the Plague hung over us. I had to stifle it. I had to give them a new enemy and a new religion. That religion became the Guard, and the propaganda you so despise became its gospel.""

Marcus walked over to the immense map and pointed to the icon of Earth.

""Look. Down there, in the factories and mines, they didn't see what we saw. They didn't feel the threat. I had to make them feel it in their bones. Every single day.""

""So you broke them. You intimidated them. You took everything from them in the name of security,"" Volkov snarled, his voice laced with pure contempt.

""Yes. And in return, I gave them a purpose. And I gave them the tools to achieve that purpose."" Thorne waved his hand, and the map flared with new light. Thousands of warship icons around Earth, Mars, and Jupiter lit up in green. Volkov stared at the sight, feeling a mixture of disgust and involuntary admiration for the sheer scale of the undertaking. ""But I can loosen the reins now, Volkov. I no longer need to hold them by the throat.""

He looked his soldier straight in the eye.

""Over these years, we have built thousands of ships. We have dozens of listening posts, rings of defensive satellites. There is a fully self-sufficient military colony on Mars, and a long-range sensor base on Pluto that will give us years of warning before an attack. I have achieved the first objective. I have made it so that we will no longer be a defenseless, easy target for the Plague.""

He paused, his voice softening slightly, taking on an almost visionary tone.

""And now for the second objective. The one I never forgot. The worlds the swarm spoke of. Remember? The low-oxygen worlds with intelligent civilizations that possess culture. But they lack the ability to develop technology. The Plague still hunts them.""

""Habitat 1,"" Volkov whispered, recalling the global vote, the referendum from forty-four years ago.

""Exactly. Listen, Volkov… I made this happen. We now have so many ships and people that we can send a powerful expedition to Habitat 1 and simultaneously defend Earth effectively from two different directions. This is no longer a dream. It is an operational plan.""

Thorne pointed to a distant sector of the map, where a single, lonely marker pulsed.

""In less than three years, the 3rd Fleet of the Guard for the Defense of the Seven Worlds will depart from here. Four hundred state-of-the-art ships, including dozens of 'Thor'-class battleships and 'Hegemon'-class carriers. Their sole mission will be to find and protect the civilizations of Habitat 1 from a potential attack. The 1st and 2nd Fleets will remain in our system, fully prepared to repel anyone who dares to venture here.""

Volkov remained silent, stunned by the scale of what he was hearing. He hated the methods, but the result… the result was undeniable.

""Understand, old friend,"" Thorne finished, a note of pleading in his voice. ""I had to use these totalitarian methods to give us a future. To give a future to those seven worlds. But that stage is ending. Now, I will loosen the reins. We will increase freedoms, reduce the required industrial quotas. We will let people breathe. The world will return to a relative norm, I promise. And their standard of living will rise. We have achieved the impossible, and now it is time for humanity to start benefiting from it.""

Volkov still stared at the sea of green icons on the map. He felt revulsion for the path Thorne had taken. But he also saw the goal it had led to. A goal he himself considered noble. Could monstrous means be nullified by a sublime end? He didn't know the answer. He only knew that the victory he had brought home was far more complicated than he had ever imagined.

""Thorne!"" Volkov shouted. ""I'm holding you to your word!""

He turned and walked out without even saluting.

Upon his return, Kael called Blanka, wanting to arrange the coffee they had promised each other at their favorite place.

She didn't answer. Devastated, he sat in the barracks of the 9th Guard Brigade, holding his head in his hands. Questions swirled in his mind, each more painful than the last. Is she dead? Does she not want to know me, did she change her number? Eighteen years had passed, after all.

Suddenly, a text message appeared on his smartphone.

He read it, and his heart pounded.

Hi Kael. I'm so glad you survived.

Kael called again. The call was rejected.

Don't call. If this is about our coffee, we're not meeting.

He replied, feeling a growing chill. Why?

My dear Kael, I'm 60 now. You, in your thousand-year body, look exactly as I remember you.

Kael answered, ignoring the pain her words caused him.

I don't care about that. I want to talk to you in person.

Understand, Kael, I'm ashamed. Can't you understand that?

I can, Blanka, but please, understand me. I want to know how your 18 years have been.

They met a dozen hours later. Kael had been waiting for fifteen minutes. Their favorite spot was gone; a factory and an industrial city, stark and alien, had risen in its place.

Suddenly, he heard his name. ""Kael.""

He turned. He recognized her immediately, despite her age. She was still a beautiful woman. Her makeup was flawless, a careful mask meant to hide the passage of time. She was holding two paper coffee cups.

He wanted to hug her, but she pulled back, creating an invisible barrier between them.

""I want to tell you that I have a husband, Kael. I met him three years after you left. I adopted his children, two sons. They treat me like their mother. I never thought I'd be a good mother. I've been happy all these years. You don't have to worry.""

Kael listened, then summed up his years on the ship in a few sentences. The words sounded empty when contrasted with her story of a real life.

""I'm glad your life turned out well,"" he said, forcing a smile.

As they said their goodbyes, he grabbed her like he used to in the old days and kissed her passionately. It was a gesture of desperation, an attempt to reclaim something that had long since died.

""Blanka, I will always remember you and love you. The war and the Guard separated us.""

The empty paper cup, crushed in his hand, was the only tangible proof that his meeting with Blanka wasn't just a dream. Kael stood alone in the shadow of the factory that had consumed his past, feeling more alien than he had on Proxima b, where he had fought. He had lost the future he had dreamed of. Now, only one thing remained—an anchor. The past. Family.

He summoned an autonomous taxi and gave an address he knew by heart. The journey through the city was like a ride through an alien civilization. Instead of colorful, vibrant streets, he saw stark, monumental structures of metal and concrete. Black and gray dominated everything, broken only by the sharp, red glow of the omnipresent symbols of the Guard. Huge holographic screens displayed soldiers marching in endless loops, industrial production statistics, and the face of Grand Admiral Marcus Thorne—the uncle who had condemned him to this abyss of time. Everywhere, there were reminders of the mission assigned to them by the swarm.

The people on the streets moved in an organized, almost synchronized manner. Their faces were expressionless, focused on their purpose, as if the entire city were one vast garrison. Kael felt a shiver. This was the world his uncle had built. The world he himself had shed blood for. A world he didn't understand at all, one that filled him with revulsion.

His parents' apartment building still stood in the same place, but it was now surrounded by a three-meter-high wall. A golden cage for the regime's scientific elite, he thought. After passing through several checkpoints that easily recognized his military ID, every guard knew he had returned from Proxima. They saluted him sharply, even though they held higher ranks. At last, he stood before the familiar door. He took a deep, shuddering breath and pressed the bell.

The door opened silently. Lyra stood in the doorway.

For a moment, they froze. They looked at each other, two people frozen in time while the world around them had gone mad. She was exactly as he remembered her—her face was still that of a twenty-six-year-old, her eyes holding the same quiet strength. But now, in that gaze, Kael also saw something new—the shadow of eighteen years of struggle, loss, and the cosmic void.

They didn't need words. They threw themselves into each other's arms. It wasn't a tender, familial hug. It was the collision of two armored hulls that had survived the same storm—a hard, desperate embrace from someone who was the only other person who could possibly understand.

As they pulled apart, a man emerged from behind her. He was slim, but Kael instantly recognized the posture of a sniper—absolute stillness and economy of motion. His face was absurdly young, smooth like a teenager's.

""Kael, this is Jimmi. My spotter,"" Lyra said quietly. ""And my partner.""

Jimmi extended a hand. His grip was firm and strong. ""Good to finally meet you, Corporal. In private, without the act. Lyra told me a lot about you.""

On the transport ship, Jimmi had never had much of a connection with Kael.

""Kael,"" he corrected, returning the handshake. He looked at his sister, then at Jimmi, who looked like he had just graduated from high school. Their shared service and the journey back had bonded them. They had become a couple with a thousand years ahead of them. How did I not guess… her and Jimmi, always together, he laughed inwardly. Kael felt a strange pang of joy—at least she hadn't returned to this new reality alone.

Then, from the depths of the hallway, their father appeared. Aris Thorne. He, too, looked almost the same, protected by nanites, but his hair had grayed at the temples, and his face was marked by a deep, unspoken sadness. There was no joy in his eyes at the sight of his son's return. There was only pain.

The apartment was silent. Too silent. Kael remembered it as a place full of his mother's laughter, the smell of her cooking, the music she listened to. Now, a sterile, museum-like silence reigned.

""Where's Mom?"" Kael asked immediately, his voice sounding foreign in the funereal atmosphere.

Aris looked at him, his eyes glazing over with tears he could no longer hold back. Lyra placed a hand on Jimmi's shoulder as if for support.

""Son…"" Aris began, his voice breaking. ""Your mother… Elara… she always believed in progress. That science was our only path forward. She supported Marcus… she supported this entire war effort because she believed it was necessary.""

""Dad, what happened? Where is she?"" Kael felt a cold ice fill his veins.

""She died. Six years ago,"" Aris answered softly. ""There was an accident. She was working as the lead physicist on the assembly of a new fusion reactor for a defense station's weapon in lunar orbit. She wanted to personally supervise the final tests. There was an uncontrolled plasma burst…""

""What? How? She was supposed to live for a thousand years thanks to the nanites!"" Kael shouted, his voice echoing off the empty walls.

Aris shook his head, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek.

""Even nanites can't reassemble a person from atoms when they've been torn apart by the energy of a star. There was nothing left of her, Kael. Nothing. That was the price of progress. A terrible, monstrous price.""

Kael's world shattered. In that single moment, he understood everything—the emptiness in his father's eyes, his sister's sorrow, the tomb-like silence of this home. This wasn't a home. It was a mausoleum.

In an instant, he had lost everything. The woman who was his future. And the mother who was his past.

His strength deserted him completely. His legs buckled, and he fell to his knees, a choked, pain-filled sob tearing from his throat. He cried for Blanka. He cried for his mother. He cried for the old world that was gone forever and for the boy he used to be, who had set off for war full of hope, only to return to ruins.

Lyra came and knelt beside him, holding him tightly. His father placed a trembling hand on his head. Three survivors, adrift in an ocean of loss, trying to comfort one another, even though they knew there was no comfort to be had.

I just want to start by saying I know this is 100% my fault. Pregnancy ruined my teeth. There wasn't much I could do about it but I had the mindset that it was worth it and I could just get them fixed after the baby was born. I used to post a lot about this after it happened, I even made yahoo news, but my baby was stillborn. My husband left me at the hospital and when I was discharged I checked into a hotel with an empty carseat and a broken heart. I was told he needed his space to grieve. Not even a week later he grieved all the way into the arms of someone else. They are now married with a baby and another on the way. 

  


My past pain pill addiction was something he used to blame me for not being able to give him a healthy baby. It didn't matter that it was over 10 years before we even met. It took me a very long time to forgive myself and I don’t think I’ll ever be forgiven and that is ok. After that I went into a very dark place and gave up. I stopped caring for myself and that accelerated my teeth issues. There was a part of me who thought if he saw how bad I was doing he would come back. 

  


My teeth are so bad that I can’t eat anything that isn’t super soft or liquid. It doesn't sound so bad except eating is now a chore. I love crunchy veggies and I was a big meat eater. I can't eat anything now that will put pressure on my teeth. Everytime i take a bite of something I have to check my mouth to see if any enamel chipped off because the sound of biting into a loose tooth is horrible. I use my tongue and the roof of my mouth to “chew” the solid food I do try. I keep a big bag of pork rinds next to me for when I don’t “chew” enough and need something to push the food down. I was on a low income list for dental assistance for over 2 years. 

  
I finally had my first appointment which was nerve racking, I almost didn’t go inside despite sitting in the parking lot. I was terrified and spent the entire appointment shaking with tears in my eyes. But you know what? The pretty receptionist with the beautiful smile didn't look at me like I was “less than”. The dentist didn’t scold me and even though he wasn’t able to do anything except get me antibiotics for the infection I had, he told me he was proud of me for coming. I was filled with so much hope. It's stupid how proud of myself I was for going to that first appointment. 

  


I miss interacting with people. It’s been years since I made eye contact with someone. I hate seeing your smile fall when I slip up and show mine. I say slip up because I’ve spent hours in the mirror practicing how far I can open my mouth before you see how bad my teeth are. I'm lucky I have a WFH job but recently I’ve been wanting to get a part time job, maybe at a coffee shop or something. To ease my way back into the real world which is weird to say but I was basically a recluse. But nobody wants anything from someone with bad teeth let alone a drink. 

  
My infection cleared up and I was supposed to have my appointment tomorrow but the money I had saved up I had to use to save my cat. Even with carecredit I won’t be able to pay. I’ll go back on the list and hope I don’t have to wait years again. I don’t regret saving my cat though, he is the only one who has stuck with me. I cut my matted hair. I have accepted that my body is never going to look like it did pre baby and it’s especially hard because my baby isn’t here. I’m not ever going to be able to be a mom but I think my life still has value. But everytime I look in the mirror I just see my teeth and realize nothing is going to change until I get them fixed.",3,1758543606.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.81,False
