1gqgeh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/1gqgeh0/my_job_is_so_boring/,My job is so boring,"I work in a cytogenomics lab for a major hospital in my city. 8am-5pm. 

I‚Äôve been here for 3mo on a 1 year contract and have been trying my best to stay engaged and learn more about the job.

The problem is that it‚Äôs SOOOO BORING. I rarely get samples during my shift and when I do, the runs only take me a few hrs and then I‚Äôm just sitting around waiting again for more to show up. Not to toot my own horn, but I have a very strong work ethic and I get shit done. I just kinda lock in and do my shit and it ends up getting done fast. My coworkers are always stunned. 

I also HATE sitting around. I feel so useless and bored and it feels like time drags on. I am here to work. I have a 45min commute to and from the lab and it feels like it‚Äôs never worth it cuz half the day I‚Äôm just on my phone or sipping coffee. 

Another problem is that when I don‚Äôt have samples to run, I am literally sitting there staring at a wall. I‚Äôve tried to ask my supervisors what I can do to get ahead, learn more, make it easier for the fulltime techs, etc. and they give me mundane tasks like ‚Äúfile these papers away.‚Äù Ok not a problem cuz I‚Äôm not doing anything anyway. Done in 15 mins and back to the wall.

I‚Äôve been trying to keep my brain active by researching some pathology stuff and trying to learn more about the lab work and looking into getting some certificates or continuing my education in medlab professionalism. 

I‚Äôm from an environmental background and I‚Äôm a recent graduate with no clinical experience so it‚Äôs all new to me but it‚Äôs starting to get a little disappointing. This is my first real look at the medical world and the first fulltime job I‚Äôve had out of college. 

Anyone got any suggestions? Is this normal for being in a specialized lab or is this just the professional life in general?",1,1731514166.0,medlabprofessionals,0,1.0,False

My dog Julius is 1yr 4mo.
Husky Chihuahua Terrier.
No previous medical issues/ear problems we're aware of.
I'm in SK Canada with no access/money for vet care, so any advice please give me home remedies. 
I have some healthcare experience so I have a grasp on caution and what may be good or bad.

I have noticed this the past 2-3 days.
He started out scratching his right ear more often, which is now bleeding because he scratched his skin.
He's now started shaking his head more often this morning and yesrerday, tilting his right ear to the side, and sometimes his head.
I looked with a flashlight in both ears, they seem clear but with a thin layer of brown wax coating his ear, still with pink skin visible.
His left ear smells normal, maybe would be classified as slightly sweeter or that's just his dog smell - can't really tell.
His right ear smells really intensely musty. Very strong.

He's going at his dog chew treat pretty good so it's not impacting his inner hearing I think or his mouth/jaw. And he is drinking and eating normal.

I would prefer if professionals gave advice please, I don't want anyone telling me a similar story that happened with their dog.
 I stayed up all night doing research and I'm tired and worried, please try to respect me in this way.

To the professionals who see this, 

I first thought ear mites but there is no coffee grounds in his ear since they're clean looking, and the smell is just really intense.
 So my second thought was yeast infection. He has cracker smelling paws and my roommates always give him too much carbs to simply get rid of their leftovers.
I tried telling them to stop but I got screamed and threatened to get kicked out of the house. They obviously haven't stopled, that's why I'm leaning much more towards yeast.

1gqg8t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ulysses/comments/1gqg8t5/finished_ulysses_and_want_to_talk_about_it_is/,Finished Ulysses and want to talk about it. Is there nothing in between the best and the worst book in the world?,"Yeah. So after 20 years dusting away on the shelf, i finally grabbed Ulysses and this time finished it.

Now, obviously, i wanna talk about it. Because i did quite enjoy parts of the book; others... not so much.

Looking at reviews in trying to find if others have similar opinions and maybe further insight into the book is a tad frustratring, as there solely seem to be 2 camps regarding Ulysses (apart from the obvious third camp, who haven't bothered to read it): either the book is the holy grail of literature, topped in allusional density only by finnegans wake by same author or completely pretentious horseshit.

I don't think Ulysses is either. 

Let's start with the stuff I liked:

First of, the language can be sublime, I'll give JJ that. Then I really dug how intimately you get to know the three main-ish characters, more than any other fictional character and possibly more than most of your fellow humans. How the story/backstory of said characters (the death of rudy, the absent sex life of the Blooms, the suicide of Blooms father, the poverty and downfall of the Dedalus family, Stephens breaking with the faith etc) is unraveled en passant, like almost accidentally (which of course it isn't) is something quite genius. How this seemingly mundane day, is a transformative point for both Stephen and Bloom. In Cyclops there is some over the top humour, which literally had me laughing out loud. There is some humour in the rest of the book too, but never as pronounced. Or maybe I just didn't get it. The 3 starting chapters from Stephens perspective i actually didn't mind. Not that I entirely get Proteus, but i just tell myself that that is the point of the chapter. I was 16 when I first started reading Ulysses, so naturally it was much easier identifying with  Stephen than with Bloom. That surely has changed. The first 2 chapters with Bloom are a kind of breezy fun, after the heavy lifting of Proteus. The one on the beach was interesting and in Circe finally there is some stuff happening (if mostly psychological). Imo Circe is one (if not THE) high points of the book. Ithaca is awesome mainly for introducing something to the novel much needed: linguistic restraint. And then of course Penelope to end everything with the female counterpoint to Bloom and Stephen.  


The stuff I didn't like as much:

It's a tad pretentious, innit? Of course it is, and I don't mind pretentiousness that much, but sometimes he's really killin it. Joyces erudition is something to marvel at, but it does get old pretty quickly. That the author and by proxy the book cares about events and people i have just vaguely heard about comes with the territory, I guess. With the book taking place over a hundred years past, and me not being Irish, not even english or at least a native english speaker. the most politicians and events of the time are akin to ancient history for me. I am open to being educated nevertheless, but i don't need to know every exact street adress of every corner shop in dublin. As soon as the first marvel wears off, it leaves you with an ocean of useless facts you don't care about. In other words unnecessary fluff, which (and this is the worst part) gets in the way of the actually good parts, like story orwhatyouwannacallit. Aelous? A lot of hot air. Hades and Oxen of the Sun? Yes, death and birth had to be in the book of course, but I don't need to know the price of the ferry ticket so to speak. Lestrygonians is kinda funny, like a long snickers commercial, with all the food themed thoughts invading the stream of consciousness. Half of it would be even funnier. The random sidestories or riddles/chiffres: who is the guy in the Macintosh? What is UP? Simply, I don't give a damn and please someone tell me, why I should. Earnestly! To me it seems, JJ was LOSTing (after the tv series) it: just throwin in random idiosyncracies without any further relevance to appear smarter or deeper or more profound or whatever. 

I have, like the commendable reader I am, supplemented the reading of Ulysses with some guides to further my insight: [UlyssesGuide.com](http://UlyssesGuide.com) beforehand, the Bloomsday Book by Blamires afterwards, and i even made it halfway through Ulysses Annotated by Gifford. Some connections i can get, others seem like the kind of confirmation bias one gets after drinking way too much coffee and looking at network static until pictures start to emerge. One interesting insight however are the parallels of Joyces Life to the happenings in the book. Like, both Joyce and Stephen lived in the Martello Tower, Buck Mulligan is supposedly a caricature of Oliver St John Gogarty etc. Truth be told, I think Buck Mulligan is the way more likable fellow of the Martello Tower Dwellergang. (When Haines and Mulligan are later in the book talking about Stephen being on a kind of mental episode, I'd second them). The whole episode with the keys to the Martello Tower as well as the Library Scene feel like JJ is out to settle a score, to write his own alternative history of events where he comes out as the one on top. 

TL;DR:

I think Ulysses is quite a fine book, if badly in need of an editor. (Forgive me, I know it's a bit of a cliche, but I honestly believe that cutting almost half of the book, would make it better).  And I almost forgot but among all the linguistic and structural marvel there is actually some quite insightful gold to be found here. What it means to be an outsider, being ostracized, how this is kind of everyday life for jews, how every nation seems to need its jew (or some other minority) as public scapegoat. Some quite progressive views on christian religion etc.

Sorry for the rant. Interested in your opinions nonetheless!

1gqg5up,https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1gqg5up/is_the_tennis_podcast_lame_or_is_that_just_me/,Is The Tennis Podcast lame or is that just me?,"As a tennis enthusiast, I search for every possible content to satisfy my interest, and since I go for long walks every day, I always try to have a tennis podcast playing. Among all the podcasts, the one I find by far the most disappointing also has the most prestigious name: *The Tennis Podcast.*

* At least half of the matches they comment on - especially in men‚Äôs tennis - are dismissed as boring or disappointing. I remember recent matches I personally found thrilling - if not necessarily technically remarkable, then certainly high in tension - that they brushed off with comments like ‚ÄúI struggled to stay awake.‚Äù
* It‚Äôs rare that they provide any in-depth technical insights beyond what any dedicated fan might notice on their own. It may be unfair to make comparisons, especially with former world No. 1s, but I find the technical analyses by Roddick or Gross far more interesting and enlightening; they often make me see aspects of the game I wouldn‚Äôt have considered. I never have that moment of thinking, ‚ÄúOh, I hadn‚Äôt noticed that,‚Äù while listening to *The Tennis Podcast.*
* I know this might be controversial, but their focus on off-court issues often completely overshadows the sporting aspect. For example, during the 6KS event, they barely mentioned the matches played - which were, in some cases, quite interesting - and instead focused exclusively on civil rights issues in Saudi Arabia. It‚Äôs certainly an important topic, but other podcasts have managed to cover the country‚Äôs political situation and express opinions without entirely sidelining the sports coverage.
* Another point that might be contentious, but I feel compelled to share (please, don‚Äôt downvote me to Hell for this XD): there is a noticeable emphasis on women‚Äôs tennis over men‚Äôs. There's NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS, but in a podcast with such an all-encompassing - and I would argue self-referential - title, I would expect a more balanced distribution. For example, in four of the last five episodes, the primary focus has been on the WTA Finals (one episode for the draw, another for the initial matches, one for the tournament‚Äôs continuation, and another after the final), and the latest episode is dedicated to the Billie Jean King Cup. Meanwhile, the ATP Finals coverage across these five episodes was about five minutes, with a quick preview at the end of the penultimate episode. We are currently on day four of the fifth most important tournament of the year. To be clear, because it‚Äôs important: I have absolutely no problem with a podcast largely dedicated to women‚Äôs tennis‚Äîit's a welcome focus. But perhaps a name change would be appropriate.
* Often, when they tackle a controversial topic, it‚Äôs very unlikely that they‚Äôll take a clear stance. I noticed this especially during the WADA appeal involving Sinner. Every other commentator, willingly or not, laid out the facts and ultimately expressed an opinion. For example, we know that Roddick and Gross - whom I mentioned earlier - would not have made the appeal if it had been up to them, and they explained why. Others had opposite opinions. But on *The Tennis Podcast*, the three of them couldn‚Äôt manage to take a clear position: it was all ‚Äúyes, but,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs unfortunate, but,‚Äù ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù - once again, much like the technical analyses, the level felt quite low, like casual coffee talk.

This is just my opinion, which I wanted to share to see if anyone else feels the same way. I don‚Äôt have the arrogance to think I could do their job better than the professionals running the podcast. However, I do believe that for a product that assumes the responsibility of such a central title as *The Tennis Podcast*, there‚Äôs room for significant improvement.",1,1731513584.0,tennis,9,0.55,False

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there,‚Äù the strange man pointed to the sky.

*Lonesome Henry,* Edwin Tanker chuckled. That‚Äôs what his friends were calling this guy. They warned him this wacko was hanging around, spouting bizarre ideas about life.

¬†Ed was walking to exercise his leg after knee surgery. He had some time to blow. ‚ÄúReally,‚Äù The young man asked, ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúLove‚Ä¶ Love is out there my friend.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs reply was‚Ä¶ unexpected.

Ed couldn‚Äôt decide if the guy sounded crazy or rational. Was this some sad, pathetic broken man, or a forlorn, forgotten scholar? He knew there was a fine line between insanity and genius.

‚ÄúHmm, okay,‚Äù The idea made Ed smile. Maybe Lonesome Henry had some answers. Yeah, he could use some clues about love‚Ä¶ His heart had been broken far too many times.

Love, like everything else in the world, is sold by the media, marketed as a concept, offering happiness, and joy. Romance movies and novels play out love as life‚Äôs greatest gift‚Ä¶ And yeah‚Ä¶ he had to admit‚Ä¶ maybe it is.

He certainly had not planned to start a conversation with this pitiable, tragic creature, but he was curious. What was this man seeing?

‚ÄúWe all know love is out there,‚Äù Ed said. ‚ÄúBut how do we capture it...? How do we make it real for the world to see?‚Äù

Expectations formed as Ed finished his question. Henry was going to tell him $20 would make love real‚Ä¶¬† a donation to help him buy food or drugs‚Ä¶ that was this guy‚Äôs idea of love‚Ä¶ But Ed was wrong.

‚ÄúLove,‚Äù the man pulled on his scraggly beard. ‚ÄúIts energy is everywhere, hidden in hearts and souls‚Ä¶ It could power the world, end poverty, make weak men strong, and save the planet from its illusions.‚Äù

‚ÄúYa know‚Ä¶‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more prevalent than the billions of neutrinos passing through our body every second‚Ä¶ Like dark energy it dominates the universe‚Ä¶ But people can‚Äôt see it‚Ä¶ They ignore it‚Ä¶ Love remains hidden‚Ä¶ hidden behand the dream of reality.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Ed staired at the man. He realized this guy wasn‚Äôt that old, maybe thirty-five or forty. With a shower and a shave Lonesome Henry might even look‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù Ed didn‚Äôt know what to say. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhh,‚Äù he tried again, debating, if he should just nod and walk away‚Ä¶ He considered returning to his first instinct and offer the man money. That‚Äôs likely all he really wanted anyways. But Ed had questions ‚Ä¶ and he had time. ‚ÄúDo you want to get a cup of coffee or something?‚Äù

No one could have been more surprised than Ed was asking him this. Really? What the hell was he thinking?

Somehow, they ended up at Dad‚Äôs Diner. Again, Ed studied this strange soul. He didn‚Äôt know what it was, The man‚Äôs deep blue eyes held an unknown, esoteric look like he had seen real truth, beyond reality, and found love unveiled in its purest form. The idea made Ed laugh. Yeah, his imagination got carried away at times. But Ed did like to dream of hope‚Ä¶ And he always hoped to find some profound revelations about life.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Ed began. ‚ÄúThey call you Henry‚Ä¶ Is that your real name?‚Äù

‚ÄúHank,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúThis is very kind of you‚Ä¶ I do like to talk,‚Äù the man admitted. ‚ÄúI like to share my thoughts‚Ä¶ my soul when people listen.‚Äù

Hank chuckled. ‚ÄúI guess most people think I‚Äôm kinda crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure, Hank,‚Äù Ed was still unsure how to deal with this guy. What had he gotten himself into? He couldn‚Äôt figure out why this bizarre figure seemed so compelling. ‚ÄúDid you want some breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo thank you‚Ä¶ Coffee is fine.‚Äù

Hmm, another surprise. Who was this guy?

‚ÄúSo, Hank‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôre not presently working.

‚ÄúHa,‚Äù he released another chuckle. ‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre taking about working for monetary gain‚Ä¶ No, I‚Äôm not doing that‚Ä¶ I am working though‚Ä¶ harder than you can even imagine‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just on a more subtle, transitory level.‚Äù

Again, he laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, I know that sounds weird‚Ä¶ But I do seem to find projects which engage me.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? What kind of projects?

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù his look was penetrating. ‚ÄúToday, my project is you.‚Äù

¬†

¬†‚ÄúMe,‚Äù Ed laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not somebody‚Äôs project.‚Äù

‚ÄúEd Tanker,‚Äù Hank said. ‚ÄúTwenty-five years old, working as a sports therapist. After blowing out your knee in a high school football game you became interested in sports medicine and graduated early, landing a job at H & L Medical Associates. Your knee went out again three weeks ago playing basketball. Last Thursday you had surgery replacing your kneecap‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre doing remarkably well‚Ä¶ by the way.‚Äù

Ed was stunned. Who was this guy? ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax, Ed,‚Äù he held up his phone with a chuckle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some kind of stalker‚Ä¶ Really‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs all here in your records.‚Äù

His I-Phone showed a picture of Ed with a Wikipedia-like report. ‚ÄúI like to make sure I‚Äôm not going for coffee with a lunatic. You should really do the same.‚Äù His smile was disarming. ‚ÄúAlthough, I‚Äôm kinda off the grid‚Ä¶ You likely won‚Äôt find too much info about me,‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, tell me about you.‚Äù Ed knew he sounded irritated, but this guy was suggesting he was some kind of project. Yeah, it was disturbing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúI guess, I caught you off guard.‚Äù

Ed gave him a hard look. He nodded, his sparkling blue eyes unwavering, filled with humor.

¬†‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Hank began. ‚ÄúI know they call me Lonesome Henry‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lonely‚Ä¶ not me‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs my people‚Ä¶ I kinda have a way of finding lonely people‚Ä¶ and curing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúCuring them?‚Äù Ed‚Äôs stare softened. Curiosity taking over. ‚ÄúLoneliness is not some kind of disease,‚Äù his tone was flat, unemotional.

‚ÄúSure, it is,‚Äù Hank never hesitated. Despite looking like a bum, he was remarkably self-assured. ‚ÄúLoneliness is probably the most proliferate disease on the planet. Everyone‚Äôs lonely‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre all isolated souls‚Ä¶ Connection with community, friends, and even lovers is a superficial remedy at best. We‚Äôre trapped inside our-Selves‚Ä¶ And sharing Self is terribly difficult in this crazy social environment. People want to fit in, but they‚Äôre all so distinctly unique‚Ä¶ So, finding Love is‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs challenging.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kidding me,‚Äù Ed didn‚Äôt know what to make of this guy. ‚ÄúSo, what the hell‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre like Dr. Love or something?‚Äù His sarcasm was obvious.

‚ÄúOMG,‚Äù hank put a napkin to his lips. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ No, no, no‚Ä¶ I guess I see myself as more of a personal guide.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for any kind of personal guide.‚Äù Ed‚Äôs annoyance was showing.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Hank seemed surprised. ‚ÄúYou said you know love is out there‚Ä¶ you asked me, how do we capture it‚Ä¶ how do we make it real?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh,‚Äù Ed paused. Did this guy have answers? ‚ÄúI- ah, I suppose I did‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù The man tilted his head, confused by Ed‚Äôs response. ‚ÄúI forget people are caught up in this reality syndrome thing‚Ä¶ facing emotional soul truth can be‚Ä¶ unsettling.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶ Love, of course,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúConsider how it‚Äôs presented‚Ä¶ and how it plays out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ed‚Äôs mind drifted‚Ä¶ So many things‚Ä¶ Everything‚Ä¶ is based on the concept of love‚Ä¶ Pop music is all based on seeking love, losing love, or simply wanting to find love. Yet in reality‚Ä¶ can the hope of love ever reach the levels of expectation presented in these dreams‚Ä¶ or is the idea of falling in love only a fanciful illusion?

¬†‚ÄúFulfillment of love in life is perhaps the most longed for gift on the planet,‚Äù Hank‚Äôs words fell into Ed‚Äôs ponderings.

‚ÄúNo one wants to be lonely. At a young age, we‚Äôre not aware of the difficulty involved with the intimate details of uniting souls. We experience the heartbreak and emotional pain involved. Yet, we become aware of sex and the pleasure that can bring.‚Äù

Ed was well aware, sex too, was a marketed concept. Sold as offering happiness and incredible pleasure‚Ä¶ Once again, this idea is based on truth‚Ä¶ and once again‚Ä¶ all that was involved with it had to be experienced to know the hidden suffering it can bring.

‚ÄúThe full impression of love and relationships are rarely considered when we are young, ‚ÄúHank continued. ‚ÄúBut we soon find love-seeking liaisons are like a superhero movie‚Ä¶ with great pleasure comes great pain and hurt. It takes the strength of [two souls committed ]()to each other to make love work.

‚ÄúLove and marriage often fail,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúCombining mind and soul with one another is a challenge. It‚Äôs difficult, even when we are aware‚Ä¶ that making love work provides happiness and satisfaction‚Ä¶ We still find it still requires pain and suffering.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore coffee,‚Äù the waitress leaning over the table brought Ed back to Dad‚Äôs Diner,

‚ÄúAh, yes, please,‚Äù he slid his cup up to accommodate her. ‚ÄúWhere are you from Hank?‚Äù



Where had he come from? He thought back‚Ä¶

There was nothing. Hank was aware‚Ä¶ but there was nothing. Nothing to describe‚Ä¶ Nothing to see‚Ä¶ There were no sounds, no children playing‚Ä¶ There were no aromas in the air‚Ä¶ There was no air, no wind. Nothing changed‚Ä¶ because nothing‚Ä¶ is all there was‚Ä¶

How do you explain nothingness? How do you communicate or illustrate nothing? Nothing is emptiness. Henry tried to recall‚Ä¶ but even emptiness is something. A void may be a hollow, baren space‚Ä¶ but subatomic particles still danced in a vacuum.

Meaningless awareness‚Ä¶ aimless‚Ä¶ pointless‚Ä¶ purposeless emptiness‚Ä¶ vast and overwhelming‚Ä¶ nothingness‚Ä¶¬† It was all that existed‚Ä¶ this was all of everything. to Hank‚Ä¶ There was nothing else.

Feeling‚Ä¶ he recalled no feeling‚Ä¶ that was the worst of it‚Ä¶ there was no feeling.

¬†It was emotion which first generated being. Awareness‚Ä¶ was ignited by feeling. He wasn‚Äôt sure if it began with loneliness or with hope. It was feeling though‚Ä¶ It began with feeling‚Ä¶ Motion began with emotion. Was it loneliness or hope? Both were undefined.

Consciousness was an abstract artifact, unformed and uninformed. Self was a presence; the stirring of emotion making him aware. He was‚Ä¶ that was all.

He remained asleep for thousands, no millions‚Ä¶ perhaps billions of years‚Ä¶ It didn‚Äôt matter in endless space/time‚Ä¶ there was no one to care.

Was there magic in the beginning? Was there some powerful extract seeping from the Creator? A touch of inspiration‚Ä¶ longing began to manifest.

And then‚Ä¶ he sensed her‚Ä¶ It was perhaps his first real memory. It was the only thing he truly recalled. The prior emptiness did not really exist‚Ä¶ How could it? It was nothing‚Ä¶ Hank laughed at the memory.

She was there‚Ä¶ that was all he knew‚Ä¶ She was there‚Ä¶ undefined but present. And he was drawn to her.

The swirl of feelings began. Confusion was one of his early impressions‚Ä¶ What was this? What was happening? He could not as yet, define desire‚Ä¶ but it was compelling.

Hank vaguely remembered laughing, or at least something like laughter. There was mirth, joy‚Ä¶ purpose.

The process of finding her, uniting with her, was God inspiring awareness. Hank was discovering who she was‚Ä¶ who he was‚Ä¶ Or perhaps‚Ä¶ he was becoming‚Ä¶ becoming Self, becoming Self-aware. Emotions ignited, flaring off in a thousand different directions. Hank chuckled, there was no direction‚Ä¶ until he fell‚Ä¶ in love with her.

He supposed it should be noted, if he were to document this, the concept of gender was not yet a thing. Personhood, and humanity had not been conceived‚Ä¶ No, there was only emotion, and it was glorious‚Ä¶ a place later described as heaven, or at least as far as human words might describe it.

Yeah, Hank now knew‚Ä¶ consciousness, awareness‚Ä¶ Love had sparked the realization of being‚Ä¶ it all began with Love.

But anyone can tell you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only during hard times that we become truly aware of our Selves‚Ä¶ our independent thoughts and feelings. It‚Äôs only during hardship and pain that we discover Self.

Hank experienced a moment next to eternity in love with his partner. But she too needed to discover Self. With his concept of God and the eternal Maker‚Ä¶ he was proud of her and the reality she formed. Still, there were children here now.

The sad concept of loneliness, once the only thing he knew, sprinkled outward. Hank could not recapture or contain it. It was released. So, he reached out. a guardian of love‚Ä¶ a healer of emptiness.

At first‚Ä¶ he believed containing the disease would be easy. Who would not choose love over emptiness? But loneliness, hope and confusion were the first impressions of being. Self and individualism were inherent properties.¬† Hank underestimated the power of the individual essence of spirit. He misjudged pride, the personal smugness of dignity and self-esteem. It seemed souls needed a distinct awareness of individuality.

The need to share love required a kind of duplicity. Prerequisites had to be met. The initial necessity of identifying the unique distinctive personality of Self was required for true love awareness to manifest.

Love was muted by reality if such prior precautions were not fulfilled.¬† The indulgence of uniting with another soul completely in love needed to be inexplicably bond‚Ä¶ Yet a subjective awareness of an autonomous personal Self had to be maintained.

Hank underestimated this process. Finding and understanding love relationships as a human creature were challenging. Identify Self‚Ä¶ recognize soul‚Ä¶ discovering the niche and the place where relationship fits‚Ä¶ Determining balance‚Ä¶ measuring and affording mutual affection‚Ä¶ binding it beyond the fallibility of nature and humanity‚Ä¶ Then working and praying that its authenticity can be maintained as time will either cultivate or corrode all the hopes and ideals contained in its essence.

Lasting love is not always dependent on choice, but on tolerance, understanding, perseverance, and forgiveness.

So, Hank was here, approaching one soul at a time. He looked for signals‚Ä¶ subtle indications that a soul might be ready. The feminine gender was gifted with a bit more Self-awareness and a little less pride. Some souls were never ready. At least not in this life. But Ed was an interesting subject. Hank could only provide insight and opportunity.

Luck and love were guided by the principle of uncertainty. The laws of probability would apply from here.

I 37F had recently returned to work (December 23) after having my youngest child and decided to resign after my maternity leave due to pnd. 
I came back to a different shop and area so I could rejoin one of my old colleagues who had transferred, I came back as a supervisor and I felt like I was ready to be back to work and looked forward to doing something for me. I had built strong connections with the girls in my team, and we always enjoyed our time at work. As expected, there can be some disagreements at work/rule break, and sometime this can be taken lightly or seriously. One my of girls had counselling with our line manager for breaking policy, and after her meeting she asked to take a break. I said this was fine and let her take a moment as I was not present at her meeting so I couldn‚Äôt say if she was upset or not. Once my line manger filled me in on the meeting and then left as her shift had ended, my girl come out to me extremely upset, she felt unsafe and wanted to leave. I of course wanted to make sure her well-being and mental state was protected and agreed for her to leave but if she could stay a short while so I could find cover, she stayed but ultimately decided that she could not return to work, and ‚Äòquit‚Äô her job. My heart broke for her, to see how upset she was, and instinctively I wanted to make sure she knew that I supported her but also our company has resources that she could use for support and I would get her all of the right details to contact before she decides to actually quit (I was made aware of some personal things she disclosed to me and felt that work was the best source of escape for her, so quitting on the spot was definitely not a good option).
Once she left I finished my shift and by the end of it, I still had not found any cover for her shift the next day. I had the contact number of another shop manager Laura, who‚Äôs wife works in my shop, and she has area cover responsibilities so I assumed she be a good person to ask for help and find cover for my girls shift the next day. Laura decided that instead of prioritising cover, she wanted the gossip instead. I didn‚Äôt want to gossip and wanted to only know if she had anyone to help, she said she will cover it, thinking she had a team member in mind, it wasn‚Äôt til the next morning I realised that the cover she found was herself‚Ä¶. And boy do I wish she had just got a team member instead of being her whole body to the shop because what I walked into had lead me to being on sick leave since July! ( just looked back at my messages from Laura and the chat has been erased! So I have nothing to post with this post).
It was Friday the 3rd of may, and I was on a closing shift. I decided to get there early so I cool have something to eat because I knew it was going to be busy. I said hello to everyone as usual and went to turn the corner into the office, and lo and behold, Laura was there. Taking up the entire office space with her negative aura. And instead of saying hello to me, I was met with a SO WHAT HAPPENED! I naturally was taken aback by this and I said, what do you mean? You know what happened, I told you. L- BUT WHAT DID YOUR MANAGER DO TO MAKE HER SO UPSET! Me- I don‚Äôt know I wasn‚Äôt in the meeting. All I know is she was upset and didn‚Äôt feel safe and wants to quit but I‚Äôm slowly convincing her not to and I got here early so I could eat and also her the numbers for unum and the people L- WHY ARE YOU GOING OVER YOUR MANAGER GETTING THE PEOPLE TEAM INVOLVED! Me- that‚Äôs not what‚Ä¶L- YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER BEFORE YOU GO OVER HER HEAD! Me- I did, I spoke to her this morning and she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ L- YOUR TELLING ME YOU TOLD HER! 
Me- if you let me speak then I can explain L- continues her belligerent rant‚Ä¶ me- starting to go into fof, whole body shaking with the no control tears streaming down my face, thinking to myself‚Ä¶ what is this person doing? Why is she so angry at me for wanting to help a member of staff‚Ä¶ next thing I know I kissed my teeth. L- did you just kiss you teeth at me? Me-yes I did L- I consider that swearing, so I‚Äôll ask you not to do that again‚Ä¶ me- internal scream RACIST! me- your not letting me speak, I walked in here with my sandwich and coffee and your screaming at me for what? I know the company policies, my boyfriend works for the company! We live together! You think I wouldn‚Äôt have checked in with him or even my manager who‚Äôs been my friend for 10 years about this situation! 
Now I‚Äôm screaming Laura has decided to change her tone.
L- oh it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want you to be so involved with your teams personal issues‚Ä¶ I did the same for someone once and they had a bad outcome‚Ä¶she said this with a pretend sad face expression. Me- I‚Äôm 37 years old and I‚Äôm not stupid, I‚Äôve been through life and experiences to know where to stand when it comes to personal problems and work! I‚Äôve had support from the people team before and they really helped me. L- what do you mean the people team? You mean occupational health? Me- well yes! If you had let me speak then you would have known that I as my intention, but no you wanted to go on at me like I‚Äôm some stupid person‚Ä¶. Feeling like I‚Äôm going to blow my switch my instinct to leave kicked in, I had to leave because now I don‚Äôt feel safe‚Ä¶ my fof suddenly intensified and my intrusive thoughts roll in‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm having an internal argument with myself‚Ä¶ stop it, don‚Äôt say that ‚Ä¶ having the urge to punch myself in the head‚Ä¶ me trying to break from the thoughts I say to my supervisor I need to leave because my mind is telling me some pretty messed up things and I have to go, I can‚Äôt come back to this place. I managed to walk out the back and go to my car, rage crying and shaking. Who the fuck is this person to be like this with me when all I‚Äôm trying to do is make sure my girl has the resources she needs. 
What happens next is literally nothing‚Ä¶ nothing is done. No welfare checks on me, nothing. I totally disassociated, which I‚Äôm stuck in now. 
There was another incident recently with Laura which lead me to write this post. She‚Äôs now telling people I said something really messed up, which is a blatant lie! AITA for holding this all in and only just deciding to speak about it now? ",1,1731513267.0,u_Melx9957,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone!

I had an awesome HIIT workout this morning and wanted to share a bit about my experience with ClassPass. If you‚Äôre curious, I‚Äôd love to tell you more about it! Plus, if I send you a code, we both get perks‚Äî20 credits for you to try out before it renews the following month. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested, and I can share more details in a separate post about how it works, my experience, and how I make the most of it.

* After my shower this morning, I noticed a lot of hair falling out. I usually keep my hair in sleek styles for work and tied up most of the time, so I never really paid attention to it before. But today, it got me thinking. **Is it safe to start taking Biotin yet?**
* I‚Äôve also been super sore since starting strength training sessions. It‚Äôs a good sore, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm overworking or stressing my body out. **What do you recommend for relieving menstrual cramps, headaches, pain, and soreness?** I‚Äôve heard mixed things about NSAIDs and would love to understand the science or reasons behind not being able to take them. I feel like I need to know this to remember it better instead of googling every time.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm overeating, but I have noticed I‚Äôm slipping back into some old habits that weren‚Äôt always the best. My mornings start between 5-6:30 depending on my workouts. Sometimes I have a quarter cup of coffee, sometimes not. Breakfast and lunch can be hit or miss‚Äîsometimes I prep and pack a healthy meal, and other times I don‚Äôt eat until 2-3pm, which is what I used to do before surgery. Then I end up having a big meal right before bed between 9-10:30, sometimes even 11PM. Even though my late meals are healthier and smaller portions, it still doesn‚Äôt feel right. **Do you count Macros, Calorie, Eyeball it?**

I think I need to start tracking my macros to have a better structure for what to eat, how much to eat, and when to eat. This would help me load up my body with what it needs. I need structure, charts, and cute little training books or memos to keep me on track because my ADHD brain is all over the place, just like this post!

* As for vitamins, it‚Äôs been tough to keep them down. My doctor suggested incorporating them slowly, and I‚Äôm trying, but **I‚Äôd love some tips on what brands to try**. I currently have Costco brands for my daily vitamins (probably every other day), Citrical (which I don‚Äôt take because I have to take four and it makes me nauseated), and a B complex or Super B (which I don‚Äôt take very often).

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!

We lost our house, our car, and even saw people we knew being carried away by the floodwaters. Some of you might have seen it on the news, but nothing on the screen comes close to what really happened here. The horror, the despair, it‚Äôs something I never imagined I would live through. We lost everything in our houses. Everything!

We‚Äôre now struggling to rebuild our lives. We‚Äôre trying to raise money to rebuild our home, buy a car, and get back on our feet. Before all this, we had a small grocery shop, our livelihood, and it was completely wiped out, now we don't have any source of income. We‚Äôre left with almost nothing, and every day I wake up worried, wondering how we‚Äôll make it through. I had to max out all my credit cards just to put food on the table and rent a temporary place for us to stay in a nearby rural village. We‚Äôre in a financial crisis. And it‚Äôs not just me, I have a daughter to care for and protect. She‚Äôs too young to understand, but I can see the worry in her eyes when she notices my stress.

The only thing that keeps me going is the grace of God. I belieeve He has a solution for us. But what weighs on my heart the most is the despair I see in my friends who lost everything too. Some of them lost loved ones, and the grief has overwhelmed them to the point of losing hope. Some are even struggling with suicidal thoughts. 

The government is doing what it can, but the aid is spread thin. There‚Äôs not nearly enough to go around, and so many of us are left wondering what will happen next. Jobs are very limited. We try to live by what we plant, but it's not raining that much, which is kind of funny having to depend on raining knowing it was what made us lost our homes.


We‚Äôre doing everything we can to gather support, emotionally and financially, but it‚Äôs hard. Every bit of help, every prayer, and every encouraging word means so much to us right now.

The debt I have isn‚Äôt from splurging, luxury on extras or unnecessary choices, it‚Äôs a result of getting through some really challenging periods, and I‚Äôm working hard to pay it down. I have a total of $10k in debt.

I just want to go to bed and wake up knowing that I don't need to worry about money for at least one day.

My husband and I started an online fundraiser to receive donations using Buy Me A Coffee and PayPal, but only two people contributed. 

I just want to tell you something... please be grateful for what you have. Even in this turbulence, I am grateful to have my family. I am grateful to wake up every day. It's hard, but it is what it is.

**Abstract:**
This seven-year, peer-reviewed study examines the effects of prolonged rectal incubation on growth rates and alkaloid concentration in Trichocereus pachanoi. Utilizing the human rectal environment's stable warmth, moisture, and rich bacterial ecosystem, this research explores how these unique conditions influence growth and biochemical enhancement. Prepared cuttings were subjected to rectal incubation, with participants following various diets. The study found that T. pachanoi cuttings incubated in plant-based diet participants showed the most significant increases in both growth rates and alkaloid concentration, suggesting a beneficial symbiotic effect from certain microbial populations found in plant-based rectal environments.

**Introduction:**

The adaptability of Trichocereus pachanoi, coupled with its alkaloid profile, makes it an ideal subject for experimental propagation techniques. While previous studies have explored the role of environmental stressors in promoting alkaloid production, this study investigates whether the rectal biome‚Äîa naturally warm, humid, and bacteria-rich environment‚Äîcan enhance growth and alkaloid levels. Additionally, it explores the influence of participant diet on microbial composition and the potential for increased growth effects in a plant-based microbiome.

**Materials and Preparatory Protocol:**

1. Selection and Preparation of Cuttings:
Trichocereus pachanoi cuttings (10 inches in height, 4 inches in diameter) were selected for uniformity and were prepared through spine removal and a six-week callousing period to minimize risk during incubation.

2. Probiotic Pre-Treatment:
Each cutting received a probiotic treatment before insertion, designed to acclimate the cutting to the microbial diversity it would encounter within the rectum. This step was aimed at maximizing compatibility between plant tissue and rectal bacteria, thereby enhancing the microbial symbiosis hypothesized to accelerate growth.

**Methodology:**

1. Insertion Protocol with Duration Escalation:
Participants inserted the prepared cactus cuttings, progressively increasing exposure times from one hour daily to overnight sessions (up to eight hours) over the course of the study. Participants were divided into subgroups based on dietary habits: plant-based, omnivorous, and meat-centric diets.

2. Dietary Monitoring and Microbial Profiling:
Participants logged dietary intake, which allowed researchers to track bacterial populations known to thrive in specific diets. Monthly rectal swabs were conducted to map the microbial profiles of each participant group, with special attention to variations in plant-based microbiomes.

3. Control Group and Environmental Consistency:
Identical T. pachanoi cuttings were propagated under greenhouse conditions, with temperature and humidity closely matching rectal averages. These controls provided a baseline for assessing the effects of the rectal environment and microbial exposure on growth rates and alkaloid levels.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**

1. Growth Rate and Alkaloid Concentration Measurements:
Cuttings were measured monthly for height, diameter, and root development. Alkaloid concentrations were assessed through biochemical assays. Comparative analysis with the control group allowed for a clear view of growth and biochemical changes attributed to rectal incubation.

2. Microbial Influence and Dietary Impact Analysis:
Microbial populations within each participant were correlated with growth and alkaloid metrics. Plant-based microbiomes‚Äîknown for their higher populations of specific beneficial bacteria‚Äîwere of particular interest.

**Results:**

1. Accelerated Growth Rates in Plant-Based Diet Group:
T. pachanoi cuttings incubated in participants with a plant-based diet exhibited a 32% increase in growth rate over control samples and a 19% increase over omnivorous counterparts. These cuttings developed faster root systems, thicker stems, and displayed accelerated height gain. Researchers theorized that the unique bacterial composition in plant-based microbiomes supported nutrient absorption and growth-stimulating hormone production, acting symbiotically with the cactus tissue.

2. Significant Increase in Alkaloid Concentration:
Chemical assays revealed that alkaloid levels in cacti incubated by plant-based diet participants were up to 12% higher than control levels and showed a 9% increase over those incubated by omnivorous individuals. Researchers hypothesize that the enhanced microbial activity in plant-based rectal environments facilitated a biochemical response in the cactus tissue, stimulating alkaloid synthesis through microbial metabolic byproducts.

3. Microbial Composition Analysis:
The microbial analysis showed that plant-based diet participants had higher populations of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Prevotella, bacterial strains known to promote bioavailability of nutrients and produce growth-stimulating metabolites. This microbial advantage was less pronounced in the omnivorous group and least developed in the meat-centric diet group, where cuttings exhibited the slowest growth and lowest alkaloid increase.

**Discussion:**

The results indicate a strong correlation between prolonged rectal incubation, microbial diversity, and dietary influence on cactus growth and biochemical enhancement. Specifically, the unique microbial composition associated with plant-based diets appears to create a symbiotic effect that optimizes both growth rates and alkaloid synthesis in T. pachanoi. This suggests that rectal incubation in a plant-based microbiome may replicate or even surpass the effects of certain greenhouse conditions, offering an unconventional yet effective means of botanical propagation.

The findings open avenues for further research into human-assisted microbiome propagation, emphasizing the potential of diet-driven microbial environments to accelerate plant growth and increase alkaloid concentration without inducing morphological abnormalities, such as monstrose growth.

**Conclusion:**

Extended rectal incubation offers a novel propagation technique that, under certain microbiome conditions, enhances the growth and biochemical profiles of Trichocereus pachanoi. The study underscores the impact of dietary-driven microbiome diversity on plant propagation, revealing that plant-based microbial populations may act as a unique growth catalyst. Future studies should further explore specific microbial interactions to optimize growth enhancement and explore applications for other botanicals under similar conditions.

Peer Review and Ethical Standards:
This study underwent rigorous peer review, with all necessary ethical protocols to ensure participant safety. The findings contribute to the fields of microbial botany and human-plant symbiosis, highlighting the influence of dietary habits on unconventional cultivation techniques.

Last Friday, he sat down with me after morning coffee and announced that he felt he couldn't fulfill himself with me and that he had fallen out of love with me, which was a long process. He then announced that he cheated on me with one of his colleagues, who is 10 years older than him, and that she also has a child. Since then, I haven't regained consciousness, I'm having a wave of feelings. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I'm completely on the ground.

Then we met again on Sunday, which I initiated. He sobbed all the way there, said that he loved me very much, but he was no longer enthusiastic about things together, and that this woman was very understanding and loved him. The relationship has been going on for a total of 2 weeks, but I heard that my husband has liked her for a longer time since August. After that we layed together for hours and kissed each other, my husband was completely upset by this, but in the end he left again because he said he wanted to be with this woman. I heared from her mother that after the breakup he kept asking her about me, what I could do, what could happen to me, he was worried about me, and he also repeated to her that he loves me very much, but he can't make me happy.

I was totally confused after that because I thought it was a sign that this was just a low point, because this woman was just a consequence of something, we didn't pay enough attention to each other, and I was ready to fix our marriage.

But the other day I found out that they went abroad on a work trip, where they already slept in a hotel room, so I was on the ground again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My husband and I did a lot of things together, we ran, hiked, and worked on joint projects, which is why I unfortunately don't understand the lack of fulfillment. I would ask him this too, but he doesn't give a concrete answer to anything, he feels that he can't find himself in this relationship, or anywhere, and everything is uncertain.

I can't process this sudden change at the moment, because last week we were on a hike together, and everything seemed fine.

It‚Äôs said that the average person will walk past thirty-six murderers in their lifetime. Thirty-six people who have taken the final breaths of victims who lead a typical, everyday life like mine. The scariest part is, they can look like you or me. 

Amongst a large crowd of people, they go undetected, camouflaged like a predator until the perfect opportunity comes to strike. These opportunities can be at any given moment at any given day. That‚Äôs what makes them so terrifying. These were the thoughts I was having while I was reading a news article yesterday in a cafe downtown.

With every word my eyes passed over, the more my heart sank. Jessica Talbot, 35, soon to be married, dead in her home after being stabbed twenty seven times in the chest and abdomen. Truly despicable.

The intruder snuck into the house in the middle of the night yesterday and murdered a soon to be married woman in cold blood. Police said there were no leads at this time but they were doing everything they can to find her killer. 

‚ÄúYeah right,‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúThey never do anything until it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

Call me cynical but the cries of help from many either go unanswered or brushed aside.

‚ÄúHer fiance Christian in addition to family and friends clam that Jessica had reported numerous times of stalking behavior and harassment from an unknown number, yet nothing was ever uncovered.‚Äù The sentence confirmed my earlier sentiment, making my heart heavy for the numerous people who tried to do something.

Why‚Äôs it so hard to just‚Ä¶listen? Listen to these people and do the right thing?

My eyes drifted to the picture beneath the article. It revealed an absolutely beautiful woman with straight blonde hair. Her smile was infectious and her emerald green eyes twinkled with a bright happiness. 

This woman would never see her wedding day. I couldn‚Äôt begin to imagine what everyone close to her was feeling.

I shook my head in disgust as I reached out in front of me to take a sip of my iced coffee. It‚Äôs refreshing taste taking the bitterness of the bile that formed in my throat.

Murder, rape, pedophiles, robberies‚Ä¶it‚Äôs always the worst of humanity that makes the front pages. The good things in life don‚Äôt rile people up or make anybody any money.

I decided to take a mental break and put my phone away in my pocket, shoving the negative thoughts that clouded my mind to the side. My mind had been so overwhelmed, I had completely drowned out what was going on around me.

The cafe was filled with people sitting, moving around, or shuffling in through the door. Low-fi music played over the speakers that was loud enough to hear, but not loud enough to drown out everything else. The chatter, the clacking of keyboards, the barista taking orders, it would be considered sensory overload to some but to me, it was comforting.

I liked being in public and seeing the daily interactions that comprised of people‚Äôs days. Maybe it‚Äôs because my life isn‚Äôt that special so I can live vicariously through others. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a little weird. I‚Äôm not sure but either way, I just like to people watch.

Ironically enough though, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I was being watched.

If you‚Äôre in public long enough, you will get that feeling eventually. However, something was different about this. It felt like someone‚Äôs eyes were glued to me and dissecting me like I were a science class frog.

My eyes darted around the cafe as I wondered what was making me feel so uneasy. I saw nothing but couples chatting, people on business talking on their phones or working on their laptops, but there was one person my eyes stumbled on that was‚Ä¶different.

He was sitting in the corner, his beady, little eyes fixated directly on me. My gut pinpointed that this was the guy responsible for making me feel this way. 

The man‚Äôs eyes were like a shark‚Äôs, dark, devoid of any emotion, and were seemingly watching my every movement of mine as his hands hovered over the keys to his laptop. 

A part of me wanted to go over and confront him and tell him to knock it off, but what if he wasn‚Äôt looking at me? What if he was looking through me? He seemed to be pondering something, but what I didn‚Äôt have the faintest idea. Nor did I want to really know.

We locked eyes for a moment that felt like an eternity before he returned to whatever it was that was on his laptop. His eyes now hidden behind the computer screen and his curly, red hair.

I chalked it up to the man being lost in thought and I just so happened to be in his line of sight. It‚Äôs happened to me before so I couldn‚Äôt necessarily fault him for that. Yet, I couldn‚Äôt completely shrug off the feeling that something was seriously off about him.

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and decided to do some more reading. I had to leave in an hour but thankfully I was only right down the street from where I was employed. In other words, I had quite a bit of time on my hands to kill.

I‚Äôm not sure how much time had passed before I felt that unnerving gaze fall upon me again. Out of my peripheral, I could see the figure of the man peeking out from his computer screen at me.

I didn‚Äôt want to give the man the satisfaction of knowing how uncomfortable I was sitting there. I felt like a deer caught in the scope of a hunter‚Äôs rifle. Any sudden movement and I was done for. 

I gulped nervously and reached out to grip the iced coffee on the table. The condensation dripped down my hand, the cup sweating like I was internally. 

Try to act normal, I kept repeating in my head like a mantra as I hyperfixated on the illuminated screen of my phone. 

Eventually he withdrew and went back to his laptop. His eyes once again hidden from view. I felt like I could breathe again. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was being suffocated by a boa constrictor.  

This must have been how Perceus felt when he was avoiding the eyes of Medusa. I joked darkly to myself, still processing the weird scenario I was in. Perhaps I was overreacting but there was something off. Something I couldn‚Äôt quite exactly put my finger on‚Ä¶

-

My focus on my phone never left until it was eventually time to leave. I got up to throw my empty cup away and push my seat in when I noticed something strange. Amidst the constant traffic of people coming and leaving the cafe, I noticed the man who was staring at me was no longer here. However, his laptop was.

It was closed and looked as though it had remained undisturbed for a while. How it didn‚Äôt get snatched up I‚Äôm not sure but I assumed its owner would return for it soon. 

Perhaps the man had gone to the bathroom? No, that couldn‚Äôt be possible. My seat was mere feet from the bathroom. I would have noticed if he had walked past me. Especially with those eyes that he had. 

Maybe he stepped outside for a smoke? I looked outside and gazed upon the people who walked the sidewalk. His face was not amongst them.

Had he really just up and left his laptop here?

My heart thudded like a heavy drum as I walked towards where the man had sat earlier and grabbed the laptop.

It was cold, like it had been off for an extended period of time. Maybe it hadn‚Äôt even been turned on? Did he come in here just to watch people? To watch me?

I‚Äôm not someone who was easily scared but this was definitely freaking me out. I began walking towards the front counter to ask if the people working could return the laptop to the man but stopped.

There are so many people who walk through those doors, how are they going to remember some random guy? Maybe I could take it and return it when I come back here the next day?

I scolded myself for entertaining the idea of taking someone‚Äôs personal property. That was downright wrong. 

What more could I do though? Besides, it wasn‚Äôt stealing. It was making sure it was safe to be returned. 

I debated for a while on what to do but that‚Äôs when I went with my gut and decided to take the laptop. I would return to the cafe tomorrow morning and return it to the man if he was here. 

With my decision having being made, I walked out the door laptop in hand towards my job. Hopefully the mind numbing boredom could make me feel something other than fear.

-

6:00 PM

By the time I got home from work, I was mentally exhausted. The monotony of work had nearly bored me to death. The only keeping me awake was the mystery of what the laptop I had taken contained.

I had debated all day on whether or not I should look into the laptop‚Äôs contents, and I had decided that I would.

It‚Äôs not an invasion of privacy if I am looking for the person who left their property behind. That‚Äôs the thought I used to rationalize what I was going to do tonight. 

I had placed the laptop on the desk in my room and made myself something to eat. When I returned, I opened the laptop and pressed the power button.

I munched on my food as I anxiously anticipated the computer turning on. What was I going to find on there? Everyone has skeletons in their closet but what kind of skeletons lurked on the laptop?

After several moments of waiting, the screen lit up before me with just a basic wallpaper of large sunflowers. I clicked on the pad and was immediately allowed access to the home screen.

There fact there wasn‚Äôt a passcode screen was very strange to me. Who doesn‚Äôt lock their computer? Everyone these days has a lock on their devices.

Even weirder was the fact that despite all the searching I did by going through various files, downloads, or documents, I wasn‚Äôt able to find a thing in regard to the person‚Äôs identity. 

It was like the computer was wiped clean. Why would that be though? I continued to search around, clicking on anything and everything that could potentially give me insight on the man who was observing me in the cafe. 

I was so wrapped up in my investigation and bewilderment that I was startled when I heard a knocking at my door.

Who could be at my door? I got up and walked to my front door and opened it. 

Nothing.

No one was there. I looked to the left and to the right, but there was not a single person in sight. 

Maybe I was mishearing things? It might have been coming from the neighbor‚Äôs apartment. It could have been someone who realized they had the wrong house. Who knows?

I closed the door and brushed it off as I walked back towards my room and sat myself before the laptop once more. I began to painstakingly comb through the files in the hopes of finding anything.

Just as I was about to chalk this whole thing up as a massive waste of time due to my fruitless results, I stumbled across a single word document that was titled, ‚ÄúAugust 5th, 2024‚Äù. Is this a journal entry?

I began reading and what I found made my blood run ice cold.

‚Äú7:45 pm. She‚Äôs in the kitchen cooking dinner. I couldn‚Äôt smell what it was exactly but I knew it had to be intoxicating. It couldn‚Äôt nearly be as intoxicating as her. Ever since I saw her face a couple weeks ago, I couldn‚Äôt get her out of my head. She was the woman for me, she was mine. She just didn‚Äôt know it. Tonight I was going to show her she was mine.‚Äù

What the hell was this? I continued reading.

‚Äú11:20 pm. I snuck in through the window in her bathroom, I know she keeps it unlocked. I‚Äôve used it to get inside and snatch some collectibles if you catch my drift. Tonight though I was going for the ultimate trophy. Her. Jessica. I was going to confess my love for her.‚Äù

Jessica? Why did that name sound so familiar?

‚ÄúHer husband was out of town on business so I had her all to myself. I crawled in and made way through the darkness to her. She lay in bed so beautiful, so still. I caressed her hair and longed for that smile to be mine. The guy that she was in love with was not who she needed to be with, she needed me. Someone who was obsessed with her and would treat her right. I would have treated her right had she not woken up and screamed at me and called me all these nasty names. That stupid bitch. I thought the world of her but she didn‚Äôt think of me as nothing other than a stupid fucking creep. That‚Äôs why I stabbed her. Over and over and over again. I loved her, but I wasn‚Äôt going to be disrespected. The only way we can be close now is when our spirits meet again. See you again someday‚Ä¶Jessica.‚Äù

I felt shivers creep up my spine as I finished reading. It was last updated at 8:46 AM this morning, around the time that I noticed the man had disappeared. 

I closed the laptop and took a deep breath, trying to calm my frantically beating heart. I had realized why this all seemed so familiar. Jessica, the stabbings? It all made sense. It was the murder I had read about this morning on the news. It was written from the perspective of the killer. The man in the cafe who was watching me was the same man that killed Jessica Talbot.

My head spun as the pieces of the puzzle had been put together. Surely there was an explanation for this‚Ä¶but what? Maybe the person was just writing a story in the perspective of the killer? That would explain it, might be a little tasteless but it‚Äôs still an explanation nonetheless.

The names and the details of the crime though? That would have to be one hell of an eerie coincidence. 

I berated myself for having this desire to go looking for this person as I had stumbled upon something truly unsettling. I slammed the laptop shut, turned off the lights and got into bed.

I continued to try and rationalize what I read and comfort my anxious brain as I tossed and turned in bed hoping to fall asleep sooner rather than later.

No matter what I did, I couldn‚Äôt really keep those awful realizations out of my head. 

I had taken a laptop that belonged to a killer. I had evidence but I couldn‚Äôt go to anyone with it. It would be self incriminating. Everyone would either not believe me or think that I did it. Was this whole thing a trap? Was this all a ploy to set me up and make me look like I did this?

The paranoid thoughts ran rampant in my head like a bull in a china shop until somehow my body became numb to my thoughts. I eventually felt my eyelids grow heavy with an incredible weight and close. Fear subsiding long enough for me to fall asleep into a much needed slumber.

-

6:00 AM 

I woke up the next morning in excruciating pain. I cried out as it felt like my ribs were stabbing my organs, my body felt like it were on fire, and my mouth had the taste of iron like I had been choking on my own blood.

I tried to move but I felt so sluggish and broken. Every movement felt like I was stuck in slow motion. 

How did I get these injuries? Did I get into some kind of fight or something? I searched deep into the pitch, black well of my thoughts, hoping that I could recover a memory that would offer any sort of explanation. 

Unfortunately for me, my mind went blank. I didn‚Äôt remember anything after I had gone to bed.

I frantically recapped the previous night‚Äôs events over and over desperately hoping that something would stand out. Every time I remembered closing my eyes though, it was nothing but darkness.

What the hell has happened to me? Why couldn‚Äôt I remember anything?

I struggled to sit up but I managed to fight through the pain and look down at the foot of my bed. That‚Äôs where I noticed the laptop resting on top of my feet.

It definitely wasn‚Äôt there when I went to bed last night, how the hell did it get there?

Before I could even begin to dwell on how the laptop could have gotten there, I heard the familiar sound of my phone vibrating.

Was someone calling me?

I checked the phone and saw that it was a number I didn‚Äôt recognize. Maybe it had answers.

I answered the phone. ‚ÄúWho is this? What the hell is going on?‚Äù

I heard nothing but the sound of heavy breathing. It sounded like someone who had just finished running a marathon.

‚ÄúHello? Is anybody there?‚Äù

The heavy panting continued before a voice finally spoke up. 

‚ÄúI know who you are.‚Äù

The line went dead. I put my phone down and felt the blood drain from my face. Who was that? What was this all about? 

My phone buzzed and I saw the notification that the number that had just called me sent twelve picture messages.

The sound of my heart pounding was deafening as I opened my phone and gazed upon the pictures. I recoiled in horror as they were all of a man with his arms and legs duct taped to a chair in a dark room.

His eyes were wide in horror in the first picture as he stared directly at the camera, almost as if he were staring directly at me. 

The next picture saw him hunched over in pain, his mouth open as he screamed in agony from the pain that was inflicted to him. 

The third picture showed his mouth was duct taped shut. Bloodstains soaked his shirt and covered his face, the abuse had escalated and by the looks of the other photos it would only continue to do so.

The rest of the photos showed various displays of violence acted out on the man who was completely restrained and had nowhere to run. Acts of violence I can‚Äôt even begin to describe, nor would I want to. It was truly the definitions of repulsive, abhorrent, and deplorable.

It was like a car crash, I just couldn‚Äôt look away. I found myself morbidly transfixed on the photos, studying them for anything that could provide any leads on who took them.

That‚Äôs when I grabbed the laptop and opened it. The document I had looked at yesterday was still there, but there was a new one that had been created.

‚ÄúAugust 6th, 2024‚Äù

Yesterday‚Äôs date. My heart plummeted. 

I read through the document and made a horrific realization. 

The knock at door last night, my injuries, the phone call, the pictures, this new document. They were all connected. It all made sense.

He had found me. I was the man in the pictures. The guy from the cafe had found where I lived and had taken me. I was going to be his next victim if I didn‚Äôt leave this alone. 

That is why I am here typing this all out. I need to know what to do? What can I do? Who can I talk to? I‚Äôm so scared.

1gqfkl5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gqfkl5,My Favourite Lipsticks as a Warm Olive,"Here are my absolute favourite lipstick shades as a warm olive Mediterranean person. I‚Äôve not been officially diagnosed, but normally warm autumn colours look best on me (and I can get away with wearing deep autumn and warm spring colours). 
The lipsticks were swatched on my lips (without any lip liner) and on my arm, indoors in natural light. They were taken on different days, which means the lighting is different between each one, but the arm swatches will allow you to compare the shades more accurately.
It took me some time and a lot of trial and error to find these shades, and I hope this list can help my fellow warm olives in their quests :)

1. Nars Lip Pencil in Dolce Vita - a coral-pinkish subtle MLBB.
2. Mac Sweet Deal - a muted dusty rose for an understated makeup look. 
3. Mac Cr√®me in Your Coffee - a natural looking brownish pink. Pulls a bit purple on me in certain lighting, but still works. 
4. Nars Powermatte in American Woman - a pigmented muted rosey mauve.
5. Mac Taupe - a light brown with a hint of red. It looks like it belongs on my face, and it‚Äôs probably a good universal shade for fair to medium warm olives.
6. Nyx Ruffle Trim - a muted brownish nude.
7. Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink in Amazonian - the perfect dramatic brown.


The Red Parade:
1. Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink in Groundbreaker - a super pigmented warm brick red that doesn‚Äôt lean too orange.
2. Mac Avant Garnet - a deep wine red. Great for a more dramatic look.
3. Mac Brick O-La - a lighter, more muted, warm red. It‚Äôs a super wearable red lip.
4. Mac Forever Curious - a pinky red that doesn‚Äôt look garish on me like those shades normally do, and actually lights up my face.

I am in decision paralysis - and within my option period - and hoping to hear the overall wisdom of you all.

I am in the accumulation phase of my FIRE journey. I put in an offer for a great $300K 4-bedroom house in Houston. It was recently remodeled, and the inspection came back with a few exterior issues (needs small roof repair on a 4-year-old roof and cracks on an exterior wall). All other inspection issues are minor/easy to fix. My monthly mortgage, property taxes, HOA and PMI payment would be $2600/month. My current rent for a comfortable 2 bedroom is $1600. PMI because I am apprehensive about liquidating VTSAX funds for a 20% downpayment (I am going to put in 10%). Due to excellent credit, my monthly PMI is $45. I plan to redirect some FIRE savings to the mortgage with a goal to pay off the house in 6-7 years. The extra bedrooms would be utilized as a home office (100% remote employee) and a room to house aging parent I will be financially responsible for within the next 10 years.

**Financials:**

* Income - 195K/year
* Annual Expenses - 65K/year (including a current rent of 1600)
* \~800K - between brokerage and retirement accounts (401K, HRA, IRA, Roth IRA) - all in VTSAX
* FIRE target - 1.5M with the house paid off (I know it could be lowered with house paid off but I want private school, travel money, and cushion to feel safe to quit job)
* No consumer debt. I just paid off my car loan.
* Single parent to a 5 year old
* 37/F
* leveraging employer tuition reimbursement to obtain a degree that will allow me to earn some money part-time post FIRE in something I am passionate about, with less stress and time commitment.

**My concerns:**

I know I am very lucky to be in good job/career, and have made good choices so far. But I am very risk adverse. And a single parent who has never lived in a house (renter, even as a child). Thus, I don't have any knowledge/expertise in home maintenance or repairs. All skills that are acquirable, yes. But overwhelming when I am currently time poor between full time job, parenting, and part time grad school.

I am also concerned about owning in general, but especially in Houston, where hurricanes and power outages are constant. I am not a native here, but due to life circumstances and family, I need to stay here for the next 13 or so years... and although renting still exposes me to power outages and hurricanes, I feel less stressed when repairs are not my problem.

The interest rates are ridiculous - but I cant time the market. Currently, the interest rate I'm being offered is 6.6%. I intend to pay off the house in 6-7 years and not 30, but is still a lot

I am comfortable in my rental. However, I think this purchase is more emotional (perceived stability and lifestyle choice). I like the idea of owning a home outright once I pull the trigger to leave a very stressful job and transition to a passion job to cover living expenses. I don't buy the idea that costs would be more fixed with a house because repairs/maintenance/ property taxes/ insurance keeps rising in line with rental prices. But having a home for my child to grow up in, customizing the house to us, and having a backyard to garden, installing a swing set, etc., strongly appeals to me for the life I want to live and provide for my child. I want this house. But I don't want to sacrifice my FIRE journey or make the wrong choice.

I lack the confidence in my DIY skills - but I'm extremely resourceful and quick study and I know I will be okay. I will learn as best I can and outsource what I can't fix on my own.

Financially, various buy vs. rent calculators have me at a breakeven or insignificant savings either way.

I know my risk-adverse personality is making me overthink and overanalyze this to death, but it is a significant chunk of money that could outperform if I continued to invest it in VTSAX. But the emotional components pull my heart strings really strongly.

What would you do? I welcome all your feedback and collected wisdom.

For those FIRE'ing as renters, any regrets not buying? For those FIRE'ing with a paid house, do maintenance/repairs eat away at your cost of living expenses?

Thank you so much.",3,1731512052.0,Fire,2,1.0,False

To me I‚Äôd rather wait until a pharmacy has it back in stock and be without Sun MFG Suboxone than get stuck with another Manufacturer. To me Sun MFG tablets feel the most like a Narcotic, Dissolves the best, Tastes the best (but kind of burns), absorbs the best, and treats my cravings the best. 

Avelon sucks and so do the flat round kind of light orange ones that seem to be the most common. I‚Äôve tried Zubsolve which is supposed to be the most potent and couldn‚Äôt even tell I took anything. 
I will literally call every month just to make sure they give me Sun MFG. I take 2 8/2 tablets and two 2/0.5 tablets in the morning and drink coffee with it. Then my GABApentin kicks it back in when it seems to be wearing off. Oh, and Sun MFG doesn‚Äôt give me Narcan headaches like all the other brands.

I had drinks last night and I woke up today and I really don‚Äôt think I want to do this anymore, the headaches, the puffy face, not to mention , I‚Äôm not present in the moment. I‚Äôm sometimes even sacred to take muscle relaxers when prescribed because I‚Äôm afraid of how I will feel and will want to feel that again so today I just said to myself ‚Äúyou are so silly, you sometimes don‚Äôt want to take meds because you think you might depend on them but you are totally ok with alcohol‚Äù and for some reason that put everything into perspective.

1gqfc36,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gqfc36/jura_e8_kitchenaid_kes8_comparison/,Jura E8 & KitchenAid KES8 Comparison,"There have been a few questions floating around this group asking about the Jura E8 and the (relatively) new KitchenAid products.  We've had an E8 for about two years and started shopping for another unit for a 2nd home a few months ago.  With the help of some incredibly informative and generous folks on this board, we ended up buying a KitchenAid KES8.  Let me also add that I'm not affiliated with either of these companies in any way, shape or form.

A couple of important caveats.  We've only had the KitchenAid for about a week.  We're still in the ""I wonder what happens when I push this button"" phase.  We also come from the ""one or two lattes/flat whites"" a day perspective.  We're not all-day coffee drinkers and ours tend to be milk drinks.  If you're looking for an Americano or traditional US coffee perspective, these won't be the droids you're looking for...

Overall, really impressed with the build quality and packaging.  KitchenAid uses a large LCD panel on the front to guide everything from set-up to cleaning to coffee creation.  It was really easy to get the KES8 up & running.  HIGH marks on this feature.

The other little thing we really appreciated was the cup shelf/holder.  On the Jura, your mug is parked off to the side and a big mug will get tippy.  On the KitchenAid, your mug sits front & center and is much more stable.  Yes, the overall unit is a smidge deeper, but not much.

Another detail we like is the removable bean hopper.  You'll note that our unit sits under some glassware and it was always a pain to refill.  The KitchenAid version has a removable hopper that makes it a breeze.

I was skeptical about some of the ""quieter"" sales copy that KitchenAid uses, but I think it's right.  Our machine is tucked into a pantry, but it definitely is quieter than the Jura.

As to cleaning, a lot of similarities with a few key differences.  KitchenAir has you plug the milk hose into the base for rinsing and that works great.  And there are a lot more cleaning options -- rinse milk unit, clean milk unit, rinse brew unit, evaporate, etc., etc.

And that leads me to some of the less awesome features.  We typically get up and immediately make two lattes/flat whites.  We turn the machine on and it does a little cleaning dance -- cool.  We then brew a latte and it immediately prompts you to clean the machine before you make the 2nd drink.  Not a big deal, but a nuisance.

There are also a couple of oddities in terms of drink creation and this could easily be user error.  Based on what we've experienced so far, the amount of coffee to put in a flat white is LESS than the amount of coffee you can put it in a latte.  So you can make a ""mugful"" of latte, but the maximum flat white is only half a mug.  Again, we might have missed something here.

Finally, the KitchenAid seems to be a few degrees cooler at the max setting than the Jura.  I haven't actually gotten a thermometer out to confirm, but I will at some point.

If it matters -- we decided to keep the KitchenAid in our primary residence and the Jura is moving to our ski place.  We've really liked it so far and we're still learning.

I can try to answer specific questions, but the Jura won't be back up for another couple of weeks.

And let me say one last time -- this group has been incredibly helpful in our journey down the coffee trail....

After that we layed together for hours and kissed each other, my husband was completely upset by this, but in the end he left again because he said he wanted to be with this woman. I heared from her mother that after the breakup he kept asking her about me, what I could do, what could happen to me, he was worried about me, and he also repeated to her that he loves me very much, but he can't make me happy.

I was totally confused after that because I thought it was a sign that this was just a low point, because this woman was just a consequence of something, we didn't pay enough attention to each other, and I was ready to fix our marriage.

But the other day I found out that they went abroad on a work trip, where they already slept in a hotel room, so I was on the ground again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My husband and I did a lot of things together, we ran, hiked, and worked on joint projects, which is why I unfortunately don't understand the lack of fulfillment. I would ask him this too, but he doesn't give a concrete answer to anything, he feels that he can't find himself in this relationship, or anywhere, and everything is uncertain.

I can't process this sudden change at the moment, because last week we were on a hike together, and everything seemed fine.

1gqf7ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leeds/comments/1gqf7ee/unusual_encounter_outside_near_the_train_station/,Unusual encounter outside near the train station,"Last week, some friends and I were sat outside a coffee shop near the train station when a man came up to us talking about a butcher‚Äôs shop and meat. He seemed a bit slow or a bit out of it and we all initially showed no interest, but then I figured I‚Äôd like to know where there‚Äôs a good butcher‚Äôs and if his shop was new I‚Äôd be interested in giving him some business. So, as he was starting to walk away, I asked.  

How foolish I was. I turn around and his mate was stood right next to us, none of us having noticed him thus far. Dude goes up to his mate, opens his backpack, and pulls out a huge, disgusting-looking leg of lamb. The thing was vac-packed and green or grey - it was very clearly unsafe to eat. By now, I had clocked that these men in fact did *not* run a butcher‚Äôs shop and had rather been bin diving behind a butcher‚Äôs, or somehow stolen this huge piece of meat, failing to consider that it would obviously be disgusting within a few hours.  

They eventually walked away after I told them a few times that I was no longer interested, and the main guy‚Äôs mate turned around and said something about Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, as they sauntered off.  

I suspected that they might have been attempting to nick a phone as there were three left out on the table and the second guy was quite stealthy. We all had our stuff though so no idea what happened there.  

Regardless, this was a really unusual encounter and I wonder if anyone has seen anything similar. First guy had short light hair, no facial hair and small eyes (might have just been stoned) and the second guy had quite unkempt light brown hair and a beard.",9,1731511101.0,Leeds,4,0.91,False

We connected after long time on insta. And started chatting. 

We never talked that much in school. But I kinda know ( or had a feeling She liked me in school ) at that time I don't get hints and all and I was not financially stable so I was not into dating etc

And Now even in chat She gave some good complements and showing interest by asking relationship related questions, want to know my preference etc. And more.

she is stunning in will say 10/10 like models. 

Girls don't say like boys they give subtle hints and I think she want me to move. And asked her out for casual outing ( coffee or something just to meet after long time) she said yes.


This is what I all want in my life. But I am not getting sure about her in my mind. ( I am single don't have any crush or talking to multiple Girls nothing like that )


I think problem is she lives very near to my house. Approx 500 meter. ( in next mohala) 

And I if think things workout I not sure will her or my parent agree to marriage. As here people avoid relationship/marriage with people who live to near. 

Leave my parents (if she loves me want to marry me. I will handle my parents but not sure about her. ) 

I know we just talking now. And I am overthink 

But I wanna make sure I don't want bad breakup and hurt her or my self.


One another thing

When we were classmates she started visiting my house on pretext of meeting my sis she was in same school. But my parents use to think she was interested in me and they don't liked that thing.
( if this was not happened, I will be sure about her. But now my parents might have some image of her in their mind )


So how should i proceed this. 

I like her but I am not getting that strong feeling due to these problems. Otherwise she is dream girl for many.

I've been aiming for the conventional 18g in, 36g out, 25-30 seconds and cannot reach a good tasting shot. I'm faced with 2 issues that seem in conflict with each other. 

1) My shots are always sour, which indicates they're underextracted, therefore I should grind finer? I feel like I'm already reaching the limit on my grinder, going down as far as grind size 6 or 5.

But also...

2) My shots take far longer than 30sec to brew. Sometimes even about a whole minute. So shouldn't that indicate there's already too much resistance in the puck and I should grind coarser? If I go much coarser, the machine doesn't even reach 9 bars of pressure.

I've even tried meeting it in the middle; keeping the finer grind size, but lowering the dose to 12-15g in. Still sour.

All the pucks leftover in the portafilter have been incredibly soupy as well. Never a nice, dry puck. (If that info helps indicate anything) 

Exactly one time, I got exactly what I wanted on paper. 18g in, yielded exactly 36 at 30 seconds. Still disgusting.

After a while, I disregarded the 1:2 ratio altogether and started pulling until I reached 2oz. That's another conventional measurement I've heard of designating yield for an espresso shot on some corners of the internet. It doesn't make much sense to me (20 oz is nowhere near 36g! But hell, I'll try anything.) These shots have been the most drinkable so far but they're still noticably sour.

So this naugthy fella stole the ONE ferrero rocher I had from the coffee table. He never did something like that before, that's why I was confident to leave it there (for literally 20 sec to wash my hands). I called the vet immediately, who told me - and this is the ""advice"" part to other owners - that for a dog this size (65 lbs) eating a ferrero rocher alone likely wouldn't do any harm BUT of course he ate it with the packaging, which was the concerning part (since it could block the small intestines).

Long story short, we rushed to the vet, they made him vomit, all the packaging came out. All is well, he's a little drowsy from the injection he got to make him vomit, and all the problem I have left is how I would eat a ferrero rocher right now if I had one...

TL:DR Lumber is broken, other things are only profitable if the market is undersupplied. The former is probably an oversight, the latter is clearly by design and Paradox has clearly thought carefully about the numbers.

**Part 1: basic rules**

Let's establish the base rules for how prices work in V3:

* For every good, there is a set price (e.g. wood has a base price of ¬£20)
* As supply/demand balance shifts, this price moves around between +/-75% of the set price
   * Using the example above (wood):
      * At perfectly balanced supply/demand, this price sits at ¬£20
      * If demand or supply is out of balance, the price first moves to +- 75% of the original price
      * This means that the price of wood moves between ¬£5/¬£35 in game, between supply being half/double of demand
      * If supply/demand balance is more extreme than this, shortages will begin to impact throughput, but we will not get into that right now

**Part 2: impact on profitability**

What does this mean for profitability?

In the post linked above, the user complains that a 75% decrease in price leaves us with a quarter of the original, but a 75% increase does not leave us with a corresponding fractional increase (quadrupling) of price.

This is true, but this is also missing the point.

Let's return to the wood example above:

A common strategy in victoria 3 is to build lots of sawmills early on. There are a number of reasons for this, but a key one is simply that lumber is cheap to build, and highly profitable even with basic technology. Sawmills, a level 1 tech, gives ¬£1000 when fully employed at base prices.

Sawmills requires 5 tools (¬£40 each) and produces 60 Wood (¬£20 each) so the difference between inputs and outputs is 100\*20-5\*40 = 1200-200 = ¬£1000

If we assume the worst possible market conditions (+75% input goods and -75% output) then we get 60\*0.25\*20-5\*1.75\*40 = 300 - 350 = -¬£50

Similarly, if we assume the best possible outcome (-75% input costs and +75% output) we get 60\*1.75\*20-5\*0.25\*40 = 2100 - 50 = ¬£2050

Notice that **the outcome here is symmetrical in absolute terms**: The overall profitability can range from ¬£2050 to -¬£50, around a central expectation of ¬£1000. In other words, the profitability of the sawmill moves by ¬£1050 in either direction! This is because the percentage change is being applied to a fixed base price, so a % of the price of wood is a set number. 10% of ¬£20 is ¬£2, wether being added or subtracted.

Overall, the success of your economy is not driven by proportional but absolute efficiency! The amount of money that you make is driven by the absolute value which is created or destroyed, not by the proportional value. You want you pops to work in the jobs that create the most money! Not the ones that create the most proportional difference in the value of goods.

So then, the percentages thing isn't a big deal. it's all fine, shortages and surpluses all make sense...

Right?

**Part 3 More than you possibly could have wanted to know at the start of this, or how I learned to stop worrying and love the sawmill**

So. Wood is a very strong building. You probably know this, but did you ever wonder why? 

Every PM in V3 is ""profitable"" at base prices (exclude labour saving PMs for now). So only price differences can make PMs differently competitive. Should I expect higher, or lower prices?

The simple take here is that wood is still profitable on inputs/outputs in all but the absolute most extreme scenarios possible. This is true, if you assume the worst outcome, but allow the wood price to be, say 30% instead of 25%, we are already back in profit! So it's pretty hard for a stable gamestate where wood is a loss-making industry to occur.

Let's compare this to say motor industries, a notoriously rubbish building, the profitability moves around ¬£900, in a range of -¬£2025 to ¬£3825. The building stops being profitable if inputs are 67% above base prices, while for sawmills the building still makes about ¬£864 in that case. Conversely, where wood is profitable at expensive inputs so long as the price is **30%** or more, engines would require the price to be **110%.**

OK, but what's the point?

The way that the price calculation (taken from the wiki) works, means that the price falls more quickly at low levels of supply than at high ones:

https://preview.redd.it/vb6oxxflco0e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25e8c1f888db283cedbf0bbfa88a3ca5471050d

You will notice that:

1. Below 50% supply, the price is fixed
2. Between 50%-100% supply, the price falls nonlinearly, with the price falling more slowly as more supply is added
3. Above 100% supply, the price falls linearly with each new addition

**However, the way these numbers work out, the marginal revenue falls into 4 stages**

https://preview.redd.it/g2uzlrjrbo0e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0f7021b5132a338f1771049861df0be9d3e8969

1. At supply below 50%, adding 1 unit of wood adds the maximum price, as it does not resolve the shortage (in this case, increasing revenue by 35)
2. At supply above 50% but below 100%, adding 1 unit of wood increases total revenue by ¬£5, as the lost revenue for existing sales is offset by the increased total volume of sold goods (for example, goin gfrom 50 to 51 units adds 1 new unit at ¬£34.41, but reduces the value of the previous 50 units by ¬£0.58. This is exactly ¬£29.41, which leads to a net increase in revenue of 34.41-29.41, or ¬£5, neat!)
3. At supply above 100%, but below 200%, increasing linearly reduces revenues, as the price reduces linearly, but the supply increases nonlinearly (100 to 101 is a 1% increase, 199 to 200 is a 0.5% increase)
4. At supply above 200%, revenue increases by a flat amount as the price is fixed

You will note that oversupply is bad, until it is REALLY bad, then suddenly, it's fine! Funny how the maths works out...

For some goods, like wood, or tea or coffee, this can actually happen, because the cost of inputs is minimal. Here is the total profit (assuming flat input good costs) for wood with the sawmills PM.

https://preview.redd.it/h5agbg23lo0e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=362b12d7efa28f957228d492b6a8c6c65c7c3600

You will notice that this is always profitable, so you cannot go wrong building sawmills.

Let's compare this to our other case, engines

https://preview.redd.it/j3pr9uoqlo0e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=57dad511217bb26136470796d899b8f7e31e1eba

You will notice that engines are only profitable when the market is undersupplied, which is why **you never have enough engines!** The same is also true of steel, which is why you never have enough steel either! (this makes engines doubly bad because the input goods are in fact almost always above equilibrium price)

So, what are the takeaways?

1. Paradox does understand percentages, and the prices are set up to make adding more goods consistently profitable when the market is undersupplied
2. Adding more supply quickly becomes unprofitable as the market becomes oversupplied, so adding more production above matched supply/demand is usually not worth it
3. A small number of goods (wood, certain cash crops) are set up in such a way that they are always worth building, and in fact become even better when they are more oversupplied, so these are safe to build

Basically, build what is undersupplied, unless you can build lumber mills (always build lumber mills) 

Allegations that the Lumber King is working at Paradox Interactive are currently being investigated.

1gqe3ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gqe3ow/what_should_i_do_with_the_jar_in_my_fridge/,What should I do with the jar in my fridge?,"I'm writing this here because I don't know what else to do.

Let me start from the start. I lived with my two roommates, Carmen and James, in a typical millennial grey apartment off-campus. The three of us shared a fridge, and space was pretty tight, but we'd worked out as good system to avoid disagreements‚Äîensuring that each of us had our own shelf, and anything in other areas of the fridge was labelled.

Carmen and James had been living in the apartment for a semester prior to me moving in, and while I was worried initially that the two of them might be cliquey, they were very welcoming. Both of them were straight-talking and adult without being rude or blunt, which was so refreshing after my experiences with some terrible roommates in places I'd lived before.

Everything was going smoothly‚Äîno moldy food, leftovers kept on our personal shelves, and boundaries respected. That was until the morning I opened the fridge, bleary-eyed and looking for coffee creamer, and found a weird jar on my shelf. 

What looked like gnarled roots were suspended in cloudy liquid that swirled as I examined the jar in my hand. The jar was old-fashioned, sealed with a two-part canning lid that seemed stuck tight. I'd never seen Carmen or James have anything like in the fridge this before, and in my mind I groped around for rationale as to how this could have showed up. As I struggled to open the lid, it finally loosened, not with the fresh *pop* of a sterile jar, but with the gritty sensation of corroded metal loosening its grip on rust. This jar looked like it had been here for years. I quickly screwed it shut again, not wanting to experience the smell of what was inside.

My fingers ran over something that felt like paper on the bottom of the jar. I checked that the lid was on tight before turning over the jar. There, on the base, was a dog-eared label with words written in old-fashioned cursive: *""To bind"".*

‚ÄúDid either of you buy this?‚Äù I asked Carmen and James, but they both said no, barely paying attention. ‚ÄúIf someone‚Äôs messing with me, just stop. It‚Äôs not funny,‚Äù I told them both, but neither of them took responsibility. It was too early to argue, so I shrugged and threw the whole jar in the trash. 

The next week or so, nothing else weird happened, and I started to forget about the jar that had shown up in the fridge. That was until the morning that James yelled my name from across the house.

*""EMMA!""* he shouted, and I immediately jumped up and headed downstairs to see what the matter was. It wasn't like him to randomly yell for me, and I could tell by his tone that something was wrong.

James was stood by the fridge, his face twisted into an expression of disgust. ""Emma, what the fuck is this?"", he shouted, as he opened the door.

I jumped back as he revealed the fridge was crawling with maggots. Their pale, segmented bodies were pulsing in sick rhythm as they wriggled up the inside walls of the fridge, each one swollen with a glistening sheen. In the center of the fridge was a mass of maggots in writhing clusters, and I realized with horror that they were concentrated around my box of leftover pizza‚Äîthe pizza I'd ordered just the night before. 

""Emma, answer me! What the fuck is this?""

I was frozen with disgust, and my voice sounded stuttery and weak. ""I don't know, James... this has nothing to do with me, I swear!""

""Then why the fuck are they coming from your pizza box?""

I recoiled as James grabbed my box of pizza, seemingly so full of anger and adrenaline that he didn't care about the maggots crawling all over it, which scattered to the floor around our feet. The air puffed with spores that made me cough as he opened the lid, the once-cheesy slices nearly unrecognizable‚Äîswollen with mold, shades of green, black, and white spreading across the surface in fuzzy patches. Some spots seemed slick and slimy, others looked almost bubbly. Amid the rotting mess, maggots swarmed over each slice, their pale bodies weaving in and out of the gooey, decomposing crust. The air was filled with the dense, sour stench of decay and whispery, wet squelching of their bodies sliding against each other.

The sight of the decay inside the box was so shocking that I almost didn't notice the message on the inside of the lid, scrawled in harsh, capital letters: *""ENJOY WHILE IT LASTS"".*

James tilted the box to look at the message. ""What does this mean, Emma?""

""I don't know! The pizza was fresh, that message wasn't there last night...""

""So you're saying that me or Carmen must have done this? Why the fuck would we want to nuke our own fridge with maggots?""

""No, that's not what I'm saying! This is so fucked up...""

James' eyes were full of a hard rage that I hadn't seen before, and I was almost as scared of him as I was of the maggots. ""I don't even want to *hear* how this happened. It's your mess, clean it up, and you need to replace all of our food that's been ruined by this. This is unbelievable Emma, I really thought we could trust you."" He threw the pizza box on the counter and stormed from the room.

I cleaned it all up, filling up trash bags while crying with frustration and fear. I was so confused‚Äîthere had been no hint of any decay when I'd eaten the pizza last night, and I'd simply thrown the leftovers in the fridge thinking I'd eat them later today. I didn't have the money to buy an entire fridge's worth of food for three people, and I was sick with worry that my living situation was descending into the same mess of hostility that I'd experienced before.

I spent about an hour on my knees in my rubber gloves, scooping up handfuls of maggots and dumping them in boiling water to kill them, then scrubbing the fridge with bleach. Neither James nor Carmen mentioned the incident to me again, although both of them had noticeably cooled towards me, and I spent as much time in my room as I could to avoid any awkward confrontations. Each time I opened the fridge, I braced myself, terrified that something else would appear. 

And I was right to be afraid, because a few nights later, it happened again.

I opened the fridge to grab a snack, only to find a plate on my shelf, front and center. On it was a slice of cake sat upright with a candle on the top, as if ready to present to a birthday girl. But the cake was old-looking, sagging and sunken. It looked kind of familiar‚Äîfrosting a sickly shade of green, surrounded by hardened crumbs, and speckled with confetti-like sprinkles. My stomach dropped as I noticed the letters scrawled across the top in smeared icing. The first few letters of my name. *EMM‚Ä¶* 

It was unmistakably the same cake from my tenth birthday. I remembered that the frosting was a hideous shade of green because my mom had added too much food coloring. How could a slice of it be here, now, almost a decade later?

‚ÄúEmma?‚Äù Carmen‚Äôs voice cut sharply through my thoughts, and I jumped. She was standing in the doorway, arms crossed. I felt like I'd been caught red-handed, guilty of some crime I had no part in, and I tried to use my body to block the cake. But the look in my eyes must have told her that there was something wrong. 

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù she asked, walking over to the fridge and peering over my shoulder. Her eyes widened as she spotted the plate, and her mouth curled in disdain. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt seriously expect us to believe this isn‚Äôt yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No, I‚Äî‚Äù I stammered, trying to find the right words, but she cut me off.

‚ÄúJames told me about the maggots, and now this? A slice of rotten cake with *your* name on it?‚Äù Her eyes were cold and sharp with accusation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what kind of game you‚Äôre playing, Emma, but it‚Äôs sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear, Carmen, I didn‚Äôt put this here!‚Äù I said, my voice filled with desperation. ‚ÄúI have no idea how any of this is happening!‚Äù

She snorted, folding her arms tighter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me that a weird cake with your name on it just magically appeared in our fridge? Do you even hear how insane that sounds?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know how it sounds,‚Äù I whispered. My voice was brittle with shame. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not doing this. I haven‚Äôt done any of it.‚Äù

Carmen shook her head. Her face with was filled with disappointment, her eyes wrinkled with disgust, like she was contemplating a stranger doing something unsanitary. I'd hoped that some fragile trust was still there, but each syllable she spoke tore it down. ‚ÄúWe were actually happy when you moved in. We thought you‚Äôd be different. But you‚Äôve brought nothing but weirdness into our home. First the maggots, and now this? James and shouldn't have to live with constant gross surprises in the fridge.‚Äù

‚ÄúCarmen, please. You have to believe me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to do anything,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to reconsider this whole living arrangement.‚Äù

Later that night I lay in bed, unable to sleep, replaying the argument with Carmen over and over in my head. I felt like I was going crazy, but I knew I wasn't responsible for this. Every other area of my life was healthy and happy. All I could think, unlikely as it seemed, was that James or Carmen were playing a trick on me. I didn't feel safe, I couldn't face a confrontation with them, and even if I could, our relationship would be forever tainted by what had happened.

I needed to talk to someone who might have an outside perspective on all this. I picked up my phone and called my mom.

‚ÄúHi, sweetheart!‚Äù She sounded cheerful at first, but her tone shifted when she heard the strain in my voice. ‚ÄúEmma? Is everything okay?‚Äù

I hesitated, unsure how to even begin, but eventually, the whole story spilled out. I told her about the maggots, the old cake with my name on it, and the jar of roots with the faded label.

She was silent for a moment. ‚ÄúA jar of roots? Are you sure that‚Äôs what it was?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúIt looked ancient, like it had been in the fridge for decades. And on the bottom, there was a label. It said, 'To bind.' Do you know what that could mean?‚Äù

There was a long pause before my mom spoke again, and when she did, her voice was hushed, threaded with a fear I‚Äôd never heard before. ‚ÄúEmma‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt told you about our family. I thought‚Ä¶ well, I hoped it would never be necessary. But hearing this, it sounds like‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, and I felt her weighing the words she spoke next. ‚ÄúIt sounds like an old ritual your great-grandmother once used. She was known to keep jars of herbs and roots, things meant to ‚Äòbind‚Äô or protect the family from harm.‚Äù

A chill ran through me. ‚ÄúBind us from what, exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know all the details,‚Äù she admitted, a soft tremble in her voice. ‚ÄúBut I do know that these ‚Äòbindings‚Äô were meant to keep something at bay, to trap it or hold it back from affecting us. Emma, you didn't open the jar, did you?""

I felt my skin prickle, goosebumps raising as a wave of cold washed over me. ""Not completely, Mom... what if I did?""

A shaky breath escaped her, like she was trying to steady herself. ‚ÄúHonestly, I don‚Äôt know. I never believed much in the family stories, thought they were just superstitions. But I remember the jars and how your great-grandmother would never let anyone open them. She told me, ‚ÄòNever break the seal on a binding jar; otherwise, what‚Äôs inside might come for us.‚Äô‚Äù

Fuck. A thick silence settled between us as I processed her words, feeling like I'd unearthed a family secret that should have stayed buried. This couldn't be real... surely there was no such thing as witchcraft, or spirits? But as I cast my mind back to the stale cake and the writhing maggots, it all seemed way too weird to have any type of a rational explanation.

""Mom,"" I finally whispered, ""what if I come stay with you for a while? I need to get away from all of this.""

""Of course, sweetheart. Come home. We'll sort this out together."" She had the practiced steadiness in her voice of every parent that talks of Santa, tells you that pets go to a ""farm"", or assures you that everything will be alright.

I packed my things the next day, shoving everything into my bags hurriedly without any type of organization. I explained to Carmen and James that I'd pay the rent until my notice period was up, but I'd be leaving that day. They barely looked at me as I left, and I didn‚Äôt say goodbye. I couldn‚Äôt blame them after everything that had happened, but it still hurt. A strange loneliness crept over me as I left the apartment and headed back to my childhood home.

When my mom greeted me at the door, I melted into her warm hug, feeling the weight of the past few days begin to ease, just slightly. That night we spent the evening watching crappy romance shows on Netflix, talking about anything but what had happened.

It was early the next morning when I went to the kitchen, still groggy with sleep. My mom was already up, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of black coffee. ""Morning,"" she said with a tentative smile.

There was some kind of current in the air, a chill that seemed like more than a draught. I think, deep down, I knew then that something was wrong. But I tried to pretend it was another normal morning, that I'd open the fridge door, grab some orange juice, and everything would be fine.

But pretending was useless.

It took me a moment to process what was inside the fridge. In front of me sprawled a massive, raw organ, fleshy and grotesque, throbbing and twitching with life. Its surface was a tangled mess of bulging veins and thick, sinewy fibers, each strand shining with wetness. The swollen blood vessels twisted over it like bloated worms, their contents sloshing with each faint throb. It sat in a thick pool of viscous, nearly black blood that dripped lazily off the shelf and splattered onto the floor with wet, sticky slaps. The coppery, metallic stench coated the insides of my nostrils, so thick and rancid it felt like it was crawling down my throat, filling me with a nausea that clawed its way up from my gut.

I stumbled back, gagging and clamping my hand over my mouth. This thing‚Äîit looked like a nightmare pulled from the depths of some twisted horror, something so wrong and obscene it felt like the air itself recoiled around it. This was something that had no place in any fridge, let alone my mom's.

On the shelf below, obscured by the shadow cast by the huge organ, another jar caught the faint glint of the fridge light. It was nearly identical to the one I‚Äôd found in the apartment‚Äîa murky jar filled with dark, viscous liquid and tangled, gnarled roots. 

But there was something different about this jar. A faded label clung to the side, the same spidery cursive as before spelling out the words: *‚ÄúTo Unbind.‚Äù*

I only realized my mom was by me when her shaking hands clasped my arm. Her face was completely pale. ‚ÄúEmma‚Ä¶ this jar‚Ä¶ this shouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

I didn't want to believe this was happening, and it took so much effort to face the situation, not to run, screaming. But I wanted to be strong for my mom. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? ‚ÄòTo Unbind‚Äô? Is this‚Ä¶ the thing I let out?‚Äù

Before she could answer, a strange, low noise filled the kitchen, like something huge exhaling. The air filled with a whispering, crackling sound, like the rustling of dry leaves, and underneath, a cracking noise like something brittle breaking. It was suddenly so cold, so damp even inside the room, like the air in the middle of a forest in a rainstorm.

I couldn't move. My eyes were fixed on the jar as the roots inside it started to twitch. At first I thought it was a trick of my eyes, a glimpse of a reflection moving. But then, unmistakably, they started to coil around each other, gripping and undulating like a nest of snakes.

My mom‚Äôs hand gripping my arm tighter seemed so small and fragile. ‚ÄúEmma‚Ä¶ shut the fridge. Don‚Äôt touch it. We need to‚Äî‚Äù

But it was too late. The jar's lid spun round, loosening with a grinding *crick*, then a loud *hiss* as the lid popped off, filling the kitchen with the sour, sharp smell of decay. The dark liquid in the jar overflowed as the roots began to uncoil, slowly creeping out of the jar like blackened fingers reaching out for us...

My mom backed away. Her voice was filled with terror and urgency. ‚ÄúEmma, get away from it!‚Äù

I staggered back, so scared but unable to look away, as the roots began to slither out of the jar, squirming and stretching like the probing limbs of a hungry parasite. They crept out of the fridge with a slow, sickening purpose, inching toward us, each twisted tendril writhing and extending like the grasping arms of something pulled from a nightmare.

Then, with a stabbing jerk, the roots shot forward, wrapping themselves around my mom‚Äôs ankle. She let out a primal cry of shock and surprise that twisted the deepest parts of me as the roots tightened and pulled her back, and she fell to the ground with a sickening, dense crack as her head hit the tile floor. Blood ran down from her hairline, her eyes glassed over in shock as she whimpered with pain. I realized then what the roots were trying to do... they were trying to pull her towards the fridge.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shrieked, grabbing her arms and pulling with all my strength, but the roots were relentless, tightening their hold the more that I pulled her away. The roots were throbbing as if something dark and alive coursed through them, and I could feel their strength, unnatural and monstrous. They were tied around her ankle like a ligature, and the skin underneath was raw and red, bruises blooming purple beneath their grip.

‚ÄúEmma‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ feeding‚Ä¶‚Äù she gasped, her voice rasping and breathy with pain. I clung to her, pulling desperately, my hands gripping so tightly I no longer cared if it hurt her. My vision blurred with tears, panic filling every part of me as I choked on my own sobs. The roots felt stronger with every second, as if they were draining her life, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt hold out much longer‚Ä¶

There, at the edge of the kitchen table, I spotted a butter knife. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it would have to do. Keeping one arm wrapped around her, I reached out with shaking fingers, grabbing the knife and gripping it hard, my fingernails cutting into my palm. With all the strength I had left, I brought it down on the roots, slashing wildly and screaming like I was possessed.

The dull blade barely pierced the thick, fibrous surface of the roots, but still I hacked and sawed. My teeth were gritted tight as the knife slipped and skidded against the sinewy mass, tearing jagged gouges in the roots. 

But despite my ineffective weapon, it seemed like it was working‚Äîevery wound gushed with black fluid, and the roots shuddered under the assault. They started twisting violently as if in pain, splattering my face with sticky black droplets, tasting like tar and decay. The roots recoiled from every jagged hack I laid into them, writhing and convulsing, the dark liquid making a mess of glossy smears across the tiles.

As they started to loosen I felt a wave of giddy disbelief wash over me, the same way that prey must feel escaping a predator. And suddenly, they retreated, and I pulled my mom free, dragging her back from the fridge as we collapsed together onto the floor. We were both covered in the smeared black liquid, but I couldn't feel anything but relief as we held each other, gasping, watching as the roots inched back into the jar. Meters of roots compressed themselves into a small, tight mass as they slithered back inside. The last root, in a way that was weirdly human, retrieved the lid and placed it back on top of the jar, which sealed back up with a soft *pop*.

The room was still and silent as if they had never moved at all, while my world had changed so completely.

My mom was so pale, and she could barely speak through her own sobs. ‚ÄúEmma‚Ä¶ we need to bury it. Far away. Where it can‚Äôt find us again.‚Äù

""But what if it just comes back, Mom? What if what's in there doesn't let go that easily?""

My mom didn't answer.

I'm sitting at the kitchen table now, writing this up. I cleaned up the mess in the kitchen, cleaned the tarry fluid from off my skin. My mom's ankle is hurt, but okay.

But I don't know what to do with the jar in the fridge. Will it come back if we bury it? Will it burn if we set fire to it? Do we need a priest? What if whatever we do to make it go away makes it come back stronger, and angrier?

I know this isn't the end of this story. This is only a pause. The thing that's bound me isn't done‚Äîit's just biding its time.",3,1731508111.0,nosleep,1,0.81,False

1gqe1sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1gqe1sv/is_100g_brewed_coffee_made_from_190g_of_water/,Is 100g brewed coffee made from 190g of water with Bialetti Venus (4 cup) normal or is that end result too little?,"I'm a beginner at making coffee with moka pot (I've been an Aeropress user) but I gathered a lot of information beforehand and also watched James Hoffmann's video series about the Moka Pot. He mentions that the output should be approx. 2/3 of the amount of water, so according to this 100g out of 190g does not seem ideal.    
  
Since I'm still experimenting and did not want to spoil my quality coffee beans, at first I used preground Lavazza coffee and the end result was about 120g, so I was confident that I got it right. After a few brews with Lavazza, I started to use my local roasters coffee , I ground it medium-fine (Kingrinder K4, 85clicks). To me it seemed that Lavazza's preground coffee was finer, so I thought that this grind setting should yield at least the same amount of coffee or more. But the first result was a disaster, only 60g of brewed coffee. So then I changed my grinder's setting coarser, (100 clicks), and despite it being clearly, visibly coarser then the preground Lavazza, I still can't get more than 100g of brewed coffee when I grind the coffee myself. It tastes fine btw, it just seems too little. I don't think I should go even coarser because my grind is already medium rather then fine/close to espresso.

So, is 100g out of 190g normal, or do you have any advice what I should change? I use Hoffmann's method ([The Ultimate Moka Pot Technique (Episode #3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4) ) with only one change - he recommends 1:10 coffee to water ratio, but I can't fit 19-20g of coffee into the Venus, so I use 15-17g instead.

	‚Ä¢	Previous and Current Medical Issues: I have a history of stomach ulcers that led to GI bleeding. I also have anemia and recently experienced very dark stools.

	
‚Ä¢	Duration and Location of Complaint: The initial GI bleeding episodes occurred 2 years ago, and I am now experiencing very dark stools and I feel tired like I am fainting anytime over the past few days, which makes me anxious about a recurrence.

	‚Ä¢	Additional Details:
	I‚Äôm really scared about having GI bleeding again. The first time it happened 3 years ago, I woke up one morning with a metallic smell. I went to the washroom and started little vomiting and having diarrhea with coffee-colored blood, and then I passed out. After a while, I called an ambulance, and I ended up in the hospital for 2-3 days. They found that I had upper stomach ulcers that led to GI bleeding.

A year later, I had a similar experience, but it was even worse. I vomited and had diarrhea with the same coffee-colored blood but it was a lot and i didn‚Äôt know that I was vomiting at all, I just found myself on floor after a while and I felt extremely weak and could barely reach my phone to call an ambulance. The blood loss was significant, and I already have anemia. Eventually, I managed to call, but I couldn‚Äôt speak clearly. I stayed in the hospital for six days this time, and I had received 2 litter of blood to stabilize and had severe headaches that didn‚Äôt go away, even with strong painkillers for 5 days.

	
‚Ä¢	Current Symptoms: I am seeing very dark stools recently and am concerned about GI bleeding recurring.

We‚Äôve got merch and commissions available to buy, and the tea room is right next to us if you want to grab a coffee and hang out with some dogs! All the proceeds go to the charity, it‚Äôs not a huge event but a huge amount of effort has gone into it by all our lovely volunteers :)",2,1731507258.0,greatyarmouth,0,1.0,False
