I’m gonna have a conversation with this guy that I’ve known for three weeks now. We met online (never met in person due to long distance), and text almost every day (albeit less now than we did in the beginning). We’ll also do video chats once a week. We’ve had three of them so far, although they had to be cut short.

About the conversation: I’m confused if he likes me or not. Before our first video chat, we talked a lot throughout the days, and maybe he was even flirting a little? But ever since our first video chat, he’s been messaging me a lot less. Maybe he doesn’t feel the need to text as much now that we video chat? Also, he IS going through a lot personally, and DID go through a situation that I’m sure affected his communication with me, but it seems to be better now. So I’m confused about him messaging me less, and am gonna talk to him about this. In particular I’m gonna ask if everything’s okay with him, if I said something that might’ve put him off, what works best for him with communication. But I’m also thinking of telling him that I have feelings for him.

Is it too early to do that? I know I don’t know him that well, but people will sometimes show interest (i.e. asking them out for coffee) right off the bat. And, hey, I do know a LITTLE bit about him because of our video chats, and what I do see I like. Is it still too early to tell him how I feel though? Should I just have the conversation about our change in communication patterns without admitting my feelings?

P.S. I know he may not be interested, judging by the reduced texting (and other factors). But it's still good to ask, right?",1,1742093367.0,Advice,2,0.67,False
1jcbx4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jcbx4x/help_recommend_me_a_grinder_aud_10001500/,Help recommend me a grinder. [AUD $1000-1500],"Hi all.

Ordered the Bambino Plus which will be delivered next week (had some frequent flyer points which allowed me to purchase this machine for essentially $50 out of pocket). I currently have a 1zpresso J ultra hand grinder but will look to palm that off to a relative soon, so I am in the market for a new grinder.

    Budget: $1000-1500 AUD
    Usage: 90% Milk based drinks (inc iced coffee/latte), 10% espresso. (subject to change once we get the gear!)
    Frequency: 2 x adults once a day, possibly extend to twice a day.

I have looked at a few entry level grinders reviews (Varia VS3/6, DF54/v, DF64/v, DF83/V, Encore ESP, Timemore 064s, etc) but am having a tough time deciding on a path to take as the machines all have cons which sway my decision.

Ideally I am after:

    Single dose grinder
    Easy to work with, out-of-the-box (not interested in upgrading burrs at this stage, might as well put the budget to a higher end grinder if that's the case).
    Easy to perform maintenance/cleaning. Should perform with minimum static buildup
    Able to process light to dark beans without stalling or risk of motor failure.
    Doesnt sound like a turbo jet engine in the morning
    Not shy in paying once, crying once. If the budget can be extended but covers the wish list then I am happy to make that move.

Maybe down the line I might want to obtain the Mazzer Philos (unless I can be convinced now), as it tickets a few more boxes with durability and build finish.

I wanted to ask for some insight about a couple of things I’ve noticed recently (last two weeks) concerning my heart/hands/feet. I’ve attached some pictures in the comments to show what I mean.

-Elevated heart rate for the past week: as soon as I stand up, my heart rate climbs up to 100 bpm (more than double my resting rate). I also sometimes get the same feeling you get when you drink way too much coffee.

-Right foot redness: My feet are usually very cold and white (always had cold hands and feet), but my right foot (mostly my big toe) sometimes becomes red, tingly, and hot, while my left foot stays normal. Lasts about 20-40 minutes and goes away on it’s own. I usually lie down when it happens so it might help idk. This happened for the first time two weeks ago and has happened again a few times since.

-Fingertip redness: I’ve also noticed that my fingertips sometimes appear red while the rest of my hand looks a more normal color. 
	
-Hands turning white after clenching: I took a video of myself clenching my fist tightly and then opening it, and my hand turned abnormally white afterward before returning to normal. Noticed this while biking. I’ve included three pictures—one of my hand at rest, one with my fist closed, and one just after opening it. I understand this should be quite normal, but never experienced it to this extent. On the contrary, my hands also become really red and even bluish when they’re below my heart and come back to normal when I put them in the air. This mostly happens when I’m in the shower.

Took my blood pressure at the drug store results came out at 139/85, no clue what these numbers mean.

May be unrelated but I also have experience major headaches (past weak) and nausea (past months)


I’m wondering if these could be signs of a circulation issue or something else I should be concerned about. I have really bad health anxiety so I could be reading Into it too much, although I’m almost certain something is off with my heart. I’d really appreciate any insights or advice. 

Ps. Before yelling at me for not going to the clinic or something I already have a appointment scheduled April 9th with my family doctor.

Thanks in advance!

1jcbshp,https://www.talitywellness.ca,Would You Visit a Sauna + Cold Plunge Wellness Space in India?,"Hey guys, 

I just moved back from Canada to Hyderabad and one thing I see missing here is premium wellness centres to connect with like minded individuals while also engaging in recovery. 

So the idea would be to launch a premium wellness space in India (Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore) that combines sauna + cold plunge therapy—not just for recovery but as a “third space” for health-conscious individuals. It would be designed in a high-end, artistic way, catering to those who appreciate the finer things.

Concept Highlights:
	•	A place for gym-goers, yoga/meditation practitioners (late 20s–40s) to recover, connect, and unwind.
	•	A coffee bar/lounge to create a social, community-driven experience.
	•	Investment: ~₹60L ($100K CAD), inspired by Tality Spa.

1jcbljg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1jcbljg/my_experience_growing_up_sda/,My experience growing up SDA,"I came across this community trying to see if others held the same opinions I do about the SDA church, especially those who were raised in it.  I'm so grateful to find other like-minded individuals on here.

With that being said, I was born into an SDA family.  I'm a 5th generation Adventist, and my parents are definitely not the liberal type of SDA Christians.  Both of my parents are very traditional people when it comes to their marriage, my dad went to work and my mom stayed home with my younger sister and I.  I never experienced attending kindergarten, since my mom homeschooled me for that, using some lame SDA program.  Even she admits I learned nothing from it.  Following this, I attended an SDA school from grade 1-2, and went back to homeschooling after the first month of 3rd grade (by my own request, which I regret SO MUCH to this day).

And I do want to highlight, the kids who went to that SDA school with me were more liberal Adventists.  They did their own activities on Saturdays, their moms wore jewelry, and they could watch movies I was not allowed to watch.  So just imagine, you grew up being taught that these things are not what you are supposed to do, yet you see your peers, who are SDA like you, doing those same things.  That definitely struck a chord in me and that was when I started questioning a lot of things.

I was never allowed to go to the movies, in a theater, or go to Disney or any other amusement park (for some reason Ellen White says we should not be doing either of these).  I was born a vegan, because of the Ellen White diet.  Never allowed to drink coffee or eat chocolate, we had to replace that with carob when we baked desserts at home.  It sucked for me when I saw other kids who were SDA eating the chocolate cupcakes at a birthday party, or devouring their cheese pizza, while I had to sit and watch them enjoy it, pretending as if I didnt feel bad.

Going out to eat with my family is so irritating when it comes to ordering our foods.  The menu will be full of options but we barely have options and have to substitute everything.

I was never allowed to be in sports, since Ellen White said that we should not participate in competitive activities since it will make us focus on ourselves and make us prideful.  As it is, I was never a very athletic kid so I didnt feel I was missing out too much.

I always felt bad that I could not be a normal girl and wear jewelry and paint my nails.  That was a huge no for my parents, and even wearing a hair tie on our wrists made them upset.  They would act as if we were trying to wear bracelets and my dad sternly told us he never wants to see us wearing that on our wrists to church.  It was only till I was 19 that I started to buy clear polish, then after several arguements, I started doing very natural mani-pedis.

I was quite sheltered all my childhood, although my parents will always claim that they are not even strict and give us freedom.  I was never allowed sleepovers because Ellen White said so, and couldnt go hang out with friends at their house, even though they were SDA too.  I was never allowed PG-13 movies, or any movie that had the slightest curse word, including ""damn"" or ""hell"".  Cursing is a GIANT no in this house, and that upsets my parents to no end.

When I was around 14, I started going online and chatting with guys in chat rooms.  I met this dude on there, a year older than me, and ""dated"" him for about 3 months till my mom caught me up at night texting on my computer.  After that, my unrestricted internet access was completely cut off.  I did this same type of thing at least 3 more times, then stopped after I turned 16.

That same year I turned 16, which was during the pandemic, we packed up our beautiful home (so grateful for having the means for that) and left for a smaller home in a very very rural part of Pennsylvania.  Ellen White stressed so much about country living, so, you can finish that part for me! I hated it at first but then got used to it, now it sucks again because I'm not sure how I am supposed to start my career with living far from every good job out there.  But, the world has gotten crazy and it is safer out here, but it is not practical for someone trying to find good income and figure out their life.

When I was 18, during my second semester of my freshman year, I met this guy on a discord server.  We quickly became friends, then only 10 days later we confessed our feelings for each other.  Now, two years later, he is my boyfriend and I am planning to marry this wonderful man one day.

He is not SDA, which worried me a lot because my parents were strict about us only dating and marrying SDA guys.  However, to my surprise, they ended up finding out about our relationship a year ago and they accept him, but they expect that I will be having him convert to SDA religion, otherwise they cannot bless our marriage.  Guess what? He will not become SDA, nor will I ever tell him to do so.  What matters to me is that Jesus is in his heart and that he obeys THE BIBLE ITSELF (Ellen White is not the Bible).

This man has really helped me wake up from a lot of things and I am trying my best now to reprogram my mind, after being taught things all my life that are not in the Bible.  I have long conversations with him about how cultish the religion can be and that what matters is that we are real Christians and try to do good and follow Jesus himself.  I will always be grateful to my boyfriend for this, for being someone who I can talk to about this and reason with more.

Today, I still am living with my SDA parents and sister.  I am an online college student, in my 3rd year and stressing about my internship situation this summer (because I live so far).  This means that I kind of spend a lot of time at home with my parents and they are always talking about something.

Last year was the first time that I ever voted, my parents suprisingly let me make my own decision on whether I can vote or not.  They are against it since Ellen White says not to vote. But they always are saying that the person I voted for is corrupt, or will bring this nation to a bad place, blah blah.  Half the time I am up in my room, working on school, or pretending I am because I get so tired being around them all day with my mom constantly talking about something that will irritate me or make me feel guilty for absolutely no reason.  It gets in my head so much then I go talk to my boyfriend and it clears my mind so much.

It's hard when you are trying to wake up from things, but constantly are getting fed more things that make you question everything even more.  It affects my relationship with God so much. From reading many of your posts on here, I see that a lot of you are atheists.  For me, I will never be anything but a Christian.  I follow the Bible as good as I can.  My boyfriend and I are not waiting for marriage even though the Bible has told us to do so, only because we will be marrying each other and trust each other to that level.  We date to marry and will be each others only partners.  Many will say that cant happen, but it is very possible I promise.

I love Jesus and I want to know the Jesus in the Bible, and take my beliefs from the Bible itself.  I am a conservative woman and against feminism.  Please no hate for this, I respect those who have the opposite beliefs as long as you respect mine.  I have traditional values, and so does my boyfriend, that is what we have built our relationship on.

I plan to raise my children to love God and follow the Bible.  I do believe that Saturday is the correct day to worship, since the BIBLE specifies it.  So I probably will still be attending SDA church with my future family, only because no other church out there worships on Saturdays.  As for keeping Saturdays, I may take off the day from work but I will not be depriving myself of having some fun on the weekends and depriving my children from playing sports and having fun with their friends.  What matters to me is that we attend church, and I certainly will not be using Ellen White to base my parenting and decisions off of.  I see her as a person giving us advice and suggestions, not as a replacement for the Bible. 

 I will definitely not be eating vegan once I move out also, nor vegetarian!  I plan to slowly introduce meat into my diet, and become animal based. Also coffee and chocolate, I cannot wait to start my mornings off with that! Right now, no meat or dairy products or coffee or chocolate is allowed in the house. I've been watching a lot of animal based influencers who dive into the science of feeding your body with REAL foods, not some processed vegan junk, full of seed oils, preservatives, and chemicals to lower your testosterone levels.  The bible mentions raw milk, cows, goats, and fish hundreds of times, but I do not see tofu or Loma Linda meats in there lol.  Eat biblically!

I know there is creme base for the not-coffee fraps and then a coffee one for the rest, and that that ingredient is what emulsifies the frap and makes it the correct texture. Do either (or both) of the frappuccino bases contain sugar? 

Are frap roast and frap base the same or are they two different things? I remember reading that a lot of people think the frap roast is gross, so I tried to order a frappuccino with espresso instead of frap roast. I ended up with a creme based frap with espresso shots poured on top, which made the texture different, and that's why I'm seeking clarification here.

My mom can not have any sugar. It will make her very sick. She likes frozen blended coffee drinks with strong coffee flavor and a bit of sweetness. Starbucks is confusing for her, but she's about to go on a long car trip and I know she will want to get something on the road.

What can I tell her to ask for to make sure that she gets a Frappuccino that preferably contains espresso (but not affogato shots) or at least coffee base and is a little sweet but contains absolutely no sugar. Would a sf vanilla espresso frappuccino make sense to order? I don't want this interaction to be confusing for her or the barista bc I won't be there in person to help. I just want to tell her how to get a tasty frozen coffee bev that will be the intended texture and won't hurt her.
