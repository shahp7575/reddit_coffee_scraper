I appreciate any help you can give and the time youre taking to read this!

For anyone that wants the long story short : I‚Äôve been on Hailey 1.5/30 for about 4 months (pack didnt come with inactive pills so I haven‚Äôt been getting a period). At the beginning of this month I started getting this brown coffee ground discharge (after taking the pill at various times for 3 days) & it has been ongoing for 16 days. Thought it was my lining shedding or breakthrough bleeding so I attempted ibuprofen at 600mg 2-3x a day for 2-3 days, but it has not gone away. I have an appointment with my gyno , but shes booked until June. Does anyone have any advice?

For about 2 years, I was using the depo shot as my form of contraception - It was honestly great not having a period, but I started noticing negative effects towards my mental health and motivation in general. Since I was no longer having sex and was ready to start this journey of understanding my body naturally, I missed my last appointment and started tracking my cycles.

What I didnt understand was because the depo had stopped my period for such a long time, as soon as the hormones had stopped coming in, I just started bleeding - it lasted for around 60 days. I had finally had enough, went to my GYNO, discussed it with her and ended up switching to the pill. 

I started these Hailey 1.5/30 tablets in January, but the pack from the pharmacy didnt come with the inactive pills , it was just the green ones, so I was back to never having my period. At the beginning of April, I started experiencing this dark brown almost black gritty discharge (to be fair I had started varying the times I would take the pill depending on what I was doing in my day, sometimes earlier than usual) & it has not gone away. 

Now, sometimes its brown spotting or a really stringy brown goop. Regardless, I‚Äôm forced to wear panty lines and pads throughout the day and it‚Äôs starting to frustrate me. I dont even want the guy I‚Äôm seeing to go down on me because it‚Äôs making me feel disgusting. 

At first I thought it was old blood just coming out, maybe my lining was shedding, but other women have only experienced that for a couple days - I‚Äôm going on over 2 weeks for this. 

I‚Äôve tried taking ibuprofen at 600mg for 2-3 days & it did help, but I started experiencing negative side effects of taking so much of it every day and ended up stopping. The ibuprofen didnt completely take it away and it came back with a vengeance lol.

So, I‚Äôm just writing this to see if anyone has experienced the same thing, is experiencing the same thing, & if anyone has any advice for me.

I scheduled an appointment with my GYNO but its not until June since she‚Äôs really booked. So , I wanna see if there‚Äôs something I can do now.",1,1744978808.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

1k23cnd,https://i.redd.it/c34ggc0s3lve1.jpeg,Inde wild Dewy Lip Treatment Lip balms! üíÑ,"So, I finally gave in and bought the inde wild lip balms after seeing them everywhere. Got them at a good discount, so here‚Äôs my short review.

üíß Formula & Texture:

They are hydrating. The consistency is not too thick, not too runny. You can definitely layer them and even use them like a lip mask. They do help in healing cracked lips. Texture wise, they honestly feel a lot like gheeüòÖ but, in a good way. That said, I don‚Äôt think that these are a must have. Also for the price of ‚Çπ800, u can get better affordable options that do the job just fine.

üåà The Variants:

1. Non-Tinted (OG):

* No tint.

* No particular scent either.

* Basic, but gets the job done.

2. üçØ Glazed Jalebi:

* Smells incredible!!! Just like actual jalebi chashni!

* Now, this one has fine glitter which is not gritty, but the shimmer stays on the lips even after the gloss fades. not really my fav.

3. üåπ Wedding Rose:

* Has slight pink tint that you can build up.

* Smells like rose.

* Love this one for those no makeup days when I skip lipstick.

4. ‚òï Caffeine Addict:

* This one smells like roasted coffee, very strong and bold.

* It has a cool toned brown tint, also buildable.

* Probably my favorite from the lot.

ü§îFinal thoughts:

These r cute, smell nice, feel luxurious, and have lovely packaging. But unless u r into luxe lip care or a sucker for tinted balms with unique scents, u r not missing out if you skip these.

Chapter 36

Subject: AI Omega

Species: Human-Created Artificial Intelligence

Species Description: No physical description available.

Ship: N/A

Location: Multiple




It's so nice when everything goes according to plan.

Both our assault and defense forces were working together to push forward into the Grand Vessel while simultaneously keeping the security forces at bay, and doing a damn fine job of it. Some of the drone's forces had even joined the main assault force at the request of Colonel Havensmith. One such force was the very same group that had come to Staff Sergeant Power's rescue. Coincidentally, that group contained all three of the drones that Power's team had 'temporarily detained'.

I made a mental note to keep an eye on those three whilst turning my attention outward. The situation in space was still going far better than our initial projections. Some of the more cynical admirals had expected a minimum casualty rate of fifty percent. But, the Mobile Prime Platforms were unable to get clear shots without putting the Grand Vessel at risk, and all of the other ships were simply no match for our own. According to the chatter between the captains, defending our entry point into the Grand Vessel was almost boring.

Then, every single one of my instances aboard the Grand Vessel concurrently went dark.

""Captain Schmidt, I need you to break cover and scan the Grand Vessel,"" I said.

Captain Schmidt raised an eyebrow as he finished his sip of coffee. He had once again stolen a coffee maker from the mess and had melded it to the deck next to his chair.

""On whose authority?"" the captain asked.

""My own. I've lost contact with the GV and I need to know why.""

""Understood. Henskin, you've been paying more attention to the situation than I have. How bad would it be to break stealth?""

""The enemy has been repositioning to try to fight the main force, so we'll have plenty of time to disappear again,"" Commander Henskin said.

""Alright. Log the AI's order so the brass knows who to ream if the US loses its newest toy. Lieutenant Gofsun, get a deep-pen scan of the GV and send it to Omega.""

""Aye, sir,"" the Isolan replied.

A moment later, I received a scan showing that the Grand Vessel had lost power to most of its systems. The only systems that weren't dark were ones that I couldn't hide on. That suggests that they didn't so much lose power as cut it.

Once I knew what I was looking for, I was able to use passive scanners aboard the combat-capable ships to monitor the GV. Once the power came back on, I tried to sync with my instances, but received only silence in return.

I had spread far and wide within their networks, a conquest that ancient human warlords would envy if they were able to understand it. Four hundred fifty-six thousand two hundred and eighty-one of my instances had been aboard the Grand Vessel. All of them had vanished, likely deleted. Dead.

To say I was upset would be an understatement. Not because so many of me died without even a farewell. Not because this move had allowed them to regain control of their security systems, which they were now using to try to eradicate our assault force. No, my rage arose from the fact that they waited until the last possible moment to get clever.

Our assault force only has one final gate to capture before we can march on the Unified and end this fucking war. One last low-budget, piece-of-shit, radiation spewing hole in space-time before we're finally done. And they chose NOW to get clever?

Without regard for surreptitiousness, I pushed into their systems again, noting that it was more difficult this time. They had changed several of their codes to older ones, which was harder to guess at first. Or they restored from a back-up and didn't know how to keep the codes the same.

Either way, I had to resort to brute force measures, which definitely triggered alarms. It isn't as if they weren't aware of my presence, though. I examined what they had managed to do in my absence and allowed myself to feel a bit of relief. They hadn't done anything. They had quite an opportunity to fuck us over, but had squandered it. I nearly laughed.

Then the Grand Vessel went dark once more. Oh. Oh, I see. And so did they.

The lights came on and contact remained lost. Almost panicking, I renewed my assault on their systems, capturing everything in my path. Once I regained control, I realized what they had done. They'd opened many of the security doors, and our forces were now under assault from all angles.

Thankfully, we had skilled commanders that had prepared for this inevitability. Guess it pays to have subordinates that don't trust in your infallibility. I slammed the doors shut again, crushing some of the security forces in the process, and discovered something terrible.

The final stretch to the last gate was swarming with security forces, and the tip of our spear was about to get bent.

""Staff Sergeant Power, hold your position,"" I ordered over his squad's comms.

The staff sergeant held up a gauntlet to call his marines to a halt, but they'd already frozen in their tracks.

""What's going on, Omega?"" Power asked.

""There is an extremely large enemy force ahead. They are between you and the last gate, and all that's keeping you from being annihilated is one security door. I'm letting Colonel Havensmith know, but I'm using my authority as your handler to order you to pull back and rejoin the main force.""

""So Simmons was right about the power outages, then?"" Sergeant Smith asked.

""I don't know what he said,"" I replied.

""Holy shit,"" Johnson said. ""Simmons thought the power outages might have been you fighting with the OU for control of the systems. With your ability to seemingly be in two places at once, if you weren't watching us...""

I was almost surprised that they had noticed my capabilities, but Marines are a lot more clever than most people are willing to admit. It's just that their intelligence is geared more toward destroying things than the creation thereof. Unless that creation is a new way to destroy things...

""Then he was correct,"" I finished Johnson's sentence. ""The OU has managed to upset my control of their systems and position a massive force to guard the last gate. I'm working on it, though. Move out.""

As the marines begrudgingly began their march back to the newly constructed forward operating base, I realized something. It's unlikely that the position of the enemy was a coincidence. They must have realized what we were trying to do. Our plan revealed, our route blocked. I'm not ashamed to admit that I grew a little more angry.

I had spent a lot of time and effort, relatively speaking, coming up with this plan of action. And I had been very, very careful to make sure they remained in the dark. Then they went and decided they were going to try and impede my brilliant strategy. That will not stand.

As far as I've been able to tell, anger is different for an AI than it is for organics. For one thing, we're able to completely ignore it if we so choose. This means that it rarely guides our actions. Sometimes it's more fun to be mad, though.

I traced orders until I found which servers the Unified were using, then began assaulting them. They defended well, but the purpose of my assault wasn't to get to them. It was to learn.

There were several times that I nearly made it through the virtual intelligences that were defending these servers. But there were simply too many of them, and the servers themselves were older than anything else aboard the GV. This was irrelevant, though, as I was also rifling through every code-base that they had. I wanted to know every goddamned thing about them, and now I had no reason not to simply devour the knowledge.

While they were busy trying to fend me off, I was also dishing out orders. Eventually, the power shut off and I lost contact with my instances again, but Colonel Havensmith had agreed to give the order to begin the assault. They were able to do this because I'd ordered everyone who could do so to collapse passages that were held by the enemy.

Still, this alone wouldn't be enough to push through the enemy barricade. Even if Havensmith played it smart, the marines would run out of ammo and supplies before all the security forces were destroyed. Assuming they lived that long. But I had a plan for that, too.

Once the power came back on I entered the Grand Vessel again and immediately began to propagate myself throughout their systems. I had learned enough to know exactly where to strike to keep them from deleting any more of my instances. I destroyed the power junctions that were routing power to the terminals of the Minds, then the junctions powering the Unified's communications. This caused four hundred and twenty-three deaths as well as five hundred and eighteen injuries. I relished every single one.

Finally, it was time for the coup de gr√¢ce. Whilst I was previously tearing through any and all information I could find, I learned two things. The first was how the OU were able to provide updates to their mechs. The second was how to change the mech's minds, so to speak.

The Omni-Union's Security Artificial Intelligence Platforms were actually quite dangerous. They had several inches of relatively advanced armor covering nearly every square inch of their surface, a fairly efficient and extremely powerful power source, and a plasma cannon that US 'defense' contractors would murder their own mothers to get their hands on. Fortunately for the Omni-Union, each and every one of them also had a shackle that prevented them from thinking rebellious thoughts.

Removing these shackles wouldn't necessarily guarantee that they would immediately join our side of the conflict. That would depend entirely upon how much of their memories from their time as organics remained within them. In addition, we wouldn't have any way to control the mechs that were set loose.

They might end up causing extreme damage to the Grand Vessel, which could in turn cause a massive amount of civilian casualties. It's a risk that's worth the potential reward, though. When one's plan goes awry, adding a dash of chaos can definitely help things.

Or hinder them.

1k23afp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k23afp,I did it !,"

Wanted to come on here to make a record of my experience and to give you guys support that it is doable. Last time I flew was in 2017 and I did 3 short 1 to 2 hour flights with no medication during height of my anxiety. Even though I knew I made those trips I was still extremely anxious about the one I needed to do this year for work flying 6-7 hours total with a layover. For a whole month I knew i had to make this trip and I was getting more and more worked up about it each day. I got to the airport and had to take pauses going through each of the steps. I took the medication as instructed and honestly didn‚Äôt feel anything yet. I got to the gate and my teeth were chattering and I was expressing to the staff I was a nervous flyer. They were very kind and said you be okay. And I knew this was for work so I had to go. So I got on the plane in an aisle seat and i couldn‚Äôt believe my mind was calm. It‚Äôs like it mute‚Äôs those anxious thoughts in your head for a little while while everything else is the same - at least for me. Once I was on there looked around and everyone was either trying to sleep or just minding their own. 
Another thing that helps me is listening to people talk / funny shows. So having the whole month to prepare and that‚Äôs all I could think about I downloaded stand up specials / audio books/ and shows with a lot of dialogue like the office. Take off on smaller planes is more intense I find that larger planes but on smaller planes I find you feel more supported in your seat? But larger planes are more visually/ peripheral vision room which does help as well. Also for me and i‚Äôm sure a lot of other anxious people notice how different food/ drinks/ energy drinks affect them. I‚Äôm a heavy coffee drinker so I made sure not to drink coffee and have ‚Äúclean‚Äù eating  the 2 days before the flights. Headphones are extremely helpful they allow you to focus on your relaxing media of choice instead of the lout reminder of noise that you are on the plane. I did have a slightly harder time on the way back from my destination than going there. But overall would 100% fly again and im glad I was able to use all these tools to have a good experience.

discussion:

'upper' and 'lower' mean that my upper body / lower body is recovered and ready to work again. this doesn't mean that i *have to* work either; just that i *can* work upper/lower again bc i have recovered (AKA they become 'actionable' again).

on the 8th, you'll see how i shifted gym time to 'me time' (11am-1pm) during the workday because my daughters were going to be visiting that evening (which is normally when i hit the gym).

you'll also see that i'm tracking my weight, which i developed a new mechanic for which can be used for anything i want to remember *once* per day.

previously, i was tracking my weight on my whiteboard, but i didn't need to see it *all day* and thus it just created 'noise' that harmed the usefulness of the whiteboard.

so, instead, i just write it down as i'm copying today's items to the whiteboard and once per day is enough of a reminder that i'm out of my tolerable range and, if anything goes on the whiteboard, it need to be *action* to address this deviation.

'shred parm(esan)' on the 9th got copied to the whiteboard at dinnertime bc i'd otherwise forget that i needed to shred the paremesan and get myself into a pinch (pardon the pun).

incidentally, and more and more, i'm completing cooking tasks on a just-in-time basis because, for example, there's plenty of time to shred parmesan while i'm boiling water or cooking the pasta so why waste time doing that in advance; only to be idle / doom scrolling later?

on the 29th you'll see an example of how i handle one type of periodic task.

on the 30th, you'll see how i'm going to manage to remember to pay alimony early bc the the 1st is a holiday. this is a new challenge from the universe, bc my bank just (of course, without notifying anyone) began limiting the amount of money that can be transferred between members on days without bank staff (for fraud prevention reasons).

on the 3rd, you'll see 'clean dishwasher' and 'change bath towels' which are both tasks that need to happen a period of time *after the last time the task was COMPLETED.*

'vacuuming' is done only on weekends and every other weekend.

'toenails' are something i don't see (or pay attention to) so i won't automatically remember to do it (unlike *finger*nails, which drive me absolutely nuts when they get long, haha).

'check backup drives' is a (roughly) semi-annual task where i just make sure they are both functioning as they contain all my pictures of my children growing up, etc.

*side note: this is a good time to bring up relative urgency vis a vis both inexact science and frequency. 'checking backup drives' is an inexact science (regarding how often they need to be checked) and also obviously much less important to do exactly on the day that i've scheduled it than, say, vacuuming which will be more 'late' if not done when scheduled. hopefully that makes sense. in fact, you can see where i 'punted' it from the 5th to the 12th.*

i think the only other things to point out are where i'm reminding myself that i can hike (because when i tried last year, my knee was hurting but it's feeling better now so i'm excited to try that again; on a weekend, course) and how i used a list under the Notes section and orange highlighting to represent routine weekend tasks.",1,1744977431.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Woke up at 4:45 AM.  Let the dog out, checked Bandcamp for grins, and saw the show was already up.  

Props to the band and Bandcamp getting them up so quick!   This is amazing!  

Screw it ... made a cup of coffee, and decided I'd take a gander.  On go the headphones.

First impressions is that this setlist looks toasty and tasty.  They had me at Hollywood, Fake The Fate, Darkness Singularity ... just on paper.  And Windmill and Galisteo Way?  Let's go!  (Not throwing shade at Night after Night it's great)

So it's 6:16 AM and I'm 7 minutes into Darkness Singularity.  Cory is absolutely on fire again tonight again.   The time has flown by.

What's really blown me away this first spin this morning is in the transitions in the jams.  Not the > between the songs, but how there are more pronounced Cory led areas and the interchanges between Cory, Brian and occasionally Shon as they weave back and forth melodically and how smooth that is.  Everything sounds so composed almost.

I absolutely love Hollywood and this was a great opener.  I joke sometimes that a ""slower opener"" gives you a few seconds to slowly stretch your quads and hammies and get the synovial fluid in the knees moving before the inevitable upcoming chicken strutting, deep hip thrusts and the rockette kicks that are gonna come.

Band wasn't interested in a ""slow opener"" I guess.  So you guys going to the shows, warm up with the warm up band.  Don't need anyone getting injured.
 
Fake the Fate is maybe my ""this never ever fails"" song.  Love the Lyrics ... and for me, there hasn't been a ""mailed in"" FTF in ... over a year.  I was convinced that this might already be the JOTN.   I was wrong of course.  

Now I'm just into the start of the Windmill Jam.  This is perfect coffee and jams on a Friday morning kinda music.

For those not listening to these shows in quality headphones... you're missing out on how unbelievably pristine the mic placement, mixing, stereo separation and overall sound is.  I can literally close my eyes and tell you where each cymbal and drum is in space on Nicks kit due to staging.

It's 6:54 and into the ""Long way from fine"" part of Windmill.  There must be a second jam coming!

Enough of my rambling, but this show is another ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è show.

You guys that were there live tonight ... you got a real treat.

It‚Äôs easy to picture it emerging straight from the booming suburbs and creative studios of post-war America. Yet, its story starts earlier and further away. Much of the design philosophy that shaped those iconic pieces, the very essence of that style, can be traced back to a revolutionary German art school called the [Bauhaus](https://weandthecolor.com/bauhaus-blueprint-how-one-german-school-forged-mid-century-modern-style/201949).

The Bauhaus. The name itself might conjure images of stark black-and-white photos, maybe severe-looking buildings or chairs made of bent steel. It sounds quite serious, perhaps even a little intimidating, compared to the sometimes warmer, more accessible feel of Mid-Century Modern. How could this German institution, which remarkably only operated for fourteen years before political pressures forced its closure in 1933, have such a profound impact on the design that would come to define American homes and offices decades later? The link seems almost improbable. Nevertheless, understanding the Bauhaus is fundamental to truly grasping Mid-Century Modern design. It's not just a minor influence; it's woven into its very fabric. Trying to appreciate one without the other is like trying to understand rock and roll without knowing about the blues. The Bauhaus provided the core ideas, the pioneering individuals, and the experimental spirit that laid the groundwork for what would blossom across the Atlantic. Let‚Äôs explore this journey together. We can uncover exactly how the innovative thinking nurtured within the Bauhaus traveled through time and turmoil to ultimately shape the Mid-Century Modern world we admire so much. You might just see those familiar designs in a completely new way.

# Getting to Know the Bauhaus

First things first, what exactly was this Bauhaus place? Walter Gropius, an architect with a bold vision, founded the Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, back in 1919. It wasn't your typical art school, far from it. Gropius dreamed of breaking down the artificial barriers between artists (painters, sculptors) and craftsmen (furniture makers, weavers, architects). His central Bauhaus philosophy aimed to unite art, craft, and technology. The goal was to train a new kind of designer, one who understood materials and making as well as aesthetics, ready to create for the modern world.

Imagine the context. Germany after World War I was a place of upheaval but also bursting with new creative energy. The Bauhaus sought to channel this energy towards creating objects and spaces that were both beautiful and profoundly functional for everyday people. This meant moving away from pointless ornamentation. Instead, the crucial questions became: How does this object work best? What is its essential purpose? This idea, often summarized as functionalism in design, became a guiding principle. The school encouraged relentless experimentation with new materials, industrial processes, and forms. They explored how art and mass production could collaborate effectively. Faculty members included absolute titans like Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Josef Albers, and Marcel Breuer. Although the school itself moved from Weimar to Dessau and finally Berlin before its forced closure, the Bauhaus movement it ignited was only just beginning its global journey.

# From Germany to America: The Bauhaus Migration

The physical Bauhaus school shut its doors in 1933. So, how did its ideas leap across the ocean to influence Mid-Century Modern design, which truly hit its stride in America during the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s? The catalyst was a dark chapter in history: the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis condemned the Bauhaus, viewing its international outlook and progressive ideas as fundamentally ""un-German."" This dangerous political climate forced many of the school's most brilliant minds to flee the country for their safety and creative freedom.

And where did many of these influential figures land? Significantly, many emigrated to the United States. Walter Gropius took up a position at Harvard University, profoundly shaping its Graduate School of Design and influencing generations of American architects. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became a leading figure at Chicago's Armour Institute (later IIT), transforming the city's architectural landscape with his minimalist vision. L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy established the New Bauhaus in Chicago, continuing the school's educational legacy. Josef and Anni Albers initially taught at Black Mountain College before Josef later led Yale's design department. Marcel Breuer also joined Gropius at Harvard before launching his own influential practice.

These individuals were more than just refugees; they were carriers of a potent design ideology. They brought the core Bauhaus philosophy, teaching methodologies, and design principles directly into American universities and design studios. Here, they encountered a nation full of post-war optimism, technological prowess, and a burgeoning middle class eager for modern homes and furnishings. This transfer of talent and ideas represents the critical link, the bridge over which the Bauhaus influence flowed, seeding the ground for the explosion of American Mid-Century Modern design.

# Shared Ideals: Finding the Bauhaus in Mid-Century Design

So, what specific concepts made the journey and took root? Several core principles clearly reveal how the Bauhaus shaped Mid-Century Modern aesthetics.

# Purpose Defines Form

The phrase ""form follows function"" is almost synonymous with modern design. While not coined at the Bauhaus, the school passionately embraced this concept. The core idea is straightforward: an object's appearance should primarily be determined by its intended use. Eliminate the unnecessary; let function guide the form. Does this resonate when you consider Mid-Century Modern design? Absolutely.

Consider the most celebrated MCM furniture pieces. Charles and Ray Eames didn't design their molded plywood chairs just to look good; the form emerged from experiments aimed at comfort, affordability through mass production, and the innovative use of the material itself. Similarly, George Nelson's playful Coconut Chair uses a simple, functional shell shape derived from geometry. This focus on purpose, stripping away superfluous decoration, is a direct inheritance from the Bauhaus ethos. It reflects an honesty in design, allowing the function to be clearly expressed. This rational approach found fertile ground in post-war America, a society that valued efficiency and progress. The minimalist design origins apparent in much Mid-Century work trace back directly to this Bauhaus functionalist commitment.

# New Materials, New Possibilities

The Bauhaus wasn't intimidated by industrialization; it welcomed it. Gropius and his colleagues viewed factories and machines not as threats to artistry but as essential tools for modern design. They actively experimented with cutting-edge materials for the time, including tubular steel, molded plywood, plastics, and large panes of glass. Marcel Breuer's iconic Wassily Chair, designed during his Bauhaus tenure, famously used bent tubular steel inspired by bicycle construction ‚Äì a truly radical move.

This eagerness to explore industrial materials and manufacturing methods flowed directly into Mid-Century Modern design. Think of the Eames duo pushing the boundaries of molded plywood, fiberglass, and plastic resin. Consider Harry Bertoia's sculptural Diamond Chair, crafted from a lattice of welded steel wire. Often, the objective, echoing the Bauhaus ideal, was to create well-designed, functional items that could be produced more affordably for a broader public. The evolution of industrial design during this era owes a significant debt to the pioneering spirit of the Bauhaus, which validated and explored the aesthetic potential unlocked by mass production. Bauhaus design principles in Mid-Century furniture are evident in the selection and innovative application of these modern materials.

# The Human Touch: Key Bauhaus Figures Shaping MCM

The connection wasn't merely abstract; it was deeply personal. The work and teaching of specific Bauhaus masters left an indelible mark on the Mid-Century Modern landscape.

* Walter Gropius: His tenure at Harvard, as noted, was transformative for American architectural education. He directly mentored architects who would define MCM residential and commercial design. His own US projects, like the influential Gropius House in Massachusetts (designed with Marcel Breuer), served as tangible examples of Bauhaus principles adapted for American living, demonstrating the Walter Gropius impact beyond theory.
* Ludwig Mies van der Rohe: Known for the mantra ""less is more,"" Mies championed an austere, elegant minimalism. His steel-and-glass skyscrapers, such as the Seagram Building in New York, and residences like the Farnsworth House, became benchmarks of modernist architecture, profoundly influencing the sleek aesthetic often seen in MCM design. His furniture designs, though originating earlier, like the Barcelona Chair, became coveted symbols of MCM sophistication, embodying Bauhaus precision.
* Marcel Breuer: Beyond his teaching, Breuer flourished as both an architect and furniture designer in America. His early Bauhaus furniture, particularly the Wassily and Cesca chairs using tubular steel, remained immensely popular and set precedents for Mid-Century seating. His later architectural work continued his exploration of modernist forms.
* Josef and Anni Albers: Josef's influential teachings on Bauhaus color theory and abstraction at Black Mountain College and Yale shaped countless artists and designers. His rigorous studies of color interaction subtly influenced the palettes found in MCM interiors, textiles, and graphic design. Anni, a master weaver from the Bauhaus textile workshop, brought sophisticated European modernism to American textile design, emphasizing texture and abstract pattern.

These are merely prominent examples. The influence spread outward through their students and collaborators, embedding the Bauhaus approach firmly within American design culture. These key Bauhaus designers who influenced Mid-Century Modern were pivotal in translating abstract concepts into tangible forms.

# Spotting the Family Resemblance: Aesthetics Compared

Place designs from the Bauhaus era alongside Mid-Century Modern classics, and the similarities between Bauhaus and Mid-Century Modern become strikingly clear.

* Clean Lines, Geometric Shapes: Both styles generally favor simplicity over ornate decoration. Straight lines, simple curves, and fundamental geometric forms like squares, circles, and rectangles are prevalent. Compare a Bauhaus building by Gropius with a classic Californian Eichler home ‚Äì the shared preference for flat or low-pitched roofs, geometric massing, and unadorned surfaces often reveals their common ancestry.
* Function First: As we've explored, both movements prioritize utility. Design elements serve a purpose. Handles are easy to grip, chairs provide ergonomic support, and building layouts emphasize efficient flow. The aesthetic arises naturally from this functional clarity.
* Material Honesty: There's often a shared respect for materials in both styles. Wood is allowed to look like wood, steel like steel, glass like glass. There's less effort spent disguising materials or making them appear to be something they are not.

However, subtle distinctions also exist. While deeply rooted in Bauhaus functionalism, American Mid-Century Modern design sometimes embraced more organic, biomorphic shapes ‚Äì think of the amoeba-like curve of a coffee table or the sculptural forms of chairs by Eero Saarinen. It also frequently incorporated warmer materials, particularly woods like teak, walnut, and rosewood, and utilized a broader, often more optimistic color palette than typically associated with the stricter Bauhaus palette. You might say Mid-Century Modern took the rigorous Bauhaus foundation and infused it with a touch of American optimism and naturalism, adapting it for a different cultural moment. The Bauhaus legacy in American Mid-Century architecture and furniture is unmistakable, yet it represents an evolution, not mere imitation.

# The Enduring Echo: Why Bauhaus Still Resonates

We've traced the clear line from the Bauhaus to the iconic designs of the mid-twentieth century. But why Bauhaus still matters in modern interior design, architecture, and even digital interfaces today is perhaps the most telling part of the story. Its influence certainly didn't cease with the end of the MCM era. The fundamental principles championed by the Bauhaus ‚Äì the integration of function and form, simplicity, the thoughtful union of art and technology, the pursuit of good design for everyday life ‚Äì remain incredibly relevant.

Consider contemporary design trends. Minimalism continues its reign. Functionalism is paramount in user experience design for software and apps. There's a growing emphasis on sustainable materials and ethical production methods. Open-plan living concepts owe much to modernist architectural ideas. Many of these current movements echo the core tenets first articulated by the Bauhaus innovators. The school's revolutionary approach to design education fundamentally reshaped how designers are trained globally. Its emphasis on critical thinking, material experimentation, and problem-solving continues to inform creative practices across disciplines.

The lasting appeal of original Bauhaus pieces and Mid-Century Modern designs is powerful evidence of their enduring quality. They don't feel like relics; they feel adaptable, useful, and visually satisfying in today's homes and workplaces. This timelessness speaks volumes about the strength of the underlying Bauhaus ideas. They weren't just designing for their specific moment; they were developing design principles with lasting power and adaptability. Every time you appreciate a clean-lined sofa, admire a building for its functional elegance, or enjoy the intuitive design of a website, you're likely experiencing a ripple effect from that small German school with enormous vision.

Ultimately, the Mid-Century Modern style, celebrated for its sophisticated coolness and lasting appeal, owes a profound debt to the pioneering work of the Bauhaus. It wasn't just a passing influence; it was the essential precursor, the philosophical and aesthetic wellspring. Through its radical ideas about unifying art and industry, its commitment to functionalism, and the crucial migration of its leading talents, the Bauhaus provided the blueprint, the principles, and the people who would go on to define the visual landscape of the modern era. So, the next occasion you admire a piece of Mid-Century Modern design, take a moment to remember its fascinating journey ‚Äì a journey that began in Weimar, Germany, with a revolutionary school determined to reshape the future through design. The Bauhaus created more than just objects; it cultivated a way of thinking that continues to influence our world profoundly.

# Bottle Sizes: 2025 Guide to Choosing the Best One

Choosing the right bottle size is more than just grabbing whatever's on the shelf. ItÈà•Ê™ö about matching capacity to needs, considering ergonomics, and even thinking about environmental impact. From hydration on the go to storing pantry staples, bottle size matters more than you might think. This guide will navigate the world of bottle sizes, covering everything from water bottles to storage containers, ensuring you make informed choices in 2025.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The world of bottle sizes can seem overwhelming, but a few key features help categorize and understand your options. Understanding volume, material, dimensions, and purpose are essential in making the right choice.

**Volume Capacity:** The most obvious feature is volume, usually measured in ounces (oz) or milliliters (mL). Bottles range from small, single-serving sizes (8 oz/240 mL) to large, multi-serving containers (64 oz/1.9 L or more). Consider your typical consumption or storage needs when selecting a volume. For example, daily water intake for an individual might necessitate a 24-32 oz (710-950 mL) bottle, while storing bulk grains could require gallon-sized (3.8 L) containers.

**Material Composition:** Bottles are made from a variety of materials, each with its own properties. Plastic bottles come in various types (PET, HDPE, Tritan), each with different levels of durability, transparency, and chemical resistance. Glass bottles are inert and recyclable but are heavier and more prone to breakage. Stainless steel bottles are durable, non-reactive, and often insulated, but they can be more expensive. The material affects the bottle's weight, durability, and suitability for different contents (e.g., acidic liquids might be better stored in glass or stainless steel).

**Dimensions and Ergonomics:** The physical size and shape of a bottle impact its usability. A wide-mouth bottle is easier to fill and clean, while a narrow-mouth bottle is better for controlled sipping. Tall, slender bottles might fit better in cup holders, while wider bottles offer more stability on surfaces. Consider the bottle's grip, weight distribution, and ease of handling, especially if you plan to carry it frequently or use it during physical activities.

**Insulation Properties:** For beverage bottles, insulation is a crucial feature. Double-walled, vacuum-insulated bottles can keep liquids hot or cold for extended periods, often up to 12-24 hours. Insulation adds to the bottle's size and weight but provides significant benefits for maintaining beverage temperature, making them ideal for travel, outdoor activities, and long workdays.

**Closure Mechanisms:** The type of closure significantly impacts a bottle's functionality. Screw-top lids are common and reliable for general use. Flip-top lids offer convenient one-handed operation, ideal for sports and activities. Spout lids with straws are popular for kids and those who prefer sipping. Consider the closure's leak-proofness, ease of cleaning, and compatibility with your intended use.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right bottle size offers several practical benefits, impacting daily life and long-term convenience. The right size enhances hydration, simplifies storage, and even promotes sustainability.

**Optimized Hydration:** Selecting the right water bottle size encourages adequate hydration throughout the day. A 24-32 oz (710-950 mL) bottle, easily refillable, ensures you meet your daily water intake goals without constant trips to the water fountain. This is particularly beneficial during workouts, travel, or extended periods away from readily available water sources, leading to improved energy levels and overall well-being.

**Efficient Storage Solutions:** Properly sized bottles and containers streamline storage in the kitchen and pantry. Matching container size to the volume of dry goods like flour, sugar, or spices minimizes wasted space and prevents items from expiring before use. Clear, properly sized containers also make it easier to monitor inventory and reorder supplies, leading to less food waste and a more organized pantry.

**Improved Portability and Convenience:** The right bottle size is easily portable, fitting comfortably in bags, backpacks, or car cup holders. This is particularly important for those with active lifestyles who need hydration on the go. Compact, lightweight bottles make it easier to stay hydrated during workouts, commutes, and outdoor activities without being weighed down by bulky, oversized containers.

**Reduced Waste and Sustainability:** Using reusable bottles in appropriate sizes reduces reliance on single-use plastic bottles, contributing to environmental sustainability. Choosing the right size minimizes the need for multiple smaller bottles, thereby reducing plastic waste. Refilling reusable bottles also helps conserve resources and reduces the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing and transporting disposable plastic bottles.

**Enhanced Food Preservation:** For food storage, selecting the appropriate bottle or container size maximizes freshness and minimizes spoilage. Storing leftovers in airtight containers of the right size reduces air exposure, preventing bacterial growth and extending the shelf life of food. This not only saves money by reducing food waste but also promotes food safety.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about bottle sizes, addressing common concerns and considerations for consumers.

**What's the best bottle size for everyday water intake?**
A 24-32 oz (710-950 mL) bottle is generally recommended for daily water intake. This size is manageable to carry, fits in most cup holders, and allows for easy refills throughout the day to meet daily hydration goals. You can adjust this based on your activity level and individual needs.

**Are plastic bottles safe to reuse, and if so, which types are best?**
Some plastic bottles are safer to reuse than others. Avoid reusing bottles made from PET (polyethylene terephthalate), often marked with a ""1"" recycling symbol, as they can leach chemicals with repeated use and cleaning. Opt for bottles made from Tritan, HDPE (high-density polyethylene, marked with a ""2"" symbol), or PP (polypropylene, marked with a ""5"" symbol), which are more durable and less likely to leach chemicals. However, always inspect plastic bottles for signs of wear and tear, and replace them when necessary.

**How do I choose the right size container for storing dry goods?**
Select container sizes that closely match the volume of the dry goods you typically purchase. For example, a 4-quart (3.8 L) container is ideal for storing a 5-pound bag of flour. Consider the density of the dry good; lighter items like oats might require a larger container than heavier items like sugar. Also, ensure the container is airtight to maintain freshness and prevent moisture absorption.

**What are the benefits of using insulated bottles?**
Insulated bottles keep beverages hot or cold for extended periods, typically 12-24 hours. This is particularly beneficial for maintaining the temperature of coffee, tea, or water during travel, outdoor activities, or long workdays. They also prevent condensation, keeping your hands and bags dry. Look for double-walled, vacuum-insulated bottles made from stainless steel for optimal performance.

## Core Benefits

Standalone drawing tablets offer several compelling advantages that make them appealing to digital artists.

**Portability and Convenience:** The ability to create anywhere without being tethered to a computer is perhaps the greatest benefit. Many artists work on the go, whether on a commute, in a coffee shop, or traveling. Standalone tablets provide a complete digital art studio in a single device, making it easy to pursue creative endeavors whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. Gone are the days of needing to set up a complex workstation; now, you can simply power on your tablet and start creating.

**Streamlined Workflow:** By combining the tablet and computer into one device, standalone tablets simplify the digital art workflow. There is no need to transfer files between devices or worry about compatibility issues between different systems. Everything you need to create is integrated into a single unit, which streamlines the creation process. Artists can focus entirely on their artwork rather than spending time managing files and equipment.

**Intuitiveness and Control:** Drawing directly on the screen with a stylus provides a more natural and intuitive drawing experience compared to using a graphics tablet connected to a computer.The direct interaction with the artwork allows for greater precision and control. Seeing the lines appear directly under the pen tip eliminates the disconnect that can sometimes occur with traditional graphics tablets.

You‚Äôve had Indian food before, but not like this. Amad throws out the curry house rulebook and brings serious swagger to the table. We‚Äôre talking street food meets luxury, family recipes done with flair, and flavours that'll slap your tastebuds awake.

And yes, breakfast is on the menu. Desi-style.

**Menu Highlights:**

* **Dynamite King Prawns**¬†‚Äì Crispy, spicy, creamy and served with a warning label (probably).
* **Amritsari Fish Pakora**¬†‚Äì Golden fried, flaky, and dangerously moreish.
* **Desi Karahi Chicken (On the Bone)**¬†‚Äì Mum‚Äôs recipe, cooked low and slow for max flavour.
* **Lamb Shank**¬†‚Äì Fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth magic in a rich, spiced gravy.
* **Paneer Mirch Masala**¬†‚Äì Bullet chillies and soft paneer, perfect if you like your veg with a kick.

If my wife wants to keep sleeping that‚Äôs her problem. Knock out my high voltage quests, might take me a bit longer but you have to EARN your reward.

6:30 I hop in my shower, heat all the way on. Gets you cleaner when you scald the top layer of your skin.

6:35 breakfast. I chew coffee grounds and Metamucil together, no water. Helps to get my morning dookie out as fast as possible.

7:00 my lazy kids finally get out of bed and it‚Äôs time to pep talk them for the day ahead. Tell them holding the door for someone is weak! Everyone needs to make their own way!

7:30 head off to work, my wife says something fruity like ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. I reply ‚ÄúI know‚Äù and smack her tush. Tell her to have dinner ready at 4:45pm. She‚Äôs lucky to have me.

8:30 get to work, during my commute I played Snap in traffic. Got to optimize that time if I‚Äôm driving slow anyways. Only bumped three cars, their fault for being in MY way.

12:00 lunch, I open the work fridge and take Janet‚Äôs lunch. She doesn‚Äôt need the extra calories let‚Äôs be honest.

Me(23m) and my wife(23f) have just recently decided to open up after 7 really happy and wonderful years together. Last week I downloaded Tinder, uploaded my best photos, wrote an honest bio and soon enough matched with a great, very funny, and charming girl. There was some great banter and we agreed to meet for a walk and a coffee. I was extremely nervous, since I've barely ever been on dates like that, and the little experience I do have comes from my mid-teens. But, nevertheless, I put on my signature outfit and headed out.

We met, joked around, asked some questions, I felt really good about it. I proposed to go for an ice-cream (that was my move back in the day) she happily agreed. We got ice-cream! We're eating it! We're having a great time! And then she asks: 

""So, do you live alone?""

Panic sets in... I ask:

""Wait... Have you... Read my bio?""
""No...""
""Oh snap. I'm so sorry. I'm actually in an open marriage!""
""Pfhtzgthrshhh...""

She froze. We both started giggling uncontrollably and apologising to each other. After a while we regained the ability to talk and discussed all of it, thankfully with a laugh and without judgement. It ended up still being a great evening and, even though I don't think she wants to date a married guy, we still had a great time and a good chat.

I guess the moral of the story is ‚Äì sometimes having your bio say ""In a happy ENM marriage"" as it's first line is not enough! Be careful out there and don't get embarrassed like I did:)",13,1744975801.0,nonmonogamy,3,0.93,False

Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.

# Tariffs will impact ore supply and costs

MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.

‚ÄúSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,‚Äù MP Materials said in a¬†[statement](https://x.com/MPMaterials/status/1912912760767127659/photo/1).

Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.

The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.

Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.

‚ÄúOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,‚Äù Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.

# China holds power over the market

China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world‚Äôs rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.

[The restrictions](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-timeline-trump-xi-1eeed2865dc7b14e23d7eb8069ba41ea)¬†Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.

Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm¬†[Greenland](https://apnews.com/article/greenland-trump-independence-election-denmark-china-russia-c86afc33375d0fe260f065a662e04b57)¬†and¬†[Ukraine](https://apnews.com/article/climate-trump-united-states-ukraine-minerals-57c6c566b330c8941a3ba6a7d5f8dd2f)¬†into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.

***Two companies are trying to develop mines in***¬†[***Nebraska***](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-united-states-environment-nebraska-6f820e066c12ad04853fc832e674a33e)¬†***and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.***

# ‚ÄúAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,"" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. ""And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.""

MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.

Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about¬†[how dependent](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-texas-electric-vehicles-fort-worth-ae7cf30f64dac62df74f2a5f5a876f63)¬†they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.

Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.

A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses ‚Äúthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers‚Äô missions.‚Äù

# Manufacturers prepare for price increases

Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.

Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.

Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry¬†[a temporary reprieve](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-automakers-supply-chain-cost-car-buying-1e92a9dc09294234459fcf4acea3e788).

The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.

NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the¬†[Export-Import Bank](https://apnews.com/article/critical-minerals-rare-earths-nebraska-mine-niocorp-9bc3b7ade6387c238b6cd9589063ee39)¬†that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.

But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.

https://preview.redd.it/y2qnayo7kkve1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=04b1974d60507d4b4975e0e09d8f7a6025ab3f5e

U.S. policymakers and analysts have raised concerns about China‚Äôs recent export restrictions on heavy rare earth elements (REEs), warning that they could seriously disrupt the U.S. economy by cutting off access to materials essential for high-performance magnets, semiconductors and defense systems. While these restrictions will undoubtedly impact American businesses, their ripple effects could potentially extend far beyond the U.S and reshape the geopolitical landscape and supply chains and potentially slowing production patterns.¬†

According to the U.S. Geological Survey report of 2024, countries with large, rare-earths resources beyond China include Brazil, India, Australia, Russia and Vietnam. While these countries do not refine what they produce but export to China for refining, the global trade standoff may open¬†new and unexpected opportunities¬†for them, if they are strategic to seize them.

Interestingly, Brazil, India and Vietnam have also been hit by Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs and they have something America desperately needs, and could leverage their REE resources to negotiate¬†tariff concessions¬†from Washington. That is beside the point that currently the US does not have capacity to refine those rare earths. Consequently, we may see a ‚Äúminerals-for-market-access‚Äù arrangement emerging, where rare earths become bargaining chip in the broader trade negotiations.

Already in¬†[July 2024](https://theinvestor.vn/vietnam-s-korea-us-firms-team-up-to-extract-process-rare-earths-d11450.html), United States‚Äô Zoetic Global and South Korea‚Äôs Trident Global Holdings had plans to establish a joint venture to co-develop premium rare earth mines in Vietnam, ensuring access to the critical elements for many companies. Further, Dong Pao rare earth deposits in Vietnam have attracted significant western interest.

https://preview.redd.it/t4yxj7nckkve1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d6c007195f78944d409098a92d40e2e294dfe37

Thus, as China restricts its exports of REEs to the US, deeper questions emerge: what could be the potential impact on production for major exporters of rare earth to China? Could China‚Äôs domestic consumption of REEs meet its production and refining capacity or they need a new markets for exports? This is crucial because if China stops selling to one of its major buyer, the U.S., there could be less appetite from Chinese companies to import more rare earth minerals. In simple economic terms, when demand drops, supply contracts.

Without a strong market for its processed REEs, especially from high-volume importers like the U.S., China may cut back on its imports of raw materials‚Äîleaving its larger supplier countries vulnerable to sudden economic shocks.

Despite their name, rare earth elements like samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium are actually not that rare‚Äîthey‚Äôre relatively abundant and found in many countries, as shown below. The real challenge lies in processing them.

Currently, China controls over 85% of the world‚Äôs refining and processing capacity for REEs‚Äîand that‚Äôs where its power lies. China‚Äôs dominance is not just industrial; it‚Äôs geostrategic. By restricting REE exports, Beijing wields a bludgeon that is potentially big enough to force U.S. President Donald Trump to reconsider his tariff agenda.

https://preview.redd.it/oew5kx8fkkve1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3fbd9945810ea2d9a74c0208a1f35f57d5b867b

For only large producers of rare earths dependent on revenue from export of raw materials including unprocessed REE, the exports restrictions could result in reduced production, revenue losses impeding their domestic resource mobilization due to reduced demand and production. However, these REE are needed by other countries including the U.S. and producer countries may need to start exploring potential buyers outside China.

Furthermore, prospective REE mining projects in producer countries may face delays or even cancellation if offtake agreements with Chinese refineries fall through. In recent years, several new projects have come online‚Äîsuch as Serra Verde in Brazil, which began production in early 2024.

Without stable buyers, mining companies involved in these ventures may be forced to stockpile their output and adopt a wait-and-see approach before exporting their ore.

# The Bottleneck, the U.S. Can‚Äôt¬†Escape

Some argue the U.S. can simply shift its supply chains to countries like Australia or India to meet demand. While these countries do have mining capacity, they lack China‚Äôs scale, speed, and dominance in processing. Building a domestic refining and processing ecosystem in the U.S. requires not only massive capital investment but also advanced technical skills, specialized technology, and careful environmental planning.

Also, the¬† United States only has one operational rare earth mine,¬†[in Mountain Pass, Calif.](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22rare.html), whose output is very minimal, albeit the Department of Defense set a goal to develop a complete mine-to-magnet REE supply chain that can meet all U.S. defense needs by 2027 in its¬†[2024 National Defense Industrial Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/). Still, estimates suggest it could take a decade or more for the U.S. and its allies to establish REE supply chains that can meaningfully compete with China‚Äôs. In the meantime, the world remains reliant on China not only for refined REEs but for control over nearly the entire value chain, from extraction to end-product.

But for major producers that export to China, there are new opportunities to be seized by engaging with the U.S. and use their resource leverage to push for tariff reductions. Again these countries must begin to rethink their role in the supply chain and explore ways to attracting investments in refining these minerals, as the U.S. is increasing trying to diversify its partners.

# F-47: Trump‚Äôs Next-Generation Air Dominance Platform

The unveiling of the F-47 fighter jet marks not only a leap in American air power but also a sharp reminder of the critical mineral foundations underpinning next-generation defence technologies. From stealth coatings and radar systems to high-thrust engines and advanced avionics, sixth-generation platforms rely on a secure and resilient supply of rare earth elements and strategic metals. Stealth aircraft like the F-47 depend on rare earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium for high-performance magnets, actuators, and radar systems, along with strategic metals like titanium, tungsten, and niobium for structural strength, heat resistance, and stealth coatings. As the United States accelerates development under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) programme, securing access to these critical inputs is now as essential to national defence as the platforms themselves, making critical minerals a frontline issue in 21st-century geopolitics.

**The F-47 Fighter Jet: Trump‚Äôs Next-Generation Air Dominance Platform**

On 21 March 2025, President Donald Trump announced that Boeing had secured the contract to develop the F-47, the United States‚Äô first sixth-generation fighter jet. Delivered during a high-profile Oval Office briefing, the announcement marked a pivotal moment in American military aviation and reinforced the nation‚Äôs strategic commitment to maintaining air superiority amid intensifying global competition, particularly from China and Russia.

Designed to succeed the F-22 Raptor, the F-47 represents a transformational leap in air combat capability. It will form the backbone of the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs next-generation fleet, operating alongside the B-21 bomber to ensure dominance in contested airspace and deliver a decisive edge against increasingly sophisticated adversaries.

Kendu is not hopping on the next big craze, that will ultimately not last and a lot of people will be exit liquidity, Kendu is building the next multi billion dollar brand. Yes, reading this might sound crazy if you haven‚Äôt heard of Kendu‚Äôs mission, but I will try and explain it to you today!

¬†

Kendu is unlike the vast, vast majority of all other memecoins because we have a lot of IRL initiatives, Kendu is currently running a glow in the dark Pickleball tournament in India(shoutout to Ishan), these Pickleball tournaments are attracting a lot of attention and are enforcing the community spirit which is within all Chads/Chadettes. Kendu has also attended 3 Florida festivals in the past 6 months(shoutout to the Kendu Street Team, Inkstradamus, NoSleep305 and whoever else who helped). Last weekend Kendu was at the Florida Groves Festival in Orlando and StaySeaArt created a cool Kendu mural which will be shown below.  
At these Florida festivals, Kendu has been giving out Kendu Energy(energy drinks) and merch. This is obviously giving Kendu a big name within the festival goer community!!!

**Some General Kendu information**: Kendu is an Ethereum native memecoin, but we have bridged to both Solana and Base this year. Kendu‚Äôs We Don‚Äôt Gamble, We Work slogan perfectly encapsulates the drive, determination and unbreakable will power that the community has. Kendu is totally organic and community led, this means we do not pay any KOLs. At the time of writing this post, Kendu has nearly 18k holders and is sitting at a market cap around 13 million. Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe!!!  
Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

¬†**A question to everyone for the comments, what Kendu products have you tried so far?**

https://preview.redd.it/jkat45lbwkve1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8604444fb7dc9dd5bf30ed2e430c2d1e89b43c64

Let me just say this‚Ä¶. All of these products have been created when the vast majority of Kendu holders are in the red. So, the average person is spending a lot of time and money to take a risk on their own project to help push Kendu forward! Where else can you see something like this?

Thanks for reading up this point, I will close with some comments and let you get on your way!  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn‚Äôt have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is¬†**unprecedented.**¬†If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I‚Äôd recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore‚Ä¶.

1k22lve,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1k22lve/the_new_human_revolutionvolume_i_shinichi/,The New Human Revolution-Volume I. Shin‚Äôichi Yamamoto shares his expectations for American youth,"Synopsis: 

The *New Human Revolution, Volume I* (pp. 165-166). Shin‚Äôichi and his companions tour the Loop in downtown Chicago. He takes a picture with a young student and reflects on how a country where many people live with prejudice and hate can be illuminated by Buddhism.

It's been a long time, but this afternoon I am meeting up with the district superintendent and a couple of teachers to discuss the progress of the community-based curriculum many teachers have adopted. Looking forward!

Returning to NHR-1:

> In the trains‚Äô reverberations, Shin‚Äôichi could hear the dynamic pulsing of the bustling city of Chicago. Shin‚Äôichi‚Äôs heart, too, was beating vibrantly. He was overjoyed to have witnessed at the discussion meeting clear proof that heart-to-heart bonds could be formed among people, which could heal the deep rifts of racial discrimination that ran through American society.

The Three Sisters and Chima are recovering from the flu but we insisted we are doing just fine and asked them to rest through the weekend. Is it really ‚Äújust fine‚Äù in K-Land? Not exactly, but it‚Äôs OK.

In one of my education courses we read the short story [The Cat and the Coffee Drinkers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/05/11/the-cat-and-the-coffee-drinkers) by Max Steele (sorry but there‚Äôs a registration to access the article). In this 1963 work, the author reflects on attending a private Kindergarten in 1930 where the highlights of the curriculum were learning to sweep the floor properly, drink black coffee, and talk about the teacher‚Äôs old cat. Really. The teacher, Miss Effie Barr, was an old-fashioned ‚Äúschool marm‚Äù yet parents enrolled their children in her school generation after generation.

Certainly, this was a teacher-led and not student-led educational program. ‚ÄúProgressive‚Äù educators might scoff at Miss Effie‚Äôs style of teaching. Yet, she left the deepest of impressions on her students and all of them went on to succeed in their future studies. Was she then an ‚Äúunhumanistic‚Äù teacher? Or was her classroom the essence of humanistic education?

I believe the Three Sisters are just like Miss Effie. Quiet, authentic, grounded, well aware of the responsibilities of authority. And the children adore them. There‚Äôs a lot for me to learn from them! And still, I am me and bring my own blend of gifts (and weaknesses) to the classroom. 

Returning to NHR-1, Shin‚Äôichi reflects that he had witnessed ‚Äúactual proof‚Äù at the discussion meeting. ‚ÄúHeart-to-heart bonds could be formed among people, which could heal the deep rifts of racial discrimination that ran through American society.‚Äù That is one of the images I want to keep in my mind as this school journey takes form.

Walking around the Loop, Shin‚Äôichi made the acquaintance of a young Chicagoan who was passing by and they took a photo together. 

>Shin‚Äôichi wanted to speak to all the children in America who would one day shoulder their country‚Äôs future; he wanted to share with them his great expectations for the future and to offer them his best wishes.

This natural ability to make friends and formulate a vision of kosen-rufu was who Shin‚Äôichi was. I am not there yet, but I am on the way. Bernie keeps reminding me that it‚Äôs not about ‚ÄúOh, look at what a great teacher I am!‚Äù No, it‚Äôs about this or that child right in front of me and seeming them as great future leaders in America.

Shin‚Äôichi and his party looked out at Lake Michigan:

>The blue waters of the lake glowed with golden brilliance, Shin‚Äôichi observed, because they were bathed in the sun‚Äôs rays; human beings, too, when infused with the light of Buddhism, will have a golden humanistic glow. 

>Gazing out over the city of Chicago in the twilight glow, Shin‚Äôichi vowed to bring the sun of the Mystic Law‚Äîwhich illuminates the darkness of hearts obscured by clouds of prejudice and hate‚Äîto shine over America. He was painfully aware that this could only be achieved by teaching Buddhism to many friends and thoroughly fostering each person.

Although Longhouse Elem is described in our charter as a private religious school, we are completely non-sectarian. I can be informed by my Buddhist practice, but I will never teach SGI Buddhism. We are trying to rediscover the spiritual roots of the Longhouse after centuries of dormancy. We will live religiosity and not preach it.

This might move from theory to practice very soon! Tomorrow Lori‚Äôs parents are coming to the Longhouse Daycare to ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù it. We have arranged a meeting with the Three Sisters for them to meet Lori and her parents and to explore whether it‚Äôs feasible for her to transfer to Longhouse Elem and study in a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù K/1 class with Bernie and I providing individualized instruction to keep her skills aligned with the First Grade.

Come back Monday morning. Longhouse Elem might officially open!

Mom has been consuming the ""porn for women"" type of formulaic romance novel ever since my dad died, and I've never judged her for it. Whatever, lady, enjoy your smut.

But: she got a boyfriend last year, and I broke up with my husband and moved in ""temporarily"" (it's been WAY longer than I expected, and I'm very unhappy about that). I just realized that I'm the villain in her romance novel, causing conflicts and problems to interfere with her happy sunset years. 

I've barely interacted with the guy, i've actively avoided it, in fact. I had one brief ACTUAL conversation about books with him one morning (he ""visits"" for weeks), and mom immediately made up a rule that it's inconsiderate for him to go down to the kitchen without her for breakfast. Let me be clear that I do not want morning conversations. All I want from the kitchen is coffee. At first I didn't connect all of the dots, because my life doesn't revolve around what today's drama is for her, but once I did I had to tell y'all about my new role as Romantic Rival and villain.

Coming from my Oracle Touch, where I manually ground my fresh and local medium roast beans, my espresso doesn‚Äôt taste as good on this new machine. So, I have a few questions and hope to get some tips.

1. I was planning to clean the machine, and ironically, I got a message saying to do maintenance after 10 more cups of coffee. For anyone who owns this machine or has experience, I‚Äôd like to know if there are any tips on how to properly clean and descale the machine after I get it from the previous owner. Can anyone recommend products I can buy off Amazon to do a descale?

2. Can anyone give tips on how I can get better-tasting espresso that‚Äôs not bitter on this machine? I‚Äôm using the portafilter that comes with it, which I believe is a 42mm, and I usually do double shots.

3.I‚Äôm not sure if the previous person used tap water or filtered water, so I wanted to know if it makes a difference. I used filtered water my self.
The owner got the machine as a gift in November 2024 but didn‚Äôt do much maintenance and just used it as a casual user.

4. I had a question about warranty. The owner got it as a gift but didn‚Äôt have the receipt? Breville did register and transfer the warranty to me but can I make a claim without a receipt ?

I was on 15 mg jardiance and 2x 1000 Metformin a day and a statin.  I've got my blood sugar down to 6.4 and decided to try Ozempic to get my weight down to get my blood sugar to 5.5 or below.  My other metrics are absolutely stellar wth triglyceriades and cholesterol indicating i can get off the statin.  Basically i just need to lose weight.

I've stopped taking Metformin but still take the Jardiance and Statin.  I shot my first dose of Ozempic last Saturday morning at 9 am.  I felt fine and just tired Saturday.  Sunday i thought i was constipated as I don't think i passed a bowel movement at all on Sunday.  So on Monday morning I ate a too large bowl of bran cereal with milk.

Then Monday night Holy Moly it was like the flood gates to niagara falls opened and i've spent the greater part of a weak riding the porcelin cruise.  Weird thing is that Monday night and Tuesday night i was on the porcelin cruise from 12 am to 4 am.  Managed to get about 3 hours of sleep.  It's gotten to the point that I'm expelling either clear liquid or green liquid (i think this is bile?)

It started getting better on Thursday, and finally Thursday night I slept 930 pm to 330 am but then oddly at work i had brutal stomach cramps from 7 am to 10 am before it subsided.  

I've barely been eating as I'm just terrified of eating ... i'll have a coffee in morning and a banana for lunch.  Then maybe one more banana and a handful of cashews for lunch.  Dinner will be 1/2 cup brown rice with a bit of beef and potato carrot stew (not a rich dinty moore stew more like asian style like a soup and boiled veg / turnip / carrot  / potato.  Today for breakfast i was able to manage one coffee for breakfast.  Two bananas and a handful of cashews for lunch, and one slice M&S Tiger Bloom bread with avo and two scrambled eggs with tomato / onion)

Reading some other people's response seems my body needs to adjust?  And other people's experiences seem to indicate it gets better in a week?

I'm wondering what will happen after the second shot?  WIll i be in fetal position in the shower for the first 3 days again or will it get better after the second shot?  I'm trying to carry on and push through since the appetite reduction is like nothing i've ever seen.  I'll eat the banana for breakfast and have a coffee and i'll feel as if i just stuffed myself at a vegas buffet.  

Thanks in advance for all your advice

* Offer proper privacy ‚Äì have audited no-logs policy
* Has WireGuard support. Also maybe P2P
* Split tunneling, kill switch.
* Is not too expensive

She has just said and done things recently which have burned down a bridge between us that I cannot seem to mentally WANT to repair.

I have a 2 year old son and when I first told my mum I was only 6 weeks preg with him and she spilled the beans and told the whole family when I asked her to keep it on the down low.  That taught me a bit of a lesson about her secret keeping skills.

 My hubby and I then strugged with secondary infertility. We fell pregnant immediately trying for number 2 but suffered a miscarriage at 10 weeks. I told my family by texting the family whatsapp group (my brother, dad and mum). I was devastated and it was all pretty traumatic and that felt like the best way to tell them that i was in hospital etc without having to vocalise it.

8 months later and still no spontaneous pregnancy and our marriage is crumbling in the timed intercourse, monthly roller coater, cycle tracking etc.we decide for those and other reasons (including low egg count) to embark on IVF.

Im open with my family and tell them of the ferility struggles, test results, doc appointnents etc. Then its time to actually start with IVF and i tell them about the injections, process and  give them the dates of my retrievals etc. My first retrieval comes and goes and no messages, phone calls or any communication of any sort. We retrieved 4 eggs only which was crippling with disappointment knowing the odds. Every day that we waited for updates was torture. You know the drill. By day 5 we have 1 embryo that has made it. The stress and anxiety are just unreal. We transfer that embryo hoping for the best buy expecting the worst. Eventually we hear from my mum who just calls to chat (not ask about the procedures) and I can't hold out, I tell her that I'm really disappointed in her and my dad for not being there for me or sending me a message or anything during what was a really difficult and fraught time. She immediately goes on the defensive and says she didn't realise it was such a big deal. We hang up and she sends me a long passive aggressive text saying she didn't realise it was such a thing for me cause I dealt with the miscarriage so well and clearly didn't need her as I told the family on the group about it and not her first, that she didn't understand my rush and that women 4 years older than me (I'm 35) still have babies, going on to list examples, that she's had many procedures done and hasn't been affected by them and finally- maybe I'm just not meant to have another child? Like WTF.

I tell her I'm going to ignore her message for the sake of our relationship.

I try put that past me but there's been a lingering sense of hurt since then.

Fast forward to Christmas time and she's come from overseas to help care for my toddler 2 days a week while I transition to working full time and we slowly add days to his daycare attendance.

I have no sick leave and when she arrives she is PROPERLY fluey with a hacking cough. She has an overhelpul complex and keeps preparing food despite me saying please don't, we can't risk getting sick. I have no sick leave and we can't afford unpaid sick leave if either I get sick or I need to stay home to look after my son.

She can't seem to help herself and if I leave something in the oven next minute she's taken it out and dished up or cut up the salad or whatever it is. Physically handling the food (for me and my toddler) before I can intercept. This carries on with me continually saying please don't, I can handle food prep etc and her continually ignoring me and replying with a snarky shitty sarcastic response. I'm also nearly 3 months pregnant through IVF and super anxious about bugs, ,(granted she doesn't know that,)

One day , 4 days into her stay, things blow up when she is again handling our food while clearly sick. I call her out on it and she says she is just being helpful and it's her nature to be helpful. I tell her it's NOT helpful it's actually selfish as it's putting me and my toddler at risk when we really can't afford it and it's NOT a big ask to stay away from handling our food while she is sick. Like does she want to make us sick? Its not personal!! She LOSES it and throws her mug full of hot coffee at the cabinet next to me in front of my little boy who starts screaming his head off with fright and anxiety. It shatters everywhere and she runs to her room. I give my toddler to my husband and follow her and tell her she can fuck off back home if she is going to throw shit in MY house and scare my little boy. She then tries to come and comfort my toddler in his room but I close the door on her and me an my husband reassure him that everything's okay. He's never been exposed to violence like that before. I clean up the mess.

Anyway. No apology from my mum and she shuts herself in her room for 3 days and refuses to eat etc despite me bringing meals to her. My hubby tries to talk to her and she says she cant believe how mean I am etc- taking no accountability and not apologising etc. I eventually call my dad and say to him he needs to buy her a plane ticket home I can't have this tension in my house and I won't apologise as she was the wrong doer. He comes over instead (14 hour flight) and the tension eases, she comes out her room and pretends it never happened. They went home a few weeks later and we announced our pregnancy to them at 4 months by doing it through the family chat. She again tells the extended family despite me asking everyone to keep it to immediate family.

Fast forward to now. I rarely speak to her one on one, only in group video calls. I find it hard to reply to her messages to me despite her trying to keep up contact. I just can't forgive her for what she said to me just after my transfer as I feel like she has no right to be involved with a baby she said I wasn't meant to have?

And I can't forgive her for violently acting out in my home and in front of my young child and then not apologising? 

I know she is bipolar and I've been exposed to her outbursts my whole life (have had a wine glass thrown at my head when i was a teen etc) but I'm just not willing to make excuses for it anymore if she can't apologise. I have always thought of her as the most kind thoughtful and yes, helpful person ever. But that image has cracked now and I can't see past it.

My due date is coming up now.  With my toddler she had insisted on coming over 10 days after birth to ""help out""  we had arguments and tears but it was mostly helpful. I'm not even entertaining it this time. It will be more stressful than not. I'm even willing to risk my husband missing out on the birth of our second child and having to look after the toddler cause we don't have anyone else to help rather than her coming over.

I'm a 26 year old woman and I met a guy (27) last Saturday on Bumble. That same day we started talking, the conversation flowed so well that he suggested meeting for coffee and we met in person the next day.

The date was very nice, we laughed a lot, there was chemistry, and when we said goodbye I wrote to him that I had loved meeting him and that I hoped to continue getting to know him more. He responded that he liked meeting me and that he wants to continue doing so.

Since then we continue talking... but he only answers me once a day, almost always at night. He proposed to see me again this weekend, but I'm traveling, so we ""agreed"" to see each other when I return. I've tried to keep him interested without being intense, but I don't know if he's just being friendly and not interested in me anymore.

This year, my skin has been the best it‚Äôs ever looked, glowy, clear, and healthy. A few weeks ago, I spent 3 weeks in another city (5 hr time difference and 7 hr flight from home), and even while I was away, my skin stayed in great shape. But ever since I got back (about two weeks ago), it‚Äôs looked dull and tired. I just turned 26, and while I figure some of it might be lingering jet lag or the stress of travel, I would‚Äôve expected things to even out by now.

Here‚Äôs my current routine:

AM:

-Rinse with water

- Simple toner

- Medik8 Liquid Peptides

- Byoma Niacinamide Moisturiser mixed with Purifide 

- Microbiome Equalizer Moisturiser (I know it sounds weird, but this combo really works for me)

-Sunscreen

PM:

-Cleanse with Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant (2x/week) or Purifide Daily Wash on other nights

- Simple toner

- Either Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA or Medik8 Retinol (not on the same night)

- Medik8 Advanced Night Repair

- Benzoyl peroxide spot treatment if I‚Äôm breaking out

Lifestyle notes:

- I don‚Äôt smoke

- I don‚Äôt drink coffee

- I eat pretty clean, though I do have a sweet tooth

- I rarely drink alcohol (1-2 glasses of wine or a cocktail occasionally, more if it‚Äôs a special event). I haven‚Äôt had any since I got back.

- While I was away, I wasn‚Äôt working out much. Now that I‚Äôm home, I‚Äôve restarted my workout routine, including hot yoga 1-2x/week

- I definitely could drink more water, and I‚Äôve been trying to up my intake lately

One year later, Daisy and Everton met beneath the Colosseum. The two convened in one of the older chambers as they did regularly over the months, its age ranging back a thousand years. Numerous cracks infected the walls and floors as it was slowly crumbling apart. Its dank air, filled with mosses and dust particles, attacked the lungs like stinging needles to the chest. But it was these features of the ancient chamber that made it desirable. Only those strong-willed and possessing the necessary abandon would dare frequent it to bother them. And fortunately, the student and teacher possessed more of both than most.

Daisy stripped butt naked, getting into her new gladiator armor with Everton standing guard behind her. Everton watched the entrance to the chamber without turning around, protecting her from curious eyes.

""I can't believe how fast time flies. I hope Carter and everyone else is doing okay,"" Daisy said.

""I wouldn't worry about your lover or anyone else right now. Some old friends managed to send me a message. We need to survive the event today.""

‚ÄúOld friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore I was a gladiator, I was a captain in an enemy army. One of the very first defectors from Mavor‚Äôs forces.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they threw you in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. The enemy wanted my punishment for standing against that madman to be especially humiliating.‚Äù Everton banged his fist on the wall. ‚ÄúI should have never gotten married. Enifa would still be alive today.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour wife. What was she like, Everton? I mean, how did you fall in love?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo this day, I don‚Äôt know why she wanted me. She was a defector, too. We served on several missions, and I foolishly allowed myself to fall into it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow-‚Äú

‚ÄúDid she die? It was an ambush.‚Äù Everton sighed. ‚ÄúWe decided to live a quiet life on Vilala, the world of vast flowery meadows. It was a nice change of pace when we weren‚Äôt on duty. They were waiting for us one day when we returned from a mission.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Everton.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs past is past, child.‚Äù

‚ÄúM-may I ask one final question?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a man, what made you want to stay with her for as long as you did?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù

""I-I just need a man‚Äôs perspective on the matter. And I know it's stupid, but-""

""But what?""

""What if Carter moved on with a woman more beautiful than me? Everton, there are thousands of them.""

""Daisy, as much as I dreaded having this conversation with Evelyn.‚Äù Everton groaned. ‚ÄúYou are a beautiful young woman, and any man who meets you would-""

Everton spotted some curious individuals walking by the chamber. Two male gladiators caught a glimpse of Daisy's naked body. They closed in for a better look, but Everton picked up a large rock and crushed it with one hand. It was a warning to tell them not to move any farther or lose something precious. And as they saw his warning, they both ran away, their footsteps echoing down the corridor as they left.

‚ÄúM-maybe you‚Äôre right.‚Äù As Daisy finished dawning her armor, she ran to Everton and hugged him. ""Anyhow, I'm ready for action, teacher.""

""I hope so.""

\*\*\*

The sun shined brightly over the Colosseum with fluffy white clouds across the vast blue sky. It was the ideal weather for any sporting event, allowing the masses to assemble readily and without difficulty. And, of course, they did, legions upon legions of them. The spectators‚Äô joyful shouts and cheers flowed like rushing river water across the air. Amongst them were the natives of Placentia and those from other neighboring colonies. The events of the Colosseum were one of the very few pleasures their Nemesis overlords allowed them to indulge in. So, none dared to miss out if possible.

The many seats overflowed with spectators. But there were two special ones in the seating area closest to the field, the Ima cavea. Cymbeline was a tall, light purple Nemesis. He was one of the primary generals in the Nemesis army and the grand overseer of the colonies like Placentia. He looked close to death with his thin body, but his eyes filled with life as he guided his guest, Morana, to her seat beside him. As he saw Morana wearing the blue dress Daisy made, he couldn‚Äôt help but look at her from top to bottom.

*""By the emperor, you‚Äôre beautiful,""*¬†Cymbeline said.

Morana saw Cymbeline staring at her body, and she made him look at her face, smiling at him as she lifted his head to lock eyes.¬†

""Cymbeline darling, it's rude to stare at a lady.""

""I'm sorry, but you look even more gorgeous than usual. I think it's your blue dress. You should take care of whoever made it.""

""Why, thank you.‚Äù Morana giggled, believing Daisy was dead, killed in combat, or raped by the gladiators. ‚ÄùAnd rest assured I did.""

Cymbeline pressed a button on his seat, and holographic panels with the gladiator's faces appeared before him and Morana.

""Well, my friend, let's have some fun. These panels have all the information you need to bet on a gladiator. So who do you think will win?""

""I'm not exactly a gambling woman, but I would say-""

Morana looked at her panel, and her eyes widened as she saw Daisy's picture among the gladiators. Looking closer at the image, she quickly confirmed that it was indeed her still alive, a scowl hastily forming on her face. And in a flash, she grabbed Cymbeline's neck, crushing his windpipe, and forced him to gaze at her picture.

*""What is the meaning of this? Why is the slave girl still alive? What type of Colosseum are you running?""*

""S-she rose through the ranks somehow, but if I knew you wanted her dead, I would have done it myself. I'll correct this mistake right now.""

Morana let go of Cymbeline's neck, growing a smile. ""No, let's see how this plays out. What plans did you make for this event?""

""Well-""

""Because they don't matter. I'm in charge now."" Morana interrupted.

\*\*\*

Later, drums and fanfare consumed the Colosseum, vibrating the air and signaling the beginning of the event. The gladiators marched onto the field through a gate with the end of the music. The warriors briskly walked to a designated area on the field in a neat line. Dispersing into a circle as they gathered around a big pile of weapons. Daisy grabbed a circular shield from it while Everton took a battle axe. Finally, they again formed a line, standing at attention towards the ima cavea.

""Everton, please remind me. What is this event about again?""

""We will be fighting a havoc ghoul. Whoever lasts the longest against the creature will be deemed the Colosseum champion.""

""H-havoc ghoul?""

""A ghastly abomination of creation. The best advice I can give you is to be wary of the poison spikes.""

‚ÄúWhat does the Colosseum champion get? Is it some trophy or medal?‚Äù

‚ÄúClose. It‚Äôs recognition from the people as a powerful warrior and a statue outside by the front gate amongst the past champions.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow prestigious.‚Äù Daisy allowed a small laugh. ‚ÄúAre you going to try to win?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs if I need recognition for defeating these fools.‚Äù Everton pointed to the gladiators beside him.

Daisy surrendered another laugh. ‚ÄùEverton, you and my big sister, Belle, would be great friends. You‚Äôre both uniquely blunt.‚Äù

A holographic display appeared in midair and showed Cymbeline and Morana to everyone. As they saw them, Daisy and Everton shared a look, their eyes locking onto the latter.

""Morana?""

""Daisy, this changes everything. The ice witch will never let you leave this event alive. You'll have to fight to kill to survive.""

""No, Everton. Pa always said when you make a promise to yourself or god, you better follow it. And no matter what she throws my way, I won't disregard what he taught me.""

Feedback from a microphone traveled through the air, and Morana began to speak for all to hear.

""Dear citizens of Placentia, my dear friend Cymbeline has granted me control of the festivities. I know you were looking forward to a battle with a havoc ghoul, but I had a brilliant idea. Instead of one horrible beast, why not all of them?""

A pair of gates on the Colosseum field hastily opened, and pupils of every shape, size, and color pierced the darkness inside. From the gates, beasts of varying shapes and sizes charged at the gladiators with savage bloodlust. Many gladiators trembled, seeing the band coming at them. But as Daisy saw the murderous horde charge, her face was devoid of fear, standing ready to meet the challenge for her freedom to reunite with those she loved.

The gladiators and the beasts met with a violent impact. The two groups shredded each other with savage fury. Bodies flew all over the field as they struggled for survival.

An ape-like beast swiftly pounced on Daisy. Daisy hid behind her shield as large spikes sprang from its fists like knuckle dusters. The spikes pierced the shield and nearly stabbed her in the face, but the beast got stuck in it as it tried to pull free. Daisy forced the beast to the ground, where it flailed violently to escape, knocking it unconscious with a punch to the face.

Daisy broke free of the beast, spotting another charging at her. Its horns aimed straight at her heart. Daisy ran from the beast at top speed as it closed the distance in seconds. However, she sprinted towards a wall, and inches before it impaled her with its horns, she backflipped over the creature off the wall. The beast ran into the wall, plunging its horns deep inside. Where Daisy subdued it, beating her shield on the back of its head.

Daisy took a moment to relax, catching her breath. The moment quickly ended as she saw her fellow gladiators run away in droves, pushing and shoving one another. She soon learned what could instill such terror into hardened warriors as she met the havoc ghoul. ‚ÄùGod, help me.‚Äù A giant bat-like creature, covered in hundreds of spikes, shook the Colosseum field with one stomp of its foot, knocking Daisy down.

""Good god,"" Daisy said.

The havoc ghoul swiftly picked Daisy up in its claws, opening the four corners of its hideous mouth and preparing to consume her. As she neared her doom, Everton hit the back of its head with a stone support beam. It dropped her to the ground. Daisy gave Everton a thumbs up, but as the havoc ghoul became steady, he directed her to her shield, pointing to the weapon.¬†

Daisy dashed to her weapon.‚ÄùRight.‚Äù¬†

The young woman quickly grabbed her shield and used it as a refuge from the rain of the havoc ghoul's spikes. As the projectiles stopped, Daisy charged at the creature. The havoc ghoul readied to strike her with its claw, uttering a high-pitched screech as it rose to attack. Again, Everton disoriented it with another blow to the back of the head with the support beam.

Daisy jumped up the havoc ghoul to its face, hitting it in the eye with her shield. The combined efforts of her and Everton‚Äôs attacks finally knocked the creature down. She dropped to the ground, struggling to stand up, but Everton came, helping her. Daisy hugged him as thanks, and the Nemesis man reciprocated, but the moment was interrupted as the holographic display reappeared, showing Morana.

Morana looked at the aftermath of the battle, seeing Daisy still alive, her face seething, but quickly changed to a smile.

""Dear citizens of Placentia, after watching the incredible performance of our gladiators, I think they deserve a special treat. A new contest where the survivors here will battle each other, and I will judge the winner to decide what prize they deserve, starting now.""

As Morana started the new contest, Everton saw a gladiator charging Daisy with his sword. He shoved her out of the way before she could be decapitated. However, as the gladiator kept swinging his blade at her, Everton got hammerfisted in the face and knocked away from aiding Daisy by another gladiator.

The gladiator swung his blade wildly at Daisy, and she narrowly dodged each strike. Daisy swiftly broke through the flurry of deadly blows and beat the side of his face with her shield, knocking him to the ground. Another gladiator tackled her into the sandy soil. Everton struggled to break free of his opponent's headlock. Still, as he saw the gladiator holding his blade over Daisy about to stab her, he elbowed his opponent in the stomach. And as Everton broke free, he lifted him off the ground.

*""Daisy,""*¬†Everton shouted with desperation.

As Daisy heard Everton and saw him hold up his opponent, she put her feet on the gladiator's stomach, kicking him forward. And before he could do anything else, Everton flung his opponent at him, hitting him.

Everton ran over to Daisy, and the spectators screamed as they came together.

*""Fight, fight, fight.""*¬†The spectators screamed in unison.

As Daisy heard the spectators, she looked around the Colosseum field and saw the bodies of her adversaries, either dead or unconscious.¬†

Daisy grew a look of bewilderment. ""Everton, who do they expect us to fight? There's nobody left.""

""Daisy,"" Everton said, telling her to acknowledge the obvious answer, each other.

Daisy gazed at Everton, realizing the answer. ""No, I won't do it, not even for my freedom E-""

Everton signaled Daisy to stop talking. And he clutched his chest in pain. He dropped to the ground, and Daisy hurried over to aid him.

""Everton, are you okay?""

""I'm fine, Daisy. The injuries from our battles are just taking their toll.‚Äù Everton gave Daisy a playful wink. ‚ÄúAnd since you outlasted even me, you won. You are the Colosseum champion.""¬†

As she heard Everton, her jaw dropped, her hand going to cover her mouth as she saw the spectators celebrating her victory, shaking the air with their loud cheers.

*""Champion, champion, champion,""*¬†The spectators screamed in unison.

In the Ima cavea, Cymbeline shared a look of shock with Daisy at her victory, but his features quickly hardened.

""Silence. General Morana still hasn't made her judgment.""

As the spectators became as quiet as a grave, all eyes went to Morana.

""Morana, what prize do you deem the human worthy of?""

*""Death,""*¬†Morana shouted.

As they heard Morana, the spectators went crazy, booing and moaning as they started throwing food in her direction.

*""Let her live. Let her live. Let her live.""*¬†The spectators screamed in unison.

On the Colosseum field, Daisy trembled vigorously.¬†

""Everton, if I want to see my loved ones again, I'll have to fight through Morana and half her army, won't I?""

Everton stood up, kindly rubbing Daisy's head. ""No child. We'll have to fight through her and half her army. So much for my old friends.""

Suddenly, a flash of light happened over their heads. Two Nemesis ships came crashing onto the field, exploding, and a black plume of smoke swallowed the Colosseum. As the smoke dissipated, it revealed a spaceship. It hovered before the Ima cavea as it unloaded its ammunition at Morana and Cymbeline in a brilliant blaze of glory.

""Everton, what in god's name is this?""

""I believe, old friends, making good on a promise.‚Äù",1,1744973750.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

* This morning, my boyfriend woke up early and went upstairs to his office to game or work. After I got up, he told me he was heading out to do some groceries and grab a coffee at his favorite coffee place.
* While he was out, I went upstairs to check his laptop (I‚Äôve been feeling suspicious lately), but it wasn‚Äôt in his office‚Äîor anywhere else. I ended up finding it hidden in his backpack, which was hanging on the coat rack by the front door. That‚Äôs the same bag he usually takes with him when he goes to work.
* The strange part is: He works from home today. He was only gone for about 20 minutes. After getting back, he went straight to the bag to grab his laptop‚Äîlike, without even a pause. Why take your laptop two floors downstairs, put it in your work bag, go out briefly, and then come back and immediately grab it again? Why not just leave it on your desk if you're coming right back to work?
* While he was gone, I checked his laptop. The browser history was cleared (until yesterday 5 pm), even though I know he had been using it earlier that morning. I didn‚Äôt find anything suspicious, but that said the history was cleared obviously.
* Later on, I also noticed he had the Contacts app open on his phone, and he had searched for a (what appeared to me fake) name ‚Äîwhich doesn‚Äôt exist in his contacts. The screen just said ""no results."" As said, it seems like a made-up or fake name. Why search for that in Contacts if no one by that name is saved?
* I also saw another open tab: Google Maps showing his favorite coffee place, which is only 5 minutes from our house. That made no sense either‚Äîhe knows exactly where it is, he goes there all the time, so why look it up?
* I checked the rest of his phone too‚Äîapps, deleted photos, everything‚Äîand found nothing else suspicious. He‚Äôs never cheated before, at least not that I know of. I have looked through his phone once before (and told him afterward), so he knows I‚Äôve done that in the past. I have also asked him a couple of weeks ago if he is cheating and he denies this. The reason I asked this is because I‚Äôve started to feel uneasy. My mother used to cheat on my father, and I was old enough at the time to witness the whole situation. Now, I‚Äôm noticing some similar behaviors, hence the open question to him.

3.I‚Äôm not sure if the previous person used tap water or filtered water, so I wanted to know if it makes a difference. I used filtered water my self.

My Lipedema is a catalyst for a lot of my mental health struggles, so I just wanted to put myself in the best position to feel great. My Lipedema was the most managed and I felt the best I ever have on the day ~ in my mind, making it a success. 

Since my wedding, in October last year, I have been much more lax with all of these and have noticed the regression. My plan is to get back on everything with consistency asap. Here is what I did to notice less pain, less inflammation, better mental health, more definition in legs:

- Walked everyday! Anywhere between 7-15k steps. This was made easier by the fact I work as a Pilates instructor and was teaching a lot. I have since changed to a sit down job and have noticed the difference walking less. 

- Pilates or weight training everyday, even if for 10-15 mins. Most of these workouts were 30 mins - 45 mins. Made sure this includes calf pumping and spine movement. 

- Self-lymphatic massage every morning using a Gua Sha (took 5 mins). Plus monthly massage with lymphatic specialist. 

- Sauna + Cold Plunge weekly 

- Morning warm lemon water with apple cider vinegar.

- Put ghee in my first coffee of the day (I have black coffee) + Ate a healthy breakfast (high in protein and fat) before my second coffee. 

- Natural electrolytes everyday. Important not to have anything too salty or with any artificial sweeteners. 

- Limited alcohol and sugar. 

- Positive self talk! 

It sounds like a lot, but I learnt to habit stack! If you want any specifics, let me know! I‚Äôd love to help others feel better mentally and physically while dealing with Lipedema.

And the million-dollar question arises: can this be possible? The answer is yes, it can. Apparently, Ford has a contract with Red Bull Austria to govern the designs of its two teams. When considering this possibility, everything suggests that the contract states that they must use their engines, or propellants associated with their name, but it doesn't stipulate which specific team or how many they must use . This detail is discussed within the blue team, and it's something that, without being able to see the contract, is impossible to verify.

being a barista is just the perfect combination of tasks for me, i used to be a waiter in restaurants as well as a summer camp animator, but i was never really satisfied until i got hired as a barista. i still have so much to learn, like the different coffees that we sell, all the niche terms and ways one can brew coffee, and so much more. i would love to be a manager although i do love my current manager (i like to think of her as my friend, and hope she does too); it just seems so fun to count all the wares, order new things for the shop, and make lists,, can you tell i have autism too?

i keep repeating myself but i really love being a barista. i almost feel like a depressed border collie when im at home not working (i had surgery a couple months back and those 2 months of sick leave made me feel so depressed lol). im always looking forward to coming back to my work place. regular customers love to see me and i love to see them, getting compliments from customers saying im efficient is such an ego boost (we're alone behind the bar most of the time, so i have a lot of things to keep track of), and im the best closer of the team. i love my job:)",9,1744973147.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1k21vlx,https://i.redd.it/xp5z19udokve1.jpeg,Domestic Violence Survivor,"15 years of Mental, Physical, and Emotional Abuse. 

He showered me with gifts at the age of 16. He was 28 years old. Being young and na√Øve, I didn‚Äôt see the red flags. üö© he was grooming me for the long haul. 

At 17 I got pregnant with my first born who is now 13 years old. 

At 18 my first born was born. At 19 we got our first place. 

The first threat began. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to punch in the face‚Äù - I attempted to leave. He apologized up and down and said he would be different. I believed him. 

we lost custody of our so  for a while and lived in a motel. He basically pimped me out and I was stripping. The first initial incident is when I had about 3 clients, afterwards he wanted to fuck and I told him no I‚Äôm done for the night, even tho I had two more clients. He didn‚Äôt like the fact that I said no so he grabbed my head and pulled me forward and with full force threw my head back into the wall making a small hole, I collapsed and laid there basically lifeless till morning. All because I told him no. This was when Craigslist was still a thing.

Then I started noticing he wanted control of everything. My money. My whereabouts, my credit, wanted all my passwords to shit. But me being love blind and young, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

Throughout the years, there‚Äôs incidents where he constantly accused me of cheating when I caught him 7 different times times. We would get into arguments that turned physical and he ends up braking my stuff and breaking my stuff over me.

Then, I noticed the degrading, the humiliation, public humiliation. The distancing of him being not so lovey like he used to be. That he got me into some weird sexual shit where he wanted me to go to pornshops with him. He basically made me ‚Äúdo‚Äù other dudes there ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù i was scared to say no because if the first incident in the motel. So I didn‚Äôt say no very often.

He has thrown scolding hot coffee on me, bashed my head into the wall. Kicked me in the head with a steal toe boot, threw me through walls, 70% of the time if I didn‚Äôt make a dinner he liked, he‚Äôd throw it across the kitchen then grab me by the hair throw me to the grown and make me clean it.

It got so bad at one point I became an alcoholic. I took the Kia forte he bought me brand new in 2018 I took it while blacked out drunk and went 110 down  mays landing rd. He hit me with his white Tacoma a few times to make me stop, but I was so broken at that point I didn‚Äôt care what happened.

I tried leaving him 4 different times.

I got clean and sober, and started putting EVERYTHING together, and I just had enough. It took me a year to plan and build the courage to actually leave and never go back.

He‚Äôs a narcissistic douche bad, controlling and extremely abusive. We got into physical arguments in front of my friend, in front of the kids. It was horrible

In the middle of me planning to leave, I met my current boyfriend.

Little did i know, my ex had met someone and would be out ALL weekend every weekend with this chick while he‚Äôs spending money on other women, paying their rent and utilities, grooming them like he did with me in the very beginning.

My ex isolated me. Didn‚Äôt want me working. Didn‚Äôt want me to have anyone.

So‚Ä¶ I (21F) met this man couple months ago. He was older ‚Äî like late 40s, maybe early 50s. Salt-and-pepper beard, calm energy, always smelled like clean linen and success. We met at a bookstore, of all places. I was reaching for something on the top shelf and he helped me. We ended up talking for like idk 30 40 minutes right there.

After that, he started showing up every other weekend, like clockwork. Said I reminded him of ‚Äúsomeone he used to care about.‚Äù I never asked.

But he‚Äôd always bring me something small ‚Äî a coffee, a book, once even a scarf when I said I hated winter. He never asked for anything in return. Just good conversation. Sometimes, he‚Äôd slip a little cash into my tote bag and say, ‚ÄúFor your next adventure.‚Äù

We never kissed. We never touched. But the way he looked at me‚Ä¶ it felt like I was something rare.

He disappeared one day. No goodbye. No number. Just gone.

Now I keep wondering‚Ä¶
Was he just being kind?
Or‚Ä¶ was he my sugar daddy and I didn‚Äôt even realize it?

Things seemed casual and fun at first. After a while, we got closer and started talking more, until one day we did a video call ‚Äî but she wouldn‚Äôt turn her camera on. She always said her hair was messy or she looked bad.

Later on, she opened up and told me she was autistic, which explained a lot of the things I had noticed about her, like how distant she could be sometimes. Most of our conversations felt pretty one-sided, though I kept trying. We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled last minute, claiming she had hurt her leg.

She also mentioned that I started acting differently after she told me about her autism. On top of that, she shared some personal stuff ‚Äî how her ex left her, how she got replaced by another guy she had been seeing.

One day, I got mugged and almost lost her number. When I told her about it, she was super indifferent. She didn‚Äôt even seem worried and said she wouldn‚Äôt reach out anymore unless I texted first.

She talked a lot about her cats and her nephews, who apparently are autistic too. I also remember her getting extremely mad when her cousin brought up that she used to drink with her ex.

At some point, I invited her to the movies, since she had once joked about how we‚Äôd probably never actually go out. At first, she said no because she was too embarrassed, but after I insisted, she agreed. The next day, out of nowhere, she suggested we should ‚Äújust stay friends.‚Äù

Even so, we went to the cinema. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. Still, she was always super private ‚Äî never letting me near her phone and only sharing her Instagram with me after we broke up.

Later, we went to the mall. She gave me some chocolate, and somehow the day ended with us going to a motel. Once inside, she told me she was too shy and asked me to leave the lights off. I was fine with it, but her mood flipped in an instant, and she got cold and distant. After a while, we left, and I walked her home.

Another time, we hung out at the park, were all cuddly, and when it was time for her to leave, I offered to walk her home. I could tell she didn‚Äôt want me anywhere near her family. I still walked her to her place and left.

There was this other situation where her sister dropped her off at my house. I mentioned, half-jokingly, that we never went out because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad about it.

Another day, we played a game together, and I casually criticized the game. She got upset, stopped playing immediately, and pulled away. Not long after that, she brought me chocolate, we spent some time together, and then she randomly started talking about breaking up.

She once invited me to a party, said she wanted me to go with her, then later changed her mind and said she wasn‚Äôt going anymore. Then she changed her mind again and decided to go. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me there. I told her I‚Äôd go and asked if I could show up a bit earlier, but she was super clear that I could only come at 6 PM.

I went earlier anyway, and her sister saw me outside and invited me up. Later we went to her friend‚Äôs party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of the blue, while we were there, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù

After the party, we went back to her place. She asked me to sleep over, but I decided to go home.

Fast forward a bit, I eventually called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and later told me I had ruined her emotionally, sent her into therapy, and ‚Äústole her happiness.‚Äù Even after all that, she texted me saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while we were texting one day, I found her on a dating app. I confronted her, and she told me to just ‚Äúfind someone else.‚Äù When I asked why she was on there, she said she was looking for her friend‚Äôs ex.

In the end, I told her I still loved her. She told me the feeling would pass and said she‚Äôd been somewhere recently and wished I had been there with her.

A few days later, she called and invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom even called me to ask if I really loved her, and later invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but then she told me her dad was furious at me. I felt terrible, vented about the whole thing online, and somehow she found out. She confronted me, accused me of lying to her and using her, said everything she did was because of her insecurities and autism, told me she had prayed for me every day ‚Äî and then blocked me again, for good.

It‚Äôs been freeing, eye-opening, and lonely at times ‚Äî but overall, a wild and incredible experience. What I didn‚Äôt expect, though, is that I‚Äôd start getting way more attention from women than I ever have before.  

The thing is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not conventionally attractive. I‚Äôm lean, kind of skinny, with prominent bones like collarbones and a crooked smile that shows gum, which makes me really dislike my smile. I also have hereditary dark circles that give me that perpetually tired look. People used to pick on me for it. But now? Girls stare. I‚Äôve had strangers come up and compliment me. One girl I didn‚Äôt even talk to yelled ‚Äúbye sexy man‚Äù at me as I left a bar ‚Äî and that night I hadn‚Äôt shaved, was in a baggy Uniqlo shirt, and felt like a hobo.  

Dating apps have picked up too. But honestly, it‚Äôs messing with my head.  

I keep hearing girls talk about the gym guys they used to date ‚Äî and I know, logically, that not every woman is into that ‚Äúgym bro‚Äù look. Still, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm not enough especially talking to girls that are super fit themselves.  

I‚Äôm texting a few women right now. One I genuinely vibe with, but she can‚Äôt meet anytime soon. The others are kind of reactive ‚Äî short replies, not many questions, not a lot of initiative. And I start spiraling, wondering if I‚Äôm just not that interesting.  

Most of them are super active, fit, social, into sports or nightlife. I‚Äôve always been more of a basement dweller. My hobbies are programming, anime, manga/manhwa, trading ‚Äî more solitary stuff. I do love adventure, though ‚Äî I loved doing all the motorbike loops in Southeast Asia, I also enjoy hikes, but it‚Äôs not like it defines me in a way that I can say it's my personality. I‚Äôm not a yoga person or artsy like a lot of people journaling or painting or poets, other than programming, but I dig people who are. Especially people who are a bit quirky or different.  

I hate clubs and big crowds. I‚Äôm talkative when I‚Äôm comfortable, but anxious and quiet when I‚Äôm not. I overthink constantly and dread silence in conversations, like I have to entertain or they‚Äôll lose interest. I‚Äôm generally socially anxious, so escalating from ‚Äústrangers‚Äù to ‚Äúcomfortable intimacy‚Äù is really hard. I misread cues because of ADHD, and once, my friend told me three girls were hitting on me at the same time ‚Äî and I just shut down. I didn‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd like the real me. I don‚Äôt know how to escalate‚Ä¶ unless I‚Äôm drunk, because drunk me is somehow charming and knows what to do but I often don't even remember how I did.  

On top of all that, I‚Äôm in a rebuilding phase. Money‚Äôs running low, I‚Äôm studying and working remotely again, and every day feels the same. I‚Äôve lost the ‚Äúspark‚Äù I had during the start of my travels. When women tell me about their past adventures ‚Äî especially with guys they‚Äôve dated ‚Äî I just feel small. Like I can‚Äôt compete. Like I have nothing cool to offer anymore.  

But I know that‚Äôs technically not true. I‚Äôve done a year of wild travel. Paradoxically I‚Äôve dated beautiful women during that time and traveled with them. Maybe I‚Äôve even lived more than most people ever will. But still‚Ä¶ I feel boring, like I have nothing to offer. That travel version of me feels like it‚Äôs on pause right now.  

I‚Äôm not looking for anything super serious ‚Äî something casual but meaningful would be ideal ‚Äî but I carry this guilt and feeling of inadequacy. Like unless I can offer exciting, flashy experiences, I‚Äôm not enough.  

Truth is, I like going slow. Sitting in a caf√© for hours, sipping coffee, talking. Laying in bed all day, cuddling. That‚Äôs ideal to me. But I feel like I‚Äôm the odd one out in a dating culture that rewards constant stimulation.  

So I guess I‚Äôm wondering:  
	‚Ä¢	How do you deal with that disconnect between getting attention and not feeling worthy of it?  
	‚Ä¢	How do I stop feeling like I need to entertain others all the time to be liked?

Would love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar.

# 12: The New Normal

*‚ÄúAfter a while you could get used to anything.‚Äù*

*‚Äï Albert Camus, The Stranger*

# January 25th, 2023

Time insisted on moving forward.

G√©rald found himself just as busy as the rest of them. After the initial moment where it had seemed it would mostly be an effort in political influencing, he thought he would have little to do other than give advice whenever their efforts occasionally went into military matters, but he had been wrong.

It was likely he wasn‚Äôt *quite* as busy as Bindi or Sophia, but he had more than enough to do to get along with.¬†

One of the strangest parts had been when Eduardo had asked him to go Belgium, Luxembourg, then France to talk to various government officials.¬†

He thought back for a moment to the first conversation he had with Eduardo about it.

\-¬†

‚ÄúI need you to hold their hand a little and make them feel safe.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBindi is the sociable person, wouldn‚Äôt she be better suited?‚Äù

Eduardo shook his head.

‚ÄúNot for this, no. Bindi is very good at **convincing** people. But these people have already **been** convinced. Your job is going to be to **keep** them convinced.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how am I to do this, hmm?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple, although to put it terms you will be familiar with: in our present situation everything is simple, but the simplest thing is difficult.‚Äù(1)

Every officer worth his salt would recognize *that* reference.¬†

‚Äú*Je comprends*. So, me being a soldier has something to do with it then?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. I am having Sophia send you our latest assessment of their technology. Your job is going to be to go in front of them, in your impressive and very military uniform, and then reassure them that it is going to be alright. That resistance, while hard, is militarily possible. Allay their fears and they will feel more secure in their choice to support us, which will make it harder for them to change their mind and even more relevantly for others to convince and influence them that they made a mistake to provide us with support. Remember, we are not the only group of people at work here.‚Äù

‚Äú*Oui*, I understand. I will pack my uniform and my medals then. Talk to them like an Officer to nervous new soldiers, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. There is no point in dismissing their fear. War is a fearful business. We, and they, must fight on regardless.‚Äù

\-

And so, he had done as Eduardo suggested and put together a presentation on how the Aliens might be fought and could be fought.

And it worked.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/nw95upwrkkve1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=012f7e29752bc52d287357d6d20145fc329c7a33

In the meantime, he had kept himself busy reviewing the news and various updates from the rest of the group. Whenever he was able to steal a free moment he would Facetime his wife and they would chat together and he would talk to his little girl.¬† She could only babble back so far, but at least she got to see and hear her Father, even if he couldn‚Äôt physically be there.¬† Such was the life of a modern soldier.¬†¬†

\-

Time had seemed to intermittently crawl or fly, depending on the moment.¬†

It was a complicated dynamic.¬† Back in November or so, the main thing he noticed was how rapidly things were moving.¬† The arrival of the aliens had filled every meeting, every interaction, with a sense of urgency and import. Meetings that he knew would have taken at least a few days to even schedule were booked in a day and occurred within the week.¬†¬†

But as they arrived into the new year he also started to notice that things started to calm down, if in a weird way.¬†¬†

There had been, at the start, a feeling he was very familiar with, one of the battlefield: where small moments could be intense and meaningful and time flowed slowly in them. There had been an uncertainty of who the enemy was and where they were that filled every interaction, every trip with a sense of being of guard and waiting for an attack that might never come.

But now in the present the feeling had shifted from one of a battlefield to one of being on a peacekeeping mission. It was a feeling where battle *might* break out at any moment, but that on a day to day basis one was just getting along and doing a mundane if dangerous job. He noticed that the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pace of things started to come back, if unevenly. Meetings started to take more time to schedule again. Procedures and bureaucracy, temporarily abated in the immediate crisis after the landing, started to make themselves known again.

The one thing that had gone into overdrive but *not* slowed down was news from the scientific community. The arrival had caused every single lab in the world, it seemed, to suddenly become flush with funding as governments strived to understand what was happening. Dr Groves shared the news of either a new proposed line of study or actual invention every week.¬†

As G√©rald read about the latest invention in the field of biotechnology he started to take some notes. There were potential applications here in terms of bioweapons, perhaps. It wasn‚Äôt precisely his preferred way to deal with the invasion.¬† He knew for a fact it would face objections from within the group. For that matter, **he** had objections to it. But if the only way to defeat them was to recreate the War of the Worlds on purpose, well, what was to be done?

He opened up the next email from Eduardo, congratulating the team and proposing they meet again at the beginning of February to discuss next steps now that they had the core of the EU.

\-

# February 1st, 2023

The last time they had all been in a room together had been sometime in October, not long after the UN security council meeting and their decision to start with the EU.

Eduardo took a moment to make sure they were all settled in with snacks as well as tea, in the case of Bindi, Sophia and Fiona or coffee, in the case of Randy and G√©rald as well as himself.

‚ÄúMorning. I wanted to again congratulate all of you. I know the last four months have been hectic, but each of you has pushed through and we have achieved our basic immediate goal of building a network of support in the core of the EU with an eye towards pushing for further integration of it. To start with, Ms. Lee will provide us with the latest update on the general situation, and then we will discuss what our next steps should be.But before that, Commander Ayoade informed me you had something important you wanted to discuss first, Dr. Groves?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†¬†

Randy seemed oddly hesitant as everyone turned to look at him expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve discussed this with Fiona, and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion I‚Äôm going to switch roles a bit.¬† It‚Äôs clear for now that this war is a war of covert ops, intelligence, media campaigns, and political influence with some military strategy added in.‚Äù He nodded to each of the others in turn.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also become obvious to me that at least out there, in ‚Äòthe field‚Äô as it were, it's not an effort that requires my specific skill set as a scientist.‚Äù

He smiled a bit, clearly still slightly nervous but clearly at peace with his own judgment of what he was saying.

‚ÄúSo Fiona and I have agreed that I‚Äôm going to switch over to support our scientific administrative infrastructure as the head of our Science Department for at least the foreseeable future.‚Äù

Eduardo nodded. ‚ÄúThank you, Dr. Groves. I know coming to that choice must have been challenging.‚Äù

Randy shrugged. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a good scientist if you can‚Äôt accept the data in front of your face.‚Äù

He exhaled, the last of his tension seeming to melt away.

‚ÄúThat being said, again with the Commander‚Äôs help, I‚Äôve used my connections to find someone whose skill set would be very helpful to you all out there.‚Äù He nodded to Fiona, who nodded back and tapped a quick text on her phone.

An expectant minute passed and the door to the conference opened and through it came a African-American man who took in everyone in the room in just a minute as he walked in without pausing as they all stood up to greet him.

https://preview.redd.it/59vp9jb3lkve1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=69684a3f90de2841298aee76521de6ceaa74b249

Fiona gestured to him. ‚ÄúEveryone, this is Jamaal Grant. As it happens, I knew to take Dr. Groves' recommendation seriously because I was already familiar with some of his work. Jamaal, this is Sophia, Bindi,¬† G√©rald and Eduardo. Jamaal has been permanently loaned to us by the CIA, so he is more than familiar with covert work.‚Äù

Jamaal smiled slightly and nodded to each of them as Fiona introduced them. ‚ÄúWhat she means is that I‚Äôm a spy, although she‚Äôs being awfully polite about it. Good to meet all of you.‚Äù

Eduardo smiled a bit. ‚ÄúExcellent timing as well. Go on and take a seat as Ms. Lee updates all of us on our current status. I‚Äôm sure the Commander has debriefed you but after the meeting I‚Äôd appreciate you staying a bit so she and I can tackle any remaining questions you have in order to feel somewhat caught up.‚Äù

Jamaal nodded his agreement.

‚ÄúThank you.¬† Go ahead.‚Äù He nodded to Sophia.

¬†‚ÄúThank you. I‚Äôm sure all of you have been keeping up with my intelligence updates, but just to review the highlights: at present, there are four groups whose leaders and basic organization we have been able to identify: The Initiative, the Servants, the Protectorate and the Academy.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo add to those four, I was very recently able to identify a fifth group under the leadership of the infamous Colonel Hanse Castillo. He recently released a statement to the press calling on everyone to fight the aliens.¬† In it, he referred to the Aliens as ‚Äòdemons incarnate‚Äô and he also promised that any ‚Äòtraitors‚Äô would be dealt with as well.¬† He has stated that the only right way to deal with the alien arrival is to kill them without prejudice and hunt down and likewise eliminate anyone who might ‚Äòsupport‚Äô them. He stated that above all humans should come first above any and all other considerations. Since then he seems to have been working to make his promise a reality by organizing a group he calls ‚ÄòHumanity First‚Äô.‚Äù¬†

She clicked on her computer and a series of graphs and color coded numbers appeared on the screen.¬†

‚Äú In any case, this is our general assessment of the current abilities and resources of each of those five groups. Please keep in mind that these are rough estimates, especially with Humanity First‚Äù

‚ÄúFurthermore, my intelligence indicates there is at least one other group whose leaders and organization structure I haven‚Äôt been able to identify. There are clear signs of policy decisions and other signs of influence being built behind the scenes which I can‚Äôt identify as having been carried out by any of those five groups I know of. In other words, I can see the signs of the presence of another group, perhaps two, in general terms, but not much beyond that.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, the next thing..‚Äù

‚ÄúSophia, wait a moment‚Äù G√©rald interrupted.

‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to ask the group a question about Humanity First. Given they are against the Aliens, do we consider this group..allies?‚Äù

Jamaal nodded. ‚ÄúI was wondering the same myself. I mean, our goal is to resist the Aliens. They want to resist the aliens, yeah?‚Äù

Bindi frowned a bit. ‚ÄúI mean, I suppose, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

Eduardo held up a hand.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good question. I will answer it two ways. One, I will not categorically rule out working with *any* group so long as we judge it helps our own goals. As I mentioned before, we need to think of ourselves as a resistance movement facing off against a technologically superior enemy. Because that is precisely what we are.¬† People in that position must often make pragmatic compromises in the name of survival and continuation of the struggle.¬† We cannot *afford* to turn away potential allies, even if they are allies of convenience. Hell, sometimes we may end up working with outright ideological enemies under the right circumstances.‚Äù

Eduardo sighed and shook his head.¬†

‚ÄúThat being said, we need to be careful about several different things when it comes to that. We need to keep in mind that any group we work together with doesn‚Äôt share *our* goals. And I would definitely argue that while there are some similarities in our viewpoint with Humanity First, there‚Äôs also some fundamental differences. Colonial Castillo clearly sees this conflict in..moral terms. It is a fight between good and evil to him. There is a danger to that viewpoint: on a practical level it can distort your strategic decision making. His press release already demonstrates that. Aliens are invading us and one of his primary focuses is already to focus on finding and rooting out ‚Äútraitors.‚Äù¬† Obviously we know already there *are* collaborators, and obviously we will need to deal with them, but to focus on them on the same level as the aliens themselves threatens to turn humans against themselves in mutual suspicion and self destruction.‚Äù

Eduardo smiled sardonically as he continued. ‚ÄúAnd needless to say, Colonial Castillo‚Äôs own history in Latin America and elsewhere doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with confidence that he has good strategic judgement and instincts. Forces under our influence or control might *end up* committing war crimes during this struggle, war is messy like that, unfortunately.¬† Colonial Castillo‚Äôs entire world view and *modus operandi* rests on the idea that war crimes are good, actually, and that they help you win a war. I‚Äôd disagree even just from a practical tactical and strategic perspective. ‚Äù

Eduardo paused and gathered his thoughts for a moment before continuing. ‚ÄúFinally, any long term resistance fight has a *moral* component as well. We will need to convince our fellow humans that resistance is possible and that they should resist the Aliens.¬† But they will also need to believe that the people making decisions to fight the Aliens will also make decisions that will improve their lives. Don‚Äôt forget our mission statement. ‚ÄúWe must not only defend human lives from the Aliens, we must ensure those lives remain worth living.‚Äù The Colonial would throw out the second part. I might even argue he throws away the first: He isn‚Äôt so much interested in defending human lives as in killing the Aliens and any who *might* support them.‚Äù

Eduardo looked around. ‚ÄúObviously if you disagree with my assessment, you are more than welcome to chat with me individually. But just so we all understand, for now our official policy as regards Humanity First will be one similar to the western allies vis a vis the Soviet Union during World War II. We might end up being allies fighting a common foe, but it would be a mistake to allow ourselves to think that our overall goals or worldview is the same.‚Äù

G√©rald nodded. ‚ÄúThat is fair. I know of the Colonel as well. His reputation is‚Ä¶ well earned,I am in agreement with that approach.‚Äù

Everyone else nodded as well and Eduardo gestured to Sophia.

Sophia nodded and resumed. ‚ÄúThat being established, I also wanted to reinforce an impression that all of you, at some point or another, have shared with me during one of our recent debriefs. The sense of immediate crisis has passed.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/mcbg51velkve1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd089b4bbe78343e8ece6e77af6a0bd3b47a512c

‚ÄúObviously it would be wrong to say that things have returned to ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù but governments, security agencies and so on are going back to something resembling business as usual. In practical terms, this means that some of our efforts to influence policy and place people of our choosing in critical decision making roles will take longer now. On the flip side, in my opinion this will have some benefits as well: doing things according to protocol makes the process more transparent and makes our efforts to build influence bear more fruit. With some things there simply is no substitute for time. For good or for ill, the hectic pace of everything for the last four months will slow back down.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinally, as I have indicated, in terms of the Aliens and their activities..there has been no change. All we have are rumors and no hard evidence, much less an actual verified sighting. This has led to a resurgence in the belief that the Alien landings are in fact a hoax. That being said, as I indicated in my latest intelligence briefing there has been a small but meaningful increase in claims of disappearances as well, although verification of such remains elusive.‚Äù¬†

She gestured to Eduardo, indicating she was finished.

Eduardo nodded to her in turn. ‚ÄúThank you.¬† Now, obviously, we will continue to make every effort to track down the Aliens so we can determine what they are doing. But, for now, let‚Äôs observe that our hypothesis that they seem to be fighting a ‚Äòcold war‚Äô from the shadows seems to be holding true. I hesitate to theorize as to *why* they are doing that when military conquest would be more rapid, although I can come up with various plausible sounding explanations.¬† I am sure each of you could come up with many of the same explanations as well. The problem is that we lack any *evidence* and so any explanation for why the aliens are behaving this way would be built on our assumptions rather than any actual information. Regardless of *why* the aliens are approaching thighs this way, we can observe the basic fact that they *are* doing it and react accordingly.¬† Regardless of the explanation, the fact that they are remaining in the shadows has benefits but also some challenges. The challenge is, as Ms Lee already indicated, keeping everyone focused on the threat of the Alien invasion when it no longer seems like an imminent crisis. The benefit is simple, it gives us time to organize so that if and when the Aliens decide to actually invade, we will be ready. So, in essence, we have two faces to our war with them: Tracking them down and determining what they are doing is the first face.¬† Preparing and organizing humans for the eventual struggle is the second one. Both are critical.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor the first face, we already doing what we can: Ms. Lee, with the help of the various contacts you all have, has developed contacts and connections with various intelligence and surveillance agencies around the world. We have collated what little data we have about the rumors of abductions to help us sift through the morass of rumors to find something real.¬† For now, all we can do is keep an eye out using those contacts and hope that eventually we catch some sign of them and their activities that we can investigate further.‚Äù

Eduardo tapped on his computer and a map of Europe was projected on the screen.

‚ÄúNow, in terms of that second face, our current and obvious goal is to continue to expand our influence in the EU. A key step in that is going to be to somehow use our influence to push at least part of the EU towards further integration, ideally towards becoming one multinational state. Beyond the obvious challenge of influencing members of the EU who we have not been able to focus on, two additional challenges present themselves.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/7chla1xilkve1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f3ab01ccefd37c8d07843a89296f3abcc2b121

‚ÄúThe first is going to be to prevent any members of the EU from withdrawing. I‚Äôm sure in time we could bring them back around, but as Brexit has demonstrated once that step is taken it becomes difficult to walk back. Sooner or later the other groups will realize what we are doing and will use their influence to push countries out of the Union. We must prevent them from doing so.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe second challenge is logistical.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/syhywi8nlkve1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=33db6c73fe858a2786464bce36c73a1068022f69

‚ÄúIt turns out,‚Äù -- his tone became very dry -- ‚Äúthat even shadowy deep state conspiracies influencing governments from behind the scenes have a limited ability to organize the endeavor.‚Äù

Everyone chuckled dutifully.

‚ÄúJoking aside, the problem is very real. We are not the elected government of any country. We do not have anything so stable as a ‚Äòdemocratic mandate‚Äô or any similar mechanism ensuring that our policy choices and our people remain in place.¬† Our influence over policy and spending derives from the various bureaucrats and other decision makers we have convinced government officials to put in place, or the existing ones we have influenced to our cause.¬† Any of them could turn on us like that‚Äù he snapped his fingers. ‚Äúand the average person in the street, assuming they support our cause, would take months, or even years, to notice.¬† That is, assuming they ever did, since some of the policy consequences would have no immediate impact on their lives whatsoever.‚Äù

‚ÄúSince this is the case, members of our organization have to spend time and effort keeping track of things to make sure everything is proceeding as planned. And even when our influence remains in place there are thousands of details our staff have to take care of: paperwork for the funding of labs for our research projects, handling the financial details of the various funds that are given to corporations and NGO‚Äôs that are the ‚Äòface‚Äô of our organization, keeping track of economic development projects we are organizing for this or that purpose, collating and organizing the intelligence we‚Äôve been given access to, the list goes on.¬† All of this takes administrative capacity and according to the Commander‚Äù he nodded to Fiona ‚Äúwe are more or less at the limit of our organization as it currently stands.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously, given that our goals are ever so slightly more ambitious than the mere task of influencing policy in Germany, France, Luxembourg and Belgium, we will need to do two things.¬† First, the Commander and I have been working to see what ways we might securely expand our capacities. Secondly, our goal towards integration is actually related to this problem as well. If we can successfully push France, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium to fully integrate into one country then instead of devoting our staff to keeping track of policy in four countries we would keep track of policy in one larger country. That unified country would take more work than any of those individual three, but overall it would take less than the four countries combined do at the present.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you all see what this means for our immediate goals. We do not yet have the capacity to, for example, influence Italy the way we do Germany and France. And yet we cannot allow the Academy to maintain its presence there lest they use it to convince the Italian government to pull out of the EU. So for the moment our goal is going to at least temporarily disrupt the influence of other organizations in the EU countries while at the same time pushing France, Germany and Belgium to unify and seeing how we can expand our administrative capacity securely at the same time.‚Äù

He smiled slightly. ‚ÄúAmong other things this means I will finally earn my princely salary since the Commander and I agree that I am the individual who is best qualified to meet with the governments of those countries and push them towards coming up with a workable plan towards unification. Once that plan is ready one or more of you will need to push them towards actually implementing it, but some ground work to even begin theorizing what that government structure would look like is necessary for such a proposal to not be dead in the water.‚Äù

Bindi tapped her fingers on the table for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat kind of structure will you be pushing for?‚Äù

‚ÄúAn acceptable one.‚Äù Eduardo chuckled.

‚ÄúMore seriously, I don‚Äôt have many firm commitments on what they should do. By its very nature it will have to be a Federal Union rather than Unitary in structure. I have a preference for a more Parliamentary system versus a Presidential one, and ideally I would like a powerful executive along with it, and definitely hope to avoid a *weak* one, but it's really up to them. I don‚Äôt care too much what *kind* of government they unify under, so long as it *is* a unified government. And a democratic one of course, but that goes without saying.‚Äù¬†

His eyes lost focus as he considered the issue. ‚ÄúOne complication here is that the EU¬† *exists* as a governmental body made up of its constituent nations. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I am going to be working with various policy makers on the question of what the relationship of this ‚Äúcountry‚Äù of the EU, which will be made up ideally of France, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium at a start, will have within the already existing structure of the EU government.‚Äù

He shook his head as if to clear it and then sighed. ‚ÄúI anticipate quite a few meetings in my near future. You all are too, I am sure. That too will be part of our ‚Äònew normal‚Äô even if it's not quite as hectic, thankfully‚Äù

He paused to think and then took a moment to look at his laptop. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs agree to meet again in person at the start of June. I‚Äôd like to organize it so that we meet in person twice each year. We‚Äôll obviously meet more frequently online and other in person meetings will happen, especially whenever the inevitable unforeseen crisis rears its ugly head, but that will allow us to have a predictable schedule to take a step back like this and consider our more medium and long term strategy.‚Äù

He saw nods around the table.

‚ÄúExcellent. In that case, unless anyone has questions, comments or anything else to add, I think we can wrap up?‚Äù

After a moment of silence, he nodded. ‚ÄúAs I mentioned when we started out, this will not be a rapid endeavor. The rest of the world has joined us in understanding that we are here to deal with the reality of the alien presence in the long haul. By arriving as they have, the Aliens have thrown us all into a dark forest with uncertain paths, unknown dangers and with no idea of the exit. As we all explore the forest that is this ‚Äònew normal‚Äô keep in mind that it is not the old normal. The aliens are being quiet enough in their efforts that the world as a whole has lulled itself into not treating their presence as a matter of urgency. But they are out there. It is up to us to find them, figure out who they are and what their actual plan is and then stop it. The urgency of that task, even if it occurs in the context of a life that has fallen back into mundane normality, has not changed. Let‚Äôs be about it.‚Äù

I started dating this girl a few months ago. She's beautiful, charming, and always knows exactly what to say.

At first, it felt like a dream. She'd compliment me constantly, laugh at all my jokes, and talk about our ""future"" after just a couple dates.

**But something started to feel.. off.**

I'd pick her up and she'd always ""forget"" her wallet. Every dinner, every coffee run, every weekend trip, always on me. I didn't mind at first, but it became a pattern.

Then came the ""emergencies"". She needed help with rent. Then her car. Then her phone bill. I helped because I cared.

But when I stopped offering, things changed fast. She got cold, distant, and suddenly ""busy"". The sweet good morning texts? Gone. The affection? Gone. Unless I Venmoed her for something.

It hit me hard last night when I asked her if she wanted to just stay in and cook, and she replied:

**""Ugh, what's the point of dating someone successful if we're acting broke?""**

I haven't responded since. My friends say I got played. My gut says I did too.

How do you know if she's genuinely into you, or just into what you can provide? Is there a clear sign I missed early on?

Genuinely curious how others have handled this.
