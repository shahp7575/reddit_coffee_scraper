1pj3l6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1pj3l6c/im_a_35m_vegetarian_software_engineer_and_my/,I'm a 35M vegetarian software engineer and my standard Indian lunch was destroying my afternoons. My new plan to fix the 'Atta-Roti' crash.,"Every single workday, about 30 minutes after I eat my typical Indian lunch-3 rotis with sabzi and sometimes with dahi - my brain completely shuts down. I get hit by a brutal brain fog, lethargy, and sleepiness that lasts for hours, completely killing my afternoon productivity.

As a 35-year-old vegetarian with a desk job, I realized I couldn't blame my motivation anymore; I had to blame my diet and biology.

# The Problem: Why the Carb Crash Hits So Hard

My simple lunch is an almost perfect trap:

1. **High Glycemic Load:** *Atta* (the flour used for roti) is a dense carb. Without enough balancing protein or fiber, this meal might be causing a massive insulin spike, which is quickly followed by a sugar crash. That crash is the brain fog.
2. **Too Many Calories for No Movement:** Three rotis is a lot of energy. Since I just sit at a desk, my body diverts all its resources to digesting that huge meal instead of giving energy to my brain.

# The Plan: Heavy Breakfast, Zero Lunch

Starting tomorrow, I'm trying a two-part change to reclaim my afternoons.

**Part 1: The Diet Shift (Heavy Breakfast, Skip Lunch)**

I'm removing the crash source by skipping lunch completely. I'll focus on two large, strategic meals.

* **Breakfast :** This has to be huge and focused on protein. I'll load up on high-protein vegetarian options like *besan*/*moong dal chilla* or *poha/upma* that's packed with groundnuts and sprouts. This should keep me full and energized until the evening.
* **Lunch (0%):** Water, tea, or black coffee only. The goal is a fasted state for maximum mental clarity during peak work hours (1 PM to 5 PM).

**Part 2: The Lifestyle Shift (Movement)**

Being sedentary enables the crash, so I have to fix that too.

* **Daily Walking:** Non-negotiable. Movement helps with digestion and uses up some of the energy I consume.

I'm hoping this is the productivity hack I need. If anyone else has beaten the classic Indian post-lunch slump, I’d love to hear your strategic tips (especially for maximizing protein on a vegetarian diet!).

This has costed me a lot of wasted hours and productivity. I just hope it solves the issue. It's an experiment, not a tested strategy. ",1,1765376005.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

I didn't have the money at the time to book it myself or I would have and told her if she could book my stuff with hers I'd pay her the money that would be my stuff when I'd be able to get it, well out of the 3 things I said about doing (we were all looking at doing 3) the website would only for whatever reason allow her to book one and were giving her issues with the other 2 so she called and had to leave a message (haven't heard nothing back yet), so I was like okay how about these 2 things to replace what you couldn't book? 

Well apparently the one replacement thingy, the only time available is at the same time as the single thing she was able to actually book for me, so can't do that and no word on the second replacement option I gave her, I went to the site to see if maybe I could book them myself now that I have money in my account and pretty much everything I wanted to try is booked on the day we want to go so I'm pretty much thinking if she answers my question about how many things her and my other friend are doing and I'm stuck with only one which will take way less time then what theirs will be,  I'm just telling her to cancel and will still of course pay her the money if need be.

I'm not sitting there being bored at a now second worst experience trying to do something at a spa that I have had, I'd rather go to Barnes and noble, read books and drink coffee.

The first worst experience I had was when we went to a floatation spa, they weren't like the little pods but like its own little private room which I did like but none of the coloring changing lights that were supposed to turn one once the main lights went off (they were on a motion sensor) came on in my room so I was in PITCH black, which I did not like at all.

I had to keep pushing the door to the water open so the motion sensor would turn on the main lights, I was supposed to be in there an hour and only spent actually 10 minutes in the water because I couldn't handle being in pitch black, so I ended up on the bench in the room on my phone for the last 50, the spa did compensate me for that because of the lights not working, but like idk, so far I feel like I'm not meant to go to ANY spa at this point, neither of my experiences have been very pleasant thus far.

1pj3e2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pj3e2x/fights_are_getting_worse_with_my_wife/,Fights are getting worse with my wife,"Hi there. I'm a 33M, my wife and I have been together for 8 years since we started dating, we have been married 5 years. Almost two years ago we had our first baby boy. 

The first year with the baby wasn't really that bad, I mean, as exhausting as raising a newborn can be, my wife and I had each other's back. Sure we had a little dispute now and then, but nothing else.

This second year has been hell. I'm not even sure where I'm supposed to start. My daily schedule is:

- I wake up at 6, 7 or 8am depending on the baby. I cook breakfast for my baby (pancakes or some oatmeal) and also stir a coffee for myself.

- At 9am I take my baby somewhere, either for a bike ride or we go to some museum, or the park, etc. Anything to keep him distracted until noon when we are back. My wife studies during the morning that's why I try to take my son out so she can study in peace.

- We are back at noon. I always prepare the lunch the night before so my wife only has to unfreeze it when we are about to come back. We three eat lunch together, then my wife takes my son to the daycare.

- At 1pm I go online to start working.

- My wife has from 1pm to 4pm free to do whatever she needs, either study or do some house chores.

- I pause my work at 7-8pm, go back to the house to prepare the bath for my son. At this point my wife has already feed him dinner. I bath my son, and put him to sleep. Usually he's asleep by 9 or 9.30pm.

- After that usually I work a bit more as there might be things that I didn't get to finish during the day, so I go back to work.

- Then is either just going to sleep or cooking launch/dinner for the next day and doing the dishes.

All this being said. During the last year my wife has done nothing but criticize everything I do. You forgot the milk out of the fridge. You put the groceries way too high in the shelves I cannot reach them. You used the outdoors broom indoors. I don't like this brand of wipes, I told you already. It's like this every fucking day. I have even tried to do more chores to take things off her plate. But nothing changes. We got into a big argument the other day, I don't even remember what was the BS that started it. She apologized afterwards saying that there was no need to take things that far. It is like this every week at least once. The only thing keeping me from getting a divorce is our son. We both together are good parents, but I think we don't make a good couple.

On top of all this I have Crohn's and the stress of these fights is making it much worse than ever before. I get no stress from anything else, work is good, economy is good, but somehow my wife always has a new issue to bring up every day.

people use them for skin elasticity, joint support, and sometimes hair and nails. the research is
mixed, but there are solid studies showing improvements when taken consistently over a few
months.
[unflavored collagen](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO1298) peptides are
the simplest version. they dissolve well in coffee, tea, or smoothies and don’t change the taste.
that makes them easy to stick with every day, which is the most important part.

Multi collagen blends, like the one from [micro
ingredients](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO1305), mix different types of
collagen together. type i and iii are usually aimed at skin and hair, while type ii is more for joints.
having them all in one scoop can be useful if you want a broader approach instead of buying
separate products.

The main thing is consistency and dosage. most studies use around 10 grams a day, though the
serving sizes can vary by brand. it’s not an instant change, more something you notice gradually
after a couple of months.
they’re generally considered safe, but it’s worth checking the ingredient label if you have

I am really excited to share Spinach with you.

Spinach is a Vegan Guide & Map. Designed to help you finding the best vegan options around, and make dining decisions fast, easy, and exciting.

The features I am most proud of in Spinach are:

1. **Spinach ratings**. The app looks at various signals and reviews and processes them in a way that highlight the actual quality of vegan food offering.
2. **Vegan Friendliness Index**. Going to a non-vegan place is rarely fun. It’s hard to predict what to expect. VFI helps! It’s the assessment based on availability of options, vegan proteins, menu clarity/markings, and staff friendliness.
3. **Dish Rankings**. Spinach is a smart veggie. It labels opinions to know if a place is praised for a certain dish. It can tell you what is the best dish in your town or how a dish is ranked across various restaurants. Like what is the #1 #2 or #5 vegan pizza/pad thai/tacos.
4. **Top Picks.** There’s a separate tab just to tell you what’s unmissable anywhere you go. It can also help you find the right spot for the right occasion. It has the Must Go places, but also best vegan spots for dates, or best places to get coffee and work from.

*For background*: I ran HappyCow from 2022 to 2024. I joined to help rebuild it into a modern product. Unfortunately I’ve spent most of my time there fixing the business. I left to build this app, and so here we are.

I’m eager to hear your opinions, suggestions, struggles.

I am already working on enabling community contributions, including adding photos, reviews, updates and new places.

Go to [https://spinach.guide](https://spinach.guide) and test it yourself.

We hit it off so well and just spent two hours chatting with no pause, let alone an awkward one. There were compliments and laughter; I could not think of a more perfect connection. We had so much in common.

Before the date, we both agreed that we were meeting up because we were interested in pursuing a relationship with one another rather than just being friends. At the end, I made it clear that I liked her and wanted to see her again. The only thing I wish I could've done was initiate physical contact like a handshake or a hug even but I was a bit nervous and we were just so engrossed in talking to each other from the get go that I didn't even think about it.

For the second date, she suggested going to an art gallery, which is great. Art is one of the things we both love to talk about; it is what brought us together initially. But I was wondering how I can make this kind of date a little bit more romantic? We both know we are interested in each other romantically so I want to do romantic things to firmly establish that kind of connection/chemistry. I am a person that likes to take things slowly (I think she could be too) but I am worried that she will start to see me more as a friend if we don't start doing the romantic stuff.

We are experiencing some problems with it and I’m hoping others may have some insight rather than having to send it back.  


When making milk drinks we cannot get it to make the proper amounts more often than 1 in 4 drinks.  Three of the drinks come out with a fraction of the espresso, I’m talking less than half, and less than a third of the milk.   We use caffe latte with 3 ounces of espresso and 8 ounces of milk.  We get about 4 ounces out total.  


We have ran the clean cycle, we have adjusted the grind setting.  Nothing seems to be working to make it dispense consistently.  We are using extremely cold oat milk and selecting plant based on the menu.  Even if that was the problem I wouldn’t expect it to impact how much espresso it is dispensing.  


Any tips?  Thanks!",1,1765374777.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Now he resents it and I have no idea what to do with that""","I am 30F, officially diagnosed with ADHD last year but obviously this has been my whole life. My boyfriend is 32M, we have been together 3 years and living together almost 2. When we first started dating he honestly thought my ADHD traits were cute and fun. He loved that I could say on Friday afternoon ""hey lets drive to the coast tonight"" and actually follow through. He would brag to his friends that I am the kind of person who will stay up until 2 am painting or baking because I suddenly got inspired. He described me as spontaneous, creative, the girl who brings energy to every room. Back then my scattered apartment, random half finished crafts and habit of losing my keys inside my own bag were quirks to him. I also treated it like a personality thing, not a disability. I knew I was messy and forgetful but I also held a job, paid my bills, so I thought it was just ""how I am"". Since we moved in together though, the vibe has changed a lot. All the things that once felt charming now seem to be on his mental list of reasons I am ""not serious about life"". I see it in his face when he walks in from work and the sink has dishes or there are 3 different glasses of water on the coffee table. He sighs in this way that makes me feel ten inches tall. If he cant find something, his first line is ""ok what did you move this time"". Most of the time he is right, I did move it, but it still hits hard.



The frustrating part is that I am actually working really hard in the background. After diagnosis I started meds, therapy, timers on my phone, whiteboard on the fridge, all of it. I set alarms for ""take the chicken out of the freezer"", ""switch laundry"", ""brush teeth before you crash on the couch"". When I tried to talk to him about it he said he was proud of me, but then keeps acting like I simply do not care. If I ask for a small accommodation, like ""please do not tell me things while you are walking out the door, text them so I do not instantly forget"", he either forgets or jokes about it. He will drop something important on his way to work and then be annoyed that I didnt remember it 9 hours later. When I explained to him that executive dysfunction is not the same as laziness, he said ""I get it, I also struggle sometimes, I just push through"" which felt like a punch. We even had him come to one of my therapy sessions. He was polite, listened, nodded, but at home he still phrases things like ""if you just tried a bit harder"" or ""you need to grow up"". I keep bouncing between guilt and anger. I know living with me is not always easy. I know I leave doors half closed and get hyperfocused on the wrong task. At the same time, he still enjoys the parts of ADHD that benefit him, like me remembering every birthday in his family or planning trips. He just hates the price tag that comes with it. We are stuck in this loop where he feels like the only adult in the house and I feel like a teenager being graded. I do not want a parent, I want a partner. I am scared that if I keep bringing it up, he will decide it is too much work and leave. I am also scared that if I keep swallowing it, I will slowly burn out and start resenting him. For women here with ADHD who live with neurotypical partners, how did you get from ""this is cute chaos"" to ""this is a real condition that we manage together"", instead of what I have now where he seems to think he got sold a defective product after the warranty ran out.

I have been spending way too much time and money getting crappy coffee at expensive cafes and was thinking if I should get one of these.

She swears by this, and even had a classic jar and strainer method that she used to use earlier. I was thinking maybe this xmas I could buy one for myself but I wanted feedback from people who have used it before and whether they have noticed a apparent difference in taste. I noticed that the coffee tasted a lot more sweeter and smooth and the overall experience of drinking coffee was just really nice. I have looked at a couple of machines on sites like Alibaba and Amazon, and found that there are simple immersion systems to larger automatic brewers taht claim to make cafe-level cold brew in a couple of hours.

Not my favorites, not what I consider the best, but the ones that, for some reason, got stuck in my head and I think about often.

Movies with such unique qualities that you can’t disregard them, even if they’re not the most amazing or enlightening thing you’ve seen. Films that bring something new to the table: genre-bending, visually striking, pushing the language of filmmaking forward or touching you so deeply they’re impossible to forget.

Here are mine, listed by year with a one‑line review. I’d love to see yours! This feels like a deeply personal exercise and it’d be fun to compare.

# 2020

* **Borat: Subsequent Movie Film** – US/UK – Jason Wolinber - He lived in the nutjobs’ house, in character, for five fucking days!
* **Host** – UK – Rob Savage - Peak pandemic filmmaking. Super scary and all over a Zoom call!

# 2021

* **In The Earth** – UK – Ben Wheatley - Another pandemic-era production. Wheatley is a living legend at this point.
* **Bad Trip** – USA – Kitao Sakurai - You may not like it, but you laughed at the Gorilla skit. Unique as hell.
* **Last Night In Soho** – UK/USA – Edgar Wright - Looks spectacular. Mirror scenes will be as iconic as the famous Contact shot.

# 2022

* **Skinamarink** – Canada – Kyle Edward Ball - Best kind of polarizing there is. I felt the dread!
* **Crimes of the Future** – Canada/Greece – David Cronenberg - Cronenberg gave us a lot, but Viggo Mortensen squatting might be one of his greatest contributions.
* **Incantation** – Taiwan – Kevin Ko - I felt dirty watching this. Feels like it was made by the devil himself.
* **The Coffee Table** – Spain – Caye Casas - If a movie isn’t great but punches you in the gut… does it become great?
* **Lola** – Ireland/UK – Andrew Legge - Having no budget is not a problem when you’re fucking brilliant.

# 2023

* **When Evil Lurks** – Argentina – Demián Rugna - Took two Xanax after watching it. What a ride.
* **Late Night With The Devil** – Australia/USA – Cameron & Colin Cairnes - Too cool to hate it even with its A.I. use.
* **Reality** – USA – Tina Satter - I’ll watch whatever Tina Satter does next. Also: Sydney Sweeney might be an accidental eugenicist, but she can carry a movie.

# 2024

* **Cloud** – Japan – Kiyoshi Kurosawa - This is all genres in one movie and it excels in everything.
* **I Saw The TV Glow** – USA – Jane Schoenbrun - Do you remember watching The Pink Opaque?
* **The Remarkable Life of Ibelin** – Norway – Benjamin Ree - I’m not crying.
* **Presence** – USA – Steven Soderbergh - Soderbergh. Hand‑held. Ghosts. Say no more.

# 2025

He needs to leave the house at 5am. His routine is to set the alarm for 4. Snooze until 4:15. Get up, sit in the bathroom for 15-20 minutes. Walk out to the garage where he keeps his clean clothes in a laundry basket next to the washer/dryer, pick out his clothes, come back through the bedroom and to the bathroom where he gets dressed and ready for another 15-20 minutes. On his way back from the garage he fills my coffee cup and brings it to me in the bedroom. He uses the flashlight on his phone and doesn’t turn on the overhead lights in the bedroom. Regardless, coming in and out of the bedroom and using the flashlight wakes me up every day. I do not have to get up until 5:45 or 6 am. I could use the extra hour or more of sleep. 

I asked him if he could pick out his clothes the night before, put them in the bathroom, and then not have to come in and out of the bedroom. He was super resistant to this idea, not sure why. I explained that I need more sleep (going to sleep around 10 and waking up at 4:30ish) and it would help me if he would make this adjustment. He was defensive and resistant to this request, which seemed surprising. He did it once and I communicated how nice it was to have the extra hour of sleep and how much I appreciated it. And then he didn’t do it the next day. I asked him if putting his clothes in the bathroom the night before messed up his morning routine and he said “kind of, yeah”. He’s never done it again. 

First, I’m continually frustrated by not being able to sleep as long as I would like. I have a strong internal alarm clock and when I get woken up at 4:15 every day I end up waking up at this time even when I don’t have to, like weekends. But more so I’m so frustrated that I feel like I calmly and rationally asked for what I want and need and he hasn’t accommodated it or explained why he won’t. Now almost every morning while I sit awake in bed unnecessarily as he sits in the bathroom for half an hour I get more and more resentful. Then he wants to snuggle for a minute before heading out the door at 5 and wonders why I’m cold and bitter and distant. 

I know it’s a stupid thing to be mad about but it seems emblematic of how he expects the rest of the household to accommodate his schedule.  AIO?",6,1765374342.0,AmIOverreacting,17,0.88,False

okay so. as i said in the title, my mom and grandma think i have an eating disorder, but i'm not so sure. i might just be delusional or sick and i don't see the problem but please hear me out. 

to preface, i AM doing all of that to lose weight. i hate my body. i'm ftm, so it's obvious as to why. i was never overweight and i have great passing, but my aunt once said to my mom ""wow, u/intothefloodagainnnn has a huge ass"" and i STILL remember it. my grandma recently said that i used to have a huge ass and chest and now i've ""shrunk"". 

they think it's bad i bought a food scale to make sure the calories i count are accurate. but i don't even have a regular one so i can't weight myself. another thing they find weird is that i stopped drinking regular soda, but to be fair i was always one of the weird people who prefer the sugarfree versions. i also stopped using sugar in tea or coffee, i use substitutes like those sweeteners in tiny tablets

however i don't think any of those indicate a problem?? like i had blood tests done a few weeks ago and the doctor said the results are perfect. i feel fine, too. 

i have some rules (like chewing gum/drinking coffee or energy drinks or water to suppress the urge to eat - bear in mind it's NOT hunger. i don't remember the last time i felt truly hungry.) and foods i would never ever eat/eat again (like fast food in general, chocolate spread, peanut butter, ramen, potatoes, butter, frozen pizza) but i think it's because i never really had them growing up so i don't see the appeal or urge to try now. 

in general i think i eat pretty healthy, i include fruit and vegetables in my meals and i eat all i want as long as it's under my limit. i even bought an airfryer to cook low-cal dinners. i substitute regular bread and breadrolls for crisp bread, regular mayo for light mayo, regular chips for oven-baked ones, etc. but even since i started counting cals and trying to lose weight, i deadass eat healthier. i started experimenting with vegetables and trying healthy recipes. if anything they should be proud 

another thing. i have a sweeth tooth but i can totally see myself cutting out sweets completely. i did cut out most of them anyway. i still like and buy some brands BUT ever since i found protein puddings and konjac jelly i don't really miss regular chocolate or desserts. i absolutely love lollipops tho and this is the one thing i wouldn't give up. fruit flavored tea also scratches the itch for me, and yes i've tried the slimming teas but in my opinion they don't really work 

i've read online that people with eating disorders tend to overexercise and i never ever done that. ever since it got cold (at least where i live) i'm only active when i go shopping. when it's warm outside i looooove to ride my bike around my village listening to music, min. 2 hours a day. but this is something i've been doing since my childhood so i don't think it counts. during late autumn/winter i'm barely active. i also never throw up the food i eat. i find vomiting absolutely disgusting and i hate it 

i'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything like that. i just wanted to vent somewhere and i hope i won't be judged. i'm already feeling so judged at home, i'm ashamed to make my food because every time i'm in the kitchen everyone suddenly wants something. apologies if i made any mistakes, english is not my first language. please tell me if i broke any rules.",0,1765374177.0,EDAnonymous,5,0.5,False

1pj2usn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfAmazonHQ/comments/1pj2usn/i_live_with_white_carpeting_a_frazzled_guide_to/,I Live with White Carpeting: A Frazzled Guide to Carpet Cleaning,"Hi, my name is Regret. I installed wall-to-wall white carpet in my entire downstairs area two years ago (I live in florida in case that explains it, that’s just what the vibe down here’s like). I thought it would make the space look bright and serene. It did. For one week. Then my dog had a stomach bug, someone dropped red wine, and I learned what toddler yogurt projectile physics looked like. :D So obviously, I had to figure out how to clean that shit and maintain at least a nice cream color on the carpeting if I couldn’t get a pure dazzling white.

Cue the research and now that I know what I know after a lot of trial and error and tiktok videos (wait has anyone seen that one of the lady who stained her white carpet a week before selling her house?) so now I’ll give all you lovely people all this info so you don’t have to spiral like I did Home Remedies: Test out the cheaper stuff first, like I’m only including the ones that actually worked for me, got these off the net and tiktok and stuff. But they’re pretty basic so I trust my sources.

1. Dawn Dish Soap + Hydrogen Peroxide This is the MVP. Especially for organic stains (coffee, wine, pet puke, etc.). Mix 1 part blue Dawn with 2 parts hydrogen peroxide. Spray lightly, blot (don’t rub), then rinse with warm water. Note: This can bleach darker carpets. Spot test first. Also on white, go slow and don’t pour the whole thing over it or it’ll turn blue.
2. White Vinegar + Warm Water + a Tiny Bit of Dish Soap Safe for most carpet types. Works well on light odors, mild stains, and mysterious splotches. Less effective on protein-heavy things (blood, pet stuff). This is just for basic maintenance, like you can add the sol to your vacuum if it has the little slot for it.
3. Club Soda for Fresh Wine Stains Immediately pour club soda on the stain and blot like your life depends on it. Don't scrub. It works if you catch it early. (I’m a wino if it wasn’t fkn obvious) Things to Avoid:

* OxiClean directly on carpets: too harsh on wool blends.
* Too much water: can soak into the pad = mold party (don’t even try it)
* Essential oils: your carpet doesn’t need to smell like a spa, it needs to be clean. Oils can stain.

Okay so obviously these work mostly on milder stains and all depend on the amount of elbow grease you put in, so for larger areas of carpet you do need one of those carpet cleaner machines. I am gonna leave a review here for some of the good ones, feel free to add onto it in the comments. Ok I see a lot of tables for reviews here, but i’m not very tech savvy, so just putting up simple pro con lists and I put all the products into like an Amazon list that I’m linking here in case anyone needs it:

Shark Stain Striker Pros:

* Super compact and easy to store
* Dual solution tanks = less refilling mid-clean
* Great for fresh stains, rugs, and upholstery
* Spray pressure is solid meaning it actually hits the stain Cons:
* Not built for whole-room carpet cleaning You need their cleaning solution for best results
* Hose is a little short if you’re reaching awkward spots

Bissell s Little Green (Pet Deluxe I think) Pros:

* Amazing for pet stains and smells
* Works well with enzyme cleaners
* Comes with pet tools that actually WORK (like the brush and the crevice one, sooo good)
* Feels durable, not plasticky Cons:
* Small tank = lots of trips to the sink
* Still needs manual scrubbing in some cases
* Suction isn’t always great on thicker rugs

Hoover’s SmartWash Automatic Pros:

* Push to wash, pull to dry = very intuitive
* Covers big areas quickly
* Has a dry-only mode (surprisingly useful)
* Deep cleans better than expected Cons:
* It’s heavy and a bit bulky
* Needs a pre-vacuum EVERY TIME
* Not great for tight corners or stairs (no crevice tool sadly) Hope this helped someone out. Honestly, if you have an area rug only, then the home remedies should be enough or a tiny handheld vacuum but if its wall to wall, its better to have a machine on hand.

I'm a 34 y/o male and taking the entrepreneurial route with highs and lows in terms of success, but always high stress. A few months ago, I started taking a liking to energy drinks instead of regular coffee. I was drinking a coffee or two + one can of energy drinks every day, until last Saturday.

I was walking around with my gf when I suddenly felt my face red and warm, out of the blue, so I asked her to please sit down for a bit. That day was awful. Accelerated high-rate, short-breathing, feeling of discomfort, damn, terrible weekend.

I stopped doing anything until I could visit the doctor, which was yesterday (including drinking coffee). Lo and behold, the dude told me I'm having panic attacks. 

So I've been caffeine-less since Saturday, and I feel my body aching a bit and have a slight headache. I don't miss the coffee, honestly, but damn, I hate how I'm feeling right now.

I had a baby (1, M) last year and my 8 year old has been really struggling with jealousy around growing up/not being a baby anymore. I’m super sensitive to it, and have been really making a conscious effort to make him feel important. My MIL got the baby a few toys for Christmas he’ll love - talking Mickey, ride on Mickey Mouse car, etc. but she got my 8 year old a board game, a nutcracker and an art/coffee table book.

My 8 year old isn’t into board games and i genuinely am so confused why she got him a Basqiuat coffee table book. She said she thought it’d inspire him, but like, he’s an 8 year old kid who draws Roblox characters sometimes but isn’t super into drawing for drawings sake. (If that makes sense).

I expressed my concern that the 8 year old is going to show up on Christmas and see the 1 year old get this big car that can’t be wrapped and get fun toys, and he’ll get a board game and a book meant for an adult and feel sad. She defended her decision and think it’s unfair for me to ask her to get anything else because the nutcracker was $50 and his big gift (he likes nutcrackers but this confused me too).

1pj2q2y,https://i.redd.it/kxe7d3fgqd6g1.png,Why December 12th is the Most Powerful Day to Manifest Love,"*“Laila, I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I’m 34. I’ve been on dating apps for six years. I’ve had three situationships that felt like relationships until they didn’t. I’ve been ghosted by men who said they loved me. And the worst part? I’m not even sad anymore. I’m just numb.”*

That’s what the woman on my screen said during our private video session last November, her voice cracking with exhaustion. I’ve heard variations of this confession hundreds of times in my energy healing practice — the loneliness isn’t poetic, it’s physical. The spiritual exhaustion of modern dating runs deeper than disappointment. It’s soul-level depletion.

But what breaks my heart most is this: we’re living in the most connected era in human history, yet finding real love has never felt more impossible. Dating apps promise endless options but deliver endless disappointment. “Commitment issues” has become an accepted personality trait rather than something to heal through relationship guidance. Ghosting is so normalized we have a casual term for it. We’ve got “situationships” instead of relationships, “talking stages” that last months with no progression, breadcrumbing, benching, orbiting — an entire vocabulary for all the ways people refuse to actually love each other.

Another client told me during a soulmate reading: *“I’ve stopped putting effort into my dating profile pictures. What’s the point? They’ll like me, we’ll talk for weeks, then they’ll just… disappear. I’m tired of being someone’s maybe.”* A third client, tears streaming during our spiritual transformation session, said: *“Everyone keeps telling me it’ll happen when I stop looking. But I stopped looking two years ago and I’m still alone. When does it actually happen?”*

The [love compass](https://app.coto.world/oMpAiktbZYb) isn’t just broken — it’s been shattered. And we’re all walking around bleeding, pretending we’re fine, wondering why we can’t find our way home to someone’s heart. This is where energy healing for love becomes essential — not as a quick fix, but as spiritual surgery that addresses the root cause of why authentic connection keeps slipping through your fingers.

# The 12:12 Portal: When the Universe Opens a Doorway

When I pulled tarot cards for that first client during our relationship guidance session, three cards appeared: The Star — hope, renewal, cosmic alignment. The Two of Cups — divine partnership, soulmate connection. And The Magician — manifestation power, taking spiritual action. I looked at her tear-stained face and said, “You’re not behind schedule. You’re right on time. December 12th is coming. That’s your doorway.”

The [12:12 portal](https://app.coto.world/oMpAiktbZYb) isn’t just another spiritual date on a calendar. In tarot, 12 represents The Hanged Man — the card of surrender, divine timing, seeing everything from a completely new perspective. When you double it to 12:12, you’re creating a mirror between the spiritual and physical realms. In numerology, 1+2+1+2 equals 6 — the number of unconditional love, harmony, and divine partnership. This isn’t puppy love or infatuation. This is soul-level recognition, the kind of spiritual transformation that rewrites your entire relationship blueprint.

Here’s what I’ve learned reading tarot for people who’ve lost faith in love: the cards don’t lie about timing. When The Star appears near the 12:12 portal, it’s the universe saying “your hope is about to be restored — but you have to participate in your own rescue.” The 12:12 portal amplifies your magnetic frequency exponentially. Think of it like this: every other day, you’re trying to manifest love with a flashlight. On December 12th, you’re activating a lighthouse beam that reaches across dimensions, calling in your soulmate with precision you simply cannot access on ordinary days.

I had a client who’d been manifesting for two years with no results — journaling, vision boards, affirmations, moon rituals. Nothing. We worked together during last year’s 12:12 portal ceremony. She met her now-fiancé on December 18th — six days after the energy healing session. Another client, a 42-year-old man who’d given up entirely on finding his person, did the portal work and received a message from his high school sweetheart on December 15th. They’re married now. A third client met her partner on January 3rd at a coffee shop she’d been going to for three years — he’d started going there in December, feeling an inexplicable pull to change his routine right after New Year’s.

That’s not coincidence. That’s cosmic magnetism activated on 12:12, rearranging two people’s lives through spiritual transformation so their paths finally cross. But the magnetism only works if you activate it. Your soulmate signal — that unique energetic frequency you emit — needs to be turned on, tuned up, amplified. December 12th is the one day the universe has maximum bandwidth to receive and broadcast your signal clearly.

I also have a client right now — she did the portal work just last December 12th. She’s been on three dates with someone she met in February, and while she doesn’t know yet if he’s “the one,” something is fundamentally different this time. She told me in our last session: “I’m not anxious. I’m not overthinking. I trust the process in a way I never have before. Even if this doesn’t work out, I know I’m finally ready for whoever is meant for me.” That’s the real transformation — not just manifesting a partner, but becoming the energetic match for the relationship you deserve.

# The Three Activations That Change Everything

After years of guiding clients through this portal in relationship guidance sessions, I’ve identified three non-negotiable actions that separate people who manifest their soulmate from people who stay stuck in painful patterns. These aren’t aesthetic rituals for Instagram. These are energetic activations that fundamentally shift your magnetic field and create the spiritual transformation necessary for authentic love.

**1. The Soulmate Letter: Writing From Your Healed Future Self**

Open a blank document. You’re going to write a letter — not to the universe, but to yourself one year from today, December 12th, 2025. You’re in a relationship with your person. You’re reading this letter together, maybe on your anniversary of meeting. You’re going to tell your past self — the one who’s exhausted from situationships and ghosting — what happened after you walked through the 12:12 portal.

Write in past tense with specifics: “Thank you for not settling for that situationship that felt comfortable but empty. Thank you for believing I deserved someone who actually shows up. Thank you for doing the portal work on December 12th, 2024, because six weeks later, I met them. And now, one year later, I can’t imagine my life without them.”

Don’t describe what they look like or what they do for work — describe how you FEEL. The security. The peace. The being-seen. The coming home to someone who actually stays. Describe the small moments: how they text you back, how they remember your coffee order, how they show up when they say they will. This level of specificity tells the universe exactly what energetic frequency to match you with.

Seal the letter. Date it. Put it somewhere sacred. One client did this three years ago and read it at her wedding last month — she couldn’t get through it without sobbing because everything had manifested exactly as written, but better than she’d imagined. The groom told me later that when she read certain phrases aloud — “someone who makes me laugh until my stomach hurts,” “someone who sees my anxiety and doesn’t run” — he realized she’d been describing him before they’d ever met.

The act of writing from your healed future collapses the timeline between your current loneliness and your coming belonging. The universe responds to certainty. This letter is your certainty made manifest, your first act of energy healing for love.

**2. The Space-Clearing Ceremony: Making Room for Them to Arrive**

On December 12th, you must physically create space for your soulmate to enter your life. This isn’t metaphorical spiritual transformation talk — this is literal, physical action. Clean out half your closet. Yes, half. Clear one nightstand drawer completely. Make space in your bathroom cabinet. If you live in a studio apartment, rearrange furniture to create the energetic acknowledgment that your life is about to expand to include another person.

As you’re clearing physical space, you’re releasing energetic attachments through intentional relationship guidance work. Every situationship that went nowhere? Every person who ghosted you? Every almost-relationship that taught you not to trust? As you’re donating clothes and clearing drawers, release those attachments consciously. Say it out loud: “I release \[name if you remember it, or ‘the person who’ if you don’t\]. I release what they taught me about not being enough. I make space for someone who knows my worth without question.”

One client cried through this entire process. She’d been holding onto a drawer full of T-shirts from an ex-situationship — wearing them, sleeping in them, energetically keeping him present in her most intimate space. Clearing that drawer felt like finally exhaling after holding her breath for two years. One month later, she met her now-fiancé at a friend’s birthday party. When I asked her what changed, she said: “I stopped living like I was waiting for him to come back. I started living like I was making room for someone new.”

The universe was waiting for her to make room. It’s waiting for you too.

**3. The 12:12 Soulmate Magnet Ceremony: Professional Spiritual Transformation**

Here’s what I tell every client in our private video sessions: you can do portal work alone, but there’s exponential power in having a guide hold space for your transformation. Some spiritual work requires a trained practitioner who knows how to read the energy blocks you can’t see yourself.

The **12:12 Soulmate Magnet Ceremony** on [coto](https://app.coto.world/oMpAiktbZYb) is specifically designed for people who are done with situationships, done with ghosting, done with almost-love. It’s energy healing for love at the deepest level — not surface manifestation work, but spiritual surgery that identifies and removes the exact blocks keeping your person at a distance. During our private video sessions, we work with tarot guidance, energy clearing, and soulmate activation rituals calibrated specifically for the 12:12 portal’s unique frequency.

We identify unconscious patterns you’ve been running — maybe you’re unconsciously attracted to emotionally unavailable people because that’s what feels familiar. Maybe you have an ancestral pattern of women in your family who never found lasting love, and you’re carrying that lineage wound. Maybe you’ve built protective walls so high after being hurt that your soulmate can’t find the door to get in. The 12:12 ceremony doesn’t just activate your signal — it clears the interference that’s been blocking it.

The portal amplifies everything, but amplification without direction is just noise. The ceremony ensures your soulmate signal reaches your person clearly, powerfully, unmistakably. We don’t just manifest during these relationship guidance sessions — we perform energetic surgery that rewires your entire love blueprint at the cellular level.

One client told me after her ceremony: “I felt something physically shift in my chest during our session. Like something that had been locked for years suddenly opened. Two weeks later, I ran into my now-boyfriend at the grocery store — someone I’d seen there dozens of times before but never really noticed. This time, we both stopped in our tracks. He told me later he felt like he’d been looking for me his whole life.” That’s the 12:12 activation working — not creating attraction out of nothing, but removing the blocks that kept two people who were always meant to find each other from actually seeing one another.

# When the Door Finally Opens

Six months after our first session, that 34-year-old client requested another video call for a follow-up reading. When her camera turned on, I barely recognized her energy. She was glowing — not with makeup or a new haircut, but with the unmistakable radiance of someone who’s finally being loved the way they deserve.

“I need to tell you what happened,” she said, her voice completely different from that first call. “I did all three activations on December 12th. The letter, the space clearing, the ceremony with you. I’m not going to lie — nothing happened right away. I went on a few dates in January that went nowhere, and I almost lost faith. I almost called you crying that it didn’t work.”

She paused, smiling. “But then in late January, I matched with someone on an app I was literally about to delete. I almost didn’t respond to his message because I was so tired. But something made me answer. We met for coffee, and Laila… I can’t explain it. It was like my body recognized him before my brain did. Like I’d been searching for him in every face I’d ever seen, and suddenly there he was.”

“We’ve been together for five months now. I found the letter I wrote on 12:12 and read it last week. Everything I wrote — the feeling of being chosen, the security, the peace, the way he texts me back immediately, the way he talks about our future like it’s a certainty — it’s exactly what I have now. Better than I even imagined because I didn’t know I could feel this safe with someone.”

Her eyes welled up, but this time with joy instead of despair. “I thought I was too broken, too old, too late. I thought the universe had forgotten about me. But I wasn’t forgotten. I just needed to walk through the right door at the right time. December 12th was that door. The ceremony was the key. You were the guide who showed me how to turn it.”

This is what the 12:12 portal offers through authentic spiritual transformation: not just hope, but actual energetic activation. Not just wishing for love, but becoming magnetic to it. Not just wanting a soulmate, but clearing every block that’s kept them at a distance. The portal doesn’t create your person — they already exist, they’re already searching. It creates the conditions for you to finally find each other in a world designed to keep people lonely.

# Your Doorway Is Open Right Now

If you’re reading this on December 12th, you’re reading it at the exact moment you’re meant to. The universe doesn’t deliver messages randomly. The 12:12 portal is open right now. The cosmic bandwidth is at maximum capacity. Your soulmate — wherever they are, whatever they’re doing — can finally feel your signal if you choose to activate it today.

If you’re reading this before December 12th, you have time to prepare. Do the letter now. Start the space clearing. Book your ceremony so you have a guide holding space for your transformation when the portal opens. If you’re reading this after December 12th, the portal’s energy ripples for weeks afterward — divine timing is always perfect, even when it doesn’t feel like it.

The woman who thought she was too numb to ever feel love again? She’s not numb anymore. The exhaustion that felt permanent? It lifted. The loneliness that seemed like it would last forever? It didn’t. Because she chose to participate in her own rescue through energy healing for love. She chose to believe, one more time, that her person was searching for her too. She chose to walk through the doorway when it opened.

Your soulmate is searching for you too. They’re tired of situationships too. They’re ready for something real too. [The 12:12 portal ](https://app.coto.world/oMpAiktbZYb)is the day you both stop searching and start finding each other.

Looking for a sanity check before I lock things in. I've done some research myself but yes, I've taken AI's help in formulating this stack and also for writing this post. 

**Me / goals**

* 6’0"", 93 kg, waist at navel \~40"". Wear 36 jeans.
* Classic skinny-fat: slim arms/legs, most fat on belly + some face/double-chin + a bit on upper chest.
* Goal: drop waist to low 30s, lower body-fat%, get stronger without wrecking recovery.

**History / plan**

* Took \~2.5 years off. Tried a “real” workout last month and my arms basically locked up for a few days (DOMS from hell).
* Mid-November: easing in at home — light full-body 3x/wk + incline treadmill (Zone 2).
* Mid-December: proper gym full-body 5-6x/wk
* January: move to PPL if recovery’s good.

**Diet / quirks**

* Strictly vegetarian, no eggs. Paneer/dahi/tofu/soya are fine.
* Protein powders are OK but I get gas if I overdo it (whey isolate is better than blends for me).
* Coffee: black pre-workout, cappuccino mid-morning (10:30–11), black again 4–5 pm.
* BMR \~1800; starting \~2200 kcal on training days / \~2000 on rest days. Protein target \~160–180 g/day.

**Meds**

* Cholesterol : Nightly **rosuvastatin + fenofibrate** (combo tab) **Rosufit-F**.
* Considering **Rybelsus** 3MG (oral semaglutide) with the usual empty-stomach rules.
   * Why? Coz I know that belly fast is notoriously hard to get rid of, and I am open to any help I can get with that. 

**Supplement stack I’m considering** *Core daily*

* **Vitamin D3** 2000 IU (Correct insufficiency; mood, immunity, training recovery)
* **Magnesium (glycinate/bisglycinate)** 200–400 mg at night (Sleep quality, reduce cramps, support recovery)
* **L-theanine** 200 mg with morning coffee maybe 100–200 mg with the 4–5 pm coffee (Smoother focus; helps blunt caffeine jitters.)
* **Vegan omega-3 (algal)** aiming \~300–600 mg DHA/EPA (Cardio & triglycerides, anti-inflammatory support)
* **Multivitamin** (Centrum Men) — only if it’s actually useful, open to skipping  (Micronutrient “insurance” for any diet gaps.)
* **Good Bug “Metabolically Lean”** — 1 stick/day for 8 weeks to test
* **Psyllium (Isabgol)** 1–2 tsp at night if needed
* **B12 :** Adinofil-SL
* **Whey Isolate Protein**

*Focus / fatigue (optional)*

* **Citicoline (CDP-choline/Cognizin)** 250–500 mg AM (Core nootropic for focus/attention + working memory)
* **Rhodiola** 200–400 mg AM (stress/fatigue), maybe on a 5-days-on / 2-off rhythm (Fatigue resistance, stress coping; pairs well with theanine+coffee.)
* **L-tyrosine** 500–1000 mg only before heavy mental blocks, not daily (Acute focus under stress/sleep-loss)

*Performance (from January)*

* **Creatine monohydrate** 3–5 g/day, no loading

**Questions for you all**

1. Is this stack **overkill** for my situation? If you had to cut 2–3 things, which go first?
2. Any red flags or interactions with **rosuvastatin + fenofibrate** and **Rybelsus** in the mix?
3. For strict veg lifters in India: favorite **protein powder** that doesn’t wreck your gut? (Whey isolate vs pea/soy isolate brand recs welcome.)
4. **Rhodiola vs Citicoline** — what’s worked better for real-world focus? How did you dose/time it?
5. Anyone here used **Good Bug Metabolically Lean** long enough to see a difference? Worth it or just stick to fiber/protein/calories?
6. Any tweaks to the **ramp** to avoid another DOMS blow-up?

Not looking for medical advice, just trying to avoid dumb mistakes. Appreciate any brand/stack feedback from folks with similar profiles (veg, skinny-fat, returning to the gym). Thanks!",1,1765373493.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False

We have been dating for one 1.5 years. He is a great man- thoughtful, gentleman, caring and I can tell he does have genuine feelings for me. 
When we met, he was in the process of divorcing and been separated from his ex-wife for about 6 months. Anyway, we start dating and it becomes a serious relationship. 
I've never really asked anything much about his marriage and so on. For me it was important that they get divorced and it's done deal.
Fast forward to a few days ago when in a casual conversation he brings up that he saw his ex-wife a few weeks ago for her birthday over a coffee (which is 9 days after mine). I get mad but stay silent and ofc he immediately understands I got upset. He then continues to say how they are in good terms, how he was giving her some documents on that day since she needs them for citizenship (I am EU national, they are not and we live in an EU country). He then repeated a few times how doesn't think has done anything wrong and that he has 0 romantic feelings for her and hasn't had for a long time. I guess he is right but I still don't like it. Also, he mentioned that he is her guarantor for the apartment she lives in, since the landlord won't let her rent without that or whatever. This is the part that gets me most mad. In the country we live in, most landlords want that your netto income is 3× the rent. If not- you need a guarantor. I didn't say anything about that because I was reflecting on the whole situation but I don't think that's right. She can always move to a cheaper place, right? Yes, she doesnt earn nearly as much as my boyfriend but she is not earning minimum wage either and if she wants to she could move out. I would do that at least if i was her. So, I am guessing it's simply convenient for her and she feels entitled to my boyfriend's help.
At the beginning of out relationship, I was understanding that the divorce was taking longer since visas and so on were involved and he wanted to be decent to her. But the apartment thing is too much for me.

Plz Any Listeners? All Opinions/Input Appreciated,"Hello fellow Redditors,  \*\*Compliant Narcissist- Title edit\*\*

   I’ve been a follower on reddit for quite some time and have found solace in many fellow reddit posts… After spending all night reading similar posts of parental abuse I’ve decided to share my own story, this is my first ever post. I am really struggling & this is going to be all over the place so I sincerely apologize. Timeline sort of goes most recent-previous events/mixed… Also, please excuse the poor edit, after several hours venting, grammar is not my priority.

   I am unfortunately an only child to an extremely dysfunctional family; I have NO support from any extended family, I.E. aunts, uncles, cousins, ETC. My only living friend is going to prison. I’ve had 4 close friends pass away. I am essentially all alone, besides my absolutely beloved German Shepard dog, Mia. 

   Coming to terms with how screwed up my parents are FINALLY at the age of 26 I am seeing it. This realization has been Earth shattering & led me to try and commit suicide a couple weeks ago. I took all 11 painkillers I had for my Gallstones & the rest of my prescribed Kolnopin for sleep (about 5…) 

   Knowing mixing benzo’s and pk’s are an interaction, I went to bed hugging my dog & holding a golden angel figurine my closest friend (now passed) gave to me. For a split second after taking the pills I was scared, but once I laid down I was truly ready… I was not amused when I awoke… I was not going to tell my mom or dad I tried to kill myself as they like to throw me in the psyche unit as punishment over the age of 18… 4 addmissions & MANY misdiagnosis. (Will get there) But as me and my mom had an argument the next morning I got so upset, I told her. She literally said “I do NOT care.” Even after grabbing the empty prescription bottles from my bedside trash, she accused me of hiding the pills and not talking to them, INSTEAD OF BEING CONCERNED. 

   I went & locked myself in my bedroom with my dog. It was probably about 10:30 AM at this point, and I took the pills about 8:30 the prior night. She barked at my door and asked what time I took the pills, to which I replied “8:30…” She thought I meant AM (just 2 hours ago) & she said something to the effect of “you wouldn’t have been able to get out of bed.” Like she didn’t hear me throwing up in the bathroom around 9 AM that morning. When I corrected her & barked back through the door “PM” she replied “Well obviously they (the pills) didn’t do much for you.” She did say she was calling an ambulance, not out of care she likes to cause scenes. I told her I couldn't afford an ambulance and two why would they not just drive me to the ER?? I got up and got dressed, surprisingly for how many pills I took I really just had the spins & worst tummy/headache combo ever…

I said if I needed to go to the hospital I would bring myself. I didn’t die so I didn’t see the need to go in & my parents went to Lowe’s to get a new doorknob. 

   I stayed locked in my bedroom the entire rest of the day, and didn't eat. I only came out to use the bathroom, feed, get Mia fresh water & potty her. Neither of my lovely parents came to check on me, ask how I was feeling, nada. I later got screamed at by my father when I said they didn’t have to get me any Christmas presents (only conversation W/ either parent all that day,) which led me to leave the house in my car & sit in a gas station parking lot with a knife wanting to slit my wrists but was to much of a b\*itch. After maybe 30 minutes I decided to go home & lock myself back in my room as I had already taken my bedtime dose of Adderall (severe ADHD) & was tired. I also felt better as I had decided I was going to report my dad, he is a pedophile…

   Last April my parents were out to dinner. I was using my dad’s laptop and accidentally clicked on a saved bookmark… Well, I truly wish I had not as it was about a 12 year old girl in a very short “sexy” dress posing inappropriately. This discovery had led me to further search his laptop to which I found other searches for “cute 10 year old girl” images and that he was on underage group chats… I also searched his phone and found even younger girls, like a toddler (clothed) but with her butt facing upward in an awkward pose showcasing her like 2 or 3 year old butt (currently trying not to vomit.) A girl around 5 laying in bed with no shirt, ETC. Which is why people need to NOT post pictures of their babies W/O clothes… There are PEDOPHILES everywhere. The worst of which I discovered was I pulled up a whole page of his google search and clicked on a link. This link portrayed itself as a young girl photography site but once I clicked on a girl’s picture, it opened up child porn. I saw several images of young girl’s chests, like “boobs” that were not boobs yet, if that makes sense. 

   I showed my mom the images of the young girls on the laptop & took pictures on my phone of the images on my dad’s phone & sent them to my mother (not the porn, I was so disgusted & stunned I just exited immediately.) I told her about the porn & underage group chats… 

  I personally think my mom knew all along bc when I grabbed the laptop & told her I found some stuff, she said something like  “at least not underage girl stuff?” He has also destroyed 2 $800 Asus laptops… One he smashed years ago before I found any of this stuff, I remember him talking it to the basement & my mom I believe went down just to witness him smash it… He does not use drugs besides a hit or two of a joint daily & smokes cigarettes, so my mom knew he was not ordering drugs online, like what else would possess a man to smash a $800 laptop? 

   Now we are going to take a little break; if any of ya’ll made it this far, much appreciated to talk about my psychiatric history. I will not deny that I have been in minor psychosis several times in my life. The worst case I experienced I felt like my electronics were tapped & I was in some kind of STING operation. Now, not defending myself just adding I worked in Medical Records and am very good W/ technology so when things are not functioning as they should it is weird to me. Also, the U.P. in Michigan literally does have a SVU unit for CSC crimes that performs STING operations… 

   Anywho… that’s the first time my mom had me committed, I do NOT do well being held against my will so yes I was being a psychotic mf… Flipping chairs, screaming, ETC. Before I even knew what a benzo was I had to be put in 10 point restraints as I was fighting off the nurses as I did not want their Ativan shots. It was a traumatizing experience. They diagnosed me with an “unspecified psychotic disorder.” 

   The second trip my ex-fiance called my dad as I was having a panic attic due to a dab of weed (he was a big pot head but I have not used since.) I was literally just sitting in bed not speaking because I was panicking inside my head so my fiance at the time called my dad to see if he would come get me to take me for a car ride & to smoke a cig to calm me down… Then, my mother arrived & I instantly knew I was going to the psyche ward. I hit her with my flip flop as she dragged me outside to the ambulance. This trip I got diagnosed with “THC induced schizoaffective disorder” I am totally unsure how they diagnosed me when I never spoke to any of the psychiatrists, I would essentially just tell them to f off & they took whatever bull crap my mom said. I am 100% certain she did this just because I was going to spend Christmas downstate with my fiance’s family & probably would have moved down there.There was NO need for a psyche petition over a THC induced panic attack, I just needed some space and water.  

   The third trip yes, I was back on the STING operation and my mom sent me to the psyche AFTER I spent a month in jail for trespassing bc she kicked me out in psychosis, I ran out of gas & wondered around all night until I ended up on private property & was going to ask for help but instead got the cops called on me. To be fair, I had lost my flip flops wandering the woods all night in the dark trying to find my friend’s house but got lost. I probably looked rough as hell but I really can’t believe they called the cops… I am 4’11 & a half and was wearing a sunflower dress, I was just going to ask to use the phone. I think they diagnosed me “Bi-polar”

  Now, before we get to the final trip I find it important to note my mom since having me petitioned the first time W doctor consent just pretty much has to make a phone call to get me committed. Also, I am never a danger to others while in my mini psychosis states. I also had my Bi-polar diagnosis taken back by the psychologist who diagnosed me severely combined ADD/ADHD. Now, it sounds weird. I even have a statement from a sleep medicine Doc stating my chronic insomnia is due to my ADHD “racing thoughts.”  My psychosis was due to sleep deprivation and if I do not have a stimulant medication dose at bedtime, I will toss and turn with my thoughts & sometimes RLS allllll night for literally sometimes up to a full week of no sleep. 

   The 4th & final psyche unit trip my mom already knew what caused me to go into psychosis. I am bad at going to the Doc & got cut off my Adderall…EVEN MY COUNSELOR W/ a PSYCHE DEGREE, AGREE’S MY MOM HAD ME COMMITTED TO PROTECT MY PEDOPHILE DAD. I was going on about 5 days without sleep, I was NOT delusional. When I was 10 years old I had what I thought was a “sleep paralysis dream,” I remember it like it was just yesterday… It was thunderstorming and from my dresser mirror, I could see my bedroom door mirror as soon as I opened my eyes… Someone was peeking in on me sleeping. I was FROZEN, I could NOT move, nor speak. When I finally could I woke my mom & she even remembers me saying it looked just like my dad. He was lying with his legs resting up but denied he’d been up to the bathroom. 

  I think A LOT when I am sleep deprived and yes I am awakened by the sleep paralysis “demon.” but I came to the conclusion it was my dad peeking in on me being a creep when I was 10… So, I started a huge fight. Not to mention, I finally realized being off my Adderall was the reason I would go into sleep deprived psychosis & why I would blank out & have staring spells. My work used to think I was having stand up seizures. Earlier that night before the fight, I came out just bawling bc I finally realised. All I said was “When I was a child” & my dad started FLIPPING THE LITERAL F OUT. Like what did he think I was going to say?? My mom says he spazzes about everything, which he does not anymore. Not like that. He used to when he had to stop smoking pot for work like 10 years ago, now he is quite mellow, except for that instance. All I was saying was you missed my ADHD as a child. I got diagnosed just about a year or two ago that I am ADHD. There were MANY signs, including my pre-school teacher saying “I was too immature & she wanted to hold me back,” My mom didn’t hold me back & ignored any statements or signs. 

  Once that night’s fight between me & my dad occurred cops were called as he threatened to slit his wrists with a knife up, I was not playing that game so I called. I wanted to report what I found on the laptop, but my mom was just concerned about losing her work from home computer (I thought at the time, she is 100% in denial/complicit) Earlier that night my mom said she snapped the laptop in half for me as I was struggling with my dad’s sickness. To find out it was actually my dad, allegedly. My mom came to my door and was like “let me come in, look what I did to his laptop.” My dad tried to take the snapped laptop but I hid it in my room. He left & it was decided he was to get an apartment & he was ordered to leave while the cops were still present. 

  Nope, my mom had him back home the next day while my aunt had me at the ER to get some Adderall so I could sleep until I made my next appointment that following Monday. She allowed me to go drive to my aunt for 5 days, no rest, I couldn’t even find her house & almost caused a major accident on the way. I went with my aunt bc I knew she would not commit me to the psyche unit as all I needed was my meds. My aunt convinced me because she was scared I was going to cause vehicular homicide. Me and my mom were fighting before I left to go see my aunt (whom I am no longer speaking to as when I told her about my dad she shut me down completely…) My mom said there was NO way my sleep paralysis dream, which she remembers when I was 10 too, could have possibly been my dad… While I was at the ER with my aunt my mom did not check on me, to see if I made the drive without an accident. Instead she let my dad back home, instead of at least keeping him out of the house a few days while I get my meds and some sleep?? Like I feel a normal mother would prioritize her f’ing child over her pedophile husband she defends to no end & is obsessed with? While I was gone she also allowed him to search my room & dispose of the laptop (2nd laptop)… 

  Later that night she kicked me out to go drive around in psychosis & called the cops to have me committed, knowing I had my meds and my Doc appointment in a few days. Mind you I was very sleep deprived but coherent. My mom loves to bully me when I am in or near psychosis. She told me I could go get hypothermia & die in my house (I got with my ex fiance but am too scared to live there- A WHOLE nother story…) But I was not allowed to take my dog to my house that had no heat… I was allowed to go die there though. That concludes the psyche series. She also currently threatens to send me or asks me if I am in psychosis if we get in the slightest disagreement, even though I have been religiously taking my meds & sleeping (most nights, my current situation makes some tough)

   I’d also like to mention at the last psyche hearing she stated in front of the judge “I could no longer live with her & I’d have to go live at the homeless shelter.” I told the judge I could go live at my house, it just needed heat. Although it has been abandoned for years, many break-ins, ETC. I should have listened to the nurses whom advised me to get a restraining order against my mother as they convinced me to move back home & sell my expensive fridge and stove for dirt cheap on FB Marketplace… Just for my mom to constantly threaten to kick me out to live at a house with no fridge or stove or the homeless shelter. Just another narcissistic control tactic? I honestly try to keep the peace as much as I can, I have called her a narcissistic psycho a few times. However, typically I will respectfully & maturely bring up an issue or something that bothered me & we cannot even talk it out, she sees everything as a conflict or argument and can almost never admit any fault. 

   I believe my mom has NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) and is either a Sociopath or suffers from Anti-Social Personality Disorder (Psychopathy.) I’ve studied a lot in psychology, being misdiagnosed 100 times in the psyche unit may have sparked an interest. She initially mocked my ADHD diagnosis, claiming I just wanted the drugs, she know she’s genuinely help me. But if we get in a fight I’m just a druggie. I find it sick how she makes his meals, coffee, and still sleeps next to him every night. She is in total denial… I am NOT accusing my dad of molesting me but some things don’t add up. I have very little memory as a kid, I don’t remember birthdays, first days of school, major childhood events which can be due to trauma. My mom says this is “normal” & just yells at me if I bring anything up having to do with the sleep “paralasis” dream, ETC. Says she knows he NEVER touched me. Like how the f can you be sure? HE IS ATTRACTED TO LITTLE GIRLS, WHICH I ONCE WAS.  

   She also added as she as a narcissist always has to be the victim, “If anyone was molested in this family it was me.” Bc her creepy uncle would tickle her in his lap… Yes, disgusting. But get over yourself and maybe try to at least hear your daughter’s f’ing concerns? Am I in the wrong here bc I feel a mother should believe her daughter or try to help make sense of things instead of just saying “your father would never.” Makes me think she knew what he was before they even had me & she just looked the other way all my life. I don’t remember my dad ever doing anything except he used to “baby blanket” me a lot, even when I was way too old for it & drying my hair off after I showered when I was around maybe 8-10? Like I think I could have done that…

  My mom defends my dad to no end, still claims “he is not a pedophile” , tries to deny seeing what I showed her on the laptop or the photos I sent her, trying to convince me the porn I pulled up was my fault. Says “he promised he is done looking at that type of stuff.” Like are you dumb? HE IS SICK IN THE HEAD… & if he’s done why does his phone have a passcode now? I did call to report my dad but took my statement back as he promised to get counseling. Ik counseling will NOT fix this type of sickness & after bugging my mom weeks later after he promised to see if she got him in she flipped out, started smashing shit & just threw a whole psychotic fit. They were able to purchase concert tickets tho?? The appointment is now finally set up. I confided in my other aunt/uncle they were a little more help… In my uncle Scott’s opinion he should be in prison… 

   Besides my dad’s sickness he is an okay father… He takes my car to its maintenance appointments, I pay but it is nice of him. Although he does just allow my mom to mentally abuse me. I seriously thought I was psychotic, Bipolar, ETC. All I ever had was severe undiagnosed ADHD… It could have been taken care of when I was a child if they ever bothered to take me to a mental health doc back then… I have diagnosed PTSD I assume from the traumatic psyche ward visits against my will… She NEVER even gave me the chance to go to the hospital on my own accord. They also love to throw “all they’ve done for me” in my face. Yes, I always had nice clothes, food and a roof over my head & I am still living with them. But I clean, help out a bit around the house, take care of their dog as well as mine (They do the same when need be.) But I am their only child?? Like that is your parental job to provide food, housing & clothes. Not now that I am 26 but my dad wanted me to put the house in bankruptcy & start fresh as it needs a lot of work & is far away from my job. 

  Trust me, I am just trying to maintain the peace and save for a new house, fix my credit & hopefully find an affordable apartment soon. It has been a major blow truly realizing what my parents really are, monsters in my opinion.

   I think once I move out I will try to cut ties completely… My parents never let me do/learn much, they always did everything for me & I believe that was intentional. 

I split with my finance of 6 years a few years ago now, lost touch with a couple good friends, had a few great friends, including my best pass away. I am now grateful I did not die, I even asked my uncle if he would take me dog. But she needs me, I am her person & she is my life saviour. I don’t know what I will do when she goes, but hopefully I have many years left. My baby is 8 years old! 

**LITTLE FAMILY HISTORY**

   

   All the family I speak about is my mother’s side, she is the oldest out of her 4 siblings. 

   My grandma passed away years ago, I did not attend her funeral or shed any tears when she passed (Yes, I can be cruel too.) She babysat me often as a toddler, while my mom worked. I vaguely remember as a kid a specific time when she had me put frozen meat down my shirt & run out of the store (to make me steal.) Another instance I remember her using a butter knife to open my Japanese piggy bank, a gift from my aunt as she & my uncle were stationed in Japan to get $10, she had to destroy my piggy bank as it was unable to be opened. I think the point was to break it once it was full. My grandma would constantly sneak into my parent’s room if she was watching me at our house to steal out of my dad’s change jar. She stole my mother’s identity to take out credit cards in her name & oddly enough buy Christmas Gifts. I stopped seeing my grandma around the age 15 or 16, I used to visit her in the nursing home but she was always rude towards me. I remember the last time I saw her, I just had my hair dyed for the first time. I am naturally a dark blonde and wanted to go platinum but was left a strawberry blonde. I was already very self conscious & she just had to comment on the orange hair- “Why is your hair orange?” According to my mom, other things my grandma would do was steal from my Grandpa’s baseball funds (he was a couch.) She also let my great grandma fall & I think even seize without helping or even going into the room.

My mom claimed she had “Borderline Personality Disorder,” but then admitted she doesn’t know her actual diagnosis… Most family on her side has depression or a personality disorder, except her because she is “perfect” and has absolutely no desire to go see a mental health doctor, despite her PCP prescribing two antidepressants, which personally I don’t think a Primary Doctor should have the availability to do. Before I was properly diagnosed I was on EVERY antidepressant/antipsyce under the sun & they made me suicidal & not myself. 

  My grandpa was a saint, I miss him dearly. I wish he was here now more than ever because he would have my back & hopefully would knock some sense into my delusional mother (getting there.) 

  I don’t know any of my dad’s family… His mom and dad passed before I was born, he has a lot of siblings but I think a lot of them are addicts or they just are not close.

Anfangs war alles übersichtlich: Input, Output, Zeit, Mahlgrad, Temperatur. Dann kamen die durchgestrichenen Zahlen, Pfeile, neu geschriebene Rezepte, eingeklebte Zettel, und irgendwann wusste ich nicht mehr, welche Version eigentlich die gute war. Wenn etwas nicht schmeckte, suchte ich meinen ChatGPT-Prompt heraus, der mir Tipps geben sollte… und verlor ihn wieder in der zu langen Liste.

Irgendwann wurde mir klar: Das Problem war nicht fehlendes Wissen, sondern dass ich Versuche wiederholte, die ich schon gemacht hatte. Meine Notizen wurden unzuverlässig und mein „System“ verteilte sich auf mehrere Orte.

Aus dieser Frustration heraus habe ich etwas Strukturierteres gebaut: Coffee Rings. Es begann als digitales Notizbuch und wurde dann zu einem richtigen Workflow. Man startet mit plausiblen Basisparametern passend zu Bohne und Röstgrad, trägt den Shot ein, notiert den Geschmack und bekommt bei Bedarf gezieltes Feedback, ohne Prompts zu suchen oder alles neu aufzuschreiben.

Die App ist kostenlos, funktioniert vollständig offline mit einer integrierten Wissenslogik (und optional mit KI) und sammelt keine Daten. Für mich löst sie vor allem ein Problem: nicht erneut die gleichen Versuche zu machen und damit gute Bohnen zu verschwenden.

Ein paar Freunde und Kollegen haben getestet und viel Feedback gegeben. Dadurch ist das Ganze weit über ein „kleines Tool für mich selbst“ hinausgewachsen. Jetzt ist es im App Store und ich bin gespannt, ob andere die gleichen Probleme hatten wie ich.

Wenn du die Notizbuch-Phase kennst, kommt dir das vielleicht bekannt vor. Und falls du die App ausprobierst, freue ich mich über Rückmeldungen, besonders darüber, was gut funktioniert und auch, was eventuell stört.

When i looked up on the manual i noticed that there is missing some text on the front cover right above. When i searched in the manual i saw multiple cutting errors. Unfortunately i can not find any compared manuals with such cutting errors. The photo with the note page, the page numbers seems normal again. Is there serieus interest in such cutting error manual? Have anyone seen such error before on a manual? i can make specific pics if you want. This is a major fabric cutting error. The operator was getting some coffee i think when this one was produced.",0,1765372877.0,gamecollecting,1,0.5,False

They  poop like their lives depend on it. I made the mistake of putting it in my front yard, not realizing that the hay mixed into it was full of seeds. You can IMAGINE what my lawn looks like and I'm so overwhelmed!

I've always been intimidated by how complicated people make vermicomposting out to be, but I'm finally motivated to do it. The rabbits don't have a hutch or cage, so I can't put the bin underneath. I considered modifying the idea of a bin to create a vermicomposting-cleaned litterbox, but I don't know if they'd go for it. I looked at the first time bin post and have another question or two.

1) How many worms do I need to digest all of the rabbit droppings and the hay that gets mixed into it? If I had to GUESS, I'd say they produce 1-2 quarts of poop a day, but it could be more. 

2) What size bin would I need for all of that poop and worm volume?

3) What do I need to layer in with the poop to keep the balance healthy for the little wormles?

4) Do I need to do anything to keep flies away?

5) Is rabbit manure moist enough to not need to add water? If so, how much does it need?

6) If I'm adding that much poop to the bin, how long does it take for them to eat it all?  
  
7) Do I need to do the whole harvesting thing or can I just stir it up and take out a percent, leaving the remaining wormies to repopulate the rest of the bin?

8) If I take the castings with live worms in it and I put it out on the ground, will they be able to get into the ground to help loosen the compacted, weed infested lawn, so I can replace it with a ground cover next year? Maybe I should increase the number of wormettes so there are plenty to populate the yard?

9) I live in Upstate NY where it's cold. I assume I can't put any of the little wormy dudes outside until it's past the last frost, since the ground is probably too hard to work through to reach below the frost line. Is that correct?

10) Are red wriggers going to thrive in the outdoors in upstate NY or do I need a different species?

11) If I make a ""Dig Box"" for the rabbits to climb into and play and fill it with some soil and wormy fellers, will the rabbits injure them or will they stay out of my bunnos' way? My biggest (Gurgi) has hunted and eaten mice, so I'm not sure it's safe for them... but I'm also not sure it matters if I have that many in the bin

OK, so that's 11 questions instead of two, but I haven't had my coffee yet.

(Not literally stealing because they aren't taking the money, Tims is. It's a complacency problem I believe.)

This is a common report and now I've seen first hand it is actually true. If you go to tims and order a cold brew it's quite common that they will substitute ""regular"" coffee (And yes there's a significant difference. Cold brew can be described as smooth, coffee from tims otherwise has a burnt taste to it that has become distinct within the brand.)

Whether because of training or because a lack of their coldbrew mixture in stock, it makes no difference to me. TELL ME YOU'RE OUT. Do anything but charge me 4$ for this product then use regular coffee and lie to me about it. You can't just ""fill"" what you don't have and say it's something it isn't it tastes completely different and you charge twice as much for it.

50% mark up every time this happens is ridiculous enough that I'd say if the staff can't be consistently trained to deal with this type of product don't sell it at all. People are getting scammed and half of them probably don't even know because it's ""coffee"".

So at it's core this is a warning to customers: If you don't know what coldbrew tastes like get a cup of it unmixed (It will look very black) and compare it too their regular coffee. It is distinctly smooth and lacks that traditional cooked/burnt bean taste Tims does have in regular coffee. You're probably getting scammed on at least 50% of your orders for this if you get it regularly. (Obviously some locations will perform better than others, I'm talking averages.)

His favorite claim is that he does “most” of the laundry. We’ve lived together for two years, and during that time I have done nearly all of the cooking, cleaning, and household management. Anytime I ask him to help more, he’ll point to some random chore he did once, like leaf blowing the carport (while we have a sink full of dishes mind you) and then state that he supposedly handles “the vast majority of the laundry.”

For context: the man can go literal weeks without touching the laundry. And his version of “helping” typically means creating more of it. If I’m starting a load of work clothes, he’ll go into some random room and take the curtains down to “add them in.” Or he’ll drag the dogs’ beds into the laundry room and leave them there so I can “do them next.” Yes, he folds his own clothes and puts them away, but I’m the one who sorts, loads, transfers, dries, and deals with everything else.

Every time I call him out, he argues, and nothing changes.

Well, this weekend was it for me. I had one day off all week, and when I walked into the laundry room and saw the hamper overflowing- knowing he had been off the last two days and hadn’t touched it…. I decided I was done washing and drying his clothes.

So I dumped the hamper out, separated mine, washed and dried only my things, folded them, put them away, and left all of his exactly where they were. Didn’t mention it. Honestly forgot about it.

Fast forward to this morning. It’s raining. He needs his jacket for work. I’m getting ready when I hear the dramatic sighing, the drawers slamming, the pacing. I walk in to find him digging through the closet like a raccoon in a dumpster, furious because “somehow his jacket didn’t get washed.”

I just sipped my coffee and let him hunt.

Tonight at dinner, I cannot wait to ask this man who swears up and down that he does “all our laundry” how that hoodie ended up sitting in the hamper untouched for so long.

Abhishek Bajaj and Baseer were his main competition. But makers removed them because 80% of votes were going to Bajaj only which makers didn't expect.

KVM had iron plate on his leg, did stunts on Khatron Ke Khiladi which involved walking on electrocuted floor and won that season. Actively participated in all Bigg Boss tasks. Did head-on confrontations for the right stand. Didn't sit back and think twice like GK.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or seasoned runner, as long as you enjoy the challenge and the vibe. If you like staying active and want a partner for races, long runs, or getting lost on mountain trails, then we’re already off to a good start.

Anyways, here’s my story:

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books

Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 12/05/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time if they’re not emotionally ready.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures right away to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,1765371672.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

Special Agent Norton Stevens never slept all that soundly. Having grown up with three older brothers and far too little parental supervision, he had, in his youth, awakened many times to the smack of a sock-with-a-balled-sock-in-it, the convulsive shock of cold water, and the all-out assault to the senses that is a bared ass breaking wind. So, when the phone on his chipped nightstand started to sound, he picked it up before the third ring. The caller ID revealed the expected. 

“Yeah, what is it, partner?” he grunted. 

Small talk was alien to their relationship, so Sharpe got right to it. He’d just gotten a call; he didn’t say from whom. Trouble had been reported at the Stanton place. Apparently, the poor fella got slapped around a bit and trapped in his own jacuzzi. Sharpe was already on his way to pick Stevens up, E.T.A. in eight minutes. Their meeting had been moved up to now.

Stevens climbed out of bed, drained his bladder and sighed. After wriggling his way into a suit and holstering his weapon of choice, his Glock 17, he made his way into the kitchen. A cup of Keurig coffee, chugged down in two gulps, led to another. Then puffing away at an e-cig, relishing its mango vapor, he luxuriated in a small, quiet moment that imploded when an insistent fist met his door.

*“Stevens, you ready?”* Sharpe thundered from the hallway.

“Damn right I am, partner,” Stevens called back, slipping on a pair of black Rockports, tying their laces nice and snug. 

His apartment was sparsely furnished, undecorated, practically unlived in, he noticed for the umpteenth time as he marched to his front door. Pulling it open, he leapt back in startlement, a strangled half-cry unraveling in his mouth. 

*“Hey, sorry about this,”* said Sharpe, as he glided inside. The man was translucent and sorrow-eyed, frowning as if he’d been born that way. *“They got me while I was sleeping. Now I’m some demoness’ puppet.”*

Stepping backward, his hands in motion, spasmatic, generating ineffective wards, Stevens said, “I…I don’t understand. What the fuck’s happened to you, partner? Am I dreaming?”

*“I’ve got to tell you, buddy. I never expected to go out that way. I thought it would be a fast bullet or slow cancer that stole my body away from me. Instead, I woke up a wisp person. Never even had a chance to fight for my life.”* Slowly, he shook his head. *“Pal, it’s a cryin’ shame.”*

*Buddy? Pal?* Stevens wondered, unaccustomed to Sharpe referring to him by anything other than his last name. The coiled-spring aspect the man had worn in life had deserted him, replaced by soft resignation. His eyes had shed all intensity. Why, then, did he continue to advance?

*“So I thought, hey, I’d give you the chance they denied me. The two of us, we were doomed as soon as we began investigating Martha Drexel…the demoness’ host body. Her ghosts are here for you now. You’re awake, dressed and armed. Flee or fight, brother? What’ll it be? Don’t just stand there. Make your death interesting.”*

Through every wall they now streamed, their eyes burning avariciously, their mouths ebon whirlpools. Stevens recognized many of the specters, having studied their shed bodies in photographs and in person. 

There was the Milford Asylum crowd: staff and patients united, in death social equals. There was Elaina Stanton and, God help him, little Lemuel Forbush. One skeleton-masked fellow made Stevens think, *The Hallowfiend! But it can’t really be him! The man’s an urban legend, nothing more! Besides, if there’s even a shred of truth to his story, how could anybody ever kill him?* 

Strangers, too, crept upon him, unmissed loners and vagrants. Shadow tendrils flickered in and out of visibility around all, puppet strings linking the dead to their controller. 

*Fight or flee indeed*, Stevens thought. *But how can I possibly defeat insubstantial attackers? Are they vulnerable to scripture? Will that frighten ’em off?*

Having ceased attending church services the very instant that he moved out of his parents’ house post-high school, he wasn’t exactly overbrimming with biblical quotations. Still, Stevens managed to, with emphasis, string together a handful of “Thou shalt not”s from memory. 

The ghosts’ laughter arrived charnel. *“Looks like we’ve got ourselves a preacher,”* said the masked one. *“Goody-goodies are so fun to torture.”*

*“No torture for this guy, Oliver,”* said Sharpe. *“He’s my partner…my friend. We’ll make it quick for him.”*

*“Seriously,”* groaned a young lady with a beanie and hood overwhelming her pink and purple hair, *“some of you ghosts are straight-up sickos.”*

A naked, one-eyed gal retorted, *“Don’t be such a pussywillow, Farrah. You haven’t spilled a drop of blood yet. Neither have Mom and Dad. What, do you think that you can get into some imaginary kingdom of heaven if you’re good? This is all that we have now. Enjoy yourself.”*

Her parents drifted through the ghost throng to say, in unison, *“That’s enough, Tabitha. We didn’t raise you to act like this.”* A relatable sort of family drama, certainly, though one of little interest to Stevens at the moment. 

 Ghost fingernails slipped through his clothing to rake at his flesh. So cold were they that he hardly felt the abrasions. Blood stippled his suit. He was entirely surrounded. 

“Fuck it,” he shouted, pulling his gun from its holster. Wrenched out of his hands, tossed from specter to specter, it disappeared into the depths of his apartment, never to be seen again. 

*“No firearms,”* the skeleton-masked man bellowed. *“It’s no fun if it’s over too quickly!”*

*“What did I just tell you?”* said Sharpe. *“This man’s to be respected. I’d snap his neck myself, just to spare him slow agony, but I just can’t bring myself to harm so much as a hair on his head.”*

“Thanks a fuckin’ lot, partner,” Stevens grunted, thrashing for arm space. Achieving it, he threw jabs and uppercuts that sailed through his opponents. His kicks fared no better. The ghosts could assault but were immune to all injury. 

Death was all around him. Its sickly-sweet bouquet assaulted his nose and taste buds, leaving him gagging, swaying on his feet with his head swimming. There was nowhere to run to. No savior would arrive to drive his persecutors away. Sharpe’s *“flee or fight”* urging had been nothing more than hollow rhetoric. 

A fist connected with his forehead; a foot met his groin. Stevens doubled over and fell to the floor. 

Targeting his cheeks and neck, phantom teeth tore away flesh and spat it to the carpet. Burrowing into his abdomen, ghosts pulled forth entrails—purple-grey small intestine, brownish-red large intestine. Those digestive tubes, to Stevens’ blood-dimmed vision, hardly seemed to belong to his body. Mega worms they were, slaves to simple impulses, glutted on the minerals, nutrients, and feces that Stevens’ lifetime had provided them. Soon, they would starve to death. 

Simple desires arrived, torturous. *If only I could feel the sun on my skin again*, Stevens thought. *If I could play hoops with my nephew, or give my parents a call. If I could blow a few thou at a casino, just like in the old days. If I could eat steak and lobster. If I could get laid one more time. That would be…well, that would be something.*

For a moment, time froze. His assaulters seemed naught but frozen three-dimensional images, straw folks sculpted of lasers and holograms. Then the chill that had inundated him vanished and he felt nothing at all, save for a throb of mourning, sorrow shaped by all that he might have been. His spirit form rose; his partner embraced him.

*“Now that all the unpleasantness is over with,”* said Sharpe, *“we’d best be on our way.”*

Stevens wanted to argue. He felt the afterlife’s pull, that celestial summons, but Sharpe’s grip kept him earthbound. Unwilling to glance at his own corpse for even a quick moment, he allowed himself to be escorted from his apartment—through its walls, into the pitiless morning. The sun reserved its warmth solely for the living. 

A gray minivan awaited them, idling, an emaciated wretch of a woman at its steering wheel. She looked alive, but just barely. Behind her, a mixed-race, far more vital, grade-schooler sobbed, clad in an oversized Chargers shirt and boxers.

Attempting to console the child, a mid-forties, auburn-haired specter that Stevens recognized as Bexley Adams rested her insubstantial hand on his shoulder and murmured that everything would be alright, though the expression on her face argued otherwise. Unlike the other specters, she’d been permitted to remain in the parking lot and escape the sight of Stevens’ demise, to babysit a boy her controller held only ill intentions for. Now, that entity’s host—the unhygienic crone whose hospital gown seemed to be putrefying—rotated to face her. 

*“Back into the depths?”* Bexley muttered. 

The wizened remains of Martha Drexel nodded. 

*“Wow, that really sucks. Why don’t you let me keep this little guy company for a while longer instead?”*

Ghastly mirth flowed through cracked lips, which then widened and widened, until blood ran down Martha’s chin. 

*“Yeah, I knew you’d be a dick about it,”* said Bexley, as she began to dissolve into green mist strands. *“Couldn’t help but try, though.”*

With one spirit swallowed, Martha turned to the others. Down her howling gullet went the nurses, the psychiatrists, the orderlies, and their erstwhile patients who’d never regain sanity. Into illimitable vastness, a ponderously churning darkness, disappeared the Baxters, Wayne Jefferson, Elaina Stanton, Lemuel Forbush, and costumed, cackling Oliver Milligan. All the while, wide-eyed, young Graham Wilson made not a peep. 

*“You ready, partner?”* Special Agent Sharpe asked rhetorically.

*“Fuck you, Sharpe,”* Special Agent Stevens replied. *“Being stuck together like this, for who knows how long…I think this is my new definition of hell.”*

*“Oh, you have no idea.”*

Thinning and flowing into malleable mist, they entered the realm of the porcelain-masked entity.



 

**Chapter 15**

 

 

“Wow, that’s some kind of fucked-up story,” said Celine. To cool her feverish flesh, she thrust an arm out of the passenger side window, exactly as she’d done during childhood road trips; serpentlike, that limb rode the wind. “When this is all over, if we’re both still alive, we’re going to have ourselves a serious talk, Emmett.”

“If that’s what you wanna do,” he answered, keeping his eyes on the road, gripping the steering wheel with such force that it seemed liable to shatter. “I probably shouldn’t have kept so many secrets from you.”

“‘Probably shouldn’t have’…you sorry son of a bitch. There’s been a ghost in our house all this time and you said nothing about it.”

“Well, yeah, but it’s just Benjy, not a scary one.”

*“Oh, I can be scary,”* Benjy chirped from the speaker of Emmett’s iPhone. 

“Shut up!” both Wilsons demanded.

Yet on the offensive, Celine added, “I don’t care if he’s scary. He’s probably seen me naked a billion times by now…and even watched us screw.”

Emmett cleared his throat and said nothing. She punched him in the arm. “I knew it! I fuckin’ knew it!” Of Benjy, she asked, “Did that get you off, you little peeper? Do you like the shape of my tits?”

*“Well, now that you mention it…”*

“Ugh. I don’t…this is too hard to process. Let’s just get Graham back and we’ll sort all this out later.”

Travelling well over the speed limit, they turned onto Avenida Ondulada. Seconds later, Emmett parked. 

*“Hey, this is Carter Stanton’s place,”* Benjy noted. *“That van is two houses up. Look, you can see it over there, in the driveway.”*

Emmett scowled down at his phone. “Yeah, I know, dipshit. But we were meeting with Carter later today. We might as well see if he’ll come with us. I mean, who knows his ex-wife better than he does? If there’s any way to get through to her, to reach the real Martha and drive the entity from her body, Carter might just be the guy to do it.”

*“Good idea. In fact, I was just about to suggest it.”*

“Like hell you were.”

As a real estate investor, Carter was no stranger to the value of curb appeal. His lawn was vibrantly green and perfectly mowed. No oil stains marred his driveway; his gutters were leaf-free. Just six months prior, he’d shelled out a hefty fee to have his home power washed and painted an eye-catching color scheme: white, grey and dove blue. Warmly inviting, a solar powered lantern was mounted near the front door. In fact, the morning seemed to brighten in the property’s presence. 

“Wait here,” Emmett told Celine.

“Fuck you,” she answered, unsurprisingly. 

They exited the car, then were knocking. No one arrived to greet them. 

“Is this guy a deep sleeper or what?” asked Celine. 

“What do I look like, his biographer?” Emmett tried the knob. “Locked,” he grunted. He rang the doorbell six times, wanting to shout Carter’s name, but fearing that it might draw the porcelain-masked entity’s attention, if she wasn’t observing them already. Could he break into the house without facing arrest? Would Carter forgive him?

He had his phone in his free hand. Benjy chirped from its speaker, *“Listen, Emmett, there’s something I haven’t told you.”*

Emmett scowled at his phone. *This is all Benjy’s fault*, he thought. *If he hadn’t got me looking into Martha Drexel and that demon-bitch piloting her, Graham would be safe and I’d still be in bed. Is Celine going to leave me? Can I stand to live alone again? Fuck you, Benjy.* 

Quickly realizing that his malice was misplaced, that even if he hadn’t investigated all the spectral slaughter, Graham might still have gone missing, he allowed a bit of tension to flow out of him. “Is this really the time?” he muttered. The longer that Celine and he lurked on Carter’s doorstep, the more suspicious they’d appear. Though neighbors occupied neither sidewalks nor lawns at the moment, one might’ve been peering, clandestine, through window slats, ready to dial 911. 

*“Yes, you big doofus, this is the time. You know how the porcelain-masked entity’s ghosts can manifest in three-dimensional space?”*

“Yeah, we just saw a bunch of ’em. What’s your point?”

*“Well, haven’t you wondered why I can only manifest on screens, and why I’m only able to talk to you through speakers?”*

“It’s crossed my mind. Do you have an answer?”

*“As a matter of fact, I do…and it just so happens to be you. My dead essence is linked to your living one, man, the same way that all those ghosts you saw are linked to Martha Drexel. They can materialize because the porcelain-masked entity wants them to. Well, guess what. Subconsciously, you’ve been preventing me from doing the same thing.”*

“I have?”

*“Yes, Emmett, you have. You don’t really want me around—it’s okay, I forgive you—and because of that, I’ve been limited to floating around you invisibly all the time, never far from your side. But if you concentrate, if you really wanna see me again, standing in front of you just like I did all those years ago, I can take on a wisp form duplicating my lost body.”*

“Really? With the head bashed in and everything?”

*“Well, I’ll probably go for a pre-caved-in-skull look. I’m vain like that. So, what do you say? If you will me a little autonomy, I should be able to leave your close proximity. I can drift inside Carter’s house and wake him if he’s asleep, and you can stay here, on the doorstep, without breaking any laws.”*

“Seriously? Why didn’t you tell me this before? I could’ve skipped trespassing that night, and spared myself the sight of that Forbush kid’s corpse.”

“You found Lemuel Forbush’s corpse?” squawked Celine, every trace of her tan draining from her face. “You *broke into a house* and didn’t tell me? Oh, Emmett.”

Unsure how to respond to that, he chose to ignore her, instead asking the boy in his speakerphone, “Well?”

Benjy’s chubby, pixelated face went hangdog. *“Okay, I’ll admit it,”* he answered. *“I could have told you this before, and chose not to…but that was only because I wanted a team up. Why should I have to see a gruesome sight all by myself? Sure, I’m dead, but I still have feelings. I get scared and disgusted sometimes, and wanted my best friend by my side to share that unpleasantness.”*

“Shit, man. That’s damn uncool of you. But, hey, whatever, let’s try this your way. You say that if I want you three-dimensional, you’ll appear before us, just as simple as that?”

*“Sure thing, Emmett.”*

“Okay, well, here I go.” Attempting to concentrate, Emmett crinkled his forehead and squinted. He squeezed his hands into fists, relaxed them, and squeezed them again. “I feel like an idiot,” he muttered. “Do I look feebleminded to you, Celine?”

“You look just as handsome as ever, baby. Now shut your stupid-ass mouth and do what the ghost boy says.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Within his clouded mind, Emmett conjured the past. He regressed to his elementary school self, that scrawny, awkward bundle of energy who went ignored by the cool kids, who dreamed of becoming a celebrity of some sort and making his family proud. Through his old, immature perspective, he recalled Benjy Rothstein. 

The most indelible image he could conjure of his friend was that of the day Benjy had shown up to school with his new “tough guy” look. Having shaved away his red cowlick, and exchanged his mother-purchased duds for a skull shirt, jean shorts, a quickly-confiscated chain wallet, and Vans sneakers, he’d abandoned all but his black horn-rimmed glasses. It was the coolest he’d ever looked, and his demeanor had shifted responsively. Soon, he’d even landed himself a girlfriend. 

Emmett closed his eyes so as to see that version of his friend all the clearer, willing a specter to take shape in the real world. When he reopened them, Benjy was standing before him, exactly as envisioned, save, of course, for the fact that he was entirely translucent. 

*“See, I told you it would work,”* Benjy declared, beaming. 

“That you did, asshole. That you did.”

They stood there for a moment, in the brightening day, before Celine cleared her throat and said, “Well, get on with it, kid. Find this Carter Stanton guy and let’s get goin’.” *Graham could be suffering unimaginable tortures already*, she almost added, but couldn’t seem to wrap her mouth around the words. 

*“Righto,”* said Benjy, flowing through the door. Moments later, though it seemed to the anxious Wilsons as if hours had elapsed, he returned. *“There’s nobody but the dog inside,”* he declared. *“The backyard’s another story, though. Come on.”*

They rounded the house and opened its gate. Threading a garden of poppies and daisies, a path composed of square cement tiles and black pebbles led to Carter’s back patio. Jogging as if full bore sprinting might lead to synchronized faceplants, feeling that unseen shadows were closing in all around them, the Wilsons spared not a second to admire Carter’s expensive American Muscle Grill, and soon reached the property’s rock-rimmed pool and jacuzzi. A manmade waterfall vomited steady splashing; all else was silent. 

“What the hell?” exhaled Emmett.  

“Who piled that shit on the jacuzzi?” asked Celine. 

*“Just shut up and help me move it,”* Benjy urged. *“Carter’s trapped there…half-crazy already, I bet. I told him we’d help him, but can’t budge a bed and refrigerator all by myself. So much for ghost strength, I guess.”*

They braced themselves against the fridge. “One, two, three,” grunted Emmett. Heaving himself against the appliance in unison with his wife and dead friend, he provided the bulk of the force that rolled it off of the bed, onto the back patio. The collision hurled its doors and drawers open. Milk, juice, beer, eggs, sweet peppers, onions, chicken breasts, burger patties, and Eggo waffles came tumbling out. Ignoring them, the trio hefted Carter’s bed up and tossed it aside. 

There the man was: waterlogged, mouth agape, squinting at sudden sunlight. “Benjy,” he gasped, “I thought I’d imagined you.”

*“Nobody could imagine someone this handsome. Now climb up out of there, Mr. Stanton. Towel yourself off and put on some dry clothes.”*

\*          \*          \*

“So…your son’s over there now? At Wayne Jefferson’s place? With those ghosts and whatever the hell’s possessing Martha?” No longer drenched, nearly rational, Carter gulped a glass of tap water. Pinching his earlobe, he grimaced at ghastly mental imagery. Dreaming canine dreams, Maggie lay at his feet.

“That’s right,” said Celine, who hadn’t been properly introduced to the man and hardly cared at the moment.

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s head on over there now. If there’s even a chance he can be rescued…” He trailed off for a moment, then said, “Weapons. We’ll need weapons. Would crucifixes or Bible verses work on the entity?”

*“I doubt it,”* said Benjy. 

“Damn. Well, I was never all that religious anyway. Did you guys bring a gun, at least?”

“Never owned one,” said Emmett. 

“Well, I guess we can load up on knives and hammers here. If we can’t drive the entity out of Martha, however that might be accomplished, we’ll just have to kill the poor woman. May her spirit forgive us.”

Without warning, the lights went out.



 

**Chapter 16**

 

 

Of course, it being early in the day, interrupted electricity hardly brought darkness. Opening window blinds restored the kitchen’s bright cheeriness. “I’ll have to check the fuse box later, if we survive this,” said Carter.

Emmett glanced to his own arms, which had sprouted goosebumps. “It’s getting colder in here. Might not be a blown fuse.”

“Don’t you feel that?” Celine asked. “It’s like something’s…watching us.”

“Quick, grab some knives,” said Carter. “There’s no telling when—” A sight stole his speech: shadows pouring through the walls and occluding the windows. 

“Benjy, what should we do?” Emmett asked, panicking. The ghost boy had vanished, he realized. Glancing at his iPhone screen, he found him absent there, too. 

The tenebrosity flowed over the walls, floor, ceiling, furniture and appliances. No longer could they see one another. Emmett seized his wife’s hand, feeling entirely impotent, and blurted an “I love you” as if it were an apology. 

Sonance arrived: somebody knocking on the sliding glass door. *“Mr. Stanton, are you in there?!”* a familiar voice shouted. *“This is Special Agent Charles Sharpe! My partner’s here, too! There’s some kinda phenomenon affecting your house!”*

Now Maggie was awake, on her paws, barking as ferociously as her little lungs permitted.

“I’m here!” Carter shouted back. “I can’t see anything, but I’m here!”

*“Hold on! We’re coming in!”* 

Muscle memory carried Carter toward his sliding glass door. He needn’t have wasted the effort, for, glowing, translucent, the investigators drifted through the wall. 

*“Sorry, we’re a bit early for our meeting,”* said Stevens, dismissively flourishing his hand. 

“Yeah, about that,” said Carter. “As it turns out, now’s not a great time for me. Things came up; you know how it is. Maybe we can reschedule. How’s next month sound? I’ll order us a pizza and we’ll chug a few beers.”

*“Oh, we wouldn’t want to trouble you,”* said Sharpe. *“Food and drink lose their appeal when you’re dead. Most things do, really.”* Turning his steely gaze toward the Wilsons, he said, *“You must be the friends Carter mentioned when he called me.”*

“Uh, sure. I’m Emmett. This is my wife Celine.”

*“Oh, the Wilsons, of course. I met your son earlier. Cute kid, but a bit of a fraidy cat.”*

“Graham,” said Celine. “You didn’t…hurt him, did you? I don’t care if you are dead. I’ll find some way to make you suffer if you did.”

*“Now, now, now,*” said Stevens. *“There’s no need whatsoever to get off on the wrong foot here. We came, as promised, to discuss…what were we going to discuss again, partner?”*

*“These folks were going to attempt to convince us of the existence of ghosts. Isn’t that right, Carter?”*

“Well…”

The dead agents chuckled. *“Consider us convinced,”* said Sharpe. *“And, hey, we found your ex-wife. Her husk, anyway.”*

*“Actually, it found us,”* Stevens corrected. *“Now here we are, dead, forced into servitude.”*

“I’m…sorry?” said Carter, quite ill at ease. “Why don’t you help us defeat her possessor? You’ll earn your freedom, probably.”

*“It’s not that easy,”* said Sharpe. *“By killing and claiming us, the demoness yoked us to her will. We can’t act against her or she makes us feel agony. If we go where she wants and do what she wishes, though, she allows us to feel a sliver of the pleasure we’d felt while alive. That’s how she makes regular specters into killers.”* 

“So, you’re here to kill us?” asked Celine. “Will you shoot us with some kind of ghost guns? Is that a thing?” 

Stevens shook his head negative. *“Ma’am, there’re no such things as ghost guns. We could fire real guns if there were any around.”*

*“As for killing you,”* said Sharpe, *“our master was quite clear that nobody could harm Martha’s ex-husband until Martha’s body arrived. She must be sentimental in that regard. No, we’ve been sent here to act as heralds, a bit of theatricality to kick off the feature presentation.”*

*“So, without further ado,”* chimed in Stevens, *“let’s bring in the star of this shindig…the one, the only Martha Drexel-wearing entity.”*

Hearing the house’s front entrance fly open and rebound off the wall, they swiveled their eyes to the form aforementioned, which didn’t seem to walk, so much as slide on its tiptoes. The shadows parted around it to permit visibility. 

Clearly, Martha’s body had soiled and wet itself countless times since escaping Milford Asylum. Indeed, it was filthy, and wafted a pungency that inspired gagging. Its hospital gown seemed half-dissolved. Blood trickled from its lips, which its teeth chewed relentlessly.

“Martha,” Carter whispered, hardly believing his own eyes. He thought that seeing his wife in her asylum bed, long-unresponsive, all those times over the years had steeled him for the worst. But her body had shed even more weight, as if she’d gone weeks without nourishment. Her hair had greyed, and was now missing clumps, revealing bits of scalp that seemed to writhe with subcutaneous worms. Her eyes were crimson, as if their every blood vessel had detonated. Runnels of snot slid from her nostrils, unwiped. 

Martha’s hand gripped that of her companion, Graham Wilson. Alive and unharmed—physically anyway—his Chargers shirt hanging down to his knees, he squinted into the darkness as if seeking a savior. 

“Graham!” Celine shouted, attempting to sprint forward. An assortment of phantoms—eight erstwhile mental patients, gibbering—materialized from the darkness to restrain Emmett and her.

“Mom, is that you? Is Dad here?”

“I’m here, Son! Don’t be scared! I won’t let anyone hurt you!” Emmett hollered, while struggling with specters whose unyielding grips birthed fresh bruises.

“Let the boy go, Marth…whoever you are,” said Carter. “Let the Wilsons leave with their son and you can do whatever you like to me.”

Though Martha’s gnawed lips remained motionless, speech oozed forth from between ’em: *“You voice your demands as if you possess leverage*. *Such a pitiable, foolish man you are, Carter. Your flesh and organs will succumb to my whims regardless, as will your souls. Not one of you will leave this house alive.”* To illustrate her point, she gestured toward Maggie. Hands manifested from the shadows to seize the corgi by the skull. A quick twist silenced her barking forevermore. Carter was too stunned to react.

“Let Graham go, you bitch!” Celine shrieked, knowing that it was futile. No pity would be found in Martha’s slack, emotionless face, nor in the terrible, ancient presence that dwelt beyond it. Emmett echoed those words, matching every syllable so vehemently that his vocal cords became inflamed. 

*“Spatial dimensions are mine to manipulate,”* said the entity. *“I have opened spaces between spaces, and wider spaces between those. Martha’s form will accommodate your specters quite easily. See the rest of my collection: your soon-to-be fellow captives.”*

With a snap of the fingers that shattered a few of Martha’s phalanges, the entity populated the residence with the glowing dead. Men, women and children, sane and deranged, stood united, their forms traced over a darkness they might never escape. 

They surrounded the kitchen island, and even perched upon it. Shoulder to shoulder, their expressions weighted with equal parts awe and loathing, all eyed Martha Drexel. 

Wedged against the refrigerator were the Baxters: Ren embracing Farrah and Olivia, and nude Tabitha aside them, fingering her own eye socket. At the edge of the living room, skeleton-masked Oliver Milligan stood with Wayne Jefferson, who, to distract himself from the horrors soon to transpire, was attempting to recall whether or not he’d ever been inside his neighbor’s home before. 

In the doorway that led from the kitchen to the dining room, Bexley Adams stood with her palms resting upon the shoulders of young Lemuel Forbush, as if she might provide some measure of comfort to one who’d suffered so terribly. So too did Elaina Stanton claim a position beside her husband, to help ease his transition from life to death. 

There were unmourned homeless present, along with all of Milford Asylum’s patients and staff. There were figures sculpted of shadows who seemed to possess intelligences of their own. There were gigglers and weepers, shriekers and gibberers, hissers and murmurers. Each and every one of them fell silent when again the entity’s voice sounded. 

*“Now that everyone is assembled, I shall reveal myself,”* she said. 

Like a marionette with severed strings, Martha’s body collapsed, ungainly. It seemed entirely lifeless, save for its mouth, which gruesomely stretched to permit an emergence. 

Young Graham, his hand no longer clutched by the possessed woman, might’ve dashed, weeping, into his mother’s embrace, if not for the spectral crowd between them. Instead, he made like everyone else present, and lowered his eyes toward that which thrust itself out from between ruined lips: that nightmarish, feminine figure. 

First came her welt-ridden, bruised hands, one being absent two fingers, followed by the arms they were attached to, both equally mistreated. Then came the entity’s porcelain mask, featureless save for a pair of eye level indentations, around which a head like a clump of minced beef could be sighted. 

As she pushed herself free from sprawled Martha, the entity revealed her vivisected torso, from which bits of small intestine undulated. She might’ve been nude. The way that she draped herself in shadows, it was difficult to be certain. 

To avoid being hemmed in by the spectral rabble, the entity levitated to the ceiling, trailed by the eyes of the living and the dead. Reclining in defiance of gravity, she stared down at her subjects. *“So much better,”* she rasped. *“The constraints of the flesh do grow annoying. If only I could escape them for good and operate on Earth independently, as I once did. Your son thwarted me, Carter, his last living act, leaving me but one link to this sphere: his mother, mad Martha, weak in form and spirit. So little strength she possesses. I cannot leave her body for too long or she’ll perish.”* 

After pausing for dramatic effect, she added what seemed a coda: *“Surely, we must make the most of our time together.”* ",1,1765371587.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

Special Agent Norton Stevens never slept all that soundly. Having grown up with three older brothers and far too little parental supervision, he had, in his youth, awakened many times to the smack of a sock-with-a-balled-sock-in-it, the convulsive shock of cold water, and the all-out assault to the senses that is a bared ass breaking wind. So, when the phone on his chipped nightstand started to sound, he picked it up before the third ring. The caller ID revealed the expected. 

“Yeah, what is it, partner?” he grunted. 

Small talk was alien to their relationship, so Sharpe got right to it. He’d just gotten a call; he didn’t say from whom. Trouble had been reported at the Stanton place. Apparently, the poor fella got slapped around a bit and trapped in his own jacuzzi. Sharpe was already on his way to pick Stevens up, E.T.A. in eight minutes. Their meeting had been moved up to now.

Stevens climbed out of bed, drained his bladder and sighed. After wriggling his way into a suit and holstering his weapon of choice, his Glock 17, he made his way into the kitchen. A cup of Keurig coffee, chugged down in two gulps, led to another. Then puffing away at an e-cig, relishing its mango vapor, he luxuriated in a small, quiet moment that imploded when an insistent fist met his door.

*“Stevens, you ready?”* Sharpe thundered from the hallway.

“Damn right I am, partner,” Stevens called back, slipping on a pair of black Rockports, tying their laces nice and snug. 

His apartment was sparsely furnished, undecorated, practically unlived in, he noticed for the umpteenth time as he marched to his front door. Pulling it open, he leapt back in startlement, a strangled half-cry unraveling in his mouth. 

*“Hey, sorry about this,”* said Sharpe, as he glided inside. The man was translucent and sorrow-eyed, frowning as if he’d been born that way. *“They got me while I was sleeping. Now I’m some demoness’ puppet.”*

Stepping backward, his hands in motion, spasmatic, generating ineffective wards, Stevens said, “I…I don’t understand. What the fuck’s happened to you, partner? Am I dreaming?”

*“I’ve got to tell you, buddy. I never expected to go out that way. I thought it would be a fast bullet or slow cancer that stole my body away from me. Instead, I woke up a wisp person. Never even had a chance to fight for my life.”* Slowly, he shook his head. *“Pal, it’s a cryin’ shame.”*

*Buddy? Pal?* Stevens wondered, unaccustomed to Sharpe referring to him by anything other than his last name. The coiled-spring aspect the man had worn in life had deserted him, replaced by soft resignation. His eyes had shed all intensity. Why, then, did he continue to advance?

*“So I thought, hey, I’d give you the chance they denied me. The two of us, we were doomed as soon as we began investigating Martha Drexel…the demoness’ host body. Her ghosts are here for you now. You’re awake, dressed and armed. Flee or fight, brother? What’ll it be? Don’t just stand there. Make your death interesting.”*

Through every wall they now streamed, their eyes burning avariciously, their mouths ebon whirlpools. Stevens recognized many of the specters, having studied their shed bodies in photographs and in person. 

There was the Milford Asylum crowd: staff and patients united, in death social equals. There was Elaina Stanton and, God help him, little Lemuel Forbush. One skeleton-masked fellow made Stevens think, *The Hallowfiend! But it can’t really be him! The man’s an urban legend, nothing more! Besides, if there’s even a shred of truth to his story, how could anybody ever kill him?* 

Strangers, too, crept upon him, unmissed loners and vagrants. Shadow tendrils flickered in and out of visibility around all, puppet strings linking the dead to their controller. 

*Fight or flee indeed*, Stevens thought. *But how can I possibly defeat insubstantial attackers? Are they vulnerable to scripture? Will that frighten ’em off?*

Having ceased attending church services the very instant that he moved out of his parents’ house post-high school, he wasn’t exactly overbrimming with biblical quotations. Still, Stevens managed to, with emphasis, string together a handful of “Thou shalt not”s from memory. 

The ghosts’ laughter arrived charnel. *“Looks like we’ve got ourselves a preacher,”* said the masked one. *“Goody-goodies are so fun to torture.”*

*“No torture for this guy, Oliver,”* said Sharpe. *“He’s my partner…my friend. We’ll make it quick for him.”*

*“Seriously,”* groaned a young lady with a beanie and hood overwhelming her pink and purple hair, *“some of you ghosts are straight-up sickos.”*

A naked, one-eyed gal retorted, *“Don’t be such a pussywillow, Farrah. You haven’t spilled a drop of blood yet. Neither have Mom and Dad. What, do you think that you can get into some imaginary kingdom of heaven if you’re good? This is all that we have now. Enjoy yourself.”*

Her parents drifted through the ghost throng to say, in unison, *“That’s enough, Tabitha. We didn’t raise you to act like this.”* A relatable sort of family drama, certainly, though one of little interest to Stevens at the moment. 

 Ghost fingernails slipped through his clothing to rake at his flesh. So cold were they that he hardly felt the abrasions. Blood stippled his suit. He was entirely surrounded. 

“Fuck it,” he shouted, pulling his gun from its holster. Wrenched out of his hands, tossed from specter to specter, it disappeared into the depths of his apartment, never to be seen again. 

*“No firearms,”* the skeleton-masked man bellowed. *“It’s no fun if it’s over too quickly!”*

*“What did I just tell you?”* said Sharpe. *“This man’s to be respected. I’d snap his neck myself, just to spare him slow agony, but I just can’t bring myself to harm so much as a hair on his head.”*

“Thanks a fuckin’ lot, partner,” Stevens grunted, thrashing for arm space. Achieving it, he threw jabs and uppercuts that sailed through his opponents. His kicks fared no better. The ghosts could assault but were immune to all injury. 

Death was all around him. Its sickly-sweet bouquet assaulted his nose and taste buds, leaving him gagging, swaying on his feet with his head swimming. There was nowhere to run to. No savior would arrive to drive his persecutors away. Sharpe’s *“flee or fight”* urging had been nothing more than hollow rhetoric. 

A fist connected with his forehead; a foot met his groin. Stevens doubled over and fell to the floor. 

Targeting his cheeks and neck, phantom teeth tore away flesh and spat it to the carpet. Burrowing into his abdomen, ghosts pulled forth entrails—purple-grey small intestine, brownish-red large intestine. Those digestive tubes, to Stevens’ blood-dimmed vision, hardly seemed to belong to his body. Mega worms they were, slaves to simple impulses, glutted on the minerals, nutrients, and feces that Stevens’ lifetime had provided them. Soon, they would starve to death. 

Simple desires arrived, torturous. *If only I could feel the sun on my skin again*, Stevens thought. *If I could play hoops with my nephew, or give my parents a call. If I could blow a few thou at a casino, just like in the old days. If I could eat steak and lobster. If I could get laid one more time. That would be…well, that would be something.*

For a moment, time froze. His assaulters seemed naught but frozen three-dimensional images, straw folks sculpted of lasers and holograms. Then the chill that had inundated him vanished and he felt nothing at all, save for a throb of mourning, sorrow shaped by all that he might have been. His spirit form rose; his partner embraced him.

*“Now that all the unpleasantness is over with,”* said Sharpe, *“we’d best be on our way.”*

Stevens wanted to argue. He felt the afterlife’s pull, that celestial summons, but Sharpe’s grip kept him earthbound. Unwilling to glance at his own corpse for even a quick moment, he allowed himself to be escorted from his apartment—through its walls, into the pitiless morning. The sun reserved its warmth solely for the living. 

A gray minivan awaited them, idling, an emaciated wretch of a woman at its steering wheel. She looked alive, but just barely. Behind her, a mixed-race, far more vital, grade-schooler sobbed, clad in an oversized Chargers shirt and boxers.

Attempting to console the child, a mid-forties, auburn-haired specter that Stevens recognized as Bexley Adams rested her insubstantial hand on his shoulder and murmured that everything would be alright, though the expression on her face argued otherwise. Unlike the other specters, she’d been permitted to remain in the parking lot and escape the sight of Stevens’ demise, to babysit a boy her controller held only ill intentions for. Now, that entity’s host—the unhygienic crone whose hospital gown seemed to be putrefying—rotated to face her. 

*“Back into the depths?”* Bexley muttered. 

The wizened remains of Martha Drexel nodded. 

*“Wow, that really sucks. Why don’t you let me keep this little guy company for a while longer instead?”*

Ghastly mirth flowed through cracked lips, which then widened and widened, until blood ran down Martha’s chin. 

*“Yeah, I knew you’d be a dick about it,”* said Bexley, as she began to dissolve into green mist strands. *“Couldn’t help but try, though.”*

With one spirit swallowed, Martha turned to the others. Down her howling gullet went the nurses, the psychiatrists, the orderlies, and their erstwhile patients who’d never regain sanity. Into illimitable vastness, a ponderously churning darkness, disappeared the Baxters, Wayne Jefferson, Elaina Stanton, Lemuel Forbush, and costumed, cackling Oliver Milligan. All the while, wide-eyed, young Graham Wilson made not a peep. 

*“You ready, partner?”* Special Agent Sharpe asked rhetorically.

*“Fuck you, Sharpe,”* Special Agent Stevens replied. *“Being stuck together like this, for who knows how long…I think this is my new definition of hell.”*

*“Oh, you have no idea.”*

Thinning and flowing into malleable mist, they entered the realm of the porcelain-masked entity.



 

**Chapter 15**

 

 

“Wow, that’s some kind of fucked-up story,” said Celine. To cool her feverish flesh, she thrust an arm out of the passenger side window, exactly as she’d done during childhood road trips; serpentlike, that limb rode the wind. “When this is all over, if we’re both still alive, we’re going to have ourselves a serious talk, Emmett.”

“If that’s what you wanna do,” he answered, keeping his eyes on the road, gripping the steering wheel with such force that it seemed liable to shatter. “I probably shouldn’t have kept so many secrets from you.”

“‘Probably shouldn’t have’…you sorry son of a bitch. There’s been a ghost in our house all this time and you said nothing about it.”

“Well, yeah, but it’s just Benjy, not a scary one.”

*“Oh, I can be scary,”* Benjy chirped from the speaker of Emmett’s iPhone. 

“Shut up!” both Wilsons demanded.

Yet on the offensive, Celine added, “I don’t care if he’s scary. He’s probably seen me naked a billion times by now…and even watched us screw.”

Emmett cleared his throat and said nothing. She punched him in the arm. “I knew it! I fuckin’ knew it!” Of Benjy, she asked, “Did that get you off, you little peeper? Do you like the shape of my tits?”

*“Well, now that you mention it…”*

“Ugh. I don’t…this is too hard to process. Let’s just get Graham back and we’ll sort all this out later.”

Travelling well over the speed limit, they turned onto Avenida Ondulada. Seconds later, Emmett parked. 

*“Hey, this is Carter Stanton’s place,”* Benjy noted. *“That van is two houses up. Look, you can see it over there, in the driveway.”*

Emmett scowled down at his phone. “Yeah, I know, dipshit. But we were meeting with Carter later today. We might as well see if he’ll come with us. I mean, who knows his ex-wife better than he does? If there’s any way to get through to her, to reach the real Martha and drive the entity from her body, Carter might just be the guy to do it.”

*“Good idea. In fact, I was just about to suggest it.”*

“Like hell you were.”

As a real estate investor, Carter was no stranger to the value of curb appeal. His lawn was vibrantly green and perfectly mowed. No oil stains marred his driveway; his gutters were leaf-free. Just six months prior, he’d shelled out a hefty fee to have his home power washed and painted an eye-catching color scheme: white, grey and dove blue. Warmly inviting, a solar powered lantern was mounted near the front door. In fact, the morning seemed to brighten in the property’s presence. 

“Wait here,” Emmett told Celine.

“Fuck you,” she answered, unsurprisingly. 

They exited the car, then were knocking. No one arrived to greet them. 

“Is this guy a deep sleeper or what?” asked Celine. 

“What do I look like, his biographer?” Emmett tried the knob. “Locked,” he grunted. He rang the doorbell six times, wanting to shout Carter’s name, but fearing that it might draw the porcelain-masked entity’s attention, if she wasn’t observing them already. Could he break into the house without facing arrest? Would Carter forgive him?

He had his phone in his free hand. Benjy chirped from its speaker, *“Listen, Emmett, there’s something I haven’t told you.”*

Emmett scowled at his phone. *This is all Benjy’s fault*, he thought. *If he hadn’t got me looking into Martha Drexel and that demon-bitch piloting her, Graham would be safe and I’d still be in bed. Is Celine going to leave me? Can I stand to live alone again? Fuck you, Benjy.* 

Quickly realizing that his malice was misplaced, that even if he hadn’t investigated all the spectral slaughter, Graham might still have gone missing, he allowed a bit of tension to flow out of him. “Is this really the time?” he muttered. The longer that Celine and he lurked on Carter’s doorstep, the more suspicious they’d appear. Though neighbors occupied neither sidewalks nor lawns at the moment, one might’ve been peering, clandestine, through window slats, ready to dial 911. 

*“Yes, you big doofus, this is the time. You know how the porcelain-masked entity’s ghosts can manifest in three-dimensional space?”*

“Yeah, we just saw a bunch of ’em. What’s your point?”

*“Well, haven’t you wondered why I can only manifest on screens, and why I’m only able to talk to you through speakers?”*

“It’s crossed my mind. Do you have an answer?”

*“As a matter of fact, I do…and it just so happens to be you. My dead essence is linked to your living one, man, the same way that all those ghosts you saw are linked to Martha Drexel. They can materialize because the porcelain-masked entity wants them to. Well, guess what. Subconsciously, you’ve been preventing me from doing the same thing.”*

“I have?”

*“Yes, Emmett, you have. You don’t really want me around—it’s okay, I forgive you—and because of that, I’ve been limited to floating around you invisibly all the time, never far from your side. But if you concentrate, if you really wanna see me again, standing in front of you just like I did all those years ago, I can take on a wisp form duplicating my lost body.”*

“Really? With the head bashed in and everything?”

*“Well, I’ll probably go for a pre-caved-in-skull look. I’m vain like that. So, what do you say? If you will me a little autonomy, I should be able to leave your close proximity. I can drift inside Carter’s house and wake him if he’s asleep, and you can stay here, on the doorstep, without breaking any laws.”*

“Seriously? Why didn’t you tell me this before? I could’ve skipped trespassing that night, and spared myself the sight of that Forbush kid’s corpse.”

“You found Lemuel Forbush’s corpse?” squawked Celine, every trace of her tan draining from her face. “You *broke into a house* and didn’t tell me? Oh, Emmett.”

Unsure how to respond to that, he chose to ignore her, instead asking the boy in his speakerphone, “Well?”

Benjy’s chubby, pixelated face went hangdog. *“Okay, I’ll admit it,”* he answered. *“I could have told you this before, and chose not to…but that was only because I wanted a team up. Why should I have to see a gruesome sight all by myself? Sure, I’m dead, but I still have feelings. I get scared and disgusted sometimes, and wanted my best friend by my side to share that unpleasantness.”*

“Shit, man. That’s damn uncool of you. But, hey, whatever, let’s try this your way. You say that if I want you three-dimensional, you’ll appear before us, just as simple as that?”

*“Sure thing, Emmett.”*

“Okay, well, here I go.” Attempting to concentrate, Emmett crinkled his forehead and squinted. He squeezed his hands into fists, relaxed them, and squeezed them again. “I feel like an idiot,” he muttered. “Do I look feebleminded to you, Celine?”

“You look just as handsome as ever, baby. Now shut your stupid-ass mouth and do what the ghost boy says.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Within his clouded mind, Emmett conjured the past. He regressed to his elementary school self, that scrawny, awkward bundle of energy who went ignored by the cool kids, who dreamed of becoming a celebrity of some sort and making his family proud. Through his old, immature perspective, he recalled Benjy Rothstein. 

The most indelible image he could conjure of his friend was that of the day Benjy had shown up to school with his new “tough guy” look. Having shaved away his red cowlick, and exchanged his mother-purchased duds for a skull shirt, jean shorts, a quickly-confiscated chain wallet, and Vans sneakers, he’d abandoned all but his black horn-rimmed glasses. It was the coolest he’d ever looked, and his demeanor had shifted responsively. Soon, he’d even landed himself a girlfriend. 

Emmett closed his eyes so as to see that version of his friend all the clearer, willing a specter to take shape in the real world. When he reopened them, Benjy was standing before him, exactly as envisioned, save, of course, for the fact that he was entirely translucent. 

*“See, I told you it would work,”* Benjy declared, beaming. 

“That you did, asshole. That you did.”

They stood there for a moment, in the brightening day, before Celine cleared her throat and said, “Well, get on with it, kid. Find this Carter Stanton guy and let’s get goin’.” *Graham could be suffering unimaginable tortures already*, she almost added, but couldn’t seem to wrap her mouth around the words. 

*“Righto,”* said Benjy, flowing through the door. Moments later, though it seemed to the anxious Wilsons as if hours had elapsed, he returned. *“There’s nobody but the dog inside,”* he declared. *“The backyard’s another story, though. Come on.”*

They rounded the house and opened its gate. Threading a garden of poppies and daisies, a path composed of square cement tiles and black pebbles led to Carter’s back patio. Jogging as if full bore sprinting might lead to synchronized faceplants, feeling that unseen shadows were closing in all around them, the Wilsons spared not a second to admire Carter’s expensive American Muscle Grill, and soon reached the property’s rock-rimmed pool and jacuzzi. A manmade waterfall vomited steady splashing; all else was silent. 

“What the hell?” exhaled Emmett.  

“Who piled that shit on the jacuzzi?” asked Celine. 

*“Just shut up and help me move it,”* Benjy urged. *“Carter’s trapped there…half-crazy already, I bet. I told him we’d help him, but can’t budge a bed and refrigerator all by myself. So much for ghost strength, I guess.”*

They braced themselves against the fridge. “One, two, three,” grunted Emmett. Heaving himself against the appliance in unison with his wife and dead friend, he provided the bulk of the force that rolled it off of the bed, onto the back patio. The collision hurled its doors and drawers open. Milk, juice, beer, eggs, sweet peppers, onions, chicken breasts, burger patties, and Eggo waffles came tumbling out. Ignoring them, the trio hefted Carter’s bed up and tossed it aside. 

There the man was: waterlogged, mouth agape, squinting at sudden sunlight. “Benjy,” he gasped, “I thought I’d imagined you.”

*“Nobody could imagine someone this handsome. Now climb up out of there, Mr. Stanton. Towel yourself off and put on some dry clothes.”*

\*          \*          \*

“So…your son’s over there now? At Wayne Jefferson’s place? With those ghosts and whatever the hell’s possessing Martha?” No longer drenched, nearly rational, Carter gulped a glass of tap water. Pinching his earlobe, he grimaced at ghastly mental imagery. Dreaming canine dreams, Maggie lay at his feet.

“That’s right,” said Celine, who hadn’t been properly introduced to the man and hardly cared at the moment.

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s head on over there now. If there’s even a chance he can be rescued…” He trailed off for a moment, then said, “Weapons. We’ll need weapons. Would crucifixes or Bible verses work on the entity?”

*“I doubt it,”* said Benjy. 

“Damn. Well, I was never all that religious anyway. Did you guys bring a gun, at least?”

“Never owned one,” said Emmett. 

“Well, I guess we can load up on knives and hammers here. If we can’t drive the entity out of Martha, however that might be accomplished, we’ll just have to kill the poor woman. May her spirit forgive us.”

Without warning, the lights went out.



 

**Chapter 16**

 

 

Of course, it being early in the day, interrupted electricity hardly brought darkness. Opening window blinds restored the kitchen’s bright cheeriness. “I’ll have to check the fuse box later, if we survive this,” said Carter.

Emmett glanced to his own arms, which had sprouted goosebumps. “It’s getting colder in here. Might not be a blown fuse.”

“Don’t you feel that?” Celine asked. “It’s like something’s…watching us.”

“Quick, grab some knives,” said Carter. “There’s no telling when—” A sight stole his speech: shadows pouring through the walls and occluding the windows. 

“Benjy, what should we do?” Emmett asked, panicking. The ghost boy had vanished, he realized. Glancing at his iPhone screen, he found him absent there, too. 

The tenebrosity flowed over the walls, floor, ceiling, furniture and appliances. No longer could they see one another. Emmett seized his wife’s hand, feeling entirely impotent, and blurted an “I love you” as if it were an apology. 

Sonance arrived: somebody knocking on the sliding glass door. *“Mr. Stanton, are you in there?!”* a familiar voice shouted. *“This is Special Agent Charles Sharpe! My partner’s here, too! There’s some kinda phenomenon affecting your house!”*

Now Maggie was awake, on her paws, barking as ferociously as her little lungs permitted.

“I’m here!” Carter shouted back. “I can’t see anything, but I’m here!”

*“Hold on! We’re coming in!”* 

Muscle memory carried Carter toward his sliding glass door. He needn’t have wasted the effort, for, glowing, translucent, the investigators drifted through the wall. 

*“Sorry, we’re a bit early for our meeting,”* said Stevens, dismissively flourishing his hand. 

“Yeah, about that,” said Carter. “As it turns out, now’s not a great time for me. Things came up; you know how it is. Maybe we can reschedule. How’s next month sound? I’ll order us a pizza and we’ll chug a few beers.”

*“Oh, we wouldn’t want to trouble you,”* said Sharpe. *“Food and drink lose their appeal when you’re dead. Most things do, really.”* Turning his steely gaze toward the Wilsons, he said, *“You must be the friends Carter mentioned when he called me.”*

“Uh, sure. I’m Emmett. This is my wife Celine.”

*“Oh, the Wilsons, of course. I met your son earlier. Cute kid, but a bit of a fraidy cat.”*

“Graham,” said Celine. “You didn’t…hurt him, did you? I don’t care if you are dead. I’ll find some way to make you suffer if you did.”

*“Now, now, now,*” said Stevens. *“There’s no need whatsoever to get off on the wrong foot here. We came, as promised, to discuss…what were we going to discuss again, partner?”*

*“These folks were going to attempt to convince us of the existence of ghosts. Isn’t that right, Carter?”*

“Well…”

The dead agents chuckled. *“Consider us convinced,”* said Sharpe. *“And, hey, we found your ex-wife. Her husk, anyway.”*

*“Actually, it found us,”* Stevens corrected. *“Now here we are, dead, forced into servitude.”*

“I’m…sorry?” said Carter, quite ill at ease. “Why don’t you help us defeat her possessor? You’ll earn your freedom, probably.”

*“It’s not that easy,”* said Sharpe. *“By killing and claiming us, the demoness yoked us to her will. We can’t act against her or she makes us feel agony. If we go where she wants and do what she wishes, though, she allows us to feel a sliver of the pleasure we’d felt while alive. That’s how she makes regular specters into killers.”* 

“So, you’re here to kill us?” asked Celine. “Will you shoot us with some kind of ghost guns? Is that a thing?” 

Stevens shook his head negative. *“Ma’am, there’re no such things as ghost guns. We could fire real guns if there were any around.”*

*“As for killing you,”* said Sharpe, *“our master was quite clear that nobody could harm Martha’s ex-husband until Martha’s body arrived. She must be sentimental in that regard. No, we’ve been sent here to act as heralds, a bit of theatricality to kick off the feature presentation.”*

*“So, without further ado,”* chimed in Stevens, *“let’s bring in the star of this shindig…the one, the only Martha Drexel-wearing entity.”*

Hearing the house’s front entrance fly open and rebound off the wall, they swiveled their eyes to the form aforementioned, which didn’t seem to walk, so much as slide on its tiptoes. The shadows parted around it to permit visibility. 

Clearly, Martha’s body had soiled and wet itself countless times since escaping Milford Asylum. Indeed, it was filthy, and wafted a pungency that inspired gagging. Its hospital gown seemed half-dissolved. Blood trickled from its lips, which its teeth chewed relentlessly.

“Martha,” Carter whispered, hardly believing his own eyes. He thought that seeing his wife in her asylum bed, long-unresponsive, all those times over the years had steeled him for the worst. But her body had shed even more weight, as if she’d gone weeks without nourishment. Her hair had greyed, and was now missing clumps, revealing bits of scalp that seemed to writhe with subcutaneous worms. Her eyes were crimson, as if their every blood vessel had detonated. Runnels of snot slid from her nostrils, unwiped. 

Martha’s hand gripped that of her companion, Graham Wilson. Alive and unharmed—physically anyway—his Chargers shirt hanging down to his knees, he squinted into the darkness as if seeking a savior. 

“Graham!” Celine shouted, attempting to sprint forward. An assortment of phantoms—eight erstwhile mental patients, gibbering—materialized from the darkness to restrain Emmett and her.

“Mom, is that you? Is Dad here?”

“I’m here, Son! Don’t be scared! I won’t let anyone hurt you!” Emmett hollered, while struggling with specters whose unyielding grips birthed fresh bruises.

“Let the boy go, Marth…whoever you are,” said Carter. “Let the Wilsons leave with their son and you can do whatever you like to me.”

Though Martha’s gnawed lips remained motionless, speech oozed forth from between ’em: *“You voice your demands as if you possess leverage*. *Such a pitiable, foolish man you are, Carter. Your flesh and organs will succumb to my whims regardless, as will your souls. Not one of you will leave this house alive.”* To illustrate her point, she gestured toward Maggie. Hands manifested from the shadows to seize the corgi by the skull. A quick twist silenced her barking forevermore. Carter was too stunned to react.

“Let Graham go, you bitch!” Celine shrieked, knowing that it was futile. No pity would be found in Martha’s slack, emotionless face, nor in the terrible, ancient presence that dwelt beyond it. Emmett echoed those words, matching every syllable so vehemently that his vocal cords became inflamed. 

*“Spatial dimensions are mine to manipulate,”* said the entity. *“I have opened spaces between spaces, and wider spaces between those. Martha’s form will accommodate your specters quite easily. See the rest of my collection: your soon-to-be fellow captives.”*

With a snap of the fingers that shattered a few of Martha’s phalanges, the entity populated the residence with the glowing dead. Men, women and children, sane and deranged, stood united, their forms traced over a darkness they might never escape. 

They surrounded the kitchen island, and even perched upon it. Shoulder to shoulder, their expressions weighted with equal parts awe and loathing, all eyed Martha Drexel. 

Wedged against the refrigerator were the Baxters: Ren embracing Farrah and Olivia, and nude Tabitha aside them, fingering her own eye socket. At the edge of the living room, skeleton-masked Oliver Milligan stood with Wayne Jefferson, who, to distract himself from the horrors soon to transpire, was attempting to recall whether or not he’d ever been inside his neighbor’s home before. 

In the doorway that led from the kitchen to the dining room, Bexley Adams stood with her palms resting upon the shoulders of young Lemuel Forbush, as if she might provide some measure of comfort to one who’d suffered so terribly. So too did Elaina Stanton claim a position beside her husband, to help ease his transition from life to death. 

There were unmourned homeless present, along with all of Milford Asylum’s patients and staff. There were figures sculpted of shadows who seemed to possess intelligences of their own. There were gigglers and weepers, shriekers and gibberers, hissers and murmurers. Each and every one of them fell silent when again the entity’s voice sounded. 

*“Now that everyone is assembled, I shall reveal myself,”* she said. 

Like a marionette with severed strings, Martha’s body collapsed, ungainly. It seemed entirely lifeless, save for its mouth, which gruesomely stretched to permit an emergence. 

Young Graham, his hand no longer clutched by the possessed woman, might’ve dashed, weeping, into his mother’s embrace, if not for the spectral crowd between them. Instead, he made like everyone else present, and lowered his eyes toward that which thrust itself out from between ruined lips: that nightmarish, feminine figure. 

First came her welt-ridden, bruised hands, one being absent two fingers, followed by the arms they were attached to, both equally mistreated. Then came the entity’s porcelain mask, featureless save for a pair of eye level indentations, around which a head like a clump of minced beef could be sighted. 

As she pushed herself free from sprawled Martha, the entity revealed her vivisected torso, from which bits of small intestine undulated. She might’ve been nude. The way that she draped herself in shadows, it was difficult to be certain. 

To avoid being hemmed in by the spectral rabble, the entity levitated to the ceiling, trailed by the eyes of the living and the dead.

The idea that in cave man times our brains were super aware to any animal threats we had to fight or run away from.

The same thought applies today. If anyone is triggering or continually triggering you survival brain your mind and body is tell you either you need to leave this person or this person needs to leave you. No matter who they are friend, family, lover etc. otherwise you will not be able to function normally with yourself or with others (active survival brain)

The brain also had a cool down and regulation phase after situations. (So the stressfully thoughts and feelings can leave you) With people that don't have cptsd this happens regularly. But if your continually in or around situations the brain never gets the chance to cool down and regulate. In turn it may need longer to regulate.

Once you left the situation or given yourself space away from it you need to give your mind time and space to work normally again. And time and space for your body to work normally again as well.

For your mind (when your in a safe place) just breathe and let yourself unwind, do nothing. Then say in an hour or so let your mind think about things. You can process your situation and aim to make sense of it, without someone else trying to tell you what to think (normal brain problem solution process for those stuck in problem mode) or just think about getting a nice coffee for yourself. The goal is to let your thoughts flow normally, logically, and back on track with out the worry of handling a situation.

For your body also do nothing for an hour or so. But try to sit or lay in a relaxed position. Then when you feel like it do a light physical activity but do it mindful with intent. For example think about doing 5-10 controlled  pushups. Or go for a walk with a goal in mind to walk for 5-10mins. The goal is to let your body act normally and while your in control.

These are thoughts and solutions I thought of this week and I feel like I'm making great progress with them. My goal is to take regular time away from my situation or to step away as soon as my survival brain or ""alarm"" starts to kick in. Then to practice both these mind and body exercise till I get strong enough to my regular state. Or untill I fully leave my situation and can fully focus on healing.",2,1765371094.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False
1pj1s4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pj1s4t/if_you_ever_see_a_gas_station_that_says_last_stop/,"If you ever see a gas station that says ""Last Stop For 70 Miles,"" keep driving.","I was about four hours into a six hour drive when I realized I needed to stop. Not just for gas, but because I was falling asleep at the wheel. My eyes kept drifting shut for half a second at a time. That thing where you blink and suddenly you're fifty feet further down the road than you thought you were. I turned up the music and rolled down the window but the cold air only helped for a few minutes. I needed caffeine.

The highway was empty. I hadn't seen another car in at least twenty minutes. When I saw the glow of a gas station sign up ahead, I felt relieved. It was one of those old independent places, not a chain. The kind that looks like it hasn't been updated since the 80s. A single building with two pumps out front and a hand painted sign that said ""Last Stop For 70 Miles.""

I pulled in and parked at the pump. The lot was empty except for a beat up truck parked around the side of the building. I figured it belonged to whoever was working the night shift. I got out, stretched my legs, and filled my tank. I paid at the pump and headed inside.

I should have just gotten back in my car and left. But I needed that coffee. And I needed to use the bathroom. So I walked inside.

The store was small. A few aisles of snacks and car supplies. A coffee station in the back corner with those glass pots that had probably been sitting on the burner for hours. A cooler full of sodas and energy drinks along the back wall. The lights were that harsh fluorescent kind that made everything look slightly off.

The attendant was behind the counter. He was maybe fifty, with thinning grey hair and a face that looked like it hadn't slept in days. He had the TV on, some late night infomercial with the sound turned low. He looked up when I walked in and something in his expression changed. Just for a second. Like he was surprised to see me. Or worried.

""Evening,"" he said.

""Hey. Just grabbing a coffee.""

I walked to the back and poured myself a cup. It was burnt and bitter but I didn't care. I just needed the caffeine to get me through the next two hours. I grabbed a candy bar too and brought everything to the counter.

The attendant rang me up slowly. He kept glancing past me toward the windows. Toward my car.

""Driving alone?"" he asked.

""Yeah.""

""Long trip?""

""Few more hours.""

He nodded but didn't say anything else. He was staring at the window again. I turned to look but there was nothing out there. Just my car at the pump. The empty highway beyond.

""Something wrong?"" I asked.

He looked at me for a long moment. Then he slid a piece of paper across the counter. A napkin. He had written on it in pen.

""You're being followed. Don't go back to your car.""

I stared at the napkin. Then I looked back up at him. His face was completely serious.

""What are you talking about?""

He held up a hand. ""Keep your voice down. Look at the monitor.""

He pointed to a small security screen mounted on the wall behind the counter. It showed a black and white feed of the parking lot. My car was there.

And someone was standing next to it.

My stomach dropped. The figure was on the passenger side, just standing there facing the store. I couldn't make out any features. They were wearing dark clothes and their face was in shadow.

I spun around and looked out the window.

There was no one there.

Just my car. Empty lot. Nothing.

I looked back at the monitor. The figure was still there. Standing in the same spot.

""What the hell,"" I whispered.

""It doesn't show up when you look directly,"" the attendant said. ""Only on the cameras. I don't know why. I don't know what it is. But I know what happens to people who go out there when it's waiting for them.""

My heart was pounding. I looked out the window again. Nothing. Back at the monitor. The figure had moved. It was closer to the front of my car now. Still facing the store.

""This is insane,"" I said. ""This has to be some kind of trick.""

""I wish it was."" He reached under the counter and pulled out a folder. Inside were printed news articles. Missing persons reports. Headlines about bodies found on the highway.

""Four people in the last eight months,"" he said. ""All of them stopped here late at night. All of them went back to their cars even after I warned them. They found them a few miles down the road. Cars stopped in the middle of the highway. Engines still running. Drivers still in their seats. Eyes open. No marks on them. Coroner said their hearts just stopped.""

I felt dizzy. This couldn't be real. I looked at the articles. The photos of the victims. A young woman. A middle aged man. A couple in their thirties. Real people. Real deaths.

""Why haven't the police done anything?"" I asked.

""Done what? There's nothing to investigate. No signs of foul play. No witnesses. Just people dying on a lonely stretch of highway. Happens all the time. They chalk it up to fatigue or medical emergencies.""

I looked at the monitor again. The figure was even closer now. Standing right in front of my car.

""How long does it stay?"" I asked.

""Until sunrise usually. Sometimes longer. But if you stay inside, you're safe. It can't come in here.""

""Why not?""

He shrugged. ""I don't know. I stopped asking questions like that months ago. I just know the rules. Stay inside when it's dark. Don't go out to the lot. Wait for daylight.""

I wanted to argue. I wanted to tell him he was crazy. But I couldn't explain the figure on the monitor. I couldn't explain why it wasn't there when I looked with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll wait.""

He looked relieved. ""Good. Smart. You can sit in the back if you want. There's a couch. I've got some magazines. It's only about four hours until sunrise.""

He walked to the front door and locked it. The click of the deadbolt was loud in the quiet store.

""Just in case,"" he said. ""Sometimes people panic and try to run. This way you won't do anything stupid.""

Something about the way he said it made me uncomfortable. But I told myself he was just being cautious. He was trying to help.

I sat down on a stool near the counter. The attendant went back to watching his infomercial. Every few minutes I would look at the monitor. The figure was always there. Sometimes in a different position. Sometimes closer to the building. But always there.

After about an hour, I asked if I could use the bathroom. He pointed to a door near the back of the store.

""Right through there.""

I got up and walked toward it. As I passed the counter, I glanced at the security monitor again. Something was different. It took me a second to realize what it was.

The timestamp.

The footage showed 11:47 PM. But it was after 3 AM now. I had checked my phone when I first came inside. It was definitely past 2.

I stopped walking. I looked at the monitor more carefully. The footage wasn't live. It was a loop. The same few minutes playing over and over.

My blood went cold.

I looked out the window at my car. Really looked this time.

There was no one out there. There had never been anyone out there.

I kept my voice calm. ""Hey, what time does that camera say?""

He didn't answer for a second. When I turned around, he was standing right behind me.

""You should use the bathroom,"" he said. His voice was different now. Flatter. ""You've been holding it for a while.""

""The timestamp is wrong,"" I said. ""The footage is old.""

His expression didn't change. He just stared at me with those tired eyes.

""You saw the articles,"" he said. ""You saw what happens to people on this highway.""

""Those could be from anywhere. Anyone could print those out.""

He took a step toward me. I took a step back.

""You should stay,"" he said. ""It's not safe out there.""

I looked at the door. Locked. The deadbolt needed a key from this side.

""Where's the key?"" I asked.

""I can't let you leave. Not until morning. For your own safety.""

I backed up further. My hand found the door handle to the back room. I pushed it open and stepped through.

It wasn't a break room.

It was a storage space. Dim light from a single bulb. Shelves lined the walls. And on the shelves were boxes. Dozens of them. Each one labeled with a date.

I opened the nearest one.

Inside was a wallet. A phone with a cracked screen. A set of car keys. A driver's license. The photo showed a young woman. Blonde hair. Smiling.

I recognized her face from the articles.

I opened another box. Different items. Different license. The middle aged man.

He hadn't been warning those people. He had been taking them.

I heard footsteps behind me. I turned around. He was standing in the doorway, blocking the exit.

""They always figure it out,"" he said. ""But by then it's too late. No cell signal out here. Nearest town is forty miles. No one to hear you scream.""

He was holding something. A length of cord.

I backed into the shelves. My hand closed around something heavy. A wrench. Old and rusted but solid.

""You don't want to do this,"" he said. ""It'll be easier if you just cooperate.""

He stepped forward.

I swung.

The wrench connected with the side of his head. He staggered sideways and hit the wall. I didn't wait to see if he went down. I ran past him through the doorway into the main store.

The front door was still locked. I grabbed a stool from the counter and swung it at the glass window. It cracked but didn't break. I swung again. Again.

I could hear him behind me. Getting up. Cursing.

The third swing went through. I knocked out the remaining glass with the stool and climbed through the window frame. Shards cut my arms and legs but I didn't care. I dropped onto the pavement outside and ran for my car.

My keys were still in my pocket. My phone was still in the cupholder where I left it. I got in and started the engine. In the rearview mirror I saw him stumbling out through the broken window.

I floored it.

I drove for an hour without stopping. When I finally pulled over at a rest stop, my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold my phone.

I'm sitting in my car now. Doors locked. Engine running. I called 911. They're sending someone to the gas station. They told me to stay where I am and wait for an officer to come take my statement.

I keep checking my mirrors. I keep expecting to see headlights behind me.

The sun is coming up now. I can see the sky turning grey on the horizon. I should feel relieved but I don't.

Because when I climbed through that window, when I ran to my car and looked back at the store, I saw the security monitor through the broken glass.

The figure was still on the screen. Standing in the lot. But it wasn't by my car anymore.

It was standing exactly where I had been standing when I broke the window.

I don't know what he had playing on that monitor. I don't know if it was really a loop or something else entirely. I don't know if he made it all up to scare people into staying or if there was some truth buried under the lies.

All I know is that I'm never driving this highway again. And if you ever see a gas station sign that says ""Last Stop For 70 Miles,"" keep driving.

Whatever's waiting there, you don't want to find out.

Standing before the heart of the city, I stared into the golden glow of our fake sun. But it wasn't a ball of light when I first thought, the light goes on seemingly forever to each side. It's hard to tell if it's a mighty wall to protect what's inside, or a dome to keep something from escaping. It didn't stop me from entering nor leaving, the blinding light creates a challenge for the seeing if that's what counts as it's way to stop those who dares approach. Regardless of my sight or what this brilliant glow intent, I venture towards where my city should be. My footsteps were loud, being left in a deaf world makes creaks and rustle sound like thunder and earthquakes. My heartbeat was calm, beating like it should. But each pump feels like it could shake the world if the rhythm goes off even by a second. Even my breathing feels like it doesn't belong outside my lungs, my breath sounds like a hurricane ready to destroy no matter how slow I tried to exhale. I ponder if I should hold my breath but I do not believe in my ability to hold it so I tried everything I can to keep the storm calm with normal slow breathing. Giving up on my eyes to comprehend this strange world, I make my way towards the city center with the help of my hands. Hands with limited reach compared to the gift eyes give us every day that are taken for granted, feeling nothing till my eyes become of use when they make out an odd shape. It was a large shape, standing tall over my stature with ease. Even though this giant shape has been bathed in this warm fake sunlight, it feels cold when my outstretched hands close in. Mere steps away from one of the many questions I pondered, I can now confidently say what this strange shape truly is that has been plaguing my mind since the moment I first placed my eyes of its blurry misshapen form from afar. 
What stands before me is a golden cross.

*Gasp!!!* I woke up and shot straight up in my bed, covered in sweat and panting like I was holding my breath. 
“Another nightmare?!” I sat in my bed, pondering what had been haunting me last night. I was shaking with my hands holding my head, unable to think of what scared me other than I was scared. I need to get up and get ready, but I don't want to. There's been days, most days where I don't want to go but reason won me over. Today fear is winning me to stay still and not leave, I look at my clock that now says 7:34. I could easily make it if I get out now, but I don't want to. A memory of Rachel warm welcoming smile popped into mind, washing away any fear and doubt I had. Finding a reason to go to work, I got out of bed slower than usual. My morning went by quicker and in a total blur, I headed to the bathroom, shower, brushed my teeth, dress, ate breakfast and got ready to leave. I check my clock again which now says 8:06, I can still make it just fine. I took a second to reach for the door knob, not wanting to leave the safe place I needed to keep away the nightmare. I grabbed the door knob, and walked out into the new day, or into hell.
Walking down the familiar street I known felt wrong, as if I were being watch from the shadow. I feel exposed, I want to turn back and hide under the sheets of my bed, I don't want to be outside. I feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me and I hate it. I quicken my pace away from what hell is out here when my city should be. I might be going crazy now, I thought I saw a glow behind the buildings. That doesn’t matter now, Random Shack is up ahead, I went into a dash as fast as I could to go to my second home where I could hide away from the terror of which I neither know nor wish to know. Just a few more steps, just within reach, I reached for the door and forced myself inside and shut the door behind me and held it shut so nothing could come after me.
 “Oh? Good morning Ethan! Quit the entrance today. Are you that excited for work that you ran all the way here? Or do you think sprinting to work till get you that employee of the month?” Rachel said cheerfully after being surprised from my sudden entrance. I didn’t hear her greeting, more like I couldn’t. I stood there trying to catch my breath and with the pounding of my heart made it impossible to hear anything, and honestly I really didn’t want to hear. 
“Ethan?” Rachel asked but to no answer. Failing to calm myself, the fear that was outside continued as I forced the door behind me to stay closed even harder the more I thought about it. Beads of sweat now falling off my chin then to the floor where I stared, now fearing that something might crash through the doors where I stood now became a greater concern. Legs feeling like jello and needing to run again crept into my mind, now begging to run away was what my entire body was shouting at me to do. I closed my eyes tightly, seeking courage to let go of the closed door and make a run for it, getting a last few quick breaths in for my mad escape before suddenly…..
“Ethan!?” Rachel asked again while putting her hand on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see Rachel right in front of me. It was so warm and soothing for her to be so close to me, probably the only other time she was this close besides when we first met and I shook her hand. Staring right into her beautiful blue eyes washed away any fear I had brought with me into the store. After what anyone would agree to be way too long to be staring at anyone, I regained my consciousness which felt like I had lost since yesterday and finally answered the concerned women right in front of me.
“...Oh, s-sorry. Yeah. I’m fine, just. Had a bad morning, that’s all. I-I’m fine, really, sorry for worrying you.” I’ve said the most amount of words to Rachel in one go the entire time I’ve known her, and slowly let go of the door with aching hands relieved to do so.
“Alright, if you say so. Must be a terrible start to your day, then. You’re pale as a ghost and sweating like crazy. Either you saw a ghost, or you realized you were going to be late and were about to ruin your perfect attendance.” Rachel said, trying to cheer me up, and it worked. I don’t think there’s much she could do to make me feel worse than just a few moments ago.
“Everything alright over there? I heard the door being slam shut, and it’s way too early for that to be an angry customer storming out just yet.” Rick asked and he made his way from the back towards us.
“Ethan saw a ghost, or maybe he found a bug in his coffee? The scared little guy hasn’t said much, but I can’t help but to worry about what had spooked him this badly. He didn’t seem like the type to be scared this bad.” said Rachel.
“Well it is true that you didn’t show up like usual, but you never really showed up looking like you found $20 on the street. Tell you what, you can grab one of my snacks from my secret stash and you can have 5 extra minutes on your break!” Said Rick now trying to cheer me up. Not nearly as effective as Rachel, but I still appreciate it.
“Well aren't you lucky! Well, besides the whole having a not so pleasant morning, but Rick always has the best snacks. Maybe I should show up like you did to get me some free snacks! Everyone knows that college kids run off of snacks, coffee, and the cheapest meal plans we can find.” Rachel said like her usual cheerful self. 
“Let me know if you need anything. And take it easy, it’s best if you put what happened earlier behind you. Ok!?” Realising that not only that I haven’t moved from the same spot this entire conversation, but this is also the longest I had ever been in a conversation. Still be it her doing most of it, but progress. Both Rick and Rachel headed to where they are needed, leaving me alone at the door made the isolation feel worse than ever. That fear never left, making it hard to do anything. I don’t know how long or how I even did it, I made it behind the register. I felt better by being in a place I know quite well for a little bit, but being left alone with nothing but your thoughts and fears didn’t make being here any better. 
Opening the store and letting the early birds in as usual, but I couldn’t recognize anyone coming into the store. I couldn’t make out anyone, everyone’s face and body just looked like messed mashed blobs with no color to them. I tried to look for the two people I knew but they were nowhere to be found in the sea of colorless shaped and distorted voices. I didn’t know if I was working or doing anything, everything just went by so fast that I really couldn’t comprehend if anything happened or not. I stared out into the store with passing blurs going in and out, trying to grasp onto anything that I could understand but I always end up at the same isolated spot where I sat as everything at the store moves on without me. The buzz above me was loud, louder then ever. It sounds more like the screams of the damn, I might actually be in hell right now. I was going insane but I didn’t say a word. I don’t know if it was either because I didn't want disturbed what’s normal left of the store, or if I physically couldn’t. What felt like seconds to minutes passed, I felt like something within me was about to snap when-
“Alright, break time!” Rick said, patting my back and snapping me out of a trance I was stuck in. I don’t know how hours passed but I wasn’t worried about that, I now have an excuse to leave this suffocating prison for a chance to breathe.
“I’ll show you where I keep some of my good snacks if you wa-”
“No thank you!” I said rushing past Rick, probably too harshly. But at the time I didn’t care, I needed to get out of here. 
“O-Oh, ok. Guess he’s not a big snack guy?”
Again I sat in a spot where I should be fine, where I should be comfortable. My usual spot where I smoke away my  first half of the day and get ready for the next. Thinking of what I could be doing instead of this, but not now. I sat with my knees to head in a ball feeling like I’m being watched all over again. A looming fear crawling back inside where it shouldn’t belong. Now I sat hopeless not knowing what to do or why this was happening. I wanted to disappear, me or whatever was out there to go away. I tried to pray but I couldn’t get the words out, or think if I was even going to say it properly. I held myself tighter wishing for all of it to go away till I heard the door open beside me.
“Ethen?” It was Rachel, someone I hadn’t realized I wanted to see but was so grateful for her to be there right beside me.
“Is everything ok? You looked out of it the whole day and rushed out the moment you could. Clearly something is wrong and you’re not telling.” Rachel said as she made her way right next to me and sat quite close to where I’m currently curled up. 
“You may not like it, but you have people who would gladly hear your worries and help in any way we can. Rick is holding down the fort for now, so we have time to get anything off your chest if it’s really bothering you this much!” She really is such a sweet person, and honestly I’ve been waiting for this moment forever, one moment with just the two of us alone together. One chance to be alone with the prettiest, kindest, and most lovely individual I know. Open up to her and form a bond that will grow stronger with time. To have both sides to truly know and understand the other’s struggles and joys, one which I’ve dreamed and fantasized for quite some time. It would be so easy to tell her, so simple to say “I had problems sleeping”, or “I’ve been having the strangest day” anything. I didn’t even need to tell her the full story, one bit and she’ll understand and comfort me the best she could. More than what I needed, but what I craved deeply.
“......I’m sorry Rachel. I’ve probably worried both you and Rick today. It’s….something I’m dealing with. I don’t want to get either of you to get involved. Thank you for worrying about me so much, I really do appreciate it.” Those words came out so easily, the most I’ve said without fumbling my words. The most normal sentence I’ve been wanting to be able to say to her, but not the words I wanted her to hear.
“......Ok Ethen. But if you ever change your mind and want someone to talk to, you have two pairs of ears who will gladly listen.” Rachel said as she stood up. Before heading back inside she gave me one more reassuring smile. Not the smile I wanted, but it still warms me from the cold isolation that surrounds me.
I waited until Rachel's warm smile could no longer keep away the cold and fear before heading back inside. I walked past Rick who seemed a bit worn out from dealing with the store all on his own. When he saw me he quickly changed his tired look to that of worried concern. 
“You good, Ethen?” you now when someone like Rick means what they say when there’s no jokes or puns to what they are saying. He always cares but only in times like this does he show it in full force.
“Yeah, I’m good. Sorry.” I didn’t even look him in the eyes. I really felt bad for putting him through all of my crap, but I was still thinking about how I failed my one chance with Rachel that I couldn’t even properly say sorry to my only friend. I continued my way to the register, glad to know that one of the eyes that are on me are ones that I know and are glad that they are there. I was still paranoid and scared, but the rest of the day went on like normal. I could see the faces of the afternoon customers and I could hear their rants and sly remarks like usual. Time went by faster than normal, which I don’t know if it was a blessing or a curse. Both Rachel and Rick came by to check on me, I lied to them again and said “I’m fine”, keeping then at arms length for hopefully someones own good. End of the day was here and the three quiet employees of Random Shack did their last tasks of the day before closing.
“Ok Rachel, you can head on back and get some rest for school.” It’s not often to see Rick to act like a gentle father, but he would be a great dad to have growing up with.
“Thanks Rick, but I’ll stay around for a bit. Gotta make sure everything’s alright, I think it’s best for me to stay just a bit longer.” Even the kind Rachel never asked to stay past her work hours, I must be one hell of a mess for her to go out of her way twice for someone like me.
“If that’s what you want, then I’ll allow it. Just make sure you don’t do anything crazy, it’s already putting my boxers in a bind to make sure one of our employees is alright.”
“Don’t worry Rick, I’ll be out of the way.” Having Rachel in the last few moments of closing the store was a blessing I didn’t know that I wanted. She stood by the door quietly watching over me and Rick doing the last of the tasks for the night, asking if I needed help even though he still has stuff he needs to bo. I really do appreciate what both of them are doing, I wish I can return the favor in any way I can. With Rachel watching me work I didn’t get the sense of needing to look impressive or needing to be perfect in what I was doing when Rachel was there watching me, I just felt calm and at peace with her there. Like the sun peeking out over the clouds from a cold day to warm me up, probably the only time I enjoyed doing work in my life. After finishing the last of our nightly tasks Rick said his lines like a tradition that must be upheld, but with less enthusiasm then normal,
“And with that, the Shack is closed.” No one can blame him for not ending off with a high note, especially me who caused the whole awkward problem. But I was kinda hoping to hear Rick's usual self before parting ways for tonight.
 “Ethen. You're probably sick and tired of hearing this all day, but are you sure you don’t want either of us to walk you home. Neither of us mind for tonight, we’re more than happy to help in any way we can.”
“It’s true. I may not have anything fancy or a magic spell to cast away your problem, but I’ll gladly do what I can if you need it.” While it is true I was getting tired of hearing the same worried concerns the whole day, I did want to stay with them just a bit longer. Away from the impending fear I can’t bare to face, the unknown that haunts me. I so desperately want the three of us to be here as long as I can, but today my mouth and body refuse to listen to me, almost like it doesn't understand what’s about to happen when I leave the only pillars I can lean on.
“Thanks you two. I really do appreciate you saying that. But I’ll be fine, I don’t live too far from here. I’ll be home in no time. You guys head home and get some rest. I’m sure I’ll be back to normal by tomorrow.” That last bit was a lie, I knew that was a lie yet I still said it. I said so many lies today I might as well name a new sin after me. I hate it, and I don’t understand why I did that. I don’t want to leave, I don’t want to go back home, and I know for damn sure that I wont be ok tomorrow, if I can make it to tomorrow. Both Rick and Rachel looked at each other then looked back at me knowing there’s no point in arguing and will let me be.
“If you say so. But if you change your mind, you know where I live, yeah?”
“Goodnight Ethan, I hope a goodnight sleep will be what the doctor ordered.” I nodded my head then walked back home, I wished that of once they weren't such nice people and pressured me into saying what I been wanting to say this whole day. I didn’t look back, I wanted to but I didn’t. My body refuses to look back on the only people who care, slowly feeling their warm pressens fade away as I walked further away till it’s fully gone. Now standing in front of what should be my home, feels alien. I’ve never stood in front of anything that felt so unwelcoming. I made my way inside, how? I would like to know, my body has been doing everything all on its own to the point where I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else was controlling it. I did my nightly duties in a trance, like my mind was still processing how I managed to walked through the front door. It’s only until I stood in front of my bed where I was able to move my body the way I wanted to, only to be replaced by fear. I curled up back to a ball right next to my bed, not wanting to move or know what was about to happen. I subconsciously turned off the light like I was about to go to sleep, but that’s the last thing I wanted to do. Deep down I know that if I close my eyes, the worse will happen. That be it I never awake again or something else was anyone's guess. All I do know is that I should get up, turn on the light and wait out the night. But fear has a stronger hold than reason, holding me down in that one spot in the dark. Like it knows what will happen if I close my eyes and sleep one last time. I tried to make a last ditch effort and force myself with everything I had to get up and out of the bedroom, but failed miserably as I slipped and bumped on the side of my bed. Somehow my face brushing against the side of my bed was enough for me to succumb to fatigue and tiredness, my eyes grew too heavy to keep open as I fell asleep on my bedroom floor and faced whatever was in store for me……….",1,1765370755.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I finally started posting 6 months ago. Coffee brewing videos. Posting 4-5 times a week. Really good production quality, genuinely helpful tips, way better than half the stuff I see going viral. Stuck at 200-400 views every single video.

I kept blaming the algorithm. Said my niche was too saturated. Thought maybe I needed better equipment or to post at different times. Tried literally everything people suggest in those ""how to grow"" videos. Nothing changed.

Last week I was genuinely about to quit. Like actually done. Said I couldn't keep putting hours into content that nobody sees. So my friend offered to look at my account with fresh eyes. He's been weirdly obsessed with short form content for a while now, so I figured maybe he'd spot something I missed. He ran my last 10 videos through Tik Alyzer, this app he uses that analyzes your video and tells you what's wrong with it and how to fix it. Figured it couldn't hurt.

He found the problem in literally 30 seconds. It showed me I was losing 65% of viewers between second 8-9. Every. Single. Video. Not the hook. Not the content. Not the topic. Second 8-9 specifically. And then it told him why: the steam from the coffee was blocking my face at that moment, breaking the visual connection.

He pulled up the videos and showed me. At that timestamp, I'm pouring hot water and this cloud of steam rises up right in front of my face for a couple seconds. I thought it looked cool and atmospheric. When we watched it together, I was convinced it added to the vibe. But he explained that when you're scrolling, losing sight of someone's face registers as disconnection or like the video quality dropped, making people move on. Instant scroll.

I couldn't believe it. I'd watched my own videos back dozens of times and never caught it because when you're watching your own content, you're not in ""scroll mode."" You're watching intentionally. So I filmed my next 3 videos adjusting my camera angle so the steam wouldn't block my face. Still got the aesthetic shot but kept my face visible throughout.

Results: Video 1 got 2,100 views, Video 2 got 3,800 views, Video 3 got 5,200 views. Same topics. Same posting times. Same everything. Just kept my face visible through the steam.

I couldn't believe it. Six months of thinking I wasn't good enough or that the algorithm hated me, and it was just one tiny thing I couldn't see without the data. Platform analytics would just show ""low retention"" and leave me guessing. I'd never know it was second 8-9 specifically. I'd never know it was the steam blocking my face.

A beautiful coat, perfectly tailored trousers, or a cozy sweater. The fabric feels substantial, looks elegant, and cost real money.

Now the critical question: how do you care for it so it lasts 10, 20, or even 30 years instead of falling apart after one season?

Wool has an unfair reputation for being difficult. The truth is simpler: wool is incredibly durable when cared for correctly, but unforgiving when mistreated. A few basic mistakes (hot water, harsh agitation, improper storage) can ruin even the most expensive piece.

This guide covers everything you need to know about wool care. Follow these practices and your wool will remain beautiful, comfortable, and wearable for decades.

 

# Understanding Wool: Why Special Care Matters

Wool is a protein fiber with unique properties that demand specific care.

# What Makes Wool Different

**Structure**: Wool fibers have overlapping scales (like roof shingles). These scales:

* Trap air for insulation
* Allow wool to absorb moisture without feeling wet
* Can lock together (felting) when agitated in hot water
* Give wool its natural elasticity

**Protein-based**: Like hair, wool is made of keratin protein. Heat, harsh chemicals, and excessive agitation break down these proteins, permanently damaging the fiber.

**Natural elasticity**: Wool can stretch up to 30% and return to shape, but only if you don't damage this property through improper care.

**Self-cleaning**: Wool's structure naturally resists dirt and odors. This means you can wash wool far less frequently than cotton or synthetics.

# What Damages Wool

Understanding the enemy helps you avoid it:

**Heat + agitation + moisture = felting**: This combination causes scales to lock together, shrinking and hardening the fabric permanently. Once felted, wool cannot be restored.

**Hot water**: Breaks down protein structure, causes dramatic shrinking.

**Harsh chemicals**: Alkaline detergents degrade wool fibers.

**Aggressive washing**: Friction causes fibers to mat and felt.

**Improper drying**: Hanging wet wool stretches it permanently; machine drying shrinks and damages it.

**Moths**: Larvae eat wool (they love the protein).

**Incorrect storage**: Hanging heavy knits causes stretching; compressing structured pieces causes creasing.

Every wool care practice aims to avoid these threats while keeping garments fresh and clean.

 

# How Often Should You Wash Wool?

The most important rule: **wash wool only when necessary.**

# Washing Frequency by Garment Type

**Wool coats**: 1-2 times per season maximum (spot clean between)

**Wool blazers**: Every 5-7 wears, or when visibly soiled

**Wool trousers**: Every 4-5 wears (more if sweating, less if worn briefly)

**Wool sweaters**: Every 5-7 wears under normal conditions

**Wool base layers**: After every wear (in contact with skin, absorbs sweat)

**Wool scarves/accessories**: Every 10-15 wears (minimal skin contact)

**Before storage**: Always clean before putting away seasonally, even if it seems clean

# Why Washing Less Is Better

Every wash cycle causes some fiber damage:

* Friction loosens and breaks fibers
* Water swells fibers, weakening structure
* Movement causes minor felting even with careful washing
* Repeated cycles gradually degrade protein

Wool's natural odor resistance and self-cleaning properties mean it needs less washing than you think.

# Between-Wash Refreshing

Extend time between washes with these techniques:

**Air it out**: After wearing, hang your wool piece in a well-ventilated area for several hours or overnight. Fresh air removes most odors.

**Steam refresh**: Use a handheld steamer to freshen wool and remove wrinkles without washing. The heat also kills odor-causing bacteria.

**Brush it**: Use a soft garment brush to remove surface dirt, dust, and lint. This keeps wool looking fresh longer.

**Spot clean**: Address small stains immediately with a damp cloth rather than washing the entire garment.

**Vodka spray**: Mix 1 part vodka with 2 parts water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist wool and let air dry. Vodka kills bacteria without leaving scent or residue. (Really works!)

 

# Hand Washing Wool: The Safest Method

Hand washing gives you complete control, minimizing damage while cleaning effectively.

# What You'll Need

* Clean sink or large basin
* Cool or lukewarm water (never hot)
* Wool-safe detergent (pH-neutral or wool-specific)
* Clean white towels
* Flat drying space

# Step-by-Step Hand Washing

**Step 1: Prepare Water**

Fill sink with cool to lukewarm water. Maximum 30°C / 86°F. Hot water causes instant felting and shrinking.

Add a small amount of detergent:

* 1-2 teaspoons wool wash, or
* 1 teaspoon pH-neutral detergent (baby shampoo works in emergencies)

Mix until dissolved. Less is more, excess soap is hard to rinse completely.

**Never use**: Regular laundry detergent (too alkaline), fabric softener (coats fibers), bleach (destroys wool).

**Step 2: Submerge Garment**

Turn wool inside out to protect the outer surface.

Gently press garment into water, submerging completely. Don't wring, twist, or agitate.

Let soak 10-15 minutes for light soiling, up to 30 minutes for heavier dirt.

**Step 3: Gentle Agitation**

Very gently squeeze and press the garment in the water, like kneading dough extremely softly.

Pay attention to areas that contact skin: collar, cuffs, underarms. Gently squeeze these areas to release oils.

**Never**:

* Rub fabric against itself (causes felting)
* Twist or wring (stretches and damages)
* Scrub vigorously (breaks fibers)
* Lift garment out of water while saturated (weight causes stretching)

Total washing time: 3-5 minutes maximum.

**Step 4: Drain and Support**

Drain soapy water while supporting the garment's weight. Don't lift it out fully, keep it supported by the basin until water drains.

Gently press (don't wring) against basin sides to remove excess water.

**Step 5: Rinse Thoroughly**

Refill basin with cool, clean water at the same temperature as wash water. Temperature shock can cause felting.

Gently move garment through rinse water to remove all detergent.

Drain and press out water.

**Repeat rinse 2-3 times** until water runs completely clear with no suds. Residual soap attracts dirt and makes wool feel stiff.

**Step 6: Remove Excess Water**

Lay a clean, dry bath towel flat on the floor or table.

Lay wool garment flat on towel, arranging it in approximate shape.

Roll towel and garment together like a burrito, pressing gently as you roll. This absorbs significant water without wringing.

Unroll. If towel is very wet, transfer garment to a fresh dry towel and repeat.

Garment should be damp but not dripping.

# Common Hand Washing Mistakes

**Using hot water**: Instant shrinking and felting  
**Too much detergent**: Impossible to rinse out fully  
**Vigorous rubbing**: Causes felting and pilling  
**Insufficient rinsing**: Soap residue attracts dirt  
**Wringing or twisting**: Stretches and distorts shape  
**Lifting while saturated**: Weight pulls garment out of shape  
**Temperature changes**: Hot to cold causes shock felting

 

# Machine Washing Wool: When and How

Many modern washing machines have wool cycles that work reasonably well, but hand washing is always safer.

# When Machine Washing Is Acceptable

Machine washing works for:

* Sturdy, worsted wool pieces (not delicate knits)
* Wool labeled ""machine washable"" or ""superwash treated""
* Items you wear very frequently
* When you genuinely don't have time for hand washing

**Never machine wash**:

* Structured garments (blazers, coats)
* Delicate knits
* Wool with embellishments
* Vintage or heirloom pieces
* Anything you truly care about

# Safe Machine Washing Method

**Step 1: Prepare Garment**

Turn inside out. Place in mesh laundry bag to reduce agitation.

Wash only one or two wool pieces at a time, never overload.

**Step 2: Machine Settings**

* **Cycle**: Wool, delicate, or hand-wash cycle only
* **Water temperature**: Cold (30°C / 86°F maximum)
* **Spin speed**: Lowest setting or no spin
* **Detergent**: Small amount of wool-safe detergent

**Step 3: Never**

* Use regular wash cycles (too agitating)
* Wash with heavy items (jeans, towels create friction)
* Use warm or hot water
* Add fabric softener
* Let wool sit in machine after cycle ends

**Step 4: Remove Immediately**

Take wool out as soon as cycle finishes. Don't let it sit, this can set wrinkles and create odors.

# Machine Washing Risks

Even with precautions, machine washing carries risks:

* Increased pilling potential
* Possible shape distortion
* Faster long-term fiber degradation
* Risk of accidental felting if machine malfunctions

**Verdict**: Hand wash structured pieces and favorites. Save machine washing for sturdy basics when necessary.

 

# Drying Wool: The Make-or-Break Step

Drying method determines whether your wool maintains its shape or becomes unwearable.

# The Only Safe Method: Flat Drying

**Step 1: Reshape Immediately**

While wool is damp, gently reshape to original dimensions:

* Smooth out wrinkles
* Align shoulder seams
* Check sleeve symmetry
* Ensure collar sits properly
* Confirm length is even

Wool is most pliable when damp, this is your chance to restore proper shape.

**Step 2: Choose Drying Location**

Lay a clean, dry towel on a flat surface:

* Spare table or bed
* Clean floor area
* Flat drying rack with towel on top
* Any stable, flat surface away from heat and sun

**Good locations**:

* Spare bedroom with airflow
* Guest bed
* Dining table
* Clean, dry floor space

**Bad locations**:

* Near radiators or heating vents (heat damages wool)
* Direct sunlight (fades color, weakens fibers)
* Humid bathrooms (prolongs drying, risks mildew)
* Over chairs or racks (creates permanent creases)

**Step 3: Lay Flat**

Place wool on towel in its natural shape:

* Sleeves extended naturally (not folded under)
* Body smooth and unwrinkled
* Neckline shaped properly
* No fabric bunched or twisted

**Step 4: Flip and Replace Towel**

After several hours, flip garment over and replace damp towel with fresh dry one.

This ensures even drying and prevents moisture being trapped underneath.

**Step 5: Allow Complete Drying**

Full drying takes 24-48 hours depending on:

* Wool thickness
* Room humidity
* Air circulation
* Season

**Never rush this.** Wearing slightly damp wool can cause it to stretch and lose shape.

# Drying Trousers and Structured Pieces

**Wool trousers**:

* Lay flat on towel
* Smooth creases into proper position
* If crease won't stay, drape over towel-covered rod (not by waistband)
* Once 90% dry, hang properly to finish

**Wool coats/blazers**:

* Dry flat initially to remove most moisture
* Once mostly dry (not damp), hang on padded hanger to finish
* Never hang while wet (shoulders will distort)

# What Never to Do When Drying

**Never hang wet wool**: Weight pulls it out of shape permanently  
**Never use a dryer**: Even ""low heat"" causes shrinking and felting. One dryer cycle can ruin wool forever.  
**Never dry near direct heat**: Radiators, space heaters, heating vents all cause damage  
**Never use direct sunlight**: Fades colors and degrades fibers  
**Never drape over surfaces**: Creates permanent creases at contact points

 

# Removing Stains from Wool

Act quickly on stains, fresh ones are far easier to remove.

# General Stain Principles

**Speed matters**: Treat stains within hours if possible

**Blot, don't rub**: Rubbing pushes stains deeper and damages fibers

**Work from outside in**: Prevents spreading

**Test first**: Try any treatment on hidden area first

**Cool water only**: Hot water sets many stains permanently

**When in doubt, dry clean**: Some stains require professional treatment

# Stain-Specific Treatments

**Water-based stains (coffee, tea, juice, wine)**

1. Blot immediately with clean white cloth
2. Mix 1 teaspoon wool detergent in 1 cup cool water
3. Dip clean cloth in solution, gently dab stain (don't rub)
4. Blot with clean water to rinse
5. Press with dry towel to remove moisture
6. Air dry flat

**Oil/grease stains (food, makeup, oil)**

1. Blot excess immediately (don't rub in)
2. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder on stain
3. Let sit 2-4 hours to absorb oil
4. Gently brush off powder
5. If stain remains, hand wash entire garment
6. Stubborn stains need dry cleaning

**Protein stains (blood, sweat, food)**

1. Rinse immediately in cold water (never hot, it sets protein)
2. Soak in cool water with enzyme detergent for 30 minutes
3. Gently hand wash
4. If stain persists, try white vinegar solution (1:3 vinegar to water)
5. Rinse thoroughly

**Mud/dirt**

1. Let dry completely
2. Brush off dried mud with soft brush
3. If residue remains, spot clean with damp cloth
4. Hand wash if needed

**Red wine (the worst)**

1. Blot immediately, don't let it set
2. Pour white wine or club soda on stain (neutralizes red wine)
3. Blot repeatedly
4. If caught immediately, this might work
5. Otherwise, take to professional dry cleaner

# Never Attempt Home Treatment For

* Ink or permanent marker (dry clean immediately)
* Large oil stains (need professional chemicals)
* Set-in stains (older than 24 hours)
* Delicate vintage wool (too risky)

Professional dry cleaners have specialized wool stain treatments that work safely.

 

# Dealing with Pilling

Pilling happens with all wool, even quality pieces. Here's how to manage it.

# Why Wool Pills

Pilling occurs when:

* Short surface fibers work loose
* Friction (bags, seatbelts, washing) tangles loose fibers
* The garment is new (initial loose fibers working out)

**Important distinction**: Quality wool pills mainly during first 5-10 wears, then stabilizes. Poor-quality wool pills continuously.

# Normal vs. Excessive Pilling

**Normal (acceptable)**:

* Appears during first several wears
* Concentrated in high-friction areas (underarms, inner elbows, where bags rest)
* Significantly decreases after initial period
* Easy to remove, doesn't return immediately

**Excessive (indicates low quality)**:

* Continues heavily after 15+ wears
* All over garment, not just friction zones
* Returns immediately after removal
* Never stabilizes

# How to Remove Pills Correctly

**Best tools**:

* Wool comb (fine-toothed comb for delicates)
* Electric fabric shaver (on lowest setting)
* Sweater stone (natural pumice)

**Never use**: Scissors, razors, tape (damages underlying fabric)

**Wool comb technique**:

1. Lay garment flat on table
2. Hold fabric taut with one hand
3. Gently comb in one direction with light pressure
4. Don't scrape aggressively
5. Work section by section
6. Brush away removed pills

**Fabric shaver technique**:

1. Lay garment flat
2. Hold fabric taut
3. Use lowest power setting
4. Move in gentle circular motions
5. Don't press hard against fabric
6. Empty shaver container frequently

**Frequency**: Remove pills as they appear. Light, regular maintenance is better than infrequent aggressive sessions.

# Preventing Pilling

Minimize pilling by:

* Reducing friction (avoid wearing backpacks directly on wool)
* Washing less frequently
* Turning inside out when washing
* Not wearing same piece consecutive days (let fibers rest)
* Buying quality wool with longer staple fibers
* Storing properly to avoid fabric rubbing itself

 

# Storing Wool: Daily and Seasonal

Proper storage prevents damage and maintains shape.

# Daily Storage (In-Season)

**The cardinal rule: Fold knits, hang wovens**

**Wool sweaters, cardigans (knits)**:

* Always fold, never hang
* Hanging causes shoulder bumps and stretching
* Fold and store on shelves or in drawers

**How to fold properly**:

1. Lay flat face-down
2. Fold sleeves across back
3. Fold in half vertically
4. Fold horizontally once or twice
5. Store on shelf or standing in drawer

**Wool blazers, coats (structured)**:

* Hang on padded hangers (wide, curved shoulders)
* Never use wire hangers (create bumps)
* Button one button to maintain shape
* Use garment bag if closet is dusty

**Wool trousers**:

* Hang from cuffs or lay over trouser hanger
* If folding, fold along crease
* Don't hang by waistband (stretches)

**Wool skirts**:

* Hang from waistband on skirt hanger, or
* Fold gently and store flat
* Depends on weight and structure

# Seasonal Storage (Off-Season)

When storing wool for months, extra protection is essential.

**Step 1: Clean Everything**

**This is critical.** Moths are attracted to:

* Body oils and sweat
* Food residue
* Perfume and lotion residue
* Any organic matter

Even if wool looks clean, wash or dry clean before storage. One microscopic stain can attract moths that destroy your entire collection.

**Step 2: Choose Storage Container**

**Good options**:

* Breathable cotton storage bags
* Cedar chests
* Cardboard boxes (clean, dry)
* Canvas storage bins

**Bad options**:

* Plastic bins (trap moisture, no air circulation)
* Vacuum-sealed bags (compress fibers, create permanent creases, no breathing)
* Damp basements (mildew and moths)

**Step 3: Add Moth Protection**

Moths are wool's biggest enemy. Protect with:

**Cedar**: Cedar blocks, balls, rings, or sachets naturally repel moths. Replace or sand annually when scent fades.

**Lavender**: Dried lavender sachets repel moths and smell pleasant. Refresh yearly.

**Herbal sachets**: Combinations of rosemary, mint, thyme, cloves, and lavender work well.

**What to avoid**: Mothballs (toxic chemicals, terrible smell that permeates fabric permanently).

**Step 4: Store in Ideal Conditions**

**Temperature**: Cool, below 24°C / 75°F (moths thrive in warmth)

**Humidity**: Low (moths love humidity; aim for 50-55% RH)

**Light**: Dark (prevents fading)

**Airflow**: Some circulation (prevents musty odors)

**Good locations**: Main bedroom closets, under beds in climate-controlled rooms, clean dry basements

**Bad locations**: Hot attics, damp basements, garages, direct sun areas

**Step 5: Check Periodically**

Every 2-3 months during storage:

* Open containers briefly to air out
* Check for moth signs (tiny holes, larvae, webbing, adult moths)
* Replace moth deterrents if scent faded
* Refold to prevent permanent creases

 

# Fighting Moths: Prevention and Treatment

Moths cause more wool damage than all other factors combined.

# Signs of Moth Infestation

**Warning signs**:

* Tiny irregular holes in wool
* Small white larvae (look like tiny white worms)
* Webbing in storage areas
* Small cocoons in closet corners
* Adult moths flying around (means larvae are already there)

**Critical fact**: Adult moths don't eat wool, their larvae do. One female lays 50-100 eggs, which hatch into ravenous larvae.

# Moth Prevention Strategy

**Clean everything**: Moths need food. Clean wool has no body oils or residue to attract them.

**Use natural repellents**: Cedar and lavender repel moths but don't kill existing larvae.

**Regular inspection**: Check stored wool monthly.

**Freeze new items**: When buying new wool, seal in bag and freeze 48-72 hours to kill potential larvae before introducing to closet.

**Vacuum regularly**: Removes moth eggs and larvae from closet floors and shelves.

**Reduce humidity**: Use dehumidifiers if needed. Moths thrive in humidity.

**Seal cracks**: Larvae enter through baseboards, vents, cracks.

# If You Discover Moths

**Immediate action**:

1. **Remove all wool**: Empty affected closet/drawer completely
2. **Inspect everything**: Look for holes, larvae, webbing, eggs
3. **Freeze all wool**: Seal in plastic bags, freeze for minimum 72 hours (kills all stages)
4. **Wash everything**: Even pieces that look undamaged might have eggs
5. **Vacuum thoroughly**: Every corner, crack, shelf, baseboard
6. **Wipe down storage**: Use vinegar solution or mild cleaner
7. **Dispose of infested containers**: They might have eggs
8. **Replace moth deterrents**: New cedar, new lavender, new sachets
9. **Monitor closely**: Check weekly for 2-3 months

**Damaged items**:

* Small holes can sometimes be repaired professionally (invisible reweaving)
* Extensive damage usually means discarding the piece
* Never store damaged items with undamaged ones

 

# Pressing and Steaming Wool

Removing wrinkles without damage requires care.

# Steaming (Safest Method)

**Equipment**: Handheld garment steamer

**Technique**:

1. Hang wool garment
2. Hold steamer 1-2 inches from fabric (don't touch)
3. Move slowly down garment
4. Let steam penetrate fabric
5. Gently pull fabric taut as you steam
6. Allow to air dry before wearing

**Benefits**: No direct heat contact, minimal risk, refreshes fabric, kills bacteria

# Ironing (Use Caution)

**When to iron**: Only for sturdy wool (trousers, tailored pieces). Never iron delicate knits.

**Technique**:

1. Turn garment inside out
2. Place clean cotton cloth between iron and wool (pressing cloth)
3. Set iron to ""wool"" setting (low heat, steam)
4. Press firmly but don't drag iron
5. Lift and place, lift and place
6. Never leave iron sitting on wool
7. Let cool completely before moving garment

**Never**:

* Iron directly on wool (always use pressing cloth)
* Use high heat (scorches and damages)
* Iron in circular motions (stretches fabric)
* Iron wool while bone dry (add moisture with steam)

 

# Repairing Wool: When and How

Quality wool deserves repair, not disposal.

# DIY Repairs

**Small snags**:

* Pull snag to inside with crochet hook or dull needle
* Gently work fabric around snag to redistribute tension
* Never cut snags (creates holes)

**Loose threads**:

* Trim close to fabric with sharp scissors
* Don't pull (unravels further)
* If thread continues loosening, needs professional help

**Minor pilling**:

* Regular removal with appropriate tools
* Prevention through proper care

# Professional Repairs

**Moth holes**:

* Small holes can be invisibly rewoven
* Specialized reweaving services charge €15-40 per hole
* Worth it for quality pieces

**Tears or significant damage**:

* Skilled tailors can patch or reweave
* May not be invisible but can be subtle

**Resizing**:

* Wool garments can sometimes be altered
* Taking in is easier than letting out
* Find tailors experienced with wool

**Where to find repair services**:

* Specialty dry cleaners
* Tailors who work with fine fabrics
* Search ""invisible reweaving"" or ""textile repair""
* Knitting shops sometimes offer repair

**Cost-benefit**: If you paid €400+ for wool, spending €30-50 on repair makes financial sense.

 

# Dry Cleaning Wool: When It's Necessary

Dry cleaning has its place in wool care.

# When to Dry Clean

**Good reasons**:

* Structured garments (coats, blazers) difficult to wash at home
* Difficult stains (ink, set-in oil, red wine)
* Wool with linings or complex construction
* Before seasonal storage (professional cleaning removes all oils)
* Garment label specifies ""dry clean only""

**When hand washing is better**:

* Simple sweaters and cardigans
* Regular maintenance cleaning
* No visible stains
* To save money
* More control over process

# Choosing a Quality Dry Cleaner

**Green flags**:

* Specializes in wool and delicate fabrics
* Asks questions about garment and stains
* Inspects items carefully before cleaning
* Uses wool-appropriate gentle processes
* Positive reviews for delicates
* Higher pricing (quality costs money)

**Red flags**:

* Treats all items the same
* No inspection before cleaning
* Suspiciously cheap
* Negative reviews about damaged clothes

**Questions to ask**:

* ""Do you specialize in wool?""
* ""What cleaning process do you use for wool garments?""
* ""Do you hand-finish or machine press wool?""

**Frequency**: Even with dry cleaning, limit to 1-2 times per season. Chemicals stress fibers over time.

 

# Wool Care by Garment Type

**Special notes**: Check waistband for stretching

# Wool Scarves

**Washing**: Every 10-15 wears (minimal skin contact)  
**Daily care**: Fold loosely or hang briefly to air  
**Storage**: Fold gently in drawer  
**Special notes**: Fringe needs gentle care

# Common Wool Care Mistakes

Learn from these errors:

# Mistake 1: Washing in Hot Water

**Problem**: Instant felting and shrinking  
**Solution**: Always use cool/lukewarm water (max 30°C)

# Mistake 2: Hanging Wet Wool

**Problem**: Permanent stretching and shape distortion  
**Solution**: Always dry flat

# Mistake 3: Using Regular Detergent

**Problem**: Too alkaline, damages protein fibers  
**Solution**: Use pH-neutral or wool-specific detergent

# Mistake 4: Machine Drying

**Problem**: Shrinking, felting, permanent damage  
**Solution**: Always air dry flat, never use dryer

# Mistake 5: Washing Too Often

**Problem**: Accelerates fiber degradation  
**Solution**: Wash only when truly needed (every 5-7 wears)

# Mistake 6: Hanging Knits

**Problem**: Stretching, shoulder bumps, shape loss  
**Solution**: Always fold wool knits

# Mistake 7: Storing Dirty Wool

**Problem**: Attracts moths, sets stains  
**Solution**: Always clean before storage

# Mistake 8: Ignoring Moths

**Problem**: Extensive, expensive damage  
**Solution**: Use cedar/lavender, inspect regularly

# Mistake 9: Aggressive Pilling Removal

**Problem**: Damages underlying fabric  
**Solution**: Use proper tools with gentle pressure

# Mistake 10: No Preventive Care

**Problem**: Small issues become big problems  
**Solution**: Regular maintenance (brushing, airing, inspecting)

 

# The Long View: Wool as Lifetime Investment

Properly cared-for wool lasts 20-30+ years. Vintage wool from the 1940s-50s is still wearable today.

**Cost perspective**:

€600 wool coat worn 150 times over 20 years = €4 per wear

€150 cheap coat worn 40 times over 3 years = €3.75 per wear, but replaced 6 times = €900 total

The well-cared-for quality piece costs less and performs better.

Wool care time investment:

* Hand washing: 30 minutes every 5-7 wears
* Flat drying: Passive time (24-48 hours)
* Daily care: 2 minutes (brushing, folding)
* De-pilling: 10 minutes monthly
* Seasonal storage prep: 1 hour once yearly

For decades of use, this is minimal effort.

We have a 4 month old baby and decided to put down one of those plush mats on our wooden floors for tummy time and floor play. This mat has a non-slip underside made of pvc dots (see pic #2).

Because this mat takes up our entire living room space, we (stupidly, in hindsight) placed our coffee table on top of the edge of the mat. We have just pulled up part of the rug and found to our horror that the floor underneath now has a faint pattern of dots on it, which are significantly darker where the coffee table legs were.

We have tried cleaning with soapy water, then Cabot’s Wood Floor Cleaner (left to sit for 5 minutes), neither of which has budged the marks. I’m now very worried these are stains and I’m panicking. I’ve read that a magic eraser or baking soda paste could work but I’m worried that anything abrasive might damage the floors further. Are they safe to try?

Everything went amazing, but on August ive sensed something was off and we went for a coffee and she told me there were certain things about me she didnt like, like I wasn't paying mich attention to her, we werent seeing each other a lot (mind u we saw each other EVERY DAY AT UNI and talked and texted all the time) and i wasn't affectionate enough and that.

So the next MONTHS i started to do things. Bought her coffee, we went on dates, birthday parties, even went to the cinema and HAD SEX.

So everything was great right?

So a week later she broke up with me because of the same things,  its as iif even thoughI tried she couldn'tsee my effort. She told me she didnt want someone with 'those qualities' in her life, but she told me she loved me and wanted to stay in,touch and with my family and all. This was October 3rd.

The next month I was feeling like shit. I texred her crying every 2 days and couldn't even work properly, i was honesteoy bedrotting. Later that month SHE INVITED ME to a coffee and talking and i told her i couldnt be her friend and I wanted to improve and she told me ""me too, i cant see myself not being your partner"".

On november SHE INVITED ME to a show she was signing at and i went and later she toldme about how it was best for us to stop talking. I told her I wont see her again until next year and she said ""Well maybe we can see each other before December ends"".

I dont understand her.

After some pretty rough days of watching her Instagram I decided to block her. That was 2 weeks ago. I texted her telling her that and that I was gonna wait until end of January to see what we would do. She started talking A LOT about how there was nothing to talk about and her mind was made up day 1 (A LIE LOL) and even if I promise her i wont change cuz i was too late to change things. I told her ""Im gonna change for me, goodbye"" and she satarted yapping about ""yeah i know u can"". What a full of shit.

In the past weeks i started going to therapy, reading, meditating, adnd honestly I'm still thinking about her a lot. I dont understand cuz she says shes done but then she did all those (and many more) weird things. Some part of me still wants her back, but not as in October, idk its kinda weird now.

What i get really mad about is how she couldn't see all the things i did for her and many more when she told me about them. Its like she is blind for what I did at the beginning and everything else, she just cant see it. Im scared she's 100% made up cuz idk I still think we can work it out if she wasn't so closed off. She just doesnt trust me  idk. And I'm scared she will think ""yeah he will never give me what i deserve, im happier like this"", idk it's just so childish.

Idk some part of me still thinks she will get around, she has to, but idk anymore. And as I dont have any way of communicating or knowing what shes doing, lately ive been getting to the conclusion that WE ARE DONE SHE HATES ME ILL NEVER GET HER SHE FORGOT ABOUT EVERTRHING WE HAD, and idk its tiring man

Hey folks, Uncle Charlie here with another round of Wednesday Words of Wisdom.

This week I want to talk about something I wish someone had sat me down and explained 15 years ago when I picked up a camera and thought, *“How hard could this be?”*

(If you’re a filmmaker, you already know the answer: Shhh No Spoilers…)

So here it is the truth about documentary filmmaking that nobody tells you until you’re already three interviews in, wondering why your back hurts, your SSD is full, and your subject “forgot” you were coming. (seriously this did happen, drove all the way to DC from Brooklyn at 4am and .. well. that may be a story for another time …can you say awkward?)

These are the lessons I learned the hard way… so you don’t have to.

1. Nobody Cares About Your Film as Much as You Do And That’s Okay

I don’t say this to discourage you. I say it to empower you. because once you realize it’s YOUR job to:

* keep the energy up
* keep the schedule tight
* keep the morale alive
* keep the story moving

…you stop waiting for permission and start leading. You are the engine. Whether you have a crew of one or twenty. Nobody, no matter how committed they are to the project is going to care about it as much as you.

A documentary lives or dies on your fire to push it forward when no one else sees the vision yet.

Your audience sees the finished film. You see it long before it exists. If you can’t communicate this to your crew to care and get them fired up, how will you get your audience to?

That’s the burden and the blessing. It’s the silent pact you make with yourself before your shoot a single frame. It’s also your job to be the cheerleader when things go bad, I love quoting Clint Eastwood from Heartbreak Ridge,” Improvise, Adapt, Overcome” of that isn’t the single most important mantra of Doc filmmaking I do not know that it is.



2. You Will Lose People Along the Way; Crew, Friends, Sometimes the Film Itself

Documentaries strain everything to the breaking point:

* friendships
* finances
* schedules
* sanity -particularly sanity.

People drop out. Life happens. Your sound person moves to Vermont. Your subject ghosts you for six months then sends you an email that they can no longer participate in your film, no explanation, so nice. Bye Bye film project.

Losing people is normal. Finishing the film anyway, is what makes you a filmmaker not a tourist.



3. Organization Isn’t Sexy, But It Will Save Your Life

Everyone loves to talk about:

* lenses
* color
* gear
* drones
* LUTs
* vintage glass

Nobody wants to talk about:

* file structure
* media logs
* release forms
* interview backups
* spreadsheets
* budgets
* title searches and opinion letters

But here’s the truth: If you don’t stay organized, your film will eat you.

Not out of malice, but out of the sheer mess you have on your hands.

Documentary filmmaking is chaos make no mistake; Your job is to build the box that keeps the chaos from killing the story and you for that matter.



4. You Will Cry. At Least Once. Maybe Twice. Probably More.

It can happen anywhere:

* on the drive home
* after a realty brutal interview
* when a subject tells you something you did not expect but that you’ll carry for the rest of your life (this one creeps up on you and kicks you right in the nads)
* or when you realize the world is a lot harder than you wanted or believed it to be.
* Or, after years of slogging away in anonymity,  you get an email from PBS telling you they will distribute your doc and then seeing it on the PBS website. Lots of happy tears.

If you don’t feel something making your film, how can you expect anyone to feel something watching it? It’s so easy to remove yourself and take a step back from your story, what makes the best docs is when you lean into, and you feel it in your toes. I can’t tell you how many docs I have watched that I knew in the first 5 minutes whether the filmmaker is invested in the story or just phoning it in. Speaking of which I Just watched am amazing doc the other night I am recommending it for everyone (I hardly ever do that with a doc that is not older than ten years – Seaspiracy was the last one.) Jimmy Chinn (Free Solo) and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhely made a doc in 2025 about Pulitzer prize winning photo-journalist Lynsey Addario. It is the perfect melding of her time in war zones and managing a new family. This film is textbook storytelling, and I do not say that often. WATCH IT!!!

Emotion isn’t a weakness. It’s the compass. If you can’t feel it, you’re in the wrong business.  


5. The Universe Tests You Before It Rewards You

Every film I’ve made has had a moment where I thought:

* “This is impossible.”
* “What the hell am I doing here?”
* “What the hell am I doing with my life?”

And then, after enough suffering and stubbornness, and coffee, lots and lots of coffee,

the door opens, the clouds clear, a choir of angels start singing .. .. well maybe not angels.

* A perfect interview lands in your lap.
* A stranger says exactly what you needed exactly when you needed him to say it,
* A location appears like magic.
* A boat captain calls you back and says, “You wanna come out on the boat today?”
* A composer emails you out of the blue and says,

“Your film matters. I want in.” (this just happened on Outcast Nation)

Documentary filmmaking is faith-based work. Without faith you would never leave the comforts of your room / office/ blanket fort, to go out and meet the world you are filming head on.

You move first. Then the universe moves. It’s an odd turn phrase but you are the primary mover on your own film. If it stalls, that’s on you.



6. The Only Real Rule: Don’t Stop

You can:

* get tired
* get overwhelmed
* get lost
* get confused
* get discouraged

You can even walk away for a bit, a month, a year, 5 years.

But don’t quit.

The world is full of half-finished documentaries. Be the person who finishes their story even when the story tries to implode right in front of your eyes. Finishing is the superpower, and I will be honest, there are a whole lot less finished docs then unfinished ones out there. . That should tell you something about “getting it done”. There is a reason why there are so many “unfinished” docs.

I will be honest, to the average person who works hard five days a week in an office, being a filmmaker is “glamorous”. And I always point out it’s a whole lot less glamorous than you would imagine. We spend more time searching for financing then we do actually making films. Getting someone to buy into your vision before you have a film is virtually impossible until you have some kind of. Track record (it took me four full length feature docs). So, documentary filmmaking is hard. It’s not for tourists. We now live in a world where anyone can pick up a camera, a Go\_Pro, or an iPhone and make a movie. I have always said just because you can make a film doesn’t mean you should. It’s fun for a few days, running around shooting stuff. But then it happens;

It’s cold out - Don’t care get out and shoot

It’s raining out – Don’t care get out and shoot

It’s snowing out – Don’t care get out and shoot

My back is totally F@#ed – Don’t care take some back meds and get out and shoot.

Someone said “don’t come back here” – Don’t care get out and shoot.

Do you see what I am getting at, the film tourists stop when it gets hard, and let me tell you something, it ALWAYS gets hard.  That is when you know you are knee deep into it and the only way out is through (a little BG3 reference there)  


Final Thought

Documentary filmmaking isn’t about perfection. It’s not about money. It’s not about fame.

It’s about:

* showing up
* listening
* honoring and respecting people’s stories
* and carrying the truth across the finish line even if sometimes it feels like you are carrying an anvil and an anchor and they keep moving the finish line, (I think I had a stress dream once exactly like this)

If you can do that, even once, you’re a filmmaker, not a tourist, in my book and I have the utmost respect for you.

If you’ve got a story of your own about the moment you ALMOST quit (but didn’t), I’d love to hear it or even that Aha! moment when it all turned around!!! Please share.

Keep shooting!

P.S.  Next Saturday I’m doing a little AMA right here about documentary interview prep, techniques, and storytelling.

A bunch of you have asked me about interviewing and shaping stories, so I figured it might be fun (and hopefully useful) to spend an afternoon diving into it with whoever wants to hang out.

If you’re working on your first doc, prepping your own interviews, or just curious how someone with five features under their belt approaches it… please bring your questions.",1,1765369153.0,u_a_documentary,0,1.0,False
