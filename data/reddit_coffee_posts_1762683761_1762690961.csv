1oshyyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oshyyg/the_adhd_tax_is_so_despairing/,The ADHD tax is so despairing,"I (26M) hate the fact that my brain is not normal. Since I overlook and forget the simplest of the details, over the years I have made a habit of double check everything. From leaving my house to leaving the table at a coffee shop or just getting out of the car or bus, I tend to forget stuff behind or lose track of the fine points. And yet, I manage to mess things up.

Just today I walked into the airport trying to board a flight back home from a work visit. Got stopped at the gate because my ticket was not for today. I had somehow managed to mess up a simple flight booking by booking a same-day return flight as opposed to the three-day return ticket that I was supposed to buy, and I hadn't even noticed that once. Not only had I missed my flight back home, it had been three days since. 

Naturally, i booked the next flight back worth way more than its supposed to be and well over my monthly savings. Even worse is the fact that I would have to explain the three bookings to my office finance tomorrow who is supposed to reimburse me for my visit. I'm sure they won't entertain my personal f\*\*\* up, and this one's on me, not to mention the embarrassment trying to such explain basic executive function mess up.

Writing this from the airport lounge as I wait for my next flight, I cannot help but recall 4-5 other incidents, none as major as this one ofc where my ADHD screwed me like this. I saw someone refer to it on here as the ADHD tax. I feel despair, I feel stupid and almost helpless as if I don't belong to the normal work life. To members of the sub who have lived a larger part of their life managing their ADHD, does it get better? Or am I bound to lose money like this for the rest of my life. (I do not come from wealth and don't think I can keep on affording such major screwups).",1,1762690792.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I am looking for some idea of relative relatable timescales for getting back to work. I know i wont be drive for at least the first 6 weeks. After that things get more opaque so trying to get a feeling for what is a reasonable expectations. 

Luckily sick is not an issue, i get 6 months full pay / another 6 half pay so its not about the money. Its about the mental fatigue… 

So my question is as a uni lecturer focused on teaching my typical un interrupted day is a 1 hour commute by car, 15 minute walk to campus. Most ‘classes’ are 2 hour lectures delivered
In very old school ( think chalk ) to 100+ students. 

Take classes, walk to coffee shop, walk t o car, drive home.

This is not every day but timetables are bad at the best of times . Min on any one day is a 2 hour slot. My Friday this year prior to the operation was classes 10 am - 3pm, 4-6. 

Can anyone relate to how much time on my feet will / is normal by wk 12 ish post op which is when Semester 2 teaching starts for me.

Thanks in advance.

The Uganda Equator is one of the country’s most iconic landmarks — a fascinating point where the Earth’s northern and southern hemispheres meet. Located in #Kayabwe, about 72 kilometers south of Kampala along the Kampala–Masaka highway, it’s a must-stop experience for both domestic and international travelers.  
  
Standing at the Equator is more than just a photo opportunity — it’s a scientific wonder. Here, visitors witness water experiments that demonstrate how the Coriolis effect causes water to swirl in opposite directions in the northern and southern hemispheres, while at the exact line, the water flows straight down. It’s a simple yet mind-blowing display of nature’s precision.  
  
Beyond the science, the Equator offers a blend of culture and commerce. The site is surrounded by vibrant craft shops, cafés, and art galleries showcasing Ugandan creativity. Many visitors enjoy buying handmade souvenirs or enjoying a cup of locally brewed coffee while straddling both hemispheres — quite literally standing in two parts of the world at once!  
  
A stop at the #Uganda #Equator is more than just a geographical curiosity — it’s an unforgettable symbol of balance, discovery, and the beauty of travel in the #PearlOfAfrica.

I have 3 paid days off I’m saving for emergencies so I go work -kid-sleep. By evening I’m exhausted. My whole body hurts literally. Sometimes I manage 15 min of tv or a 10 min hot shower. It’s not enough somehow.

I eat like shit so I’m fat but I eat bad because I’m exhausted and broke and don’t have time to cook bc I’m watching the kid. 

Sometimes I think of sleeping in the car on my lunch break to help a bit but I feel like people will think it’s weird.

I haven’t been able to even get a hair cut in 14 months.

I don’t have much money at all so I can’t really afford a sitter or nanny or daycare hence my mom helping. I try to take my son for walks but it’s hit or miss on his temperament so a lot of times I just say fuck it and we stay home. Dad can’t help. 

I used to work out and cook sometimes and see friends for coffee sometimes and it was nice. I managed to see a doctor and I have prediabetes and liver issues and part of me is just like if I go to a hospital I’d get rest maybe.

This is how my story goes:

I’ve tried many ways to earn money for my rent: Writing and selling poetry e-books across marketplaces, building websites, creating Roblox experiences, and making Discord bots. Unfortunately, not everything worked out, and I ended up wasting my savings instead.

I also tried mining cryptocurrencies, taking part in surveys, using investment apps, and doing various online jobs, only to find that many were scams or ineffective. Yes, I learned these lessons the hard way and should have been more careful.

Because my savings were wasted a lot, I'm in financial struggle. I have social disabilities, struggle with communication, and also in a bad shape. I'm pessimistic, slow, and barely have talent. No one supported my career, and I was alone. 

**Now, I’m focus on creating what I probably could offer with my small services by using AI effectively such as:**

• Come up with a logo, branding, titles, or providing ideas and suggestions

• Revising sentences or words until you’re satisfied

• Writing short e-books or specific content

• Providing Roblox scripts or improving your Roblox game ideas

• Building Discord bot commands or a full Discord bot

• Adding HTML, CSS, or JS code to your website

• Giving design ideas for specific parts of your website

While it might take me a while to get things done, I put effort into everything I do because every idea deserves to be realized and I'm also somewhat perfectionist. **If you are interested, you can reach out to me anytime through Reddit chat, Facebook Messenger, or Discord DM. And again, please no scams.**

1oshmjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1oshmjf/the_savior_complex/,The Savior Complex,"I bought a man food yesterday . As i was giving him a ham and cheese croissant , cookie , water and siracha sauce (from a very well known chain coffee shop) a lady who was older than me started to thank me . I ignored her at first but she just kept going , and for some reason it upset me . i didnt understand at first until a few moments ago while i was in the shower. 

I was upset because i shouldnt have been thanked. It was something anyone could have done. The man i gave food to didnt really seem to be all there. Maybe it was from the sun or maybe drugs im trying not to assume but he only asked for food. Im not exactly a wealthy person what so ever but i wanted to help him because he asked. I didnt want a random thanks from a lady i didnt know . I just smiled and said “thanks” from her kind words. 

Ive had issues most of my life where i think i have to help people. I want to “save” them from themselves and their problems. Ive let friends sleep over when kicked out. I never said no to giving rides even though i was out of gas most the time. I listened to both my divorced parents squawk about eachother and their problems . I hurt relationships because i try to force help them. It wasnt healthy. I wanted to be loved. I thought maybe if i help them then i was useful. If i was useful then i was loved. If i stop being helpful then im no longer worthy of love. 

It was a terrible mentality and one im trying to accept is part of who i am but not one that defines me as a person nor defines the love i receive. Im not loved for my help im loved for me. Or at least thats what im trying to tell myself. Its embarrassing to really even talk about but thats just how it is. I felt like a desperate puppy begging for validation. Thats why yesterday i was upset . I wasnt looking for recognition or validation. 

I didnt want to feel like a “hero” . I just wanted to give that man some food because i know what its like to be hungry and thats all. I feel so stupid even ranting about this but theres been other incidents these past few years that lead up to this feeling. This small and stupid thing that on the outside looks insignificant, is alittle bit bigger to me. 

Times ive helped others i dont speak about because i dont want to brag and because i dont want validation anymore. Im just happy now because i dont feel like that annoying puppy anymore. Desperate and pathetic. I finally feel genuine and not just an imposter

I’m half terrified and half extremely excited. We have my parents’ support. I don’t have a job right now but I have a few interviews next week for jobs ranging from 15 an hour to 33 an hour. Fingers crossed I get the 33/hr.

I’ve gotten a few supplements already. Prenatal vitamins (one a day prenatal softgels. They have 800mcg folic acid, 27mg iron, 235mh Omega-3, and various other things I’ve heard are good for the baby and my partner.) and nausea support. Will probably get digestion support as well. Anything else I should get?

I have a list of things they can and can’t eat. Yesterday they had cooked sushi (pretty sure that’s okay from what I looked into) because I told them they can’t have it raw.

Here’s the list of that.
Less than 200mg caffeine
Foods to avoid:
Raw Sushi
High Mercury fish
Soft Cheese
Raw meats
Shellfish
Coffee/Energy Drinks
No drugs of course.
Deli Meat

It’s unfortunate, because they love raw sushi. After our baby is born I’m definitely going to give him some as soon as I can.

Any other foods we need to be aware of? Generally they’re very picky anyways but I need to make sure.

i can eat as healthy as i want, but weight loss just comes down to CICO.  i *would* start counting calories but i'm really reluctant to do that because i had a pretty serious eating disorder as a teen and now counting calories is a living hell for me.  i'm just not going to do it.  it's frustrating that i've had that option taken from me because i know how effective it is.

there are other things i can do.  frankly i don't want to do them either, but i'm going to have to.  my breakfasts, having counted calories in the past, i know to be really high in calories.  yesterday's breakfast was probably around 700, coffee included.  i mean, oatmeal and peanut butter, yogurt and fruit, sounds healthy enough but it's the calories that matter for weight loss.  so i can do stuff like swap things out, cut things back and cut things out.

psychologically, when i approach a meal, i usually approach it with this fear of hunger.  at my size, whatever i'm eating, it's definitely enough.  hungry is fine because that means i'm just getting used to the change.  it's not like i've cut *that* far back at this point anyway, there's still a lot of room to cut back because i'm not hungry.  there's also the human element of comfort, though.  like, i'm sorry, but i'm not getting comfort anywhere else in my life so if i have a big spoon of peanut butter at breakfast because i feel like shit and it's comforting, guess what, i'm having that peanut butter.

1oshhjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1oshhjq/save_yourself_work_elsewhere/,"Save yourself, work elsewhere…","I’m not sure if this is okay to post on here and this is also my first post on Reddit overall. I’ve made this account just to get advice so I’ll try not to give too much detail. And I apologise in advance for how long this post is…

So, I started working at a Costa Coffee cafe/DT one year ago. I’ve worked previously in hospitality at various places and I’ve never experienced anything like Costa before.

On my first week, the only thing I was ‘allowed’ to do was the cleaning and dishes. I was then allowed onto the cafe till but had no help when it came to working the till systems, so the cafe queue would grow and grow with tired and annoyed customers who would then take frustrations out on me. Added onto this, one of the BMs would quietly berate and say demeaning comments rather than help. When I brought this BM’s behaviour up to other staff I was told by everyone, “that’s just how they are” and that this particular BM had previously had warnings about their behaviour. As I write this, multiple bullying complaints have been submitted to the managers about this one BM and nothing!!! has happened. I’ve seen three female staff members crying on shift because of his behaviour. 

Fast forward a few months, the Area Manager (AM) transferred the store manager to another store under the promise of a promotion. For the record this promotion did not, and was never, going to happen and this person ended up leaving the company completely. In the meantime, our store was left with no manager for around a week before the next manager started. During this week, I experienced my first Costa Check. The BM previously mentioned was running the shift that morning along with me and one other barista during our morning peak hour. At this point I had been at the store for a few months, still had no brand standard training, no training on how to make coffees and was still unsure of how to make some of the cold drinks as the newbies were always put on dishes or tills. The BM had no management or direction to the shift and I ended up running back and forth between the cafe and DT to serve both sides whilst the BM ran around panicking about the Check. Needless to say, we failed miserably.  

When the new manager did start, they copy and pasted rotas for months at a time, listened to no one’s concerns, and were consistently late to their own shifts. We were then told that the AM had also promised this manager a promotion to a brand new store if they stepped in for us for a few months. By the time they left, the majority of baristas, including myself, were miserable with the situation they were in. The AM reassured us all that she had a new manager lined up already, who was going to be brilliant and for no one to leave the company. The AM had told the new manager that there were no issues with the store and everyone was completely trained etc. This new manager arrived, did four shifts, then left as they felt overwhelmed by the workload and environment.
In an emergency decision, the AM promoted a BM to practicing store manager under the guise that after two months they would then become permanent if the job was done well. 

Despite this, at the end of this time, the AM announced that she had hired a new store manager. This manager had twenty years experience in hospitality and was enthusiastic about the job. Fast forward two months and they’ve left the company, claiming that the work-life balance, issues with BMs, sicknesses etc in the store were too much. News of this manager quitting was announced on Monday. Once again, the AM assured everyone not to quit too as things were being sorted accordingly and were going to improve. This week alone, I lost nearly ten hours due to closing early, got my rota changed the morning of my shifts and got ripped into for having the nerve to complain about it, got told that the finishing time on the rota is not actually the finishing time but that we finish ‘when the store is ready for us to finish’,  had three days where there was only two people on shift during busy periods, got screamed at by frustrated customers, and got told they were still taking my break off my pay despite not having a break due to the staffing issue. One day, our tills would not log any staff on so we had to refuse service to customers for a few hours. The BM phoned and messaged the AM with no responses all afternoon. The following day the AM came into store and watched all the CCTV claiming that we were lying about what happened as we wanted early finishes. 

On top of this, at the beginning of the year we had rat sightings in the bin area. Further inspection found the rats were actually inside the walls and in the disabled toilet. We were told this was being handled properly. As I write this, the rats are still an issue, the disabled toilet has been ‘out of order’ for nearly eight months because of them, and not once has the store been closed to deal with this. Also, during the summer months two staff members were stung by wasps inside the store. Customers were complaining about them, with some being spotted crawling over the cakes.

Currently, due to having no longstanding manager, at least one person phones in sick on nearly every shift leading to two/three people running the store and DT. The AM refuses to allow closures of either to maximise profits, despite many bad reviews mentioning speed of service and staff numbers. The AM has also scolded BMs for not running the shop and DT alone when other staff have called in. 

Well, after this week, I’ve quit. I’ve read other posts on this Reddit with similar themes and I thought I would give you all my experience of Costa. I truly believe the issues have been started by the AM and have spiralled to the point where any new manager has simply too much to take on. On top of all this, I personally felt I could not give customers the level of service they were paying for, the store is always unclean, and the standard of drinks is sometimes unbelievable.

I guess I wrote this out because it’s still shocking to me that such a big company can be so badly run. And I know there’s still a lot that I haven’t even mentioned. But surely this cannot be the norm for Costa Coffee? I’ve been told since leaving to leave a review/contact hr etc but can anyone advise if this would just be ignored, which I imagine it would be…",1,1762689199.0,Costa,1,0.66,False

1oshg40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oshg40/my_bfhusband_of_three_years_emotionally_cheated/,My bf/husband of three years emotionally cheated on me,"Hi,

This is gonna be a long one but I'm honestly very thrown off and confused and this has never happened to me and I actually don't know what to do. 

I met my bf/husband over bumble in August 2022 and we spoke over text for two months before meeting up and immediately got very close. We talked all day everyday, I'm from Leeds and he was a student in Leicester. I worked and he was studying in uni so he would come see me every weekend and without fail until May 2023. In May, he officially moved in with me because his uni accommodation was done and we were so close and had been meeting up every week that we thought, it'd be better if we just stayed together.

During our relationship, I paid for everything, food, bills, rent, dates, basically all of it. He helped here and there but nothing more than £100 during that time. I asked him to get a job but he would always say ""I can only work twenty hours, fine i'll find a job ill look for one""but he never ended up finding a job.

In October, he told me his visa will expire in January and that he is looking for a work visa. At that time, there were a lot of changes happening with the visa requirements and he was ultimately not able to find a job. I asked him to look into a graduate visa because that would give him two years to find a job and we would not have to separate but his friend had told him that graduate visa rules have changed and that visa is no more so without researching he just took that ship and ran with it. 

So with all visas out of the way, we decided to get a spouse visa because that would be an easier option. In december we applied for our wedding application with the council, got checked and approved and in January, 10 days befor he left, we got married.

When he went back to his country, he said he'd take care of the visa and is working on getting the finance bit secured from his dad. I was getting paid £25k at that time and the visa requirements were due to change from £18k to £29k in April.

He did not tell me that he actually didnt get the finance bit ready because ""my dad said he'd take care of it"" and he kept this going even a week before the deadline. Now it's the night before and I'm stressed and he says his dad wasnt able to transfer to exchange the currency or such in time and we ultimately were unable to apply for the visa. This was a devastating time and I was extremely upset that he did not let me know about it because I wouldv'e tried to secure the application fee and such another way if he had just let me know. For the next few months after april 2024 life was sad. He was in his home country and I was in the UK but in June 2024, I got promoted, my salary went from £25k to £27k and then ultimately £28k in September 2024. 

This was a turn of events because it meant that if I worked overtime, we would be able to apply by Feb next year as the HO looks at 6 months of statements but due to my pay increasing little by little every month, I did overtime each month but then had to start over. Regardless, in May, we were ready to apply and we did, we applied but a day later he tells me he forgot to add a small visa detail. This is big because the HO assess spouse visa applications very diligently and any odd discrepency could result in a decline. So we decided to withdraw the application and reapply in April. The application had costed him £6k with priority and he had borrowed money from his family and even friends for it and we were now stuck as I didn't have any saved and the whole idea was that I meet the financial requirement and he gets the application finance sorted.

We were so close at this time but it felt hopeless. Then I decided to take a loan out, I took £8k loan out and decided to pay it over 5 years. We ended up applying and within a month the visa got accepted and my bf/husband was in the UK.

The reason I say bf/husband is because it didnt really feel like a marriage, because of how rushed it all was, we had decided that we will remarry at some point but do it properly like with the reception and all. 

Before he came to the uk, I had been telling him to apply for jobs before he gets here so he can just start working straight away as he had a big loan now and we needed to save for the visa 2 years later. He ofcourse said ""no ill get there and apply"" and so it began. My constant back and forth with him asking him to apply to jobs for months and he kept saying the same thing ""I am applying im not getting anywhere they dont get back to me"". The job market is harsh in the UK at the moment so I didnt feel like he was lying, he was actively applying. During this time he decided to help out a family ffriend with his only business and that guy paid him £600 per month at MOST and £300 per month otherwise. He continued to work for this guy and started to neglect his applications again.

At this point, I took it upon myself and I started applying for him, I remade his Cv multiple times, got him an interview at my own company which he failed and then kept applying until in October I was sick of it, I had asked him to contact agencies and ask if they had any warehouse jobs whilst he waited for an office job and he in June had said that when he called the agencies, they'd asked him to apply online. So in October 2025, I thought let me do it myself, I called a couple and found a job in a meat factory as a production operative with a good pay.

He started the job in November. Now this is the tricky part. We had for three years been playing a mobile game together and a few months ago we started playing with three girls exclusively. I had work so I only jumped on for a few games but him staying at home since May 2025, he was always playing on the phone. He started telling me about this girl who is a piercer in London and as someone who also has piercings he'd tell me ""if you want any more, we'll go to london for them"" and I thought, oh why not.

However, in mid October, he started spending a long time on his phone and for someone who does not have many friends, he was texting a lot. It felt weird because he'd also spend a lot of time in the kitchen smoking and when I'd go there, he'd say, ""don't come in you'll be sick"" because I didn't react well to the smoke. So I didn't think much of it until he was leaving to go smoke every 30 minutes. That felt wrong and i was worried and even thought of checking his phone whilst he slept once because we had each others codes but I thought better of it and it just didn't feel right.

But he was being secretive and turning do not disturb on when I was near him and so a week ago I sent him a message when he was at work. I said, ""hey dont cheat on me"" and I know you'd probably think why tf would you ask someone that but I felt that even if he was texting someone maybe this would wake him up and we'd never speak of it again because everyone makes mistakes. And he said ""no i love you id never do that to you"" but yesterday before he went to nottingham to see his friend, he wa listening to music on his phone whilst he got ready.

So I thought, hey let me change it to an upbeat song because it's saturday morning and he goes ""no put it on urs, im leaving"". I didn't think much of it because why would I connect my own phone to the speaker to put ONE song on when I can just change the song on his phone so I opened it and he had left the phone closed on a chat. It was the girl who was a piercer. I know that because it said ""Hannah the piercer"" as her insta id lollllll

I tried to read as much as I could but he snatched the phone off of me saying ""oh its just the girl we play with"" but essentially he had asked her what headphones she was using as he was looking to buy some. the next message was ""true you always look good"" then her sending a paragraph that I didnt get a chance to read and then her replying with ""No I dont but thank you"" when I asked him what he talked about with her he goes ""just random things"" but my heart had sank, it felt all wrong. How long had he been speaking to her for that he knew what she looked like? They had probably sent pictures of eachother to eachother enough times for him to say ""true you always look good"" and from there it was just excuses.

""Shes 35, why would I even go for her when I have you"" I asked him to leave because I was hysterically crying at this point. I told him dont delete any messages because I want to see them when hes back and he told me hed removed her and deleted all messages. Again, red flag. If that was me in his position and I was innocent, I would keep all messages and show them to my partner like ""here please understand its not what u think"" but him deleting all was crazy.

As we used to play games together, I logged on and asked hannah to give me her insta id and she did and i told her me and ren were dating and that I only wanna know what they spoke about because we've been together for 3 years. I am now £3500 in debt because I've been paying for both of us for almost a year and have been the breadwinner of the house as well as me having an £8k loan. I'm also married to this guy and his visa relies on me and she said that they had been talking for a month, they didnt send anything explicit but he had told her that he was in a relationship, theyd been talking about me reading romance novels and from there the conversation had gotten inappropriate about 5 times. She apologised and still wanted to be friends but said she was sad that he blocked her??? because she liked playing games with him.??? so clearly things had gotten way out of hand.

When he left he had messaged and said that of I think hes cheating, he doesnt care because he can't make me change  my mind? Thats what he said at first then he tried calling me over and over but I didnot want to talk to him over the phone about this. 

I was devastated, this only happened yesterday so I'm still really upset and so so confused. When he got back from nottingham yesterday, he brought back a ring and flowers? because I'd asked him for one because when we got married, I bought my own ring and then his ring too so I wanted a nice present from him. But I didnt accept it I asked him why he did it and he kept denying it saying he would never do anything to jealordise our relationship and that I can speak to her and confirm that it was platonic.

I told him that he had developed an emotional connection with her and had been keeping it from me for a month. If it had not been so secret, he would not have anything to hide and he said ""I didnt tell you because I knew you'd react like this"" Absolutely shitty excuse. He then said that when we had arguments, he spoke about it with her and asked for advice. We barely argued, the only time we did is when I was sick of him not looking for work, staying at home and not doing anything. He'd clean up the house and make food but he would not put effort in himself, he would stoo applying for jobs every week and when I had to remind him is when he'd do it again so it bothered me that he only did these important things when I asked him and reminded him to.

He had spoken to her about us and our arguments and said that she didnt send any pictures and that he did not know what she looked like but in the same breath would say that she sent her makeup pictures and asked me if it looked good. So he was scrambling for excuses and was backtracking a lot. It was clear they had exchanged pictures or in the least he had seen hers multiple times for him to tell her ""you always look good"" 

Now this sentence is also significant because Id had to remind him after our nights out that he hadnt complimented me and the fact that he did so to another girl so easily, was hurtful.

At the end of the day, he admitted that he wasn't thinking clearly, he didnt realise what he was doing but he doesnt want to lose me and that he loves me.

And maybe thats true but where was his love when he started a secret emotional relationship with someone else over the phone.

Now things are so complicated, I don't know what to do, I planned on living my life with him and growing old together but I just cant be with someone who disrespected me. He said hed never do it again but... ""Once a cheater... always a cheater... no?""

I'm very confused. I love him so much, I have no family in the UK because I ran away from home when I was 18 and I am only in touch with my mom who is in a different country and I dont know anyone here so he wa sa lifeline to me and even though, I carried the relationship on my back, I loved spending time with him. When I first met him, he used to wear skinny jeans and barely say two sentences irl but now hes talkative and dresses so well. I feel that all this effort I spent on him has all gone to waste and my dreams are crushed.

I had been asking him to move out constantly from May 2025 because I thought that's what he needed. When you're thrown into a situation where you know if you dont bring any money in, you'll starve, you have no choice but to find a job. You're not lazy, then. And him being dependent on me, was making him comfortable and too easy. I was paying for his transport, coffees lunches and brunches and dinners and everything so life was chill for him but that wouldve made him stand on his own two feet but he did  not move out, anytime we'd have this convo, he'd say ""no ill change ill look for a job"" and then nothing.

Now Im looking for an apartment because I know he's not gonna leave and all I need is some time away from him to think and figure out what I want to do. Has this ever happened to anyone? I am so stumped because I love him and am so attached and I genuinely dont think ill find anyone so caring again. Maybe he was meant to be a house husband? But i dont want a house husband, i want someone who would stand on their own feet and be reliable. Anyways, here I am. Do they ever change if they say they wont do it again? I also feel bad leaving because then it means his visa wont go ahead either but then again, he knew what he was doing when he did it and if he didnt think about it, why should I.

Edit: Idk if itll help but when he would get paid £300-£600, he would pay it towards my credit card debts that I didnt have before he came back to the uk in may 2025 so its not that hes never paid but only bits and pieces and we spent way more than that",2,1762689055.0,Advice,6,0.75,False

Tragically, it was a decision that cost him his life. 



.

Clues at the scene suggested that Jonathan had been tortured and killed by someone he trusted. 

There were no signs of forced entry and police found takeout containers and plates, still crusted with food, on a coffee table. Just inside the kitchen, Jonathan’s body, lay face down on the floor near a chair. Duct tape around his wrists and ankles suggested he’d been bound to the chair and tortured by his unknown killer. 

“I remember the slash cut marks to the right side of the neck and they had a pattern like a serrated knife, like a steak knife,” recalled Butcher, a former medicolegal death investigator for The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner. “Just deep enough to hurt like hell without killing him.”

Jonathan also suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head, just under his earlobe, and a post-mortem stab wound to the chest.

Jonathan’s wallet was still in the apartment, but it was missing his ATM card and any cash that may once have been inside.

“Could this have been a robbery gone wrong? A fight among friends?” Butcher asked. “But why the torture? This tells me that there was probably something much bigger at stake, something more personal, but what?”

It was a tragic end for a man who had been adored by his students and coworkers.

Jonathan’s parents had divorced when he was 4, but he remained close to his famous father, who was considered one of the most wealthy and powerful men in the city at the time.

Jonathan briefly considered following in his father’s footsteps and entered the business world after college, but it was never the right fit.

“He didn’t want to live the executive life or be in the business world,” NYPD Homicide Detective Darryl Hayes explained. “His calling was to become a teacher. He was a teacher at William Taft High School, which was located in the Bronx and what we found out during the course of speaking with the faculty and students was that he was a beloved teacher. Everybody had nothing but nice things to say about him.” 

That included girlfriend and fellow teacher Clotilde “Cleo” Tejada, who came with a coworker to  check on Jonathan on June 2 after he failed to show up to work that day. When they were unable to get inside, they called police, who found Jonathan’s decomposing body.

“It was terrible,” Tejada recalled. “It was something like never in my worst nightmares I would think of.”

Crime scene techs dusted the apartment for prints and recovered a serrated knife covered in dried blood that looked as though it had been used to deliver the superficial wounds to Jonathan’s neck. 

Police also began talking to those closest to Jonathan to see whether anyone may have wanted to hurt him—but it was a clue on his answering machine that would change the course of the investigation.

“When detectives played the answering machine tape what they found, along with all of the messages from the concerned teachers, was a message from someone named Corey saying ‘Mr. Levin, pick up,’” said Manhattan Assistant District Attorney KJ Dell’Antonia, describing the voice as someone “young.”

Detectives learned the call had been placed at a pay phone near Central Park, but there were no longer any usable prints on the phone. However, authorities did find a print on the duct tape used to restrain Levin. It matched to Corey Arthur, a former student at William Taft High School with a criminal record for drug-related offenses.

“He was somebody that Jonathan had really felt a connection with and really was trying to help,” Dell’Antonia said. “Other teachers and people around him described them as close.”

A manhunt was launched to find Arthur. A tipster led them to the home of Arthur’s aunt, who handed them over a bag of bloody clothes Arthur had been wearing the night of the murder, but his whereabouts were still unknown.

At the same time, investigators learned that Jonathan’s ATM card had been used the night of his death to withdraw $800, but the man captured in the surveillance video was too short and stocky to be Arthur.  

As NYPD Det. Sgt. Timothy Horohoe noted, “We now have two dangerous suspects that would need to be found.”

Another call on the tip line pointed them to Montoun Hart, a man with past robbery arrests. 

Hart agreed to talk to detectives and admitted to being there the night Jonathan was killed as part of a robbery attempt, but insisted he didn’t know Arthur planned to kill the teacher. He told detectives that after tying Jonathan up and threatening him with the knife to get his pin number, he went to the bank. When he returned, he found Arthur holding a gun to Jonathan’s head.

“Jonathan cried out ‘Corey why are you doing this to me?’” Butcher said. “He was so unable to understand why this kid who loved and cared for and who loved and cared for him would do this to him.”

Five days after Jonathan’s body was discovered in his apartment, Arthur was tracked down and taken into custody.

Although both men went on trial, only Arthur was found guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to 25 years to life behind bars. Hart was acquitted.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

My mom lost her job a few months prior and while she's trying to get by my tuition feels like a dead weight sometimes. My dad doesn't know my mom is without a job and we're planning to keep that way since he doesn't know how to keep stuff between family.. and another reason is because she feels ashamed to tell anyone that she is without a job. 

In August, I have reached out to my dad to ask him if he can chip in some money to help me pay for my tuition, he is a surgeon that has 30ish years of experience and I know money isn't an issue for him. However I have been hit with the classic refusal "" No son, I can't help you money is tight"", also mentioning that he sent me pocket change to put it lightly for my birthday which can barely cover 2 textbooks.. Another excuse of his was: ""I'm helping you as much as I am able to"". Just his usual classic bs answer everytime I need help with something he has used for years. After that little back and forth with him saying "" i want to see your results first"" i didn't want to push further and I just said ""Thanks for showing me how much you believe in me and where I stand on your priority list."" I went 4 weeks no contact with him. After that he has made some small groupchat between my sister, him and I to play the concerned father asking us how is school, how is life etc etc. I gave him very short one word answers because if you don't invest you don't get feedback on how it's performing. All of this feels more like im asking for a business loan instead of my dad helping me when I need him the most. Following this event after few initial weeks of no contact he has texted my mom ""Tell him to cut his bullshit and that I'm helping him as much as I can."" My mom has unterstood my POV as he has been an asshole towards her aswell and I have continuted my contact up until now.

Few years back, he has never took my sister and I to a vacation, barely puts together 48 hours to see us and even if we do see him it's all 3 of us on the phone him arguing with his parents about politics or spilled coffee, it has reached a point where I'm honestly very unmotivated to keep contact with any of them as he also the same father who has missed my concerts, my highschool graduation, meanwhile my mom has been doing everything to provide for my sister and I to keep doing what we love and to spend as much time together.

Few days ago after this long anecdote he has sent my mom some money  so she could take us to a pizza. I'm feeling a certain kind of guilt now where I'm drawn between ""he is my father"" and ""i need to keep my dignity"".

## Why Thoughtful Corporate Gifting Matters More Than Ever

In a digital world, a tangible, well-chosen gift stands out. It’s a physical touchpoint that reinforces your professional relationships in a way an email never could.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

*   **Strengthens Client Relationships:** A great gift keeps your brand top-of-mind and shows clients you see them as more than just a line item on a spreadsheet. It fosters loyalty and can be the deciding factor when it's time to renew a contract.
*   **Boosts Employee Morale & Retention:** After a long year, employees want to feel seen and appreciated. A meaningful gift is a powerful form of recognition that boosts morale, contributes to a positive company culture, and shows you're invested in their well-being.
*   **Builds Brand Ambassadors:** When you give a gift that people love, they talk about it. Your employees and clients become walking testimonials for your brand's generosity and thoughtfulness.

## First Things First: The Gifting Strategy

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

Before you even browse a single catalog, a solid strategy will save you time, money, and ensure your gifts hit the mark.

### ### Know Your Audience (Clients vs. Employees)

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

This is the golden rule. The gift you give a key client might be vastly different from what you give your entire team.

*   **For Clients:** Focus on gifts that reflect professionalism, quality, and an understanding of their business or personal tastes. The goal is to impress and build rapport.
*   **For Employees:** Focus on appreciation, wellness, and fun. The goal is to show you care about them as individuals, not just as workers.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

### Set a Budget (And Stick to It)

Determine a clear budget for each category (e.g., Tier 1 Clients, Tier 2 Clients, All Employees). This prevents overspending and ensures fairness. Remember, thoughtfulness trumps price tag every time.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

### Timing is Everything

Don't be the company that sends a gift on December 23rd. Plan to have your gifts delivered by early to mid-December. This gives them time to be enjoyed during the holiday season and shows you're organized, not rushed.

Sometimes the best gift isn't a thing, but a memory.

*   **Gift Cards for Experiences:** A voucher for a nice dinner at a local restaurant, tickets to a concert or sporting event, or a certificate for a wine-tasting tour.
*   **Subscription Services:** A 3 or 6-month subscription to a service like MasterClass, a premium streaming service, or a specialty coffee or wine club.

*   **A Charitable Donation in Their Name:** Make a donation to a charity of their choice. This is a powerful way to show you support their values.

> **Pro-Tip:** The ultimate employee gift is often non-material. Consider giving everyone an **extra paid day off** to use during the holiday season. It costs the company relatively little but is priceless to an employee.

## What to Avoid: Common Corporate Gifting Pitfalls

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=corporate%20holiday%20gifts)

To ensure your efforts are well-received, steer clear of these common mistakes.

*   **Anything Overtly Cheap or Flimsy:** This reflects poorly on your brand. If you can't afford a quality item, opt for a smaller, more thoughtful one instead.
*   **The ""Logo Slap"":** Avoid plastering your logo all over everything. A subtle brand touch is fine, but the gift should feel like it's for *them*, not just a walking advertisement for you.
*   **Gifts That Create Work:** Avoid complex kits, plants that require expert care, or anything that feels like a chore.
*   **Overly Personal Items:** Avoid gifts like clothing (sizing is a nightmare), perfume/cologne (scent is subjective), or anything that could be misinterpreted.
*   **Ignoring Dietary Restrictions:** For any food-related gifts, ensure you offer options for common allergies or dietary preferences (gluten-free, vegan, etc.).

1osh4ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1osh4ea/caffeine_content_listed_on_drinks/,Caffeine content listed on drinks?,"I've never really paid much attention to it for the longest time, but I remember a few years ago there was something on the news about listing caffeine content on drinks. Recently I've become more concerned with the amount of caffeine that I'm consuming, and trying to transition from coffee, which is strong, to tea, which is milder. The only thing is, when I look at the caffeine content on drinks at 7-11 and such, almost EVERY drink has 20mg/100ml listed.

I can only find 2 teas that have a higher content listed, and there are a few coffees that list higher also, but actually, most coffees and teas have 20mg/100ml.

Is this just a joke, or just to fulfil some technical requirement. Even coca cola, and pepsi have it listed as 20mg/100ml. And I even noticed that chocolate milk has the same.

What's the story here, is there something I'm missing or is this a mass scale ""茶不多"" situation",1,1762687931.0,taiwan,3,1.0,False

1osh2uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1osh2uz/the_binding_part_1/,The Binding - Part 1,"I'm 27 years old and I live with my mom.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. My mom knows too—she reminds me every few days, usually when she's doing laundry or making dinner for one and realizing she has to make enough for two. ""You need to get a job, honey."" ""Have you applied anywhere today?"" ""You can't just stay in your room all day.""

But I do. I stay in my room all day.

It started after I got laid off. That was eight months ago. I told myself I'd take a week to decompress, then start applying places. The week became two weeks. Two weeks became a month. And somewhere in there, I fell into a rhythm that's hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it.

I'd wake up around noon. Make some coffee. Sit at my computer. And I'd just... browse. Reddit, Twitter, art sites. Hours would disappear. I wasn't looking for anything specific at first, just letting the algorithm pull me deeper into whatever rabbit hole felt interesting that day.

That's how I found the art community.

I'm not going to pretend I'm some misunderstood intellectual about it. It was anthropomorphic character art—furry art, if we're being honest. The art was good, sometimes incredible. The characters felt more alive than anything in my actual life. I started saving images. Then I started seeking out specific artists. Then specific characters.

That's when I found Red.

She was a fox character. Sleek, beautiful, with dark red fur and these piercing amber eyes. The artist who created her had this way of drawing her that made her feel real. Like she was looking back at you through the screen. Like she knew you were watching.

I made a folder for her. Then another. I'd spend hours just cycling through images, commissioning art when I could scrape together some money, searching for every scrap of content featuring her.

The thing is, Red felt more real to me than job applications. More real than my mom's disappointed looks. More real than my only friend texting me to hang out and me making excuses because I didn't want to leave my room.

I know how pathetic that sounds. I'm writing it down and I can see it clearly.

But that's where I was two weeks ago. That's who I was.

And then she appeared in my room.

It was 2 AM on a Tuesday.

I'd been at my computer for six hours, maybe more. I lose track of time easily. My room was dark except for the monitor glow. I had my headphones on, some ambient music playing to drown out the silence.

I saw movement in the corner of my eye.

At first I thought it was my mom, checking if I was still awake. But the movement was wrong—too fluid, too low to the ground.

I turned my head slowly.

Red was standing in the corner of my room.

Not a picture of Red. Not a hallucination or a dream or a screen reflection. Red. Physically present. Three-dimensional. Real.

She was perfect. Exactly like the art, but impossibly more. Her fur looked soft and real, catching the light from my monitor. Her amber eyes were fixed on me, unblinking.

My brain couldn't process it.

I thought maybe I was having some kind of breakdown. I thought maybe I'd fallen asleep at my desk. I thought maybe I was having a stroke.

But she didn't disappear. She just stood there, watching me.

I took off my headphones slowly. The movement seemed to interest her. Her head tilted slightly, fox-like and curious.

""You're not real,"" I whispered.

She smiled. It wasn't quite a human smile—her muzzle couldn't form that expression right. But I knew it was a smile.

Then she moved closer.

Each step was fluid and wrong. Not the way a person walks. Not even the way an animal moves. Something in between, something my brain kept rejecting as impossible.

But she kept coming closer.

I should have run. I should have screamed. I should have done literally anything except what I did.

I reached out toward her.

She closed the distance between us in one smooth motion.

Up close, she smelled like something I couldn't identify. Not perfume. Something animal. Something that made my head swim.

Her paw touched my chest gently. The fur was impossibly soft. She was real. She was real.

And then her mouth opened.

It stretched wider than it should have been able to. Too wide. The ambient light caught rows of teeth that were too sharp, too many.

She bit into my shoulder.

The pain was instant and overwhelming, but it wasn't just pain. There was something else—a feeling like electricity, like something was being injected into me through the wound. I felt it enter my bloodstream, felt it worm its way toward my brain like a parasite finding a host.

I couldn't scream. Couldn't move. Could only stand there as she held me.

When she finally pulled back, she looked at me with those amber eyes—and there was intelligence there. Awareness. Hunger.

Then she smiled again.

And vanished.

Not slowly. Not a fadeout. Just—gone. One moment she was there, the next the corner of my room was empty.

I collapsed onto my bed, my shoulder screaming with pain, my whole body shaking.

The bite mark was real. I could feel it, hot and wet.

I passed out somewhere around 3 AM.

I woke up at noon the next day with my mom pounding on my door.

""You alive in there?""

""Yeah,"" I croaked. My throat was dry. My shoulder was on fire.

""There's coffee downstairs. And you need to do laundry, your hamper is overflowing.""

I heard her footsteps retreat down the hallway.

I sat up slowly, touching my shoulder. The bite was there—two crescents of deep punctures, angry and red. It was real. She had been real.

The next few days were a blur.

I didn't leave my room except to use the bathroom. I couldn't eat; my stomach would twist into knots at the thought of food. I couldn't sleep—every time I closed my eyes, I saw her. Felt her teeth on my shoulder. Smelled that animal musk.

By day three, I realized what was happening to me.

I needed to see her again.

Not wanted. Needed. The way you need air or water. It was physical, a crawling sensation under my skin, an itch I couldn't scratch. My hands shook. I couldn't focus on anything else. Every thought circled back to Red.

Where had she gone? Would she come back? How could I make her come back?

That's what I started calling it in my head: the Itch. Capital I. Because it was more than discomfort—it was a need, a craving that made every other desire I'd ever felt seem insignificant.

I needed to understand what had happened to me.

It was day five since the bite when I started going through old computer files.

I thought if I could find the first image of Red I'd ever saved, I could trace it back. Find the original artist. Maybe contact them. Maybe understand where she'd come from.

I headed to the garage and started digging through the pile of old desktops and laptops I'd stored away.

I was three folders deep into an unlabeled directory on one of the older machines when I found something I didn't recognize.

A folder titled ""PRIVATE - DO NOT OPEN.""

It wasn't mine. The file dates were all wrong—the oldest went back over a decade. I'd only been into this art for about a year and a half.

I opened it.

Inside were dozens of image files. Digital sketches. All anthropomorphic character art.

All drawn by the same hand.

My mother's hand. I recognized her style immediately—she used to do illustrations for children's books back when I was a kid, before the divorce, before she got the office job she hates.

But these weren't children's book illustrations.

They were character designs. Dozens of them. Wolves, rabbits, dragons, all in various outfits and poses. Some were innocent enough—character studies, expression sheets. Others were more suggestive.

And one character appeared over and over again.

A pig character. Massive, hulking, grotesque. Not stylized or cute like some furry art tries to be. This thing looked wrong. Too-human eyes in a too-animal face. Thick, muscular body crammed into clothes that didn't quite fit.

My mom had labeled the file ""Piggy.psd.""

I clicked through the sketches, my stomach twisting.

The early drawings were rough, experimental. But they got more detailed as I went chronologically. More specific. More real.

And there were notes written in the margins. Text layers she'd left visible.

""He came to me in a dream last night.""

""Can't stop thinking about his eyes.""

""The itch is worse when I don't draw him.""

""He feels so real now. Almost solid.""

""My hands hurt but I have to keep drawing. He wants me to draw him.""

The last file was dated three days ago. The drawing showed Piggy in perfect, photorealistic detail. Every bristle of fur. Every wrinkle in his snout. Every stain on his shirt.

At the bottom, in small text: ""Tonight. He's coming tonight.""

I sat back from the computer, my heart hammering.

My mom was experiencing the same thing I was.

""THOSE ARE PRIVATE!""

I'd been so absorbed in the files that I hadn't heard my mom come into the garage. She was standing in the doorway, face pale, eyes wide with panic.

I spun around. ""What are these?""

""Give me the computer. Now.""

""You've been drawing these for years?"" I was still trying to process it.

""You don't understand—"" She moved toward me, hands out like she was approaching a wild animal.

""I saw one!"" The words burst out of me. ""Red. She was in my room. She was real.""

My mom froze.

Her eyes went to my shoulder. I was wearing a tank top—the bite mark was visible, the scars already silvery despite being less than a week old.

""No,"" she whispered. ""No no no, you didn't—""

""She bit me. Right here. She was real and she bit me and now I can't stop thinking about her and I—""

""YOU LET ONE MARK YOU?"" Her voice cracked into a scream.

I stood up, knocking my chair back. ""Let her? I didn't LET her do anything! She just appeared and—""

""Do you know what you've DONE?"" She was crying now, tears streaming down her face. ""Do you have ANY idea what that means?""

""Then explain it to me!"" I shouted. ""Explain what the fuck is happening!""

She grabbed my shoulders. ""Just stop. Stop looking into this. Stop trying to find her again.""

""Just tell me!"" I yelled. ""What is Piggy?""

All the color drained from her face. She slapped me—hard. The crack echoed in the garage.

""Get out,"" she said quietly.

""Mom—""

""GET OUT! Get out of my house! You don't understand anything!""

She was sobbing now, backing away from me like I'd threatened her.

I grabbed my jacket and my phone and left.

Dave's house was twenty minutes away by bus.

He answered the door in sweatpants and a t-shirt with cartoon dinosaurs on it—his daughter's favorite show. ""Holy shit, man. You look like hell.""

""Can I crash here tonight?""

""Yeah, of course. You okay?""

""Not really.""

His wife Amy was putting their kids to bed. The house smelled like dinner—real food, home cooked, not the microwave meals and takeout that comprised my entire diet. There were toys scattered across the living room floor. Pictures on the walls. A life that felt impossibly distant from mine.

Dave set me up on their couch with blankets and a pillow. ""You want to talk about it?""

""Not really,"" I said again.

He nodded. ""I'm here if you change your mind. Bathroom's down the hall if you need it.""

After he went upstairs, I lay on the couch in the dark, listening to the sounds of a normal household settling in for the night. Footsteps above me. Muffled voices. A kid laughing at something. The hum of the refrigerator.

Dave had his shit together. He'd always been the responsible one, even in high school. Job at an insurance company, married at 23, kids by 25.

Lying there in his living room, surrounded by evidence of his actual adult life, I felt like a child.

No. Worse than a child. At least children have potential. I was just... stuck. Frozen. Twenty-seven years old and nothing to show for it except a hard drive full of character art and a bite mark from something that shouldn't exist.

The Itch was getting worse. I could feel it crawling under my skin. The need to see her again. Touch her again. Feel her presence.

Around 2 AM, I gave up trying to sleep.

I had to go home.

The house was dark when I got back.

All the lights were off, which was weird—my mom usually left the porch light on at least. I used my key to let myself in quietly.

The living room was empty. Kitchen dark. Everything silent.

My mom's bedroom door was open.

It was never open. She was weirdly private about her room, always kept the door closed and locked. Even when I was a kid, her bedroom was off-limits.

But now it was open, and there was a strange light coming from inside. Not electric light. Something else. Something that pulsed softly, like a heartbeat.

I approached slowly, my heart hammering.

I could hear sounds. Breathing. Something that might have been words but came out strangled and wrong.

I reached the doorway and looked inside.

My mom was on the floor.

Piggy was there.

Not a drawing. Not a fantasy. There. Real and solid and massive, exactly like the sketches but worse because he was three-dimensional, because the smell of him filled the room—something rotten and sweet and wrong.

My mom was pressed against him, her face against his chest. Her eyes were rolled back in her head, unfocused and glassy. She was making small sounds, like someone in the grip of a fever dream.

Piggy's head was tilted back. His eyes were closed. One hoof-hand rested on my mom's head almost tenderly.

He was feeding on her. On her need, her addiction, her obsession.

And she was feeding on him right back.

Something in me snapped.

I don't remember running to the hallway closet. Don't remember grabbing the baseball bat we kept there for home defense. Don't remember crossing back to her bedroom.

I just remember swinging.

The bat connected with Piggy's shoulder with a sickening thud.

He squealed—a horrific sound, half-pig, half-human—and released my mom. She crumpled to the ground, her trance unbroken.

Piggy turned to face me.

His eyes were fully aware now. Intelligent. And angry.

I swung again.

The bat cracked into his ribs. He staggered but stayed upright, reaching for me with those terrible hoof-hands.

I backed up and swung a third time. This blow caught him across the snout. Dark blood sprayed, viscous and wrong.

He squealed again, louder. Trying to reach past me, toward my mom, like she could protect him.

I didn't let him.

I lost count of how many times I hit him. Each impact sent jarring vibrations up my arms. His sounds grew weaker. His movements slower.

Finally, he collapsed.

I stood over him, bat raised, breathing hard.

Then his body began to change.

The solid form seemed to lose cohesion. His fur dissolved into wisps of dark smoke. He was unraveling, becoming translucent, thinning out like morning fog.

Within seconds, he was gone. All that remained was a dark stain on the carpet and a smell like ozone and burned hair.

I dropped the bat.

My mom was making sounds now. Coming out of the trance. She blinked, looked around, confused.

Then her eyes found the stain.

""Where's Piggy?"" Her voice was small. Childlike. ""Where is he?""

I couldn't speak.

""WHERE IS HE?"" She was on her feet now, looking around frantically. ""What did you do? WHAT DID YOU DO?""

""I killed it,"" I managed. ""I killed that thing.""

The sound she made wasn't human. It was grief and terror and rage all mixed together.

""You don't understand. You don't UNDERSTAND what you've done.""

She grabbed my arm, nails digging in. ""We're bound to them. When we create them, obsess over them, give them that much of ourselves—part of us goes into them. Part of them stays in us.""

""What does that mean?""

""When they die—""

She couldn't finish. She doubled over with a coughing fit that sounded wrong, wet and painful.

When she straightened up, there was blood on her lips.

""Mom—""

Another coughing fit, more violent. She was bringing up blood, dark and thick.

""What happens?"" I grabbed her shoulders. ""Mom, what happens when they die?""

She looked at me, eyes wide with terror.

""I don't know. No one I've talked to online has ever... everyone says don't kill them. NEVER kill them. The binding goes both ways.""

Her legs gave out. I caught her before she hit the floor.

""I can feel it,"" she whispered. ""Something's wrong. Inside me. Like something's missing. Like part of me is gone.""

She passed out in my arms.

I called 911. Now I'm waiting in the ER hallway, staring at the closed door they took her through. I have no idea what to tell them when they come out.

The Itch is still there. Worse now, actually. A constant, staticky buzz under my skin and deep in my brain.

I've been searching online, desperate for answers. I've found a few obscure message boards where people talk about this phenomenon. They call them Tulpas. Egregores. Thoughtforms. Entities that are created through obsessive focus and mental energy.

And everyone says the same thing: Never kill them. The binding goes both ways. Creator and creation. Maker and monster.

1osh2pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1osh2pu/m25_i_screwed_up_with_my_crush_f22_and_i_dont/,M25 I screwed up with my crush F22 and I don't know if I can fix what I had built with her.,"Hello everyone. Unfortunately, I have never posted on Reddit nor have I ever written down any of my thoughts in general, and I hope I can be as descriptive as possible, as if you were in my position. I thank anyone who reads this post and can somehow give me a hand.

I'm an incel guy who is attending his last year of nursing school along with F22, for whom I have literally had a crush on lately, and I'll explain how it all happened.

In the first year, I wasn't interested in her, but every now and then, when the chance arose during coffee breaks, I enjoyed talking to her. In the second year, halfway through the first semester's lessons, so November 2024, she started talking and texting me when she needed notes, and she would also send me hearts or various emojis that suggested something. After an exam in the February 2025 session, we had both failed the same subject, and she came up to me for a hug to comfort her, but it ended there until we met purely by chance: I was going home heartbroken, and she was just as heartbroken as me while waiting for the bus. I stopped to talk to her for about 20 minutes, and she invited me to grab a coffee, which I accepted. From there, we told each other everything about our personal stuff for more than an hour, only to stop hearing from each other until the second semester's lessons resumed (March 2025). From then on, we would exchange glances during lessons (I was sitting far back in the row while she was among the first 3), and we would text almost every day about how our studying was going because we were retaking the same exam that we had failed in April. We joked and laughed together, and sometimes we video-called to study when we could, but I still didn't feel anything for her, and I was doing things purely out of kindness and altruism, which is just how I am.

I started thinking about her when, during the internship in July, I was sending things on IG, to which she would reply immediately, and we messaged until we discovered we were both on the night shift. She asked me if I wanted to grab a coffee at the vending machines, and I happily accepted. We were in a hallway that connected the two blocks of the hospital. While we were confiding in each other about our things, she came up next to me and, on her own initiative, was constantly seeking physical contact, and we were even arm in arm for nearly half an hour. When we said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the arm. At the time, I thought ""wtf,"" but then I thought about that moment all night. We were supposed to see each other at the end of the shift, but, due to my usual bad luck, an emergency came up just as I was supposed to clock out, so I had to stay late. We messaged as usual, and after a few weeks, we met up again for breakfast, but nothing particularly special happened then.

More weeks passed, and we messaged as usual, until I was home alone and I asked her if she wanted to come over for a drink. She accepted, I picked her up, and we spent a nice hour talking. At a certain point, her mom called my crush, and that's where the panic started, as she is Moroccan, and her parents are quite strict, she was hastily finding any excuse to stall the call while I was taking her back home. I got back home and found a message from her saying that she had sorted everything out during my trip back, and, being the gentleman that I am, I decided to go pick her up again to spend even more time together. From there, during the trip home (again), she showered me with compliments until, once we got inside the house (yet another time), she practically leaned into me, and we cuddled, became fond of each other, and confided even more than ever before (I know some of you might say I could have 'dipped the wick' or something, but I wanted something honest, and it wasn't something I truly wanted, also because I'm a kissless virgin, so...). While I was taking her back home, she told me how special I am to her, and vice versa, and how kind I had been to her and that I was different from other guys. We even took a picture in the mirror, hugging. I returned home and saw her message saying she had a wonderful evening.

We resumed lessons for our third and final year on October 6th, and we started taking the same bus, even though it would be more convenient for me to take others than hers, but I did it to spend more time with her. She would rest her head on my shoulder, I would stroke her hair, and if something was wrong, I comforted her as best as I could.

Now we get to my screw-up. On October 31st, we had 2 hours of lessons that I could have easily skipped and stayed home for, but she wanted to go, so I followed her. She suggested that I sit in the front row next to her because a girl who usually sat there wasn't present. I was a bit hesitant, but in the end, I went. We joked, I teased her, and did all that in front of the professor as if we were alone, until I wrote in the group chat I have with some girls which are university friends that I was sitting in the front row. One of them jokingly replied that I couldn't stand them anymore anyway, so it was better if I stayed in the front. But, being the idiot that I am, I replied with the exact words: ""*It's temporary anyway; you are better than these geese*"". My friend replied that they were the best but downplayed the others. I showed it to my crush to take it lightly, but she took it differently; she started avoiding me and wouldn't speak to me at all,  I sent her a message right away, but she blocked me. During the break, as I was about to re-enter the classroom, I saw her in the restrooms and genuinely apologized and told her I was sorry for having hurt her, even though I truly didn't mean to after everything we had built, and then she told me she had unblocked me. When I got home, I sent her a voice note with more apologies, the best I could do, and meanwhile, I was feeling terrible, constantly thinking about the mistake I made and other anxieties. After several hours, she replied that she forgave me and that we would resume as if nothing had happened, but she clarified that she wasn't angry, just bummed out/disappointed. I didn't text her over the weekend because she was at her cousin's, and I didn't want to bother her, but she had replied a few days later to a message I had written her on the same day as my blunder.

On Monday, November 3rd, I text her as usual to wake her up because we were taking the bus. She missed it, and came in a little late, but I noticed she wasn't looking at me like before or texting me during the lessons. I text her to ask if we were going back together because sometimes her sister picked her up for the return trip, but she replied that she wasn't coming back because she was going to a bar with her university friend who sits next to her. At the time, I didn't have any problems, but gradually, my bad thoughts started to kick in, like: ""What if that interest between us is gone, if it was ever there?"" ""Is it really a past memory?"" My thoughts started to become more concrete when I asked her if she was going to the same class the next day, and she replied that she was going for breakfast. I then asked if she was going with anyone or if she was going alone, and that I would keep her company. She jokingly (as she said) said she was going alone, but then she texted me that if I wanted, I could go with her, and that's what I did.

On Tuesday the 4th, I give her the usual ""good morning"" to wake her up, I take the bus, we arrive at her stop, I make her sit by the window as always, but I notice she was a bit troubled, that she no longer rested her head on me, that she no longer let me stroke her hair, and she replied to messages without really paying attention to me. I really started to worry about this in my mind, but fortunately, breakfast went more or less well (I had ordered a cream croissant, which she doesn't like and had even told me before I ordered -\_-), obviously paid for by me. We go to class, and there it's the same thing: no glances and no messages like before. The next day, we managed to have an pre-dinner drink/snack organized by her, along with a guy and a girl from our course (the invited girl was texting the guy, who is also engaged), only then two more people joined. We went to the bar, and everything was fine until she didn't sit next to me, and this created some anxiety for me. In fact, it was a bit awkward because only 2-3 people were talking while I only spoke occasionally. After about an hour and a half, we decided to leave, and I decided to pay for her drink instead of her, but she got angry, so consequently, I didn't do it, but I felt a sense of fear of losing her inside me. I get home and see that she calls me to ask what was wrong with me because she had noticed a certain degree of discomfort in me, but at the moment, I wasn't able to truly tell her what I thought about all of this.

After all this, the situation has remained unchanged. On the bus, she doesn't let me touch her, and when she talks, she seems a bit muted. When I send her things on IG, she doesn't reply as she did before, and the same goes for WhatsApp. In addition, when I got home on Friday, Frank Ocean's ""White Ferrari"" came on shuffle, and I'm not lying when I say I cried because of the mess I, the idiot, made.

This weekend, I haven't texted her at all since she's at her cousin's , who lives about an hour away from where we live and also, so I can think a bit about what to do.

I was thinking of maybe, when I meet her again on the bus on Thursday, asking her if she'd like to go out after class and telling her exactly what I think and what I truly feel for her, or even simply asking her to video-call to study tomorrow (Monday) as soon as she gets home, and then telling her everything.

As I'm writing this, I feel more than destroyed; I'm literally disintegrated, and I truly don't want to lose what we've created together, I really don't. Anything is welcome, even insults, because that's what I deserve.

Thank you very much to anyone who reads this long post and can also give me a hand (and a pack of filterless red Marlboros).

* tl;dr: I have a crush on a classmate (F22). We built a special bond: we supported each other, we hugged, we spent hours talking, we grew fond of each other. Then, I made a stupid comment that made her feel terrible, and she's shut me out ever since. I don't know if there was something real between us, or if it was just friendship. Now she doesn't reply to me on IG and WhatsApp like she used to, she doesn't lean on me on the bus anymore, and I'm devastated.

Here's what I'm thinking. Please let me know what you think. We rely on public transport. This trip would last around 14-16 days.

*Fly to Munich. 3 days in Munich. 
We would go to Bayern's FC arena (my son is a fan). Science museum. Beer garden. Should we go to Neuschwanstein Castle also? Is it accessible by public transport? (No ""getyourguide"" tours. Too expensive for my taste).

*Train from Munich to Ljubljana, Slovenia. 2 days. Mainly to chill, have coffee, wine taking pictures.

*Bus or train from Ljubljana to Split, Croatia. Have a week of beach fun : swimming, snorkeling, little cruises to islands (Hvar must be fun for teens). Still unsure if Split should be our base for the week. I do also quite like what I see from Omis. 

*Train from Split to Zurich, Switzerland. 2 days in Zurich ? I'm not in love with what I see from this city (pictures online) but direct flights from this city to Montreal are frequent. For different reasons we need a direct flight from/to Montreal (which is why we arrive in Munich even if Croatia is our main focus).

1osgzwk,https://i.redd.it/6exrjpevu70g1.jpeg,(1800s Kurdish coffee is now revived) Chicorée au Kurde – A Taste of Kurdish Heritage and Strength,"Did you know that in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a unique coffee substitute called Chicorée au Kurde was exported from the Kurdish-majority region of south-eastern Anatolia?

Unlike regular coffee, it was made from the fruits of the turpentine/terebinth tree (in Kurdish, qazwan / kizwan).
	
• In France, it was marketed under the name “Chicorée au Kurde” by the French company Etablissements Marcel Godard (near Cambrai) from the mid-1800s until around 1930.
	
• The drink is naturally caffeine-free (or very low in caffeine) as it uses roasted terebinth fruit rather than coffee beans.
	
• Recently, in March 2025, the trademark in France was officially registered to recognise it as a Kurdish heritage product.

But this drink was more than just a beverage. Its branding often featured images of Kurdish warriors, symbolising the strength, bravery and resilience of the Kurdish people. Just like the warriors who defended their lands and culture, Chicorée au Kurde represented endurance, vitality and pride.

Every cup told a story of a people who resisted erasure, preserved their heritage, and faced challenges with courage. In this way, this simple drink captured the Kurdish warrior spirit – a reminder that strength and identity can thrive even in the smallest, everyday things.",14,1762687481.0,kurdistan,5,0.94,False

1osgxtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1osgxtk/compounding_effect_of_consumption/,Compounding Effect of Consumption,"The idea of compounding is often explained with money — small interest gains that snowball into wealth over time. But in reality, the same rule applies to habits, health, mindset, and relationships.

Losing control in life rarely happens in one big moment. It usually happens slowly, through small choices that compound day after day — until the damage becomes visible.

It often starts innocently: eating out a few times, watching short videos a little longer, deciding to sleep late, skipping the gym once or twice. Repeated over time, these choices compound into fatigue, pain, lack of focus, and low motivation.

# The Bad

Consumption isn’t just about food or drinks. It’s everything we allow into our lives. Over time, those little inputs quietly become who we are.

* Consume junk food → loss of control over body, sleep, and confidence.
* Consume endless videos → loss of control over focus and mind.
* Consume the comfort zone → growth stops, progress reverses.
* Consume bad energy from people → spirit breaks, energy drains.
* Consume negativity → perspective rots, motivation fades.
* Consume self improvement books and not take action → nothing changes, only time slips away.

…and it’s all connected together. They don’t just add up — they compound.

* Skip one workout → the next skip becomes easier → months pass with no exercise.
* One night of poor sleep → next day sugar cravings, low focus, laziness → cycle continues.
* One “just 10 minutes” of scrolling → turns into hours → brain normalizes distraction.

Small decisions don’t stay small. They echo, amplify, and compound until they reshape an entire life.



# The Good

The compounding effect can also work in the opposite direction — building strength, clarity, and growth. A single positive input can trigger a chain reaction:

* One healthy meal → improves sleep and energy → better focus → stronger performance at work.
* One page of journaling → clears the head → clarity improves decisions → better decisions create a better life.
* One workout → boosts energy → energy lifts mood → mood improves social life → social life builds confidence.
* One small win → builds belief → belief fuels bigger action → action compounds into momentum.
* One hour of focused work → completes a task → reduced stress → freed mental energy for bigger goals.

The compounding effect never stops working. The only question is: will it work for you, or against you?

  
The Solution

The compounding effect can work for you, but only if you start somewhere. The hardest part isn’t doing it perfectly — it’s simply beginning. Big change never starts with big steps. It starts small, then grows.

Here are a few simple ways to make the shift:

* Check your foundation → Before building habits, check your body’s basics. A simple vitamin and blood test can reveal deficiencies that silently drain your physical, mental, and emotional energy. Fixing those first often makes everything else easier.
* Move your body → Regular physical activity, even a short walk or stretching, resets energy levels, improves mood, and strengthens discipline. You don’t need to start with heavy workouts — consistency matters more than intensity.
* Start tiny → Choose one habit that feels almost too small to fail. One push-up, one paragraph, one glass of water. Small wins create momentum.
* Protect your attention → What you consume mentally compounds just like food does. Choose carefully — fewer empty scrolls, more time with people or content that lifts you up.
* Track what matters → A notebook, an app, or even a calendar on the wall. Checking off progress each day gives a sense of direction and proof that you’re moving forward.
* Link habits to routines → Attach a new action to something you already do. While making your morning coffee, read one page. When you sit at your desk, write down the first task of the day.
* Celebrate progress → Don’t wait for big results. Every checkmark, every day you follow through, is already compounding.

The key isn’t to try fixing everything at once. Pick one place to start, be consistent, and let time do the work. Compounding will take care of the rest.

# Final Thought

What we consume today quietly shapes who we become tomorrow. The inputs may look small, but over time they create the entire trajectory of life.

Every bite, every scroll, every skipped workout, every late night — they don’t vanish. They build upon each other, for better or worse. The same is true for every page read, every habit tracked, every hour of focused work.

Life is always compounding. The question isn’t whether it’s happening — the question is: in which direction is it taking you?

It’s been a quiet stretch lately, and I’ve been realizing how much I miss having someone to talk to. Not small talk or forced conversations, but someone I can genuinely connect with. Someone who’s there through the day, someone I can share thoughts with, and someone who feels like a steady presence.

I’m not in a rush for anything. I just want real conversations with someone who’s easy to talk to and naturally fits into my life. If it turns into something meaningful over time, good. If it becomes a solid friendship, that’s good too.

About me. I’m grounded, calm, and straightforward. I like people who think deeply and speak honestly. I’m spiritual in my own way, influenced by psychedelics and philosophies like stoicism. Coffee is basically my morning ritual, and most evenings I wind down with music or a good show. Lately I’ve been diving back into the things that actually make me feel centered.

I’m looking for someone who’s kind, thoughtful, and comfortable being themselves. Someone who can handle a mix of serious conversations and quiet teasing. Someone warm, nurturing, steady.

I still always get up around now. I’m not sure if you do or not, but it rubbed off onto my family. 6:10. 

I’m usually up a little earlier, but I set the coffee for then, my youngest grinds it. I only buy whole coffee beans now and grind them myself. I picked it up from someone I met at my brother in law’s bachelor party. I bought coffee from a company he started. I was praying for him and it to go well for him. He was one of the guys who seemed to talk about life the same with me when I couldn’t talk to you the first time. He unfriended me later because I didn’t give a fuck about Charlie Kirk. The day before he unfriended me he texted me “I love you, brother.” 

I’m grateful for the beans, if nothing else. I’m glad that rubbed onto me too. I love the smell of fresh coffee in the morning, not pre ground stuff. 

Anyway, I’m up and thinking about you as my little men are getting into their day. I hope you have the best Sunday. I’m praying for you and as I said, I look at that time and my new life, these new surroundings, but my mind goes to you and the memories we shared in them. 

I love you.

1osgl3u,https://wahidazal66.substack.com/p/bahaism-as-a-western-soft-power-replacement,Bahāʾism as a Western Soft-Power Replacement Theology,"Although now declining in significance, over the last century Bahāʾism managed to gain significant visibility in Western intellectual and interfaith circles despite being numerically small and historically marginal. At first glance, this seems improbable. Why would a 19th-century Iranian messianic offshoot gain more traction among Western elites than, say, Sufism, Shi’ism, or the writings of major Islamic philosophers like Ibn ʿArabī or Suhrawardī? The answer becomes clearer when one examines what Bahāʾism offers, not to the masses, but to power structures: It functions as a soft-power replacement theology—an Islam-like structure stripped of Islam’s politically and metaphysically challenging elements. Bahāʾism presents:

* A Prophet → but no clergy
* A Scripture → but no *sharīʿa*
* A Call to World Unity → but **never to resistance**
* A Global Brotherhood → but one administered top-down by centralized councils
* Spirituality → **without metaphysical rigor**
* Mysticism → **without annihilative intensity**

In other words: Bahāʾism is like an Islam declawed. A monotheism pre-adapted for polite society. It preserves the optics and aesthetics of prophetic religion while quietly neutralizing its revolutionary core. In this sense, Bahāʾism operates as a “managed substitute”—spirituality engineered to be non-threatening, infinitely agreeable, and structurally obedient. It is, in effect, universalism without teeth, but one which specifically serves Western colonial and neocolonial agendas.

**Historical Evidence of Elite Facilitation and Post-Revolution Iran, Media Framing as “Good vs. Bad Islam,” and Bahā’ī as Managed Antidote to Islam**

Critics often shy away from asking the obvious question: Did Bahāʾism spread organically in the West — or was its growth quietly facilitated? A survey of historical patterns suggests the latter is far more likely. Early recognition by imperial and globalist institutions is one such glaring example:

* The World Parliament of Religions—one of the first bodies to officially acknowledge Bahāʾism.
* Peace and Federation Societies funded by Carnegie and Rockefeller networks repeatedly platformed Bahāʾīs as “model world citizens.”

What message does such recognition send? Simple: *“If you must adopt an Eastern faith—take this one. It causes no trouble.”*

After 1979, Western governments and media began constructing a neat dichotomy: *“Bad Iranians”/“Good Iranians”; Shi’a revolutionaries/Bahā’ī minority; Resistance theology/Global unity theology; Political Islam/ Post-religious spirituality*. Bahā’īs were platformed as *model dissidents* to Islam—not because of their suffering alone, but because their theology perfectly served a broader narrative amd agenda: “Religion is fine—as long as it stops demanding sovereignty and cooperates exclusively with Western power centers.” Out of this there is a pattern repeatedly reported by former members across the US, Canada, and Europe: *Those leaving Islam are guided toward Bahā’ī as a “safe” spiritual alternative—Islam without law, without resistance, without intensity.* This is not random. It is socially engineered.

The uncomfortable truth is this: Bahāʾism functions—whether by design or by historical convenience—as a Western-approved substitute for Islam. A pacified monotheism, engineered to appease both liberal universalists and global governance advocates. A spiritual placebo offered in place of the disruptive metaphysical fire that true revelation brings. If Islam is a flame, Bahāʾism is incense—pleasant to smell, safe to burn indoors, and guaranteed never to set off alarms.

**The Bayān as Revolutionary Fire—Not a Prelude to Politeness**

Now, the common Bahāʾī narrative claims that the Bābī movement “naturally evolved” into Bahāʾu’llāh’s universalist ethic—that the fiery Bayān was simply an immature chrysalis awaiting its enlightened fulfillment. This narrative is historically false. The *Bayān* was not a prototype of liberal harmony. It was a *volcanic* text—apocalyptic in tone, mathematical in structure, antinomian in social implication. Its insistence on lettrist cosmology, radical succession doctrine, and conditional theophanic warfare made it fundamentally incompatible with imperial order. It was *too intense to be tolerated*. It could not be allowed to spread—except under sedation. This is precisely what happened during Bahāʾu’llāh’s Baghdad period (1852–63).

According to Siyyid Miqdād Nabavī-Razavī’s unpublished Master’s thesis (*tārīkh-i firqa-i Bābīyah dar Baghdād az 1268 tā 1280*, Shahid Beheshti University, 1392/2013), the Baghdad years were not a quiet mystical retreat. They were a strategic repositioning process. While Ṣubḥ-i-Azal remained the *silent, legally designated successor*—supported by the Witnesses of the Bayān who were explicitly tasked with safeguarding the Bayānic law—Bahāʾu’llāh began quietly cultivating cross-factional prestige. Credible sources cited by Nabavī describe how Bahāʾu’llāh would visit coffee houses daily, presenting a different persona to each group: *“with the Sufi, a Sufi; with the Shīʿa, a Shīʿa; with the Nusayrī, a Nusayrī…”* while “his own creed remained hidden.” This is not mysticism. This is political positioning.

Furthermore, as his activities in Baghdad began resembling more and more an organized crime syndicate (bribing and blackmailing local officials and dignitaries alike), Bahāʾu’llāh’s residence in Baghdad became a refuge from Ottoman state prosecution, such that *“no one had the power to touch him.”* When clerics and consular authorities wanted to act against the Bābīs, Bahāʾu’llāh’s personal protection made him the safest focal point — and therefore, over time, the most convenient authority to negotiate with. This was the birth of a containment strategy against the Bābīs through the manipulated charisma of Bahāʾu’llāh.

**Enter the Foreign Handlers**

But Nabavī-Razavī preserves a far more revealing fact—one rarely discussed openly in Bahāʾī historiography: Mirza Malkom Khān (d. 1908), founder of the Farāmūsh-khāna (the first Iranian Freemasonic lodge) and Mankji Limjī Hataria (d. 1890), a Parsi agent tied to British colonial networks, both made contact with Bahāʾu’llāh in Baghdad.

After the dissolution of the Farāmūsh-khāna in 1861 CE, Malkom Khān was expelled from Iran and “went to Baghdad, seeking to align with the Bābīs there.” One Azalī testimony quoted by Nabavī recounts Bahāʾu’llāh’s own reaction to this visit: *“This man’s coming to us is a great opening… let us not drive him away, but by subtle means draw him toward ourselves.”* Even Saʿīd Nafīsī, cited by Nabavī, admits openly that the earliest force to align with the Freemasons were “among some of the supporters of the Bāb.” In other words: Baghdad was the exact moment where revolutionary Bābism and British-aligned reformism entered active negotiation through the hands of Bahāʾu’llāh.

Shortly after these encounters, Bahāʾu’llāh’s rhetoric shifted. His writings—formerly Bayānī in tone — began to promote “unity,” “obedience,” and the replacement of revolution with administration. He ceased condemning state structures and instead began presenting his movement as a model of civilizational reconciliation. This was not theological progress. It was strategic pacification. Meanwhile, Ṣubḥ-i-Azal and the Witnesses—the legal guardians of the Bayān—continued insisting on fidelity to the original, intense covenantal Bayānic structure. Their insistence on succession, textual integrity, ritual secrecy, and metaphysical discipline was now painted as “obstruction.” In short, those who defended fire were cast as divisive—those who tamed it and aligned with the West as enlightened.

**Bahāʾism as Managed Theophany**

As such, the Bāb’s revelation was not *fulfilled* by Bahāʾu’llāh. It was neutralized, reformatted, and exported. Bahāʾism emerged not as the next rung of heaven, but as the empire-friendly branch of revelation—a *salvageable remnant* once the volcanic core of Bayānī fire became too ungovernable. The evidence preserved by Nabavī-Razavī—far from proving continuity—documents a theological *coup* carried out under the watchful eye of imperial diplomatic handlers. That is not evolution.

I’m Sissi from **Lost Lantern Studio**, currently working on my first game release: **Night Errand**.

Ever since getting back into gaming, I’ve been drawn to visual novels, detective stories, and everything narrative-driven. So, I finally decided to channel all that love into my own project.

Check out the trailer here: [Trailer](https://youtu.be/_Hp106mNh4E)

**Night Errand** is a detective visual novel where you switch between two characters: Sage and Nur, who run a small-town detective agency / coffee shop.  
When crime resurfaces in their quiet community of Morrow Pines, the two are forced to confront their latest case and their own fractured partnership.

* **Sage**: a jaded detective who keeps everyone at arm’s length after the end of a messy relationship to her former partner.
* **Nur**: an empathetic monster who feels too much for their own good.

At its core, *Night Errand* is about the **e**volving relationship between these two unlikely detectives — and how players navigate their biases while solving the case. You’ll explore Morrow Pines, meet its odd residents, and “rethink” evidence through small mixing minigames that lead you down different thought paths and conclusions.

In three chapters you will get to investigate three different cases that took place in the small town. 

Right now I hope to make a demo available to the public in January and am amining for a release late 2026 or early 2027 :)

Trip Report for Wangxiangu.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**NOTE: PHOTOS ATTACHED TO THIS POST IS OF WANGXIANGU ONLY.**

**WANGXIANGU / Wangxian Valley Town = 2 nights, but you only need 1 full day / night or less here….

My Fenghuang hotel booked a taxi for me to get to the train station and I caught the **8:28am 5hr train from Fenghuanggucheng to Shangrao train station for $110 AUD including the Trip.com booking fee; it was a 2nd class seat.** Then, my Shangrao home-stay picked me up and I carpooled with other people for 35 yuan, one way. Its an hour long drive to **Wangxiangu Zhonglou Homestay where I stayed for 2 nights = $78 AUD, booked on Trip.com.** It was a simple cute cat themed room with everything that I needed as a solo traveller: queen bed, projection screen with USB port to watch my own movies and TV shows, private wet bathroom with sit-down western toilet, breakfast not provided which was fine as there’s plenty of restaurants and some convenience stores around the block. Many foreigners stay here, check the reviews. Its family run. You communicate with the home-stay owners via WeChat to organise the pick-up and drop-off to Shangrao train station and if you don’t want to carpool, you can book a private transfer or just catch a taxi, or DiDi.

By the time I checked-in to my home-stay, it was nearly 3:30pm. I was really tired and sleepy (first time in 3 weeks travelling around China), so I decided to rest and relax for the rest of the day (my first rest day too). I sorted out my suitcase and dropped off **a big bag of laundry to the home-stay owners for a wash and dry, free service.** I only snacked on the long train ride so I went for a proper meal in one of the local restaurants: I ordered steamed rice, stir-fried bitter melon with beef and a spicy fried tofu dish which were all huge servings (enough to feed 3 adults): total cost 88 yuan and it was an excellent home-cooked, hearty meal. Then I wandered around the area near the hotel: it was peaceful yet interesting walk to see the local town life, buildings etc. I dropped by a convenience store and stocked up on snacks and drinks before heading back to my home-stay for some TV time. I fell asleep not long after...

The next day, the home-stay owners **dropped me off around 10am at the main entrance to Wangxiangu. They also picked me up before 9pm at the same spot. This was a free service with the home-stay and its only 5-10min drive, each way. I spent nearly 11hrs inside Wangxiangu scenic area** and it was the perfect amount of time for me – I saw everything! I took my time and I had time to relax: like sit down for 15min (a few times) to rest my feet, take 1000s of photos, snack breaks, a 45min lunch and dinner meal, go souvenir shopping, etc. **I felt like I was the only person visiting Wangxiangu during the day: it was like I had the whole place to myself and I actually enjoyed it a lot more, than at night. Most people seem to visit Wangxiangu from 5pm onwards, as people come for dinner, then explore and stay til late (opens 9am and closes 11pm?). Many Chinese bus tour groups drop by in the late afternoon and you can see them all walk through when you’re up in the famous White Crane Cliff Tower and looking down into the valley.**

**From what I saw on social media, Wangxiangu seemed a lot bigger and more spectacular than it is in reality, for me, at night. I was quite disappointed with the night lights. Now, I don’t regret visiting Wangxiangu as I wouldn’t have known if I enjoyed it or not – you need to see, do, experience everything yourself, right? I just wouldn’t come here again. I came to Wangxiangu as it was ‘on the way’ with my other stops towards Shanghai. If I had to choose, I would rather go to Fenghuang again.**

**If you want to visit Wangxiangu, my suggestion is to only visit if 1: its on the way to / from your destinations, 2: if you have the time and 3: if you can wander around during the day here as well. If you’re only coming to Wangxiangu at night for the lights and you’ve already been to places like Furong and Fenghuang, I think you will be disappointed, like me.**

**If you really want to visit Wangxiangu and have limited time, you can see the main highlights in half a day. I recommend to arrive at your Wangxiangu accommodation by 4pm and head over, have dinner and explore til late.**

**There was also a lot of construction work happening while I was here. I think they’re building more hotels and adding more tourist attractions, viewpoints and walkways in the valley... so maybe in another 10 years, it will be a better place to visit?**

Anyways, there are two ways or directions to explore Wangxiangu: I started from the east side of the valley and headed over to the west side later, but you can start from west side and head to the east side instead. **NOTE: I couldn’t find a map with all the attractions and landmarks listed to share on Reddit. Every map was different and highlights specific places of interest. When you’re researching for the best walking route, you will also come across many suggestions and various names for the places inside Wangxiangu which makes it really confusing. I’ve tried to note here where I visited with their Chinese / pinyin / English names... hope it helps!**

**I bought an entry ticket at the main office in the Visitors Centre / East Entrance 入口. You need your passport and can pay with cash or via Alipay and WeChat.** There’s a toilet block, a few shops including a convenience store and a Luckin Coffee (yay!). I grabbed x2 takeaway drinks and entered a manned gate by scanning the QR code on the paper ticket. **NOTE: Your ticket is for a one-time entry (you cannot leave and re-enter on the same day, you will have to buy another ticket to re-enter on the same day) unless you’re staying at the hotel inside the scenic area.**

**After you get your ticket scanned, you will walk into a big concrete square area with a convenience store on your far left side, (what looks like) an enclosed children’s playground called Little Fairy Paradise or Xianrou Amusement Park on various maps?, a wooden pigeon house and a hanfu (traditional outfit) renting boutique.** On the right side is a **big long red Qingyun Bridge 青云桥**. I walked over this bridge and followed the footpath to **The Camping Area**, which includes an entertainment block (I think theres a VR reality experience and arcade inside, I didn’t check it out), a souvenir shop (unstaffed but they have cameras and when you’re in there, someone will then ‘appear’ to serve you!), an outdoor seating area with a live music type stage, couple of food trucks and picnic tables, etc. It was empty – there were no other visitors here at all, so I just walked through…

I believe the walkway from the Camping Area is called **Xunxian Road 寻仙路** and it leads you to **the Waterfall Group: Sanqing Waterfall 三叠瀑, Guanyin Waterfall 观音瀑 and Rainbow Waterfall 彩虹瀑.** They weren’t big or long waterfalls – well, not like what you see in photos, or maybe it was the time of year that I visited and there was less water streaming down? Regardless, it was a pleasant stroll around here as you’re surrounded by trees, birds chirping and cicadas chatting away – you will feel like you’re in nature but with concrete footpaths and stairs to climb (see photo 2 attached, this area is nice to visit)! I chose to walk around here first, the east side, so I could also admire **Baihe Cliff 白鹤崖 with the White Crane Cliff Tower** from the opposite side (west side).

After you pass the three waterfalls, you will reach **Sankouyguo or Three Neck Pot / Three Kettle Holes** which is a three-fork bridge walkway above the stream (see photo 3 attached) and where **people can go rafting** below. (I didn’t see anyone go rafting til about 3pm and you can hear their screams and laughter echo through the valley!) As you wander along the edge of the cliff, on your left side, there’s a **flat concrete bridge with wooden hand rails covered in red ribbons (I think its called Caihong Bridge?)**. I crossed this bridge and entered **a small resting area with some food stalls, fresh fruit drink vendors, souvenir stores, etc**. I bought a few red ribbons and a lucky-pouch shaped wooden plaque, wrote my name on them and tied it to one of the bridge wooden hand rails facing the entrance of the valley. This is the only area in Wangxiangu with red ribbons (see photo 4 attached as reference). I crossed the same bridge again and continued walking along the east side of the valley until I came to **a wooden covered bridge with round windows (I think its called Lanyue Bridge?).** This is a great stop as you get wonderful views of Baihe Cliff with the White Crane Cliff Tower (see first photo attached).**

From this wooden covered bridge with round windows, you can venture into the town area or continue along the east side of the valley where you will encounter more bridges (see photo 6 attached for another bridge). **FYI: There’s x7 bridges in Wangxiangu and you can walk across them all: Qingyun Bridge 青云桥, Caihong Bridge 彩虹桥, Zuixian Bridge 醉仙桥, Wuyang Bridge 五洋桥, Lanyue Bridge 揽月桥, Bai Ge or Bai He Bridge 百舸桥, and Changkong Bridge 长空桥 but I did see some articles mention other bridges such as Lang Bridge 廊桥. NOTE: Some bridges have English names such as Joy Bridge, White Crane Bridge, and Sky Bridge on maps instead of their Chinese names too. So confusing, right?** Eventually, you will come to **Bar Street** which consists of a toilet block, several restaurants and cafes – its a well decorated and colourful area but it was empty when I got here… I’m guessing it would be packed and really noisy at night! **NOTE: when you are in Bar Street, on your right side and above you, is Yunhai Cliff 云海崖 & Cloud Palace云上仙宫, which you cannot see until you’re on the other side (west side) and in the ancient town area looking across the river. Also, you cannot climb Yunhai Cliff or visit Cloud Palace: even though they are real buildings, supposedly, its only for show, a display, and very pretty when its lit up at night.** I wanted to explore up there but the locals said, no! Awww, but I read on some travel blogger sites that they were able to walk up there? If anyone has been, please let me know!

**Around 12:15pm, I arrived at the end of Wangxiangu scenic area – where Changkong bridge aka Sky Bridge is located and its the last bridge you can cross over to the west side of the valley**. There’s also a toilet block here, the entrance to the rafting experience (if you choose to raft, the ride will end pass the Visitors Centre / East Entrance) and a small entry/exit point of the scenic area (compared to the East Entrance point). I was getting hungry now so I sat down and tried some **crossing the bridge noodle soup for 35 yuan in a restaurant** with a view of Yunhai Cliff & Cloud Palace. It was a hot soup dish, nothing strange, weird or different from any other tom-yum flavoured type soup (as a comparison). Near this strip of restaurants, is a convenience store and I grabbed a **Cultural Heritage Ice Cream on a stick for 25 yuan: spirulina blue sea salt, cheese, peach & mango flavour – thats what it says on the box!** (see photo 19 as reference and yes I got it for the image and the taste was mild, light, mostly sugar really).

I strolled along **Workshop Street 作坊街, Ming Chang Alley or Mingchan Lane 鸣蝉巷, Yanjing Ancient Street 岩铺老街**, and stopped in every store for a few minutes. It was great shopping with no crowds or queues! There’s some nice souvenirs you can buy in Wangxiangu like huge colourful art filled painted umbrellas (wish I had suitcase space for it or more hands to carry one back home), ceramic tea-ware, jewellery, wooden and bamboo crafted items, lucky cat figurines, hand-dyed clothes and scarves, plus the usual keyrings and magnets, etc. I bought a canvas tote bag for 25 yuan as my Wangxiangu souvenir because I liked the crane birds and ancient Chinese architecture art on it.

One of the highlights of my visit in Wangxiangu was the **Wansan Shushe Cultural Art Museum**. Its free to enter and the exhibition held was about the academies in the Jiangxi province throughout various dynasties; the development of writing tools such as the brush with its numerous types of animal hair; how black and coloured ink are made from the East compared to the West; the importance and value of ink grinding stones; the use of bamboo scrolls and creation of paper over the centuries – notably the 72 steps in producing Lianshi paper; and how technology arrived and changed our way of communicating and recording information. I spent about 45min wandering through these halls. There was a lot of English translation so it was really enjoyable reading and learning about all this, plus the building had air-con which was awesome! It was around 38 degrees today.

At 2pm, I walked down **a flight of zig-zag stairs** to **an Indigo blue hand-dyed textile clothing store, a garden and outdoor seating area with s cute pavilion that gave great views of Yunhai Cliff and Cloud Palace, a small rock stage area for skit type performances, and several lantern filled narrow footpaths** that lead back up to the main streets of the ancient town… The ancient **Yang’s Mansion 望仙杨府 or 杨员外府** (a big creme coloured brick and grey concrete building with traditional Chinese architecture entrance) was closed. Bugger! Next door, on its left side, is the big, wide **Lantern Alley** which gets packed at night when all the lanterns are lit up. Opposite is the **Theatre Stage Square 戏台广场 with a Juxian Stage 聚仙戏台: a huge outdoor digital stage** (it screens the daily show schedule but was so hard to read: the writing is small and it flips through sessions quickly – hard to take clear photos), and the **Bonfire Party 篝火晚会** is held here around 8pm, depending what time is gets dark.

Other points of interest in the ancient town area include: **Fu Clan Family Courtyard 胡氏宗祠, Yanpu Market 岩铺街市, Baiwei Food Street 百味街, Craft Market 作坊街, Yangfu Rock Plaza 岩铺广场, Cenming Alley 蝉鸣巷, Shuo Wang Street 朔望 and Zuo Fang Street 作坊街, plus Sandei Springs (three-layer cascading water pond) which is next to the Hu Clan Family Ancestral Hall 望仙杨府 that holds the 30min Han People’s Marriage Performance at 3:30pm** (highly recommend, I watched it and they throw candy at you at the end haha). **A 5min walk uphill from here and you can visit the Three Gods Temple 三神庙 before you climb several flights of stairs to reach Baihe Cliff 白鹤崖, aka White Crane Cliff Tower and Chaohe Tower 朝鹤楼 for the best panoramic view of Wangxiangu.** At the top, there’s no seats or seating area. You have to stand or keep walking around up here and theres no cafe or place to buy drinks, so bring a bottle of water or something to keep yourself hydrated from the workout. There’s a tiny art exhibit with English translation about The Legend of Yunhai Cliff in the final room. I went up here twice: around 4:30pm and stopped at several different balconies along the way until I made it to the highest point, and then I revisited again at 7:30pm for the night lights.

Dinner was at 6pm in a restaurant in between the hotel and the Three Gods Temple. The outdoor balcony seating area had a gorgeous view of the ancient town, Yunhai Cliff and Cloud Palace. I ate a **cold beef wrapped rice noodle dish (I didn’t like it) with steamed rice and a bottle of Fanta for 88 yuan.** I went back down into the ancient town area and watched **four girls dressed in hanfu play various traditional Chinese musical instruments on a balcony in front of the Sandei Springs** and this is when it started to get really crowded. I grabbed a fruity flavoured iced milk tea for 20 yuan in one of the streets and made my way back to the Sky Bridge to wait for the night lights... **At 6:45pm, Wangxiangu changed to the famous image you see on social media: all the night lights were turned on; red lanterns lit, street lamps were glowing, fairy type lights were sparkling everywhere.** I started going through the ancient town area and took photos along the way…

After I visited the Baihe Cliff with the White Crane Cliff Tower, for the second time, I hopped down several staircases and turned right towards the **50-metre long Glass Walkway 玻璃栈道** (no special red slippers needed or extra cost to walk here). It was dark now so I couldn’t see through the glass below me... The **red lanterns hanging over Sankouyguo like a bridge** is particularly eye-catching as it connects the east and west sides of the valley – you will stop to take many photos of this! **To get to the exit, you will walk through the 388-metre long Cliffside Waterfall Walkway 悬崖栈道 which offers great views of the valley and takes you to the Lei Mu Bridge 雷木桥**: a unique z-shaped bridge (which you need to stop walking, turn around to see). Follow the crowd and you will see the long red Qinyung Bridge again ahead of you, on the left side… you will eventually find yourself back at the **big concrete square area with a convenience store on your far left side, (what looks like) an enclosed children’s playground called Little Fairy Paradise or Xianrou Amusement Park on various maps?, a wooden pigeon house and a hanfu (traditional outfit) renting boutique.** From this area, its about another 10min walk to get out of Wangxiangu as you need to go through a different route and gate with some shops before you get to the car-park and main road where taxis, or DiDis, are waiting to take you back to your accommodation. I got to the meeting point – where my home-stay owners picked me up, around 8:45pm. I didn’t stay for the Bonfire Party as I’ve been walking around in the sun and heat all day, I really wanted a cold shower and I needed to get up early the next morning...

**Below are some walking routes that I found online: I’ve copied and paste them so you can see they are all similar but different. I recommend when you arrive, just go where you want! You cannot get lost here as all the pathways weave into one another and its easy to distinguish where you’ve been and where you should go next, because every part of Wangxiangu is unique, its layout and design is not repetitive.**

1osgbo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1osgbo3/do_unis_offer_social_skill_lessons_i_cant_find/,Do unis offer social skill lessons? I can’t find anything online,"I was wondering whether there was a way to get social skill lessons through uni - whether through DSA or uni itself. Or if anyone has any tips that would be appreciated.

I’m a late diagnosed autistic (and it’s literally the worst thing a person could possibly be). I work hard at uni and try to be kind to everyone. But it’s near enough impossible to make and maintain friendships. And people are my friend for a while, but where I’m missing social cues, or sometimes say weird stuff without realising people end up hating me.

So general rules I’ve sussed.

- don’t ask lecturer questions, because people get annoyed because they want to get home.

- at least leave 3 seats between you and people you don’t know in lecture halls (unless they’re your friend then you can sit next to them)

- if there’s a group of people who loudly announce they’re in a rush for a lecture in the coffee queue - let then go infront of you (bc that’s what they’re hinting at)

- always ask if you can sit on a table with someone in a seminar - because they might have friends coming and might not want you to sit there.

- let others choose their parts in group projects first, as opposed to doing the bit you’d enjoy.

- don’t mention if people have forgot something in there work if they ask you to proof read , because it’s upsetting for them.


There’s obviously a lot I’m missing.
But it’s very important I get better at masking at uni.

Thanks in advance 
Hope everyone has a lovely day

TLDR: I have to choose between getting back with ex or continuing pursuing a new relationship with someone I met a few months ago

Full story: about 6-7 months ago my LT GF (F29) and I M(27) broke up after 3 years. It was a mutual and civilised break up caused by the fact that she was set on getting children very soon while I personally don’t want kids at all. Other than that, it was a great relationship, love of my life sort of territory and I had plans to propose in the coming years.

Fast forward 6 months, I met this new girl. We hit things off immediately and after an intense getting to know each other period of around 4 weeks (she also doesn’t want kids), we started dating. It’s now been 2 months so still pretty fresh and obviously still in the honey moon period but also in the process of building a proper relationship.

Here comes the crux: my ex reached out a few weeks ago asking to chat. Since we left things on good terms, I agreed (the new girl was in the know too in case it matters). 

So we meet for coffee and she tells me that she regrets breaking up and she’d rather be with me and have no kids than be with someone else who’s not “the love of her life” but wants to have kids. I told her that I’ve been seeing someone else recently and this is quite a lot to take in and that I need to think about it. 

So here I am thinking about it and asking the community for thoughts and advice. 

I do find the thought of getting back together and “turning back time” minus the kids issue very appealing. We had worked so hard on that relationship, had dreams and plans for the future and it would be nice to pick those back up where we left things off. But I’m also conscious that things might not be the same anymore once we get back. Especially since I’ve recently gotten to know this new person and I also really really like her and could see a future with her. But there’s obviously more uncertainty and risk to that because we’ve just been getting to know each other.
