I talk with several women in my MBA who are mostly within 21-26 age range but there is this luxurious mall in our city where there are many foreigners who are expats here because of the IT(tech) industry here. So far I have initiated conversation with 8 such expat women who were all within 20-35 age range. My most recent one was just 2 days ago inside a Coffee Shop of this mall who is from Ukraine and she is most definitely in her late 20s to early 30s and she was really friendly and we had a decent conversation and even asked her name too but I was hesitant to connect further on social media.

Similarly met an Australian woman there who was somewhere in her 30s and was strolling around in the mall couple of weeks ago but as usual didn't ask her socials. Also met a woman from Luxembourg there who looked in the 27-30 age range but she mentioned her husband so she is married. Then almost a month ago, I also met this expat woman who is studying Law in our city and is in her final year and she is 20 year old and was dressing and we had a good conversation but as usual I didn't have the courage to ask her socials as I was worried that she might feel uncomfortable. Then 2 months ago, I talked with this German woman in the coffee shop too was about 28-30 too and we had a decent conversation and so did I with a 29 year old American woman 4 months ago but as usual I either forget or don't feel confident enough to ask them their social media. The American woman is the only one to whom I asked her Instagram but she said she doesn't use Instagram.

Because of this we aren't able to connect further. How can I ask them for their Instagram without making them uncomfortable or creeped out?",1,1733933101.0,OlderGenZ,3,1.0,False

Inlaws family christmas
So long story, but (I think) worth the read.

Preface: my husband doesn't care one way or another about many things. I'm usually the Megaphone if something needs said, he usually lets it go. Or asks that I let it go.

Last Christmas I said nothing. But than things were said to other people in the family about me so I had to say something this year.

Anyways,

My sister in law, we'll call her Jan, started talking about Christmas in September. I mentioned that with cost of items, it's just really getting expensive to buy every single person a gift from every single person in the family. Besides, we don't really ""need"" anything unless someone wants to pay a bill. In addition, his parents just downsized to a trailer and sold their two story house, they don't want anything.

I asked if we could just do a small gift exchange instead of buying every single person in our family gifts. Everyone agreed. So we decided to do the ""Bad Santa"" Gift Exchange, where everyone buys a $20-25 gift and people draw numbers and can steal from each other.

Everyone agreed. Well, about 6 weeks go by and we are into November. We receive a text from the group that Jan's husband, we'll call him Dave for story sake suggests that we do a name exchange gift exchange. I asked, oh so you want to do that instead of the ""Bad Santa?""

No he wants to do that in addition to the Bad Santa. So, that makes my family of four go from 4 presents to 8, all around $20-25. I said oh, well we were hoping to keep the cost down this year. But if everyone wants to do that, I guess we can try to make due.

Everyone else wants to do it. My husband never said anything because he didn't care either way. (He didn't realize how much we spend at Christmas, this is my fault. He knows now how much it actually is...when this year I ordered $300 worth of gifts for all the gift exchanges our family is in. We should have discussed finances better, maybe he would have piped up.)

Anyways, so Thanksgiving comes around and we draw names. Everyone was told to put suggestions of items on their name card in case someone had no idea what to get them.

We do the name draw. Both of my kids get Dave and Dave's son who is 23, we'll call him Sam. On Dave's list is a hunting knife and beer, on Sam's list is Angry Orchard which is also alcohol and some gas cards. In addition, my Sister in law Jan, found out I had my Father in law for the gift exchange and announced to everyone left in the room that she already bought a perfect gift for her dad so I needed to trade. Umm what? Okay I guess. Because she announced it to everyone. I ended up getting Jillian, Sam's girlfriend. My husband got My sister in law Jan.

Now I love buying gifts, don't get me wrong! But, for all of these people, I ended up picking out the gifts and running them past my kids and my husband to see if they agreed. They all agreed so we bought them.

We packaged them up. And came to Christmas.

So we go ahead and do the Gift exchange where we drew names first.

Ugh. I hate even typing this because it makes me so mad!

We are not giving alcohol as Christmas presents especially from my kids. Just...no.

So I bought a ""Hunting Knife"", mind you, we don't hunt. But what I found is a good hunting knife is $75 or more. Umm no. So I found a knife on Amazon with a leather handle, a leather knife holder to snap to your belt and it was engraved with a feather. It was super sharp and pretty. It alone cost $25, I felt bad just getting that so I also bought a coffee Thermos in the shape of a bullet.

First of all, we sit down to do the gift exchange. And Dave yells at me to get out of his seat, that's where he always sits. Sorry, how am I supposed to know?! Second time ever being invited to your house. And you could have been a little nicer instead of treating me like a child. Of course, no one else hears this!

When my son handed it to Dave, he opened it and said ""What kind of Hunting knife is this?"" And then proceeded to open the rest and said ""I already have a coffee thermos, this wasn't on my list, why did you buy this? I don't know what kind of hunting you expect me to do with this?""

He said this to my son. But me and my son were the only ones that heard it because other gifts were being handed out. My 15 year old just looked at me sad, because he thought it was a really cool gift. To keep the peace, I told him just to let it go.

Jan opens up her gift. Now, to preface this...I run a little drink/coffee shop. My husband was supposed to get her gift. On her list, she asked for a Starbucks gift card and some other items. It's in direct competition with me but my husband said ""just give her a Starbucks gift card."" I purchased a $10 gift card and then bought her some really nice body spray, lotion, etc. well over the $25 limit. She also said ""ugh, this wasn't even on my list. Why did they get me body spray?"" I overheard it and said ""you're brother only said get her a gift card, and I thought I'd make the gift a little nicer and buy you some other items.

At this point, I'm livid. The girlfriend Jill, got the same thing as Jan, she was grateful and loved it.

Anyways...moving on...

We go to do the ""Bad Santa"" gift exchange. Yet again, I picked out and bought all the gifts because my kids don't know what to buy. I showed them, they liked what I picked and we ordered them.

We draw numbers. Found out that Sam and his girlfriend, brought Jill's little sister but didn't bring any gifts for her. They weren't going to let her play. So I tell them ""She can play for me, the gift I bought is more of a kids gift anyways."" Then Jill says ""oh no, she can play for me I guess."" Father in law says ""no you both play, she can play for me.""

We get started.

At one point, my sons turn comes up. And honestly there's nothing any of us really want but Sam got a little Multitool set with some other random tools. It's my son's turn, so he steals from Sam instead of chancing it and opening a different gift. This 23 year old throws a tantrum that's what he wanted and ""it's not fair that he stole it from me.""

Ummm what!?! That's the game. My son quietly asks ""Should I give it back?"" I told him no, that's the game.

Anyways, his dad Dave says ""well, steal mine and I'll steal it from him.""

So he does, my son doesn't know what to do so I tell him ""Steal someone else's or grab a new present."" At this point, he doesn't even want to play after Sam threw a tantrum, I don't blame him.

So my awesome husband starts shaking his gift and winks at my son. I love him! I just love him!

My son steals my husbands gift. My husband steals the Multitool set from Dave.

Dave steals from my son, my son steals the Multitool set from my husband.

Sam is fuming at this point.

My husband steals Sam's gift. Probably because he's acting like a child. And starts stomping his feet and says ""That's it I'm not playing anymore, why do you guys keep stealing from me?!""

Everyone freezes. What the heck is happening!?! It's supposed to be fun.

So my sister in law Jan tells Sam, just steal the Multitool back that you wanted.

He stops pouting and says ""Oh.""

So he takes the Multitool from my son, and my son just stares at me.

I said ""steal from someone or pick a different present to open.""

My son picked a present. Guess what it is!?! Alcohol!

Dear Lord. 3 minors in the room and someone brings alcohol. They could have labeled it adult only atleast.

My turn is next. So I take yhe alcohol that I won't drink from my son and he steals a gift from husband.

My husband is done with the drama and picks a new gift.

We get to the last person, Jan and she goes to pick a gift. There are no gifts left!

Between Sam, Jan and her little sister. They only brought 1 gift, which was the $8 bottle of alcohol. We all brought $20-$25 gifts like stated. And 3 of them played the game when only 1 ""gift"" was brought.

I'm just beyond myself at this point. So now we just called it a game, even though the first person, my daughter was supposed to go again to pick whatever she wanted. I said ""we're done. She likes her gift. No problem!""

This isn't even the end of the night.

My sister in law is trying fairly hard to be a good hostess. I'm still a little perturbed about her comment about her gift but I let it go. Try to have fun.

Next game.

She made a Saran Wrap ball with little gifts from the Dollar Store.

Now if you know...the Dollar Store barely has anything of great value. You get what you pay for, but the game is super fun to play.

Our family of four love games. Super competitive and we enjoy just playing games together. So even though my son felt attacked during the last game, he makes the best of it.

The games broken up between girls and guys. Jan made 2 balls, 1 for girls and 1 for guys. Sam and Dave decide they ""aren't going to play, this game is stupid."" That would have left 3 people for the game for the guys. Not super fun, so we all try to talk them into playing.

The girls game was fun. We got some little lotions, chapsticks and Jill's little sister got a $10 gift card at the end.

The boys play. Sam really wants the gift card at the end. During the game, when the Saran Wrap ball gets to Sam, the next person rolls doubles and gets it before he can really unwrap anything. This happens over and over. I blame Karma for being a douche.

Anyways, it gets to the end and he gets to unwrap the middle box. It didn't have a $10 gift card in the middle, it had a stress ball. Sam throws the stress ball and stomps out of the room.

It was supposed to be funny. I personally thought it was comical.

He gets mad because he only got 1 thing and it was sour gum and he wanted a gift card, says ""See this game is dumb.""

Dave his dad said ""Ya, this game was dumb. And left everything he got out of the ball on the table.""

At this point my father in law blows his top and says ""you guys are ungrateful, here give it all to me! I'll take it!""

I wish he had good hearing because he didn't hear half of the things that was said!

So the question of the day, AITA that suggests we don't bother with gifts this year!? Even my husband thought that was going a little overboard. Or let alone, don't even want to go...I'd rather just go over to my in laws and it just be us and then if we have to deal with Dave and Sam again.

(Btw, we are only doing the Bad Santa gift exchange this year. Thank God! And Jill broke up with Sam, he deserved it!",1,1733932718.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

training philosophies seem unanimous that there's value in taking it easy - Zone 2, long-slow distance, whatever you want to call it.

But while out jogging, I was thinking, on Strava at least, most of the incentives, awards and little trophies and things, are for going fast. PRs, KOMs, etc. 

This makes sense, of course, but it got me thinking: What would it look like to encourage/reward slow efforts? That is, efforts where we take it easy on purpose, and are NOT going for a PR, or KOM? 

Now, I'm not someone that drools over Strava trophies (that much), but I do enjoy the gamified stuff a bit... 

Normally when I get back after a workout, I look for any PRs on segments. But with an Easy workout, you'll not be getting any PRs, and that's the point... 

I was thinking: Have a tag for type of workout: right now we can choose ""race,"" or ""commute,"" but it would be cool to have ""Easy"" as an option, so then it would differently colored in the training log as well.

In terms of trophies, maybe, like, on segments, you could have a pop-up saying: You completed this segment with a ***record-low relative effort***

So basically, it's about efficiency in this case, not speed. Like, how efficiently can you cover 5k, with a LOWER heart rate... 

I think training apps of course want to encourage us to go faster, and most of us want to go faster, as well, but along the way, we need to go slower sometimes to go faster, and it would be cool if the apps could encourage that too, somehow...",1,1733932583.0,Strava,0,1.0,False

Female- 32

Impression: 
-mucosal changes in the duodenum. Biopsies. 
-Gastritis 
- 3 cm hiatal hernia 
- Hematin ( altered blood / coffee-ground-like material) in the gastric body (greater curvature).

""Diffuse mild mucosal changes characterized by white specks were found in the entire duodenum.biopsies were taken. Estimated blood loss, minimal. Localized mild inflammation characterized by adherent blood and aphthous ulcerations was found in the gastric antrum. Biopsies were taken for Helicobacter pylori testing using CLOtest. ""

- the esophagus was normal 

I've had gerd / acid for some years now. I haven't been taken my medications to treat acid as much as I should aside from tums. Needless to say, I will be taking them. I have taken sucralfate and I'm now on pantoprazole. . 

Ultimately, I must await my biopsies but I'm so worried about cancer with the white spots or even the ulcers as someone told me ulcers can lead to cancer. . . I have to wait two weeks for my results and already the wait just to have this done today had worried me so much I ended up in the ER twice with anxiety. Had a CT scan done too with dye, thankfully nothing ever showed except a small 1mm nodule on my thyroid. 

Any advice or breakdown or even other reasons besides cancer for white spots would be appreciate. 

The reason why I went through all of this (aside from the hiatal hernia that does needs surgically repaired) is because I am on recovery from bulimia. I suffered for years and I'm officially over one month free from vomiting. I'm healing my body ...I just want to make sure I can heal everything else and hopefully nothing is irreversible.

For example: he works s lot and after work he would help his friends with their projects, their work, connect them to other people in order for them to grow in their career and similar. We do not have weekends for ourselves anymore because is either him working for the weekend, resting or visiting his family. It is impossible to plan anything with him because he is either too tired to do anything or something might come up or he has work. When we eventually go out is an event that is mostly networking connected to his job and finding potential new projects to work on. I sometimes like to attend these events but they are not my ideal way to spend a free evening on. 

Some guilt is also on my part because I gave up on trying to plan anything because it is easier for me to do these things on my own (walks, going for a coffee, beer, concert...) or with a friend than to count on him. I also added a nee hobby to my existing ones and now I am running out of time when he once on the full moon suggests a mutual activity. I also feel resentment because he would help so much his friends and push them in to the scene but I am never being treated the same way even if I am in the same field. I am very independent and successful in what I do but sometimes some support is very welcome. 

I feel very taken for granted and unwelcome in our own relationship and basically invisible. When he tries to show affection I am just not in the mood because I feel like: too little too late. 

Bringing any of these feelings up only results in his depressed silence or denial. 

To clarify: we live together. 

Is there any way to overcome this since I feel we are so deep into this? Has anyone been in a similar position and had a successes story?

Tl;dr:  i feel like my partner prioritises everyone and everything before our relationship and is making me feel resentment towards him.w",1,1733932442.0,relationships,3,0.67,False
1hbwk9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1hbwk9f/experiencing_palpitations_since_last_night/,Experiencing palpitations since last night,"So I've been experiencing heart palpitations since last night, most likely premature ventricular contractions. I have experienced intermittent palpitations in my life before, but never this consistently for such a long duration.

I started noticing them while I was lying down in the evening. Since I have Polar H10, I got an app that can do EKG and started recording. I recorded for 1h20m, when I went to sleep and saw only 3 PVCs during this duration of sleep. But when I was awake (but sedentary) previously, they were much more frequent. 7 per 8 minutes for example.

Today I recorded from 15:00 for 2h17m and got about 59 very similar ectopic beats. Been experiencing them the whole day.

These ectopic beats all look very similiar to these random examples:

I went to the doctor as well and the nurse kinda botched the EKG, so they got only 1 example of the PVC, even though I experienced three while I was hooked up.

Anyways, it's a slow process as they promised to hook me up to a 24h holter monitor in 8 days etc. They did take blood samples, which will be analyzed tomorrow, tho.

Nothing out of the ordinary happening in my life, but I did drink lots smoothie yesterday, which gave me diarrhea and drank a coffee afterwards which only exaggerated the diarrhea. :)  
Am physically in good shape and don't abuse my body much except a bit irregular sleep schedule, with a bit too little sleep - usually less than 7h.

1hbwjmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1hbwjmm/teeth_2_weeks_of_actually_do_it/,Teeth (2 weeks of actually do it) ,"Hi ! 👋 , I've somehow nearly managed to brush my teeth everyday for the last two weeks ! And it's not been a chore! I've actually been eager !


Here's how it happened:
I brought a teeth water jet cleaning thing (it does 30 goes on one charge as well)
I buy flavored toothpaste (because the others burnnnn) , different flavors help with my willingness example - chocolate because I can have a coffee right after 
I brought the purple toothpaste ((because years of unscheduled brushing dosent exactly help prevent stains) also encourages more time brushing) 

Firstly
I brush my teeth with my flavored toothpaste whilst i wait for the tap to go hot to fill the water cleaner

Secondly 
I use the clean settings on the water cleaner to rinse away the toothpaste till the cleaner runs out of water 

Thirdly 
I use the purple toothpaste and brush it in till I think I've got my money's worth (because jeez it's expensive but that's also insensitive to use it 😉) 

Fourthly 
Then I use the soft setting with the periodontal tip for the water cleaner to wash away the purple and essentially floss 

Fith step 
Use the left over toothpaste on the brush (to brush my tounge), wash excess off ,brush back in its home away, use a metal scraper and then the tounge attachment on the water cleaner (which because my tounge then feels so clean, the next day it genuinely feels disgusting so added insensitive to brush again 😅)

I then use having done my teeth as a before step to washing my face and skin care which means I've also been doing that too !

For me at least the toothpaste and water cleaner has made a massive difference!

Teeth brushing has become a little relaxing time out self care 💅🧖 moment for me now, I hope this can help someone else the same way 

2 weeks and I haven't even noticed it's not been a chore and I've been smiling more 😁
 
Good luck 😁💓

1hbwisv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamesontelegram/comments/1hbwisv/imagine_pokemon_go_but_with_memecoins_a_new_way/,"Imagine Pokemon Go, But with Memecoins: A New Way to Play, Earn, and Explore!","I’ve been toying with a crazy idea that combines augmented reality gaming, like *Pokemon Go* and *Ingress*, with the wild world of memecoins. Picture this: you’re walking through your neighborhood, phone in hand, not to catch Pikachu but to snag some rare memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or even the latest trending coin.

Here’s how it would work:

# Gameplay Mechanics:

1. **Capture Memecoins in the Wild**:
   * As you walk around with the app open, random memecoins spawn based on your location and activity.
   * Some coins are common, like Dogecoin, while others are ultra-rare drops, incentivizing exploration.
2. **POI Domination**:
   * The map features Points of Interest (POIs) tied to real-world landmarks.
   * To claim a POI, you need to ""stake"" memecoins from your inventory.
   * The more memecoins of a specific type you’ve collected, the stronger your claim on that POI.
3. **Challenges and Battles**:
   * Compete with other players by challenging their claims at POIs.
   * Battles aren’t just about numbers; certain coins might have ""power-ups"" that give you an edge.
4. **Earn and Trade**:
   * Coins you capture can be traded on an in-game marketplace, turning your virtual adventure into a potentially lucrative endeavor.
   * Special events could offer limited-edition coins that increase in value over time.

# Why Memecoins?

Memecoins are inherently fun and community-driven, making them the perfect fit for an AR game. Their volatility and pop-culture appeal add excitement, and the concept of owning a real-world ""territory"" based on your holdings ties it all together beautifully.

Imagine walking downtown and seeing that someone has claimed your favorite coffee shop because they’re holding 10x more Dogecoins than you. Wouldn’t you want to take it back? Or, you might find yourself hustling to grab a rare PepeCoin spawn in the park before anyone else does.

# Features I’m Considering:

1. **Daily Missions**:
   * Earn boosts or rare coin spawns by completing walking milestones or visiting specific POIs.
2. **Seasonal Events**:
   * Celebrate memecoin milestones with themed events, like a Doge-themed treasure hunt.
3. **Social Integration**:
   * Form alliances with friends to dominate entire neighborhoods or cities.
4. **Real Memecoin Integration**:
   * Partnering with actual memecoins for special rewards or staking opportunities could give the game a real-world economic twist.

# Community Feedback Needed:

1. Would you play a game like this? What would make it most appealing to you?
2. Should captured memecoins have real-world value, or stay purely in-game?
3. Any ideas for special abilities or mechanics tied to specific coins (e.g., Dogecoin gives you speed boosts)?
4. How can we ensure it’s fun without turning into a ""pay-to-win"" nightmare?

Let me know your thoughts! This is still in the brainstorming phase, and I’d love input from the community to flesh it out. If there’s enough interest, I might just start putting together a prototype.

Thanks for reading—to the moon! 🚀

1hbwi3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1hbwi3e/what_do_you_think_about_my_first_two_chapters/,What do you think about my first two chapters?,"THE weather was not too cold to send shivers down your spine and neither too hot for people to swear buckets, it was abundantly warm for people to swarm up the streets of the market district and hence the atmosphere was quite lively. In a developing state’s metropolitan city where smoke is one of the essential gasses in the air and dust is the companion of the skin, for people to experience a day like this must be a blessing. However, residing in a city that is the financial hub of the state as a lower class or lower middle class is not indifferent than a curse. They struggle to secure themselves a few grams of grains. Still, they won't hesitate to come out of their roofs and try to enjoy ‘life’ with their family with whatever pennies they might have. Hence the streets were populated so much that if the formation of their path were to be disturbed the crowd might just trample over each other resulting in many casualties.

But the lives of the impoverished are as significant as the lives of ants. The ones at the pinnacle dictate their direction however they want or even crush them for their entertainment.
This is the harsh reality of the world we live in. But oblivious to all these, the poor exist happily with however little resources they have.  The market district is like a blessing for vagrants to live in. They occupy the streets and might as well get something to satiate their insatiable appetite. Even though the officers drove some of them away, others took up the chance to occupy the streets. Hence the market district is always crowded.

The market district was situated at the center of the city. The human settlements were around the market district. The cost of living was of course high around the market district. The factories, healthcare, industries, and educational hubs were located at different corners since this financial hub- ‘Luxette’ was a planned city in a square area. And it served its purpose very well, leading the development of its surroundings. People also call Luxette the ‘Square Of Heaven’. Even renting a house around the market district was an achievement for some. It mainly houses the upper middle-class section of the society which includes occupations such as doctors, army officers, tycoons, renowned authors, etc.

A postman resolute to fulfill his duty was trying to his bones to make space for his bicycle. He was a middle-aged person on the verge of retirement. After pedaling through the queue he made it out of the market district. He slammed his bicycle on the wall and made his way inside the two-story house present exactly at the right border of the market district. He tapped the door a few times to no avail. He then kicked the door to achieve the same result and then slid the letter under the house, muttered something, and left. 

The door was unbothered for a while. Then at length, some footsteps approached the door and it was creaked open. A silhouette standing around five feet and eight inches came into light from inside the abode.
“What a pleasant day it is!”, he exclaimed while his jaw wide opened , and took a breath in and breathed out.

“I wonder what would've happened for that fellow to rummage through my gate mercilessly?”, he muttered to himself while he let his eyes stray around as if he was looking for something. After a few seconds, his eyes locked onto the letter at his doorstep left by the postman. He genuflected to get it.

“The postman must've had it rough to make it through the market district, that explains his frustration.”,he explained to himself.

He uncovered the letter, threw the envelope along with the stamp outside and began perusing the letter. His expression transitioned from plain to the edges of his mouth widening.
“We won the award!”he cried and rushed upstairs leaving the door open.

The footsteps were so loud that it could have acted as the alarm clock for everyone under that roof.
 
I bet he would still insist on saying that he doesn't have any involvement in this achievement. He took a left swing at the steps and tapped on the door at the end of the corridor.

“How many times do I have to remind you that you need not to knock ? You're the owner, you can enter at your will”, a cheerful voice came from inside the room. “I am not the owner, we are the owner,”He pushed the wooden plank and made a remark to his reflection visible in the long mirror. He was lying against the window frame overlooking the market district.

He is still smiling ever brightly when he just woke up a while ago. His smile is draining the sun rays entering this square. He is outshining the sun. He is the sun for me if I must say. Whenever I am around he never separates with his smile ever since we met except for that one day. Ever since then I've been afraid about what would happen if this smile of his were to disappear. What would I do then? Ah! Man it's only the start of the day and I have already been overthinking. He averted his gaze from the long mirror to the person itself after he bumped his first on the wall.

“Hey! Guess what, we have achieved the ‘Best Fiction Author Award Of The Year’-

“It's not ‘we’, it's you.”, he interjected.

“Cut it out you jerk! Without your suggestions and world building tips I wouldn't have been able to write this award winning novel series. You know it yourself that the most adored character - ‘ The antagonist of the series was your idea’ Every single fan letter mentions how much they love him without fail.”

“Exactly, a few tips and suggestions that I gave you. It’s nothing major.”

“You don't know when to stop, do you?”

“Anyways cutting to the chase, we have been formally invited to attend an award giving ceremony organized by ‘ The Author's Association Of The States’ to commemorate their 101th anniversary. And I don't care about whether it's ‘me’ or ‘we’ , you will be accompanying me, you understand Staler?”

“ Whatever you say goes, France”, Staler turned around and looked France in the eye and giggled.

“So when is this ceremony? You know I need to inform my employer a day before if I am going to ask for a leave?”

“It's going to take place on Monday i.e. tomorrow, in the afternoon.”

“Ain't the interval too short? You received the invitation today only. Anyways I will go visit my employer. He should be at the laboratory at this time. He will probably ask me to stay a bit to help him around, so don't wait for me for lunch.”

“What a workaholic he is for being present in the laboratory on a Sunday!”

“Hey, France though, aren't you worried about your anonymity? You will have to reveal your face while receiving the award, right?”

“ You need not to worry my friend. They are a national level association and they will undertake every single measure to conceal their author's identities.”

“ Well that settles everything. I will go fresh myself up and leave for the factory. In the meantime, you prepare breakfast.”

“Aw, man it's such an amiable day! I had thought of having a meandering talk with you. You let me down.”

“France you know it well that one must be willing to sacrifice something in order to obtain something. Don't worry, I believe we will have a fair amount of distance to cover tomorrow, so I will be all ears.”, Staler reassured France.

“You're right, Staler, so freshen up and come down to have breakfast. I will cook your favorites- scrambled eggs with bread and coffee.” Upon saying that France headed downstairs for the kitchen.

Staler stood where he was for a few seconds then closed the windows. In an instant his smile disappeared like it never existed and the room was encapsulated with darkesnes. It seemed like the square was homophobic to light. After fixing his eyes on the entrance for a few minutes as if contemplating something, Staler at last left to reach the other end of the corridor where the bathroom was.
…

After half an hour, around forty-five past ten, Staler returned to his light deprived room, donned a white linen shirt, black chinos and leather black shoes and went down. The breakfast was served by now on the dining wooden table by France who was slumping on his chair. 
“It looks good.”, complimented Staler with a bright smile and took a seat on the opposite side.

“It's your favorite afterall, I can't afford to slack off.”

“How do you intend to expend your day?”

“It's such a pleasant day, it'd be a shame if I didn't go out for a stroll.”

“What about your novel series? It will soon reach its climax, right?”

“About that, I told you before that I was considering if I should take a hiatus for a few days to improvise myself and the plot since it will reach its climax soon. So I am on break for a few days!”, said France with an obvious grin on his visage.

Staler nodded and asked, “Will you be fine alone?”

“What do you think I'm a child?”, he retorted and continued, “Nevertheless, I would ask Ralph to accompany me.”

“See you are a child.”, he jested.

“Shut up, you jerk.”, France refuted with a sheepish smile.

“Well, make sure Ralph doesn't get you involved in any of his mischievous acts. He is notorious in the market district, you know right?”

“He may be a spoofer but he is good at the core.”

“You never know how a person is, do you? So watch out for yourself.”

“Why do you detest Ralph so much?”

“I do not particularly detest him. He is just a loafer who feeds upon his mother's savings and his father's pension. He is twenty one but still unemployed.”

“Well I can't argue with that. But rest assured I will take care of myself well.”

“But man, sometimes you get very snoopy. I guess it's high time you get married. Should I start searching for a princess for you?”France humored him.

Without a change in expression Staler replied, “Speak for yourself. You spend most of your day indoors. I'm unsure if you will ever find a bride for yourself. Or maybe you have already found one? That young lady who sends you letters regularly, do you like her?”

“Shut up, you jerk. She is just a fellow author who seeks advice from me. It's nothing else. We haven't even met once.” France said rather embarrassingly.

Staler chuckled and said, “If you say so, well I would pray to god that he shows you some mercy and finds you a ravishing young lady.”

“Enough messing with me.”

Around eleven, they had finished their breakfasts. Staler stood up, extended his hand to take his hat which was near the entrance and when he was about to step out, he said without turning, “Take care France and if you encounter any trouble with your series, feel free to bother me.”

“Ofcourse, you jerk. You too, take care of yourself. Be heedful while handling the solutions.”

He turned and replied, “You need not to worry, I'm just a helper not a chemist.” He swung to head out.

“And about you helping me, Isn't it a given for an editor to help the author? In fact you are much more than an editor for me, you're a co-writer.”, France spoke in a hurry.

“I am neither an editor nor a co-writer, understand?”

“Man, no matter how much I force you, you never change your opinion. You really are an intransigent one. Of Course that's probably one of the things I like about you.”

“Speak for yourself, you also never do anything you think is unjust. That's why you are persistent on crediting me, but I guess it's fine. I like that no matter how much I coerce you, you will never do something you think is unfair.”

Staler left and France reached out to close the door, but just then Staler stopped and altered with the same bright smile and said-

“You're intransigent too.”


               RALPH

“You are intransigent too.” Staler commented on France and began following his path to leave the front yard. 

This jerk caught me off guard. I hope this smile of his never vanishes. France waved at the back of Staler and shut the door.

I ought to do the dishes, wipe off the dust from the furniture and put the clothes in the machine. After that I would take a bath to relax. I should probably deliberate with Staler on hiring a maid. The housework sometimes vexes me. 

…

It was seventeen past noon when someone knocked on the front door. It reverberated throughout the two story abode. France, who was sipping on his tea while he invested his eyes in a book while he loosened himself on a cogswell armchair in the living room, got up. He arrived in front of the door and opened it. 

As he unclosed the door, there was a figure standing over five feet ten inches in his view. He assessed the childish baby face and determined he was his neighbor - Ralph. 

As usual, this fellow seems to have attracted some trouble which explains his messy hair, soiled attire and stinky odor. He is infamous in the neighborhood as the ‘mischievous rat’, since he always feeds upon other's fortunes. But people in our vicinity usually let his mischief slide as his father is a martyr. He was a Major General in the army. But unfortunately he met the end of his fate by the hands of a terrorist organization. Ralph's family now consists of his widowed mother and this fellow himself. They got enough pension from the government and had savings to continue residing around the market district. Although it seems like this fellow will soon change their fate. Ever since his father died, his mother has been a fervent religious person. I sometimes wander around the market district since he is always available and I mostly stay in my room writing my novels. He has an easy going, lazy personality and you can also see it in his clothing sense- unironed, untucked black linen shirt, gray chinos and unpolished leather shoes.

“What are you doing here at this time? And what is this attire? You even reek. Even the beggars around the market district would look tidier than you”, France ridiculed him.

“Hey, don't be so rude. I will explain everything once you let me in. I'm starving too, could you spare me something to devour”, he requested and added, “oh! Also what happened to Staler?”

“What do you mean?”

“I met him on his way somewhere and greeted him but he gave me a cold shoulder.”

“He doesn't like you very much since you're twenty-one and still don't work.”

“That's not true. I do different gigs regularly”, Ralph refuted.

Ralph was about to step his way inside but France blocked his way.

“Is that really true?”, France smirked.

“Yes it is. Mother has revoked my allowance so I have to earn for myself. She is too cruel”, Ralph complained.

France let Ralph in and unopened the door.
“She did the right thing”, he said.

“Not you too, man. Anyways, where was Staler headed on a Sunday?”

“Oh he had something to do. He has a job, you know”, France jested.

“So why do you appear so battered and bruised?”, France asked.

“Ah that, you know how of a fervent believer she is, don't you?”

“I do. So what about it?”

“She had kept aside some money to donate to charity in the name of god, and i took it for myself.”

“As usual, I see.”

“I mean we don't have enough for ourselves and she was gonna donate money to the charity. Isn't it unfair!”, he exclaimed.

“You're one to talk? You waste your father's pension in brothels and gambling”, he reminded Ralph.

“Anyways, she kicked me out for such a trivial matter two nights ago. Ain't she heartless?”

“She did the right thing. So where have you been all this time?”

“I took on some gigs and spent the nights in the brothel. I expended most of my money. I shall soon commence my job hunt”, he explained expecting some empathy from France and added looking at himself, “So will you please let me take a bath and give me something to eat? I would really appreciate it if you can provide a change of clothes too, as you can see these are already shabby.”

“The bathroom is in this direction”, France pointed to the right side of the steps.

“Thanks, I really appreciate your hospitality.”

“Nevermind. Also, there's some leftovers from breakfast on the dining table there. You can have it afterwards”, he said.

…

It was one hour past noon and the sun was exactly overhead. The heat was rising but it was bearable since it was the winter season. The electrified fan present in the foyer was switched on. The wooden dining table was also in the foyer. Ralph was done drying himself and had donned the apparel provided by France. France mentioned that these were of no use to him since he had bought a new set of clothes for himself. Ralph was sitting on the chair Staler sat on and was facing France.

“What a fantastic meal it is! Especially the scrambled eggs”, he said and added, “It really complements the coffee although I prefer tea more.”

“This is Staler’s favorite  breakfast. You should be grateful instead of whining”, France said.

“Anyways, when are you gonna prepare the lunch? It's already noon.”

“We will be having lunch at Caviar’s.”

“By ‘we’, you mean us”, he inquired.

“Yes. Didn't I tell you? We'll be going out for a stroll after you finish.”

“Oh I see! Fine by me.”

“Thanks for the meal.”

Upon finishing his meal, he slid his hand in the back pocket and took out three notes worth three pounds.

“Here take it as the price for the clothes.”

“Will gladly take it.” This fellow still has some dignity, I see.

“Where did you get this much money?”

Three pounds would be enough for a family of four to sustain a week and still would have some savings.

“It's from the donation money”, he said with a sheepish smile with his left hand at the back of his neck.

“As expected of the ‘mischievous rat’.”, France muttered.

…

Once Ralph had finished eating, he took a nap on the foyers’s sofa as he hadn't been for quite a while. France went back to his usual routine which included a nap for  one hour and when he got up he started scribbling something in his notebook.

This is no good. I ought to make the climax more intriguing. I'm unsure whether I should kill the antagonist or not. I would have to ask for Staler's opinion. I am unsure about many more things. Maybe it's time I should head out in the fresh air and consider all these. I should wake that rat up.

France made his way to the foyer and saw Ralph sleeping soundly. 

It's not evening yet, I should go prepare some tea for us and then will I wake him up. It would be much better to go out for an evening stroll. The sun won't be too hot and the crowd should be minimum as people would prefer to get back to home before dark.

France prepared tea for the both of them and went to wake up Ralph. He then noticed that Ralph was murmuring in his sleep. He closed up on him to catch what he was giving out.

“Mother please forgive me”

“I have started doing some gigs and I vow on the name of father that I will soon find a job which pays weekly.”


“Then Mother, you won't need to rely on God for anything.”

After muttering this, Ralph's face puckered and he yelled in distress -“Mother, please, don't, do not do that.” And he abruptly woke up and was panting as he looked around.

“Are you fine?”, France inquired.

“Ah yes, nothing to worry about, I just had a nightmare.”, he forced a grin on his face.

“ Then What was that; about you relying on god?”

“I told you, didn't i? It was just a part of the nightmare. I don't even remember what I said.”, he said indignantly.

“All right.” His countenance and unusual temper gives out that something's suspicious. Well I shouldn't bother since it looks like a family matter. 

“Anyways, were you observing me in my sleep.”, he asked in a rather joking way to letup the stressful air surrounding them.

“Of course not. Are you a sleeping princess for me to stare at you? I was here to wake you up for our stroll. It's already evening. We are yet to have our lunch too.” France replied with almost no expressions as if he was mocking Ralph.

“Okay. I will be ready in two minutes.”

Ralph got up and headed towards the bathroom limping as if he was yet to recover from the nightmare he had.

One thing's for sure it wasn't a normal nightmare. Looking at his condition it seems like it's more serious of a matter than I thought. I wonder what it would be? Then again I guess it has nothing to do with me.
 
Ralph returned from the restroom and France locked the door and they went out for an evening stroll. 

…

We went down the way. My place was near the market district. So it took us only about five minutes to reach the market district on foot. On our way Ralph requested to stop by his house since he wanted to peek inside and confirm that his mother was doing fine. We caught a glimpse of his mother watering the plants in the roof garden. He had told me before that his mother adored the plants more than him and I laughed it off. But looking at her visage when she was showering them I thought that might very well be true. I looked at him and he was showing mixed expressions. I couldn't quite make out what he was feeling. 

After that we arrived at Caviar's. The market district housed many luxury cafes and it was famous amongst them. I usually visit here since I think it's not worth it to prepare lunch for a single person since Staler has his lunch at the laboratory itself. He said that the chemist brought lunch for him too and the food was to his liking. I thought that's a valid reason. Moreover, I like the chewy, tender and juicy steak they serve a lot. I convinced myself that whatever they were charging was deserving.

I ordered ‘Mushroom Soup with Bacon and Gruyere Crouton’ with the usual steak with dessert alongside. I asked Ralph what he would have and he was hesitant to order since he didn't have enough money. But I told him the tab would be on me so order as per your liking. He didn't bother going through the menu and ordered the same as me.

I was more than satisfied with the lunch hence I left an additional ten pence as tip with the one pound and twenty pence. Ralph thanked me and said that it was very tasty. He assured me he would bring me, Staler and his mother at Caviar's for dinner once he found a job for him. I nodded at that.

The sun was going down and it started to get dark. Hence the crowd was very less as compared to the day. One could get mesmerized by the white birds in the orangish sky. France along with Ralph headed to the south-west of the market district as there were gardens and sanctuaries since Luxette was a planned city . There were many pleasant sceneries. It was suitable for environment lovers. 

It feels good. I was right to decide to go on a stroll. I feel like my mind is cleared.

When they were walking at a slow pace, Ralph suddenly halted. 

“What happened?”, asked France.

“Look, that's my mother. She is heading in the direction of the church. I don't want to face her for now. Let's change our course”, Ralph had an uneasy expression.

That's right the church is also in the same direction. 

“All right. We will take the long way.”

They turned around and took a right turn. It was a narrow street where there were many street vendors on each side. There they spotted a middle aged couple.

“Hey, isn't that the chemist; Staler attends to?He was supposed to be at work right,”
Ralph asked with a puzzled expression.

France was taken aback. 

Tldr: I don't expect you to read all of this since this could be very lame but based off what you read, how good or bad is this?

Is it fine enough for a beginner?

I just got off work and have been in touch with our Family, and it's all about you, Boo for the next while (it's ALWAYS all about you...just as far as my schedule and the day goes, specifically my next several 'daily missions' 😏 are all about you, too).

1hbweul,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hbweul/confusion_about_most_effective_preheating_process/,Confusion about most effective preheating process for this machine [Bambino Plus],"So I just got my Bambino Plus last week and have been really enjoying getting into the world of espresso and experimenting and dialing-in my shots. Months of research definitely paid off as I have a great starting point and many common questions already answered ahead of time for me. (lots of answers thanks to you guys!) :)

In regards to dialing-in however, as we know, the Bambino Plus doesn't have any way to adjust temperature directly, so with this machine we know that preheating the machine, portafilter, basket, puck screen (if one is used), and cup is very important prior to pulling your shot to ensure the temperature starts off correctly in all parts the coffee/water touches.

While trying to dial-in my shots I've noticed a bit of inconsistency with how the resulting taste/texture (and even the speed of the shot sometimes) come out. This is strange to me when I make no changes to other variables like the coffee used, dose, grind size, puck prep, target ratio, target contact time, etc... between the shots.

When researching about it, it seems this is more of an issue when using light roast coffee (which is exactly the one I'm using here) with the Bambino Plus, and one recommendation is to really focus in on preheating the machine and all accessories as much as possible to eliminate lack of proper temperature as a variable.

In an effort to do just that, I came across a few tips where (specifically for the Bambino/Bambino Plus) folks recommended to use the pressurized basket to run the blank shot instead, prior to swapping out for your regular basket to run the real shot, as this seems to make a noticeable difference on these machines.

I am planning to try this next but, one confusion I have is, if I run my blank shot in the pressurized basket prior to swapping out for my proper basket where I will pull the real shot, wouldn't that then not have preheated my proper basket and may decrease the effectiveness of the preheating process?

It seems some folks are really vouching for the pressurized basket preheat (based on their experiments) but I didn't see anyone actually explain how doing that and not preheating your proper basket is better than just preheating everything in your proper basket instead.

Just wanted to get you guys' thoughts on the matter. Any tips/advice would be much appreciated.

Just for reference, my current preheat/prep process is as follows:

1. Insert portafilter/proper basket/puck screen in machine and turn it on
2. Bean Prep - Dose/RDT/grind/shaker in the meanwhile until the grounds are fully prepped for the portafilter
3. Put the cup I'll be using for the drink in the machine and run a pre-programmed 2-cup blank shot
4. Take out the portafilter/basket/puck screen and dry all of them, while keeping the shot water in the cup to keep it heated as long as possible
5. Put filter paper in basket
6. Put dosing funnel onto portafilter
7. Put the grounds from the shaker into portafilter
8. WDT just the very top 1mm to clean it up
9. Tap the portafilter onto tamp pad to settle grounds
10. Remove dosing funnel and tamp (twice without lifting tamper between - recommendation per Lance Hedrick)
11. Remove tamper and insert puck screen
12. Insert ready portafilter into machine
13. Empty the previous heated water from the drink cup, dry it, and put it back in the machine
14. Run the shot",2,1733932043.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1hbwaw3,https://i.redd.it/9hucpa1bp86e1.jpeg,[Grand Seiko] A Cult Classic - GS 6156-8020 Cap Gold,"
This morning started with a coffee in hand and my 6156-8020 Cap Gold on the wrist. There’s something about this watch that feels just right—classic, simple, and timeless without trying too hard. The warm gold tone and clean design make it easy to wear, especially on quiet mornings like this one. It’s not about making a statement; it just fits naturally into the rhythm of the day.

Life feels better when taken one step at a time, and this watch somehow mirrors that pace. There’s no rush, no urgency—just a steady reminder to stay present and enjoy the little moments. The warmth of the gold case catches the light in a way that feels understated but special. It’s not loud or flashy; it just blends in effortlessly, like it belongs in these moments.

As I sit and sip my coffee, I can’t help but appreciate how some things, like this watch, are timeless. They don’t chase trends or demand attention. Instead, they quietly remind you of what matters—living simply and appreciating the here and now. This morning wasn’t anything extraordinary, but maybe that’s the point. Sometimes it’s the ordinary moments, like the first sip of coffee or the way the sunlight hits your wrist, that feel the most meaningful.

The 6156-8020 doesn’t need to be more than it is, and that’s what makes it so special. It’s effortless and calm, just like the start of a good day should be. There’s beauty in simplicity, and wearing this watch is a nice way to carry that with me throughout the day.",13,1733931747.0,Watches,0,1.0,False

How fitting to be deep in thought while going into town today. The fog was as thick as Niflheim over the mountains and added a nice ambience to my pondering. 

One thought that crossed my mind was the history of the Native American tribes, that once roamed this land freely. Being in Appalachia, there are many historical landmarks as well as rich history that is engrained in this land from them. I am not completely familiar with their customs, stories, or traditions. However it made me think of the Norse and Dane invasions of England in the Middle Ages. 

A basic understanding I have is that the Danes would settle land in England. Then go about installing Saxon puppet kings that were loyal to them. This arrangement proved beneficial for them, but ultimately led to their conversion into Christendom, as well as many other social and political factors of the time. As well as Guthrum’s defeat and converting after Alfred spared his life. 

So many thoughts crossed my mind. What would America look like today, had the Danes not converted and England stayed a mix between pagan and Christian’s? Would the settling of America look the same as it did, or would it be vastly different? 

I’m assuming vastly different, what would have Westward expansion looked like? Would the puritans come, or would they even exist? Would Native American religions been influenced by Norse Paganism, or vice versa? Like in the case of western Christianity.  

We will never know for sure, but it provided some interesting entertainment on my routine commute. Obviously the ramifications of the Norse and Danes not converting provide a deeper world alternate reality, than just the development of America. But I thought I would share it all with you.

# Training

My training block has been unusually long and constant, starting in May with a 5k block (race report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1dkgbe8/2024_al_goldstein_speed_series_3_crushing_an_8/)). Marathon training started in proper in August, roughly following Pfitz 12/70 but subtracting a few miles here and there. 

I PRed in every single distance from the 5k, to the 10k, to the [half marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ge4m98/2024_sri_chinmoy_rockland_half_marathon_another/), all of these sequentially, and knew that while my previous marathon PR of 3:14 could be easily achieved based on the times I've run, no marathon PR is easy and that I must respect the distance, seeing as the last time I ran a marathon was a trail marathon in 2022 where I finished just a shade under 5 hours. To say I am a different runner than I was then is an understatement.

My training plan had been successful outside of a couple hiccups, which I'll list below.

**Mileage of weeks leading up to race day (average: 48.83 miles):**

|Week|Mileage|
|:-|:-|
|1|38.5 mi |
|2|59.3 mi|
|3|48.9 mi |
|4|61.5 mi |
|5|60.9 mi  |
|6|39.3 mi |
|7|53.9 mi |
|8|65.6 mi |
|9|35.7 mi|
|10|44.6 mi |
|11|34.3 mi|
|12 (Race Week)|43.5 mi|

**Key Sessions**

* **Marathon pace long runs**: I'll list some of them below, but I ended up doing a bunch of my long runs with longer marathon pace segments between 6:55 and 7:15. I think I actually could have used more of these.
* **45 minute Unbroken Tempo:** a little slow (6:42 average pace) but really hard and a big confidence builder. A modification on the 7 mile tempo, but ended up only being .3 miles short so w/e
* **Back-to-back MLRs:** I shortened these by a mile or two, but these were really difficult and I think helped build fitness and strength running on tired legs.

Lots of people have used Pfitz plans to great success, so I don't feel I need to go into them too much.



**Here were my problems:**

* I have struggled with marijuana addiction for a few years now, and relapsed midway through this plan. It caused me to gain some weight (from high 140s lbs at the start to around 160lbs on race day) and probably impacted my training, notably my sleep. I have learned to take these relapses in stride as they are consistently shorter and less extreme than they have been in the past. And gaining weight isn't the worst thing during training, as long as I am not getting hurt (which I did not at all this block).
* I just did not feel I had the length necessary for the marathon distance. My times indicate that my best age-graded time is my 5k, with a steady decline as it gets longer. I think there's no doubt that the top-end is there (a couple track workouts I had near the end of the plan tell me I'm even faster than I was in the summer) but I needed more long running. Here were the lengths of my longest long runs, which I'd count as some of my most important marathon sessions:
   * 18.4 miles (10 miles at 7:15 pace)
   * 18.0 miles (12 miles at 7:14 pace, which I thought was slower than MP but ended up being MP in the end)
   * 17.09 miles (2x2 miles at HMP, originally intended for a 3x2miles but cut it short)
   * 17.04 miles (no uptempo pace segments)
   * 16.75 miles (9.35 miles at 7:03 pace)
* About three weeks before the race, I slipped in the bathroom late at night and got a mild concussion. This caused me to miss a 10k race, 18 mile long run, and I ended up taking a more aggressive taper strategy as a result (last 3 weeks before the race were 35, 44, 34 miles not including race week)
* I had legitimately the most stressful three weeks of my life at work right before the race day/week (all the way up until Wednesday before the race)



# Pre-Race

I got into Sacramento on Thursday night and settled at my friend's apartment. I was doing a 2 day carb load, not being concerned about exact macros on Friday but then around 700g of carbs on Saturday.

My plan was going to be to go out with the 3:05 pace group and see how I felt at mile 20ish, but my friend talked me into going out with the 3:00 pace group, risking blowing up, to see if I could chase sub 3. I knew it was an absolute outside shot and that everything would need to go PERFECTLY to get that time. But my heart won out over my head and I agreed to give it a shot, knowing that I'd probably still have a PR in the bag if I blew up. I just had to make sure I didn't blow up spectacularly.

# Race

I woke up at 3:45am, ate a couple SIS granola bars and an iced coffee mixed with a Maurten 320 CAF. Got to the buses at 4:50am, only to quickly realize I had forgotten my hand bottle in my friend's car. A quick call solved the first problem of the day.

I got to the start around 6:15am, waited in line for the bathroom and managed to get off a pretty solid bowel movement. I did some dynamic stretches but did not do a warmup run, which I'd normally say is a mistake but I truly didn't notice at the start. Settled in around the 3 hour pace group and we were off.

First half

The minute I started I can tell my choice of shoes (Adios Pro 3) were a mistake, just never could get the feeling right and lockdown was a real struggle. Outside of that, I felt pretty good chipping along at 6:55-7:00ish pace between miles 1 and 12. It felt much like my marathon pace workouts, comfortably hard. I made it a point to not look at my watch too much during the race and just go by feeling. I could tell that my quads were going to be feeling the downhills, it was just a question of when. There were a ton of people to run with which really helped mentally speaking, managed to chat with a couple in short sentences along the way. I was having trouble putting down my Clif Blokz at this pace, which is a change that I'll definitely make in my next marathon. They're great in training but I just couldn't get them down fast enough!

I split the first half in **1:31:13**

Miles 14-16

I could feel the wheels start to fall off a bit. I think mentally, seeing my half split, I knew there was no way sub 3 was in the cards but I did still really wanted that 3:05. This is around the time where the pain started to set in. I was just uncomfortable everywhere, I tossed my hand bottle at an aid station because I couldn't stand it anymore. I had wished I'd brought more palatable nutrition along the course. I managed to keep a decent pace but could tell that even 3:05 was going to be an immense struggle.

Miles 16-Finish

There's a slight final hill at mile 16 and at some point around here, my heart rate spiked into the 190s and never left for the rest of the race. My legs were beginning to seize up after trying to hold a pace and I said to myself ""You'll have a PR if you maintain under an 8 minute pace the rest of the way."" so I made my best effort to keep the fatigue down and keep smiling through the pain. The cramps were the type where I could continue to run, but it just hurt a lot. I made sure that I was not going to stop for any walking breaks outside of slowing at aid stations, because my legs would be cooked after that.

At this point, it was more about surviving than racing. There were so many times that I wanted to quit. I litigated in my head the things I would have done differently during training. I thought about all of the ex girlfriends I wanted to spite. But mainly, I kept my thoughts on myself and how proud I would be of myself to stay resolute and finish the race with a PR.

The perceived effort levels varied during this part of the race, but I'd say it felt like running a 10k for over an hour. It was deeply uncomfortable. My heart rate struggles to get above 185 or so during training, and even would only hit the 190s during 5k-10k races. I am absolutely amazed by the fact I could hold on for that long, and I was feeling every bit of it.

I mentally picked up at the 40k mark, knowing that my PR was in the bag and that I had less than 2 miles to go. I visually imagined my 2k home at the end of workouts (which include a sizable hill and are definitely harder than the final 2k of CIM). I finished hyped and with a smile on my face

Final time was **3:11:39**

# Post-race

I grabbed the blanket, my medal, bottle, and a banana and wept, knowing that I had achieved every goal I set out to 6 months ago, and broken a nine year old marathon PR. I didn't run the time I had hoped for, but I was so proud of myself for the extremely gutsy mental effort in the last half. I think younger me would have given up or walked it in, but I was not walking away from this race without a PR. It wouldn't have invalidated the work I'd put in, but I didn't want to regret this race.

I'm going to be glad to get away from staring at my watch and paces for a bit, and just enjoy running for the sake of it once I am recovered from the race.

Choice is down to three machines
1. Jura S8 (ordered from Costco, not delivered yet)
2. KitchenAid Kf8 (have access to the insider pricing)
3. De’Longhi eletta explore 

Not having tasted the coffee myself, based on the videos it seems that either of the machines will work for my palette

So to me it now comes down to ease of maintenance 
Seems that Jura S8 doesn’t need descaling if you use their filter but you pay for it
Both the KA and De’Longhi will require descaling 

The milk cleaning system is where i have a question
Seems like the juras system is the most complicated with cleaning tablets and a special plastic container. Is it really an ever day/ every night thing? 

The De’Longhi seems like doesn’t have any internal cleaning required for milk as all of it is contained in the milk container and only that needs to be washed separately. Am I right about that? 

The kitchen aid also seems to have a quick way to clean milk from the system per this video

So for context I’ve been on a weird sleep cycle where I fall asleep early and wake up around 2:30 to 3 am but yesterday I was asleep for most of the day because I woke up around 1 am and stayed awake for awhile until I eventually crashed. So yesterday was a bad day and I didn’t get anything done but the past few days I’ve been doing pretty good. After waking up this morning at 3am I came downstairs around 5 because I heard my parents awake, I came downstairs and immediately my stepfather started berating me about how he mopped the floors and he expected that since I saw him do that I would clean something but I didn’t. He was yelling extremely loud for 5am and thought about our neighbors and how it might wake them up, after saying I was in the wrong and that yeah I messed up he kept going and I said this is ridiculous that he’s being this loud over this. Of course my mom joins in and yells at me. This is the first interaction I’ve had with them today. He starts yelling at us to stop talking everyone shut up and I say something about how loud he’s being and he leaves the house screaming and slamming doors yelling outside and drives off. I have a talk with my mom where I just say that it’s not fair that you gang up on me even though it’s not her argument and that it should stay between me and him since me and her have been doing pretty well recently and that if me living in the same house is gonna work that we need to communicate to each other instead of just yelling because we’re all adults and I’m not gonna be yelled at over something so small. He comes back, I tell him that yeah I was wrong yesterday I should’ve cleaned something and could’ve been better but I want to move forward and be better in the future. He then completely ignores that and continues on with the argument pointing out the dishes my mom left and pinned it on me, a dirty toilet I already cleaned and the fact I didn’t take out the trash one time. I keep telling him how we need to just talk instead of yell because he keeps yelling at this point, I’m pretty much just defending every slight he  thought was a slight and was instead a misunderstanding but he doesn’t care. At this point I’m yelling too and it isn’t getting anywhere so I just stop talking and my mom comes in to intervene trying to calm it down. He starts saying something about how he gives up and that there’s no point. And all I say is how he just gives up and wants to ruin the family over something fucking dishes and we go back and forth for a second and then he gets all lovey dovey out of nowhere to my mom makes her coffee and plays the symphony card, they hug for an uncomfortable amount of time saying how much they love each other and how he was only telling me to clean and how I don’t respect the house. At this point I watched this and completely thought that this was so manipulative and saw right past it. He pretty much took all his negative emotions then transferred it on me and now I got to get rid of the emotions by myself like every single time. I’ll also add that they both are “disabled” which over the years I’ve noticed my mom isn’t really and just uses it as an excuse to get out of things or situations and cash in on the checks without doing anything. My stepdad on the other hand does have a hearing disability but doesn’t wear his hearing aids at all meaning we all have to work around that. Honestly it just seems like something to make me feel guilty all the time, oh you’re disagreeing with your disabled parents. They even have a handicap parking pass that makes me feel disgusting because they can both walk just fine. I can barely stand them and just want to move out but every time I bring it up it’s met with, no no find a house we can buy so you don’t have to rent and waste money. Yeah it sounds great and it’s a great place to be in for them to do that but on the other hand it also feels like a way to control me, they already told me I’m raising my family in the house I’m living in now even though I don’t want that at all and never thought to tell me about it. Just feel completely controlled and even when I admit to being wrong and wanting to change they don’t care snd instead just want to scapegoat me.",0,1733930538.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

NEXE Innovations accelerates sustainability with ecoBeans Coffee as demand for compostable coffee pods soars.

NEXE Innovations Inc. (TSXV: NEXE) has received a second purchase order from ecoBeans Coffee Inc., reflecting the growing demand for ecoBeans' compostable coffee products. This order, which was received ahead of schedule, underscores the momentum in both the retail and office coffee services (OCS) markets. The partnership between NEXE and ecoBeans exemplifies a shared commitment to environmentally responsible business practices.

**ecoBeans: Brewing More Than Coffee**

ecoBeans Coffee is more than just a coffee brand; it’s a vision for a sustainable future. Rooted in a philosophy of intentional living, ecoBeans aims to inspire people to care for themselves, the planet, and the generations to come. Every cup of coffee sold carries a message of harmony with the earth, inviting consumers to embrace mindful choices.

The retail footprint of ecoBeans spans Nature’s Fare Markets, selected Save-On-Foods locations, and its official e-commerce platform. For businesses, the OCS channel has become a vital distribution avenue. Through a partnership with Thirst First Refreshments Inc., a leader in office coffee services in British Columbia, ecoBeans has secured a strong presence in the corporate coffee market.

**NEXE Pods: A Revolution in Compostable Solutions**

At the heart of this partnership lies the NEXE Pod, a cutting-edge, BPI-certified compostable coffee pod. Designed to combat the environmental impact of single-use plastics, the NEXE Pod embodies durability and eco-friendliness. It has been engineered to withstand heat, pressure, and water while maintaining compatibility with major coffee brewing systems. This innovation positions NEXE as a pivotal player in the green technology sector.

The compostable design of the NEXE Pod offers a practical solution for environmentally conscious consumers and businesses alike. Its advanced materials align seamlessly with ecoBeans’ commitment to sustainability, setting the stage for a more responsible approach to coffee consumption.

**The Partnership That Keeps Brewing**

The collaboration between NEXE Innovations and ecoBeans Coffee has been a story of mutual growth and shared values. According to Alina Gogoescu, Founder of ecoBeans, the initial launch of their compostable coffee products exceeded expectations, signaling strong consumer interest in sustainable coffee solutions. The second purchase order is not just a milestone but a testament to the growing momentum behind this partnership.

ecoBeans is already planning an expansion of its product line to include additional stock-keeping units (SKUs). The company is also exploring new regional markets within the OCS channel to capitalize on the increasing demand for environmentally conscious coffee products.

**Retail Success and OCS Expansion**

ecoBeans has made significant strides in the retail sector, leveraging its presence in established outlets such as Nature’s Fare Markets and Save-On-Foods. These partnerships ensure that ecoBeans products are accessible to a wide range of environmentally aware consumers. Meanwhile, the company’s online store caters to those seeking convenience and direct access to their coffee products.

The OCS market represents a burgeoning opportunity for ecoBeans. By collaborating with Thirst First Refreshments Inc., ecoBeans has tapped into a network that delivers sustainable coffee solutions directly to offices across British Columbia. This approach not only meets the growing demand for sustainable options in workplaces but also positions ecoBeans as a frontrunner in corporate coffee services.

**Sustainability: A Necessity, Not a Choice**

The alliance between NEXE and ecoBeans underscores a broader shift in consumer behavior and corporate responsibility. Sustainability is no longer a luxury or an afterthought; it is a business imperative. Companies that fail to adapt to this new reality risk being left behind as consumers increasingly prioritize environmentally friendly products.

For ecoBeans, sustainability is woven into every aspect of its operations, from product design to distribution. The use of NEXE’s compostable pods allows the company to align its business practices with its core values, ensuring that every cup of coffee it sells contributes to a healthier planet.

**Shifting Consumer Preferences**

The rapid adoption of ecoBeans’ compostable products reflects a larger trend in the coffee industry. Consumers are actively seeking brands that align with their values, particularly when it comes to environmental stewardship. This shift has created a fertile ground for companies like ecoBeans and NEXE Innovations to thrive.

Retailers and distributors have also recognized the value of sustainable products, driving demand across multiple channels. The support from Thirst First Refreshments Inc. for the OCS market exemplifies how businesses are increasingly incorporating eco-conscious products into their offerings to meet customer expectations.

**Conclusion**

NEXE Innovations and ecoBeans Coffee are collaborating to advance sustainable business practices, demonstrating that environmental responsibility and commercial growth can align. With a second purchase order confirmed and plans for continued growth, both companies are positioned for a promising future.

The strong performance of ecoBeans in retail and office coffee service (OCS) markets, supported by NEXE's compostable solutions, highlights their mutual dedication to sustainability. As consumer preferences shift toward environmentally friendly products, this partnership aims to contribute to positive change within the coffee industry.",1,1733930155.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

I love media in all forms: movies, TV, games (mainly PC), books, music, anime, manga… Looove anything fantasy but I’m also a sucker for other genres such as sci-fi, horror, and romance. I love to share playlists and other media recommendations!

We met four months ago, and two weeks ago, we broke up. This was my first serious and emotionally close relationship, so I’m still processing what happened. After the breakup, I spent two weeks analyzing the entire situation, trying to figure out where things went wrong. That’s when I discovered something called attachment styles, and everything started to make sense.


---

The Story:

We were on a date, but she seemed cold and distant. I tried making conversation, but she gave short answers. Despite this, she kept taking selfies and even asked me to take some pictures of her. I was confused but kept trying to stay positive.

When it was time to order food, she seemed disappointed with the simple option I suggested. Trying to make her happy, I got the more expensive option she wanted and even went to the ATM for more cash. Out of nowhere, she sent me some money and said, “I sent you some cash.” I thanked her, though it felt unnecessary since I usually paid for our dates.

After dinner, I asked where she wanted to go next, and she said, “Home.” Thinking the date was over, I walked her to the bus station, then texted my friends to meet up at a bar.

The next morning, I called her to check in. She admitted she was upset because she expected me to spend the night with her and felt hurt when I went out with friends. I explained that when she said she wanted to go home, I assumed the date was over. I now realize that was a weak justification—she was distant even hours before I mentioned my friends.

To fix things, I invited her out for coffee. She agreed, chose the place. But she stayed emotionally distant, throwing passive-aggressive comments like, “My friend’s husband does this and that…” or “I’ll marry someone who truly cares for me and gives, so I can give back.”... in an arrogant way ,I felt like she was indirectly saying I wasn’t enough.

Throughout the date, I kept asking her what was wrong, pleading with her to trust me and open up because I genuinely had no idea what was bothering her. But she only responded with vague or dismissive answers, leaving me feeling confused and helpless. I was doing my best to fix things.

For the next three days after that date, I kept trying to revive the conversation through texting, hoping she’d open up about what was bothering her. But she stayed distant, refusing to tell me what was wrong. Exhausted and emotionally drained, I let the conversation die, feeling stuck and unsure what to do.

On the third day, she finally texted saying she wanted to talk. When we met, she explained that she felt hurt because I didn’t bring my bag to our last date, which, to her, meant I hadn’t planned to spend the night—even though we hadn’t made any plans.

Frustrated, I told her, “The real issue here is that you keep your feelings bottled up until they come out as passive-aggression.” Instead of acknowledging it, she responded, ""i have a problem expressing my self"" and then “If we can’t handle this small problem, how will we handle bigger ones?” She’d used that line before in other arguments.

Looking back, I now see that she seemed to have a deep fear of arguments or confrontations. Whenever I brought up something I thought we could work on, saying something like, “I noticed this and that—what do you think?” she would fall silent, looking visibly sad or even scared. Her eyes would fill with sadness, and she would give short answers, like she was bracing for something worse. I always reassured her that it was okay and that I was just bringing up an issue so we could fix it and move on. I never wanted her to feel judged or criticized, but it seemed like even small discussions triggered her fears.

At that moment, emotionally drained and overwhelmed, I told her, “To be honest, I lost my feelings for you during all this.” in reality i was frustrated and confused when I said it—I didn’t mean it, as i had a bit rest i discovered i still miss her.

Later that night, I texted her saying we were done because I felt our dynamic was unhealthy. She blocked me on everything, and we’ve been in no contact for the past two weeks.

Reflection on Attachment Styles:

After the breakup, I spent two weeks researching attachment styles and took multiple online tests (both paid and free). Every test confirmed the same result: I’m an avoidant.

Looking back, I see how this played out in our relationship. I already knew I had difficulties balancing emotional closeness and my need for personal space, but I didn’t know there was a name for it. I genuinely cared for her, tried to make her happy, and felt her emotions deeply—especially when she was upset or sad. I never played games, always replied to her messages quickly, and tried to be emotionally present.

But as I read more, I realized she likely had an anxious attachment style. She often seemed emotionally needy but couldn’t express it directly. Instead, her unmet expectations came out as passive-aggression, which triggered my fears of being controlled or manipulated. We fell into a classic avoidant-anxious cycle: she needed more closeness than I could comfortably give, and I felt smothered when she demanded it without clearly communicating her needs.

Now I’m torn. Maybe I should have tried harder to bridge the gap. I know I was emotionally drained, but I also know I wasn’t perfect. Part of me wishes she had at least recognized her own behavior or acknowledged how her emotional reactions affected the relationship—something that would have given me hope that things could change.

We shared some genuinely beautiful moments together, which makes it harder to move on.
Even that she blocked me.

I perused some of the older threads, but I was wondering if you fine folks had any specific or general tips for using Live 12 to process live vocals and guitar for coffee shop/brewery performances. I have a powerful windows laptop. as well as a blacklion audio revolution 2x2 interface (I also have a UA volt 476 but that usually stays home), and just want to sweeten up my signal before sending it out to my lil bose s1 pro+.

In the past, I've usually just used the first party EQ8, compressor, and 'verb ""to taste"" on the vox and acoustic guitar and it sounds okay. When recording at home, I usually slap the izotope nectar and neutron on and it sounds--at least to my ear--a lot better, but of course, causes a lot more signal latency and probably isn't viable for live performance.

I'd love any tips or thoughts from those that might have a lot more experience than I do.

\- Are there some light weight plugins that might make my life easier?

\- Should I be incorporating a DI or some sort of signal processing into my chain before or after the interface?

\- Should I just ditch ableton all together and use the somewhat scuffed 'verb and tone settings from my speaker for a setup this simple?

Thanks for your thoughts and have a good one!",0,1733929196.0,ableton,3,0.4,False

1hbvbea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hbvbea/fl_diamonds_expert_tips_for_smart_buying/,"FL Diamonds: Expert Tips for Smart Buying
","FL (Flawless) diamonds represent absolute geological perfection, with fewer than 0.5% of all diamonds achieving this mythical status. These crown jewels of nature command over a 90% premium over VS1 grades, entering a realm where buyers look for perfection.

This definitive guide provides simple yet smart strategies for navigating the FL diamonds market, making sure you make an informed decision.

# Bottom Line:

FL (Flawless) diamonds represent the pinnacle of diamond clarity but come with significant trade-offs:

* Extreme rarity: Less than 0.5% of all diamonds are FL grade
* Substantial price premium: Often 10-%20% more expensive than IF diamonds and 90% over VS diamonds.
* Imperceptible difference: FL and IF diamonds look identical to the naked eye. Most likely you won’t see the difference between VS2 and FL diamond with the naked eye as well.
* Strong investment potential due to rarity and desirability, depending on all the other 4C’s.
* Consider if the pursuit of perfection aligns with your priorities and budget.
* Lab-grown diamonds are much more affordable. You can buy a similar FL lab-grown diamond at a 70%-80% lower price tag or invest in a larger and better lab diamond.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Feel free to[ reach out for a free one-on-one consultation.](https://labdiamondsreview.com/contact-us/)

# Who is this for?

* Collectors seeking the absolute finest diamonds
* Buyers wanting a significant luxury investment piece
* Those who value technical perfection above all else

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers
* Buyers prioritizing size or other qualities over clarity
* Those satisfied with eye-clean diamonds at lower clarity grades

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Compare to IF diamonds: Consider if the premium for FL is worth it given the visual similarity.
2. Prioritize cut quality: Even for FL diamonds, excellent cut is crucial for maximum brilliance.
3. Get expert verification: Ensure authenticity through reputable labs like GIA or AGS.

1. Consider overall value: Weigh clarity against other factors like carat weight and color.
2. Shop with trusted retailers: FL diamonds command high prices, so buy from reputable sources.
3. Think long-term: Consider resale value if treating the purchase as an investment.

# FAQ

Q: How rare are FL diamonds?  
A: Extremely rare, making up less than 0.5% of all graded diamonds.

Q: Can I see the difference between FL and IF diamonds?  
A: No, the differences are not visible to the naked eye and require expert grading under magnification.

Q: Are FL diamonds a good investment?  
A: They can be, due to their rarity and consistent demand. However, like all investments, there are no guarantees.

Q: Do FL diamonds cost much more than IF diamonds?  
A: Yes, typically 25-35% more expensive for comparable diamonds.

Q: Can FL diamonds be damaged?  
A: While extremely hard, diamonds can still chip or scratch. Any damage would lower the clarity grade.

Q: Is it worth buying an FL diamond over a lower clarity grade?  
A: For most buyers, lower clarity grades that are still eye-clean offer better value. FL diamonds are for those seeking perfection regardless of cost.

1hbvaqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1hbvaqe/week_1_in_the_books_tracking_muscle_loss_and/,Week 1 in the Books (Tracking muscle loss and increase dosing),"So I took my first shot Wednesday December 4th. I was scared to step on the scale this morning, thinking if didn't lose anything I would feel defeated. All is well as I dropped 7 pounds in week 1. Understanding it could be just an ideal weigh in, I wouldn't even be discouraged next week If loss minimal to no weight at all.

37M 6'1"" SW 248 CW 241 GW 195 Current Dose 2.5

Side Effects were pretty minimally. The first couple of days it was a weird feeling not be hungry. I felt my mind told me to eat and not my stomach. Even while staying hydrated I would start to get a minor headache, and I'm like OH, I guess I should eat something. Appetite started to slightly come back the last day or two, but nothing crazy.

Training - I'm trying to train at least 3 days a week. I'm starting off pretty light as its been a many years since I been consistently working out. Usually I do a beginner full body workout on peloton followed by a 30 minute walk. Trying to get at least 10k steps even on the days I don't work out. I work at a desk so it's hard sometimes.

Protein/Diet - Trying to up the protein wherever possible. Protein shakes/bars, protein coffee, turkey roll ups, lean jerky etc... Not a fan of Greek yogurt but going to try moving forward. I always get a minimum of 100 grams of protein but really going to try to up that to 150. Always drinking plenty of water and drink some electoryes around shot days and when needed.

  
My questions after Week 1 

\- What's the best way to track muscle loss without getting a dexa scan? I'm using the renpho scale to track weight. Is has a section for muscle mass. Is there an acceptable calculation for every pound loss it should only be a percentage of muscle. For week 1 reference my total weight went down 7.2 pounds. My muscle mass went down by 1.2 pounds. So about 17% of my weight loss was muscle. I read somewhere then when losing weight that no more than 25% of weight loss should be muscle. I know the scale won't be perfect but I'm hoping that this is a good way to track muscle maintenance while trying to lose weight. My goal would always to keep muscle mass loss under 20% of the total weight loss, with the ultimate goal to fully maintain or even build muscle. According to the app as well my muscle mass is currently 162 pounds which is at the highest point of the scale. So really just looking for someone to say its ok to drop a few pounds of muscle as long as it's below 20% of total weight loss. 

  
\-Dose Up - I still have two more shots of 2.5. My initial doctor visit told be that we would increase as long as you didn't have side effects. If I continue to lose weight at lets say 2 pounds per week is there any reason to increase the dose im progressing well. I know its SO early but just checking in.

We did a full remodel about 7 years ago and while we are happy with most of our decisions the one place we left unchanged was the pantry (to the left of the fridge in photo). Our fridge is already falling apart (modern fridges suck!) and think it might be a good time to rethink the pantry and fridge.

When we did the first round of changes we were a family of 4. Now we're a family of 6 (2 adults, 4 kids). A few years ago we switched over to mostly eating fresh whole foods. That means we max out our fridge and use a garage fridge for overflow. Which is a PITA. Some of the items in our pantry are YEARS old, but my wife's mom is a hoarder and brings us 5-yr cannned food (eyeroll). We only maybe need half the space we have in the pantry.

The plan is to swap out the fridge/freezer for a fridge only unit. Then convert the pantry to a drawer freezer and upper coffee bar / tea / hyrdration station. An alternative is to just skip having a freezer in the kitchen. We don't use ice for anything and we rarely get things out of the freezer. It's mostly meat.

We have a smaller ""dining"" room that isn't used at all as we tend to sit at our nook (seats 8). We would lose the floating shelves and put in a few more upper cabinets to take in some of the pantry stuff and to move some other items out of kitchen drawers that aren't used as often. Basically we are looking to turn that far wall into our pantry.

Has anyone here converted to a fridge only unit? I love maximizing vertical space and floating shelves while pretty don't hold as much stuff as a cabinet. I'm going to spilt the shelves in half and move them to the left of the sink. We have a 28"" wall there that is open at the moment. ",1,1733928973.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

I tried it, and while it was interesting, it took me longer than it would have taken on the stove, so I filed it away as an interesting idea.

Further exploration led me to various recipes that called for adding cleaned egg shells to my dry coffee grounds to soften the coffee’s acidity, as well as actually cracking an entire egg or egg white into a cup of coffee, which I think is called Swedish coffee. I have not tried those ideas yet.

What I am wondering is what would happen if I put (probably warmed to room temperature) eggs into my glass carafe and then made a normal pot of coffee with them in there? My brand’s carafe will stay heated for up to two hours and from what I have read it generally takes about 30 minutes to create a hard boiled egg when using straight water. I do not want my coffee to taste sulfurous but I am wondering if the eggshell’s calcium carbonate might still help to reduce the acidity of my coffee, and in a half hour, using a spoon or tongs I can take out a few eggs to have them in either a soft or hard boiled state? All I can find online is the plain water hack, nothing that tells me what would happen if I was actually making coffee which in turn will be heating up the eggs.

1hbv3wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1hbv3wu/weird_things_happening_in_my_home_lately_and/,Weird things happening in my home lately and experienced by multiple people,"This all started about 3 months ago in my relatively new build home that had flooding and required basement renovations. There was one previous owner that I still am familiar with and just a regular family and I have lived here 11 years.

I was lying in bed with my girlfriend one evening when my acoustic guitar in the corner on a stand strummed a single string loudly. My girlfriend and I both looked at each other and were like ""did you just hear that?!"". We joked it's a ghost and I said to ""do it again"" and nothing happened so we cuddled back up and lay there for about 5 minutes talking and it happened again! This was at like 2pm in the afternoon on a Saturday.

My children are entirely unaware of what happened and were at their mother's when it occurred. One day my preteen son told me he was my daughter in the kitchen standing to the rear left of him out of the corner of his eye by the kitchen table. He turned and saw her for a second and she disappeared. He thought she was playing a joke on him as it was early Sunday morning. When he couldn't find her he realized she was still fast asleep in bed (and there was no way for her to sneak past him from the kitchen). I said he may have just thought he saw her out of the corner of his eye....but it creeped me out a bit.

I was in the kitchen with my girlfriend one weekend making breakfast and all of a sudden there was a loud bang on my countertop like someone slamming their fists into it in anger. It rattled my coffee machine and stand mixer visibly. This part of the counter why right above my build in dishwasher which was empty and we agree the sound was not below counter level but right on the surface despite nothing falling. We could never explain what happened.

I'm a heavy sleeper, but when it comes to my kids if they are evening sniffing different when they are in their bed with a cold it can wake me up as I know they are awake. Sometimes they will call for water, or because they are stuffed up, etc in the middle of the night. On 3 nights in the last 2 weeks I have been woken up by the sound of one of my kids calling me (non-urgently) and finding them asleep. That has never happened before. I brushed it off as a weird dream and didn't mention it to anyone.

Last week my 10 year old daughter came into my room just after midnight to ask why I went back to bed as it was a school morning. I was fast asleep for about 2 hours, but apparently I told her to wake up for school and she went to actually have her shower and get dressed and ready!

It's starting to add up and I'm not really a believer in the paranormal...but I can't explain what's been going on here!

By Matt Denis – Reporter, Jacksonville Business JournalDec 11, 2024
6–7 minutes

Northeast Florida's cultural institutions made significant strides in 2024, with transformative projects poised to reshape the region's artistic and educational landscape.

From the Museum of Science and History's ambitious relocation to the Jacksonville Zoo's next phase of ""ReZoovenation,"" these initiatives signal a renewed commitment to enriching community experiences and driving economic vitality.

MOSH

In the works since 2019, the Museum of Science and History received another financial push toward construction of a new facility at the Shipyards.

Operations have outgrown the 33,000 square feet of usable exhibit space at its Southbank location. The new museum will serve more students and visitors.

Plans comprise 130,000 square feet for exhibitions, programs, events, and a planetarium.

The City of Jacksonville approved $50 million in funding on Sept. 24 to be spread over a three-year period from the city’s Capital Improvement Plan to push towards the project.

MOSH itself will direct at least $85 million in capital toward design and construction.

More than $40 million came from philanthropic, corporate and private support. The largest financial commitment came from Jacksonville-based CSX Corp., which donated $10 million on March 26.

Florida also appropriated $5 million for the project in the state’s 2024-2025 budget.

Fundraising to cover additional needs will proceed under MOSH Genesis capital campaign chair Jill Davis and MOSH Chief Development Officer Maureen Mercho.

“MOSH is an essential leader in our city’s cultural landscape. With a larger location and cutting-edge exhibits, it will play an even greater role in attracting tourism to our downtown, cultivating curiosity and inspiring innovation among our next generation of leaders,” Mayor Donna Deegan said during an October presentation.

Balfour Beatty and Stellar will jointly lead MOSH construction management.

Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens

The Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens continued step two of its $210 million “ReZoovenation” campaign in 2024.

The J. Wayne and Delores Barr Weaver Manatee River entrance and manatee rehabilitation center and clinic. A 330,000-gallon tank welcoming guests will include a river, holding pools and filtering equipment for up to 15 manatees in need.

The exhibition will also feature a functional wetland complete with native fish and birds.

Ticket counters and guest relations will augment a newly-built retail center and restaurant space offering coffee beverages and Mayday Handcrafted Ice Creams, operated by SSA vending.

Post completion, the Jax Zoo will move on to constructing an expanded lion habitat, a new education campus, a redesigned elephant habitat and, finally, bringing orangutans to Jacksonville.

The Zoo hopes to complete all projects within the next 10-15 years.

Manatees are scheduled to greet zoo guests upon completion of the project in fall 2025.

Ponte Vedra Concert Hall

Renovations for a transformed Ponte Vedra Concert Hall kicked off in late spring of 2024.

Designed by the architecture and interior design firm Fisher Koppenhafer, expansion plans for the historic concert venue include a long-awaited second-floor balcony and an outdoor terrace.

On the first floor, refigured stadium-style seating offers more flexible crowd configurations for the concert halls over more than one hundred shows per year.

Additional enhancements will include wider seating, new projection and audio systems, modernized restrooms, a multi-use room for special events and meetings, an onsite merchandise shop, elevated concessions amenities, and more.

Since the Concert Hall opened in 2011, over 300,000 music fans have attended 484 unique acts, from classic artists like Graham Nash and The Zombies to emerging artists like country-blues singer Charley Crockett and soulful bass-guitarist Thundercat.

The Friends of the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall, local residents dedicated to the cause, continue to drive structural upgrades.

In 2022, FOPVCH, in partnership with St. Johns Cultural Cultural Events, Inc., launched the ‘Elevate’ campaign to complete a comprehensive renovation of the 40-year-old structure.

“Collectively, we’ve been committed to enhancing every aspect of our operation, aiming for an unparalleled experience for both artists and patrons,” Gabriel Pellicer, CEO & President of SJC Cultural Events, Inc., said in a press release.

Owned by the county, the Concert Hall’s renovation will not impact St. Johns County residents' ad valorem tax dollars.

Finalized plans promise a renewed space, with the anticipation of completion in early 2025.

Friday Musicale

Friday Musicale, one of Jacksonville’s foundational music venues, brought its marketing efforts into the 21st century with outside promoters to schedule shows in 2024.

Executive director Daniel Stark also sparked its short-term revenue stream, through the addition of concert admission, ticket tiers and VIP seating.

With new streams in process, Stark aspires for the arts nonprofit to renovate the main venue at 645 Oak St. and recruit a restaurant to operate out of its historic cottage at 635 May St.

This consideration overlays an ambition to provide a reliable experience overlayed by an elevated show for Friday Musicale showgoers.

“An eating establishment here would engage the community in a new and authentic way,” Stark told the Business Journal.

Jacksonville Symphony

While no major renovations occurred at the Jacksonville Symphony’s downtown building, the organization did debut original 2024 shows and secure plans for 2025.

“Parrots + Palms: The Songs of Buffett & Fins” — a celebration of the life, vibe and legendary songs of Jimmy Buffet — opened where the show originated on an auspicious Friday the 13th of September.

In 2025, the 300 Water St. location is slated for a new, $6.97 million roof. Advanced Roofing Inc. secured the construction permit on the City of Jacksonville’s behalf.",3,1733928504.0,jacksonville,2,0.8,False

1hbv2m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hbv2m6/evilbb_a_true_story/,"""EvilBB"": A True Story","*Note 1: I tried posting this on the darknet* *and deepweb subreddits because I thought it fit those communities better, but my posts were auto-deleted. So I thought I'd try here instead.* 

This is a true story. It's the reason I stopped using the Dark Web for years. I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this \*.onion site, or has information on it.

And no, this is not a creepypasta, where something claims to be ""true"" for scare/shock value - this shit actually happened to me.

**Background**

*Note 2: I put a zero instead of an ""O"" in the word p0sts, so that this p0st doesn't get tagged as being about shopping in the darknet subreddit.*

I'm getting back in to the Dark Web now, because I'm seeing multiple countries around the world (and worryingly, Western ones) move closer towards authoritarianism and I want to have options in case our net ever gets taken down on the orders of corrupt politicians. But it made me think about why I stopped using it entirely back in 2018. Back then, I used it for the same reason I mentioned above, but also out of some curiosity, and as an alternative outlet for information I couldn't find on the regular web - like Pizzagate.

When that story was floating around, I recognized I wouldn't be able to find anything reliable through the regular web. I've been a student of the occult for many years, and knew that most of the people suddenly talking about occult topics online had no idea what they were talking about, so I dusted off Tor (which I hadn't used in months) and tried to cross paths with some fellow occult-minded internet sleuths for shits and giggles.

We know what the Dark Web is like. It's all word of mouth, essentially, and you just have to dig until you find something interesting. Dark Web search engines back then had nothing but dead links, so I hit the chans (end, nein, leftypol, etc.), the socials (like Galaxy3) and chatrooms asking anyone I crossed paths with for some directions on where I might look next. Someone gave me a link to a spider/crawler that someone had put together and suggested I started looking through some of the links it was spitting out.

The crawler was called (from memory) ""Daniel's List"", or something like that. It was a basic page with a  blue header at the top, a spreadsheet table on it, with 50 rows per page, that would refresh every couple of minutes. By the time you were done looking at the links on page 6 or 7, you'd hit refresh and there'd be a whole bunch of new links ready.

The table had the onion address in the first column, and then if the crawler found any further information it would put it in the subsequent columns, like the title of the page, the first couple lines of text, last time it was accessed, etc. I found some disturbing shit through that, certainly. I realized pretty quick (like, after the first 2 attempts) that if the table had just the onion address and no other information, that the link would be of pictures of kids that I didn't want to look at - so I only focused on links that had more information. No clicking on blank links on ""Daniel's List"", that was the rule.

But even with that rule in place, I managed to stumble across some fucked up pages, like marketplaces claiming to sell humans for slavery, bestiality porn, extreme gore/snuff films, Islamic terrorist literature/videos/chat rooms, etc. This is in addition to the usual drugs marketplaces, hacker hangouts, Neo-Nazi groups and the psychotic ramblings of paranoid narcissists you usually find out there (it seems like every dude with a manifesto puts their drafts up on the Dark Web at some point).

But despite this, I kept looking through the crawler, because I also found some pretty cool/interesting pages that fit what I was looking for.

During this time, I found the page for the '432 mystery', I found some pages for occult groups, some interesting 'dark' art projects (at least, I hope they were art projects, lots of grainy black and white videos of things that looked like they belonged in a Rob Zombie horror movie - like people in robes in a barn sacrificing a goat, and silent video of some screaming girl chained at the wrists and ankles on a table, while some other dudes stood around her with candles, etc.), as well as some ""net art"" types with their 90s inspired personal homepages and dark, satirical humor (surprise goatse links, for example) .

I mention all of this to give you an idea of my own personal baseline.

I saw all of this material, and wasn't put off the Dark Web at all. Actually, the fact that it was so fucked up was half the fun. I was sleuthing for info on satanic cults that might be kidnapping children, after all, so finding that dark stuff just egged me on further.

But my fun ended pretty fucking quick when I clicked on a link for ""EvilBB"". That's the link that made me stop using the Dark Web entirely, from mid 2018 until December 2024.

**EvilBB**

The table on ""Daniel's List"" had the onion link, and next to that, the title of the page as EvilBB. In the next column, it said ""The Evil Bulletin Board"". That's all I had to go on, and because so many users on the Dark Web are edgy types and like to call themselves 'evil', for the same childish thrill that tweens have when they try to front as being evil or wicked, I saw no harm in clicking it.

I was greeted with a standard front page for a bulletin board - blue and grey color theme, with ""EvilBB"" in a default font, it's full name beneath that, and then a login box with a ""Register"" link below. On the bottom left of the page was a line that said that there were ""3 users online"".

I clicked on register, came up with some username and used my burner Protonmail address, and created an account. I was in, and the counter on the bottom left said there were now ""4 users online"".

That's the first time I could see the titles of each of the forums on this bulletin board. The first was a ""Message from the Mods"" forum, next it was an introductions forum where ""psychopaths can introduce themselves"". But after that were the specific forums - each one devoted to some evil act one could do to another. They were for Assault/Murder, Rape, Kidnapping, Torture and, finally, the ""Evil General"" forum for any act that didn't fit into the above.

Right away my bullshit meter started going off. I immediately thought that these were all edgy dickheads writing fanfics about what they would do to other people if they weren't just keyboard warriors.

But I was wrong.

The first link I clicked was the kidnapping forum. The most active link, at the top, was from a user who claimed that they had kidnapped a 10 year old boy and were holding them captive in their basement, and torturing them for fun. They were asking for ideas on what to do next, as well as tips for disposing of the body afterwards. Some other users had suggested that the kidnapper sodomize his victim with something around the house that would be painful, but not kill the victim instantly, so they can have their ""fun"" for longer, and it seemed like a rolling pin was chosen. I realized that these psychos were sharing photos off the site, because they had references to the photos they had received of the rolling pin being used, and were now egging the kidnapper on to use something wider, like a tin can.

Still, there was a part of me that didn't believe what I was reading, so I clicked on the profile of the kidnapper. In a previous p0st, from six months earlier, he had posted a picture to the murder forum, of a little girl, who was maybe 5 or 6 years old. This little girl, wearing those little kid pajamas, was hanging by the neck inside of his closet at home from a rope, her face was purple and her tongue seemed swollen and it stuck out of her mouth. It was a high quality photo, and it was years before AI generated images were invented.

This was real, and it made me sick to my stomach.

I realized that these psychos operated the same way that pedos must do. They cross paths and recognize each other in different parts of the Dark Web (like chat rooms), and by word of mouth, pass on a site's address where they can congregate and share their interest.

I clicked on the Rape forum, and saw p0sts where users gave advice on which parts of a particular city are best for hunting women at night (like those dark paths leading away from universities, which seemed to be a favorite of theirs for lack of security cameras/passers by, places to hide/escape and young, hot women to target). They were also trading stories of rapes they had done, and congratulating each other. There weren't any pictures or videos p0sted here.

The torture forum had first hand accounts of larger tortures done to kidnapped victims, but also smaller tortures, like putting razor blades in public places, and watching people get hurt from afar. The users were asking for detailed accounts and sharing ideas for new plans. Some of them were juvenile, like one user who shared a story of poisoning his boss' coffee with powerful laxatives and watching him shit his pants at work. Others were way more insidious, like a months-long thread where one user was psychologically torturing a girl at his work with an ultimate goal of making her take her own life. That one was very detailed, and showed a real grasp of psychology, as well as a scary level of patience - and by his account the girl seemed near her breaking point. She was losing her ability to function at work, as well as losing hair from stress.

I noticed that, on the bottom left, there were now ""6 users online"". A new p0st appeared as a sticky on the moderator's forum. It was a reminder that ""new psychopaths had to say hello"", or they'd ""be banned"".

I was still curious, I still wanted to see more and so, to avoid getting banned, I went to the introductions forum and said a quick hello, and then I went to the Evil General forum and asked a Pizzagate related question - something along the lines of ""has anyone here come across any groups that mix being evil with the occult, like human sacrifices or something?"".

I then checked out the Murder forum, and saw p0sts where psychos were exchanging hints and tips on where and how to dispose of bodies, different methods for killing people, sharing pics of murder victims they claimed to have received privately from the murderers themselves, sharing stories of their own conquests (with incriminating information removed). I also saw another picture of a murdered little girl, from a different user. This one was a ""power user"" on the board, and it was of a little girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old, with a blue top and tiny shorts. She was also hanging by the neck, from an extension cord, in the corner of an unfinished basement. There were unpainted cinder block walls behind her, and a bare dirt floor, and she was hanging from some pipes above. Her face was swollen, and her skin was pale below the neck, and dark purple above.

Then I noticed that I had received a reply to my p0st, from the same 'power user' who's photo I was looking at. He commented about the occult groups that practice human sacrifice that I was asking about. He said ""Cult of the snake. Very dangerous. Stay away from them.""

I asked why. he replied instantly, ""They kill to keep people quiet, so you can never leave."" I didn't know what to ask next, so I went back to the homepage. There were now ""12 users online"".

At that point I saw that the moderator had made a new sticky thread - in ALL CAPS. The moderator said that there was a huge spike in the number of new accounts, as well as the number of concurrent users, and that he suspected that there had been a leak of the site's address somehow.

Right away - meaning **fucking instantly** upon reading that p0st - I closed Tor and turned my internet off. I felt like I was busted. I didn't know how tech savvy these people were and I didn't want to hang around to find out if they could locate me.

I was reeling. I went for a cigarette to process what had just happened. It had all happened in less than half an hour. After a smoke, though, I calmed down and knew that I had to screenshot everything and send it to the cops. I hadn't thought to do it at the time, because I was just leaping around the website trying to understand it. I logged back on with my clipping tool ready, but the site was down. The mods had already taken it offline. I was only away from my computer for 15 minutes max before I tried reloading EvilBB, but it was gone.

I spent another hour checking ""Daniel's List"" to see if there was another link for it to get the screenshots, but after that I closed Tor, and didn't open it or download it again until last week.

I still think the Dark Web is going to be a useful asset in the years to come, and that most people will eventually prefer a version of the internet that is genuinely private (because so many have already lost their livelihoods to being canceled), which is why I've gotten back on it. But, damn, EvilBB made me walk away from it for years.

I also stopped caring about or sleuthing Pizzagate that day. I went looking for information on organized groups that hurt kids, and I found them. I can still describe those two little girls in accurate detail, from memory, and I don't want to see any more pictures like that.

So, has anyone here seen EvilBB for themselves? Anyone here know whether the psychos in that community ever faced justice?",2,1733928466.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I received $76 from 3 supporters. I went to withdraw that money and the dashboard shows that my outstanding balance is $69.09, I assume its lower because of taxes. It's annoying because on PayPal, I can quickly transfer the exact amount of $76.

Anyways, when I go to physically withdraw those funds, the new amount listed is $68.74. Is there some other hidden fee I'm unaware of that is at play here?

Can someone explain these two dropoffs to me please?

I thought maybe she would be turning in to the frozen storage facility, nope, she attempted to cut me off WITHIN the intersection to go straight. After I wailed my horn on her for 10 seconds, she backed off and squeezed in behind me, cutting off the rest of the 15 cars. 

However at the next set of lights , she pulled ahead of all the cars again at the light by driving into the right turn lane than cutting off everyone in the intersection, and going strait down commercial. I then preceded to watch her in the distance drive like a bat out of hell down commercial and doing the EXACT SAME THING at every traffic light, just swerving into a turn lane then butting ahead of all the cars cutting them off at full speed. I have never seen such entitlement on the road, and it's minor miracle she hasn't caused an accident or hit someone. Again, this is the third time I have seen this car do this in the last few months, so it tells me she does this EVERY DAY. My Wife even asks if I saw the grey Ford focus today, it's a running inside joke now between the two of us, when we see anything crazy on the road. 

However this time I saw her final destination, she swerved through the intersection in front of the Ferry terminal, and veered full speed in the parking lot next to the Five County Credit union on commercial street, and speed walked in the bank with her same tag around her neck and work stuff (coffee mug bag etc). she works at the credit union.

I constantly feel somehow over-acidified. And my stool is usually rather soft. The nausea is usually very severe in the morning. Can these symptoms really be caused by this C gastritis? And where does it come from? I drank coffee on an empty stomach for many years and eat very few dairy products.... can this be the cause?

I have recently discovered histamine intolerance and realized I believe I have been dealing with it for around 5 years at this point. I have more background I can provide later if needed but I am trying to keep this short. I have been on a low-histamine diet for a full month and some change. Last week I re-introduced coffee (because I have had a very hard time without it, not caffeine, just the coffee lol) and all was well! No issues. This week, I started HistminX on top of my DAO enzyme that I introduced 2 weeks in (I take one about every 3 hours still), and well as my other supplements (vitamin D + k2, 1000mg vit c, magnesium, zinc + copper, and folate). Day 1 (12/09) took it later in the day because I didn't have a bigger meal before then and I was nervous. I could feel my digestion working but no negative side effects. I then took another the next morning (12/10) with my breakfast earlier in the day and had no side effects all day. I felt decently well. Well, night rolled around and I had what I call attacks, the main symptom of my histamine intolerances, which I believe are histamine dumps and only happen at night when I need to go to sleep. My usual symptoms are extreme anxiety/dreadful feeling all throughout my body, my upper arms tingle and feel numb, I get extremely cold, can't get warm and shiver, then turn around and sweaty and hot. I get diarrhea/nausea and any sensations I can't handle (being talked to, talking, being touched, even air being blown on me). This has not happened since I started the diet. 

Could this be a reaction to the probiotic? I'm wondering if I took them too closely, or maybe 2 days in a row was too much for my body to handle? The DAO and diet are not completely removing all symptoms (still hiving, still extremely fatigued and have sleep issues) so I'm not ready to give up on it entirely, since I've heard such good things. I'm positive my gut biome is wrecked, but I have not been to a GI to prove it.

She explained to me that when she was in her early 20s she had an affair and became pregnant, based off of my conception she wasn’t sure who my father was. She had told her affair partner that she was pregnant and he had told her to get an abortion and that if it was his he didn’t want children and would not be involved in any capacity. She scheduled the abortion, showed up to the appointment, and walked out while in the waiting room deciding she could not go through with it. She decided instead to keep the pregnancy and to live in ignorance. When I was born, I looked so much like her that she still did not know, and preferred to keep it that way. My dad and my mom had a turbulent relationship. My dad was always a good father to me growing up, but he was prone to anger and I could tell the two were never affectionate with each other. My dad and mom separated when I turned 16 and he passed away in a motor vehicle accident when I was 20. He never knew and I think because of his anger issues, it was for the best. 

After my mom told me, I took an ancestry test and it was confirmed that my biological father was my mother’s affair partner. I did reach out to him, and he had told me that he tried to look for me when I was a teenager but that he could not find my mom. We had a casual conversation where he revealed more details surrounding his relationship with my mother, more or less matching up with my mother’s version of events. I reunited the two of them and we all had coffee together, him traveling more than 2000 miles to have coffee with us. 

In the aftermath I maintain contact with my biological father via email and my mom and I continue to have a strong relationship. Being around my dad’s family feels somewhat awkward now, my grandmother on my dad’s side is still living though she is in her 80s now and I didn’t feel the need to tell her that I wasn’t her biological grandchild due to her age. 

It’s been years since I’ve taken my ancestry DNA test, however, I recently logged back in to work on my family tree. I maintain one for my dad with me on it and another one with my biological father and mom’s information.

1hbuur6,https://www.reddit.com/r/theassholeclub/comments/1hbuur6/ah_the_ageold_question_whats_the_deal_with/,"Ah, the age-old question: what’s the deal with assholes? ","It’s almost as if they have a secret club where they meet up to compare how many people they can annoy in a day. You know, I think part of the reason people have such a universal dislike for assholes is that they serve as a brilliant, albeit unfortunate, mirror for our own human frailties. 

When someone acts like an ass, it can dredge up feelings we often keep tightly tucked away in the back of our minds—like our own internal monologue that whispers, “Hey, you could totally be an asshole if you let your better self take a coffee break.” The more someone embodies behavior we secretly despise in ourselves—like selfishness, arrogance, or general rudeness—the more we tend to project our distaste right back at them. Classic psychological move! 

Let’s dig deeper! Assholes have a remarkable talent for being the human equivalent of a fly buzzing around a picnic—irritating, loud, and totally uninvited. They seem to thrive on drama, often relishing in causing discomfort among the rest of us, who just want to enjoy our metaphorical potato salad in peace. So when we encounter an ass, it’s like, “Whoa, buddy, chill out! We’re all just trying to vibe here!” 

Plus, there’s that delightful sprinkle of hypocrisy. We often catch ourselves acting like an asshole on occasion and then cringe because we know better (but let’s face it, a heated video game moment or being cut off in traffic can bring out the worst in us). So, when we see someone unleashing their inner jerk, it’s a little too close to home for comfort. It’s like watching ourselves in a cringe-worthy home video where we thought we were the star but ended up as the person who forgot their lines and tripped over their own feet. 

In a nutshell: yes, it’s definitely about that complex cocktail of self-reflection and sheer annoyance. But don’t you worry! There’s hope! The world’s filled with lovely, kind folks who make the asshole market crash. So when you feel the urge to join the “anti-asshole club,” just remember to check your own behavior too. Like any good superhero, it’s important to be in touch with our inner flaw and harness that energy into a superpower for good—or at least not being a jerk during happy hour!

Since taking Farxiga, my A1C has hovered between 5.6 and 5.9 on tests every six months. My peak blood sugar after a really bad meal (like Chick-fil-A) was 190. Normally, my blood sugar is between 90 and 130 during the day, and two hours post-eating, my highs are normally around 140-150. In the last two months, within about an hour of eating, no matter what I eat, I feel tired—like suddenly I have extreme diabetes- thirsty and urge to pee, but then my blood sugars are normal (105/116/104 in the last day). Is this likely something else? I am following up with my doctor this month. I'm eating less than in years prior and eating better as I work from home. My biggest caveat would be a cup of coffee w/ creamer in the morning. My worst crash is 3 pm post lunch. I've been doing yogurt (low sugar), bananas, apples, oatmeal, etc...

1hbuj6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchpress/comments/1hbuj6d/small_plasticfree_recs/,"Small, plastic-free recs?","My husband just broke the French Press and I figured I'd take the opportunity to actually research instead of just picking up whatever they happen to have at Target. 

I definitely want a small one. We've been using a 12oz glass (Bodum or maybe some knock-off?), which is just right. My husband and I prefer our coffee prepared very differently and don't usually have a second cup. And if there is a good one that doesn't break the bank and is entirely plastic-free on the inside that would be great!  I really don't like mixing plastic with food/beverages, and especially when there is heat involved.

I'm torn about material otherwise. We've always had glass, and it's nice to be able to see the coffee inside of it. But I'm not opposed to metal - it would certainly be more durable, and I like the idea of a double walled metal carafe for better insulation. I like that glass doesn't hold or impart weird flavors the way metal can, but I'm not sure how much to worry about that. While I have a hard time drinking water from a SS water bottle (it tastes like zapping) I'm fine with coffee from a SS travel mug for coffee. But also my husband likes this one flavored coffee that I find absolutely gross. Soap and water would be enough to prevent that from being a problem in a metal press, right?

  
Anything come to mind that is great? Should we just go with another Bodum since it seems to work well enough? Peeking quickly at prices, I see the Bodum Chambord 12oz retails for nearly $40, though is currently listed on their site for about $25. That seems like a reasonable rice range for what I want to spend on this purchase. If there were a compelling reason to go slightly higher (like maybe $50ish) I could justify doing that.

My sleep quality rn is the best it has ever been since ages. 

When I was still drinking caffeine, I always needed AT LEAST an hour to fall asleep. I thought that's just how it is for me and how it is going go be. I totally underestimated the effects of caffeine on sleep quality, because I only drank yerba mate in the morning and here and there a small coffee after lunch.

Now I fall asleep in max 15 minutes. And the sleep quality is insanely good. I dream again pretty much every night and wake up refreshed. 

It feels like when I was still drinking caffeine, I wasn't even getting real deep sleep.

I have also been tracking my decaf life with this app to get stats and motivation through the withdrawal and it says I already avoided more than 4g of caffeine and saved like 11€ (yerba mate is pretty cheap here).

Also it says prior to quitting, in my whole life I consumed over half a kilogram of pure caffeine ☠️. Imagine what damage that did to my sleep, fml haha

(It is the same for schoolwork. Group projects I will do first thing. But an individual essay I'll turn in late because I know I can write it and don't care if I prove it, I guess. Or I haven't done the reading and ran out of time.) 

I'm going to take a gap year and hope that helps but I just can't envision what career I can ever do that's meaningful. I like astronomy, but I've learned that's mostly coding all day. I am interested in creative writing, but that is also a solo activity. Sure, both have moments of collaboration and opportunities for group work, but the main work is done independently. I'll never do it. 

I'm scared and depressed. I don't want to go to college and fail because I'm just not doing the work. Even if u could, I think it would just lead to a lonely boring career that I hate. Any ideas? I haven't decided what to do with my gap year yet. My mom thinks I should go volunteer for Habitat for Humanity or something like that. I might like that, but I'm not sure how it's gonna help me figure out how to do homework in college or  what to do with my life.",5,1733926561.0,findapath,4,0.86,False
