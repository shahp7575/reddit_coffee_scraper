My Ninja CFN602 broke, so I bought the ES701.

* The tamping function is too open to inconsistency
* The intelligent grind took 6 shots to not suggest a change ($$!)
* The ""coffee"" is begging for a paper filter
* Big cups physically don't fit for the big volumes, whether wide or tall
* The volume that comes out is always less than it should be (i tried tamping less, this even includes the no-tamp coffee sizes)

I think the 1st gen machine would have been better for me, where I could tamp myself, but that alone would not be enough to fix my view on this machine. If you're primary goal is good espresso there are better machines for that, and don't get this thinking the ""drip coffee"" will satisfy / compare to your past experience with paper filtered coffee.

## Key features Analysis

The Cuisinart 12 Cup Replacement Carafe should possess specific features to ensure seamless compatibility,durability,and ease of use. These factors are crucial for optimal performance and longevity.

**Material and Build Quality:** The carafe is typically made from high-quality glass or thermal stainless steel. A robust borosilicate glass carafe is designed to withstand high temperatures and resist cracking, ensuring long-term reliability. Alternatively, a stainless-steel thermal carafe will maintain the coffee's temperature for a prolonged period.

The borosilicate glass resists thermal shock, meaning it withstands rapid temperature changes without shattering. The stainless-steel versions are usually double-walled and vacuum-sealed,providing excellent insulation and preventing heat loss.Both options should have a sturdy handle and a well-designed spout for easy pouring.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring the replacement carafe is compatible with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model is crucial. Cuisinart coffee makers vary in design, and a universal fit is unlikely. Always check the product description or the manufacturer's website to confirm compatibility.

Many replacement carafes are designed to precisely fit specific Cuisinart models, such as the DCC-1200 series. Verifying the specific model number ensures proper alignment with the coffee maker's brewing system, preventing leaks and ensuring a secure fit during brewing and pouring. Failure to check compatibility may result in purchasing a carafe that is unusable with your coffee maker.

**Capacity and Markings:** A standard Cuisinart 12-cup carafe holds approximately 60 ounces of brewed coffee, equivalent to twelve 5-ounce cups. Accurate measurement markings are critical for precise brewing.

Clear and easy-to-read volume markings allow users to accurately measure the amount of water needed for brewing different quantities of coffee. these markings are typically displayed in both ounces and cups, providing flexibility for various brewing preferences.Durable markings that don't fade after repeated washing are preferable.

**Drip-Free Pouring Spout:** The design of the pouring spout is vital to prevent spills and drips while serving coffee. A well-designed spout ensures a smooth, controlled pour without creating a mess on your countertop.

The spout should be engineered to minimize backflow and prevent coffee from running down the side of the carafe. A sharp, defined edge and accurate spout alignment are critical for drip-free pouring. Some carafes also feature a hinged lid that can be opened and closed for controlled pouring.

**Easy Cleaning:** A carafe that is easy to clean simplifies maintenance and ensures optimal hygiene. Dishwasher-safe carafes are especially convenient, saving time and effort in daily cleaning.

Wide-mouth openings allow for easy access for hand washing, while smooth interior surfaces prevent coffee residue from sticking. Removable parts, such as lids or filters, should also be dishwasher safe. Regular cleaning prevents the build-up of oils and minerals that can affect coffee flavor and overall hygiene.

## core Benefits

The Cuisinart 12 Cup Replacement Carafe provides several significant benefits, improving the overall coffee-making experience and convenience.**Consistent brewing:** A compatible replacement carafe ensures consistent brewing by maintaining proper alignment and sealing with the coffee maker. This prevents leaks and ensures the coffee is brewed correctly, resulting in a consistently flavorful beverage.

A properly fitting carafe ensures that the coffee is brewed at the ideal temperature and pressure, preserving its aroma and flavors. When the carafe is securely in place, you can expect optimal extraction of coffee solids, leading to a richer and more satisfying cup of coffee every time

**Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan:** Replacing a broken or damaged carafe instead of the entire coffee maker saves money and extends the life of your appliance. Investing in a quality replacement carafe can prolong the usefulness of your existing coffee maker.

A quality carafe that fits and functions properly prevents strain on the coffee maker's components, such as the heating element and the pump. the availability of replacement carafes allows consumers to keep their appliances running smoothly at minimal cost.This also contributes to reducing e-waste by not discarding a functional appliance merely becuase of a single broken component.

**Improved Safety:** A sturdy, well-designed replacement carafe minimizes the risk of accidents, such as burns from spills or cuts from broken glass. A secure handle and a drip-free spout contribute to safer coffee serving.

Strong heat-resistant glass or stainless-steel materials reduce the likelihood of cracking or shattering while handling hot liquids. The ergonomic design of the handle provides a pleasant, secure grip, preventing drops and spills.Drip-free spouts minimize the risk of coffee running down the sides of the carafe and perhaps scalding the user.

**Maintained Coffee Quality:** Using a replacement carafe made from appropriate materials helps maintain the taste and temperature of your coffee. Some carafes are designed to keep coffee warm for extended periods, while others prevent flavor absorption.

Thermal carafes will keep the coffee hot for hours without affecting the taste or aroma, as coffee does not continue to brew once inside the carafe. Glass options are non-reactive, meaning they won't impart any unwanted flavors to the coffee. Regular cleaning of the carafe also helps prevent the buildup of old coffee oils, which can degrade the taste of freshly brewed coffee.

## FAQs Section

**How can I ensure the replacement carafe fits my Cuisinart coffee maker?**
To guarantee a proper fit, always check the model number of your coffee maker and compare it with the compatibility facts provided by the seller or manufacturer of the replacement carafe. This information is typically found on the bottom of the coffee maker.

Refer to the Cuisinart's user manual or manufacturer‚Äôs website to verify the compatible carafe part number. Measure the dimensions of the old carafe (if available) and compare them with the specifications of the replacement option to ensure similarity. Online customer reviews can also give insight regarding fit and performance.

**What material is best for a Cuisinart 12 cup replacement carafe, glass or stainless steel?**
Both glass and stainless steel have their advantages. Glass carafes are non-reactive and dishwasher safe, while stainless steel carafes are more durable and offer better heat retention.Glass carafes, typically made from borosilicate glass, are resistant to thermal shock and won't impart any flavors into the coffee. stainless-steel versions are less prone to breakage and can keep coffee hot for several hours without the use of a warming plate, which can scorch or alter the coffee‚Äôs taste. The choice depends on your usage habits and preferences in terms of durability and temperature control.

**How frequently enough should I clean my Cuisinart replacement coffee carafe?**
Regular cleaning is essential to maintain hygiene and preserve coffee flavor. It is recommended to clean the carafe after each use with warm soapy water.

A thorough cleaning should be done at least once a week, or more frequently if you notice a buildup of coffee oils or mineral deposits. Dishwasher-safe carafes can be cleaned in the dishwasher, while others can be hand-washed with the help of a long-handled brush. Regular cleaning removes any residual oils and minerals that may affect taste.

**What can I do to prevent my glass carafe from breaking from temperature changes?**
Avoid drastic temperature changes and ensure the carafe is at room temperature before brewing. Never place a hot carafe on a cold surface or vice versa.

Preheating the carafe with warm water can help to minimize the risk of thermal shock before brewing. Allow the carafe to cool down gradually before washing it. Handle the glass carafe with care and prevent impacts.

They‚Äôre wrong.

The extra one hides between 3:59 AM and 4:00 AM ‚Äî a sliver of time that doesn‚Äôt belong. Most people never feel it. But if you‚Äôre unlucky enough to be awake, it finds you.

I used to work the overnight shift at a roadside diner off Route 41. It was dead most nights ‚Äî a few truckers, the occasional drunk, nothing unusual. Until that night.

A man in a grimy leather jacket sat at the counter, staring into his coffee like it held answers. His hands shook, but not from cold.
‚ÄúYou see them too?‚Äù he asked without looking up.

Before I could ask, the lights flickered. Not the kind of flicker from bad wiring ‚Äî this was like the world had blinked, and when it opened its eyes again, something was different.

The windows no longer showed the highway. Outside was a corridor of black, as if the diner floated in a void. The hum of the fridge was gone. Even my own breath felt muted.

Then the ticking started.

At first, it was faint ‚Äî a slow, deliberate tick-tick-tick, like a clock somewhere deep inside the walls. But it wasn‚Äôt coming from the walls. It was coming closer.

They appeared in the glass:
Long-limbed things, pale and stretched like old paper left in rain. Their heads tilted unnaturally far, like broken marionettes. Their teeth weren‚Äôt jagged ‚Äî they were thin, carved to points so fine they shimmered when they breathed.

They didn‚Äôt speak.
They knocked.

Not a knock like a person would ‚Äî more like testing wood for hollowness. They tapped on the windows, the counter, the metal coffee pot‚Ä¶ then, impossibly, the skin of my chest. Each knock was cold, vibrating in my bones.

The trucker whispered:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer. They only need one word to get in.‚Äù

But the lights went out again, and in that blackness, something whispered my name. Not from outside. From directly behind me.

When the light returned, the trucker was gone. His stool was still warm, but where his coffee had been was a mug filled with black liquid‚Ä¶ and floating in it, a small brass clock hand, slick with blood.

I grabbed my phone. The time read 13:00.
It blinked once, then changed back to 4:00 AM.


---

Since that night, I‚Äôve felt them more often. It always starts with that heaviness in the air, then the ticking, then the knocking. My mirrors no longer show my reflection during the hour ‚Äî only the corridor, stretching away into infinity, with pale shapes at the far end.

And lately, they‚Äôve been knocking from inside my walls.

If you‚Äôre reading this, you still have a chance.
Never be awake at 3:59. Never look at the clock when it changes. And whatever you do ‚Äî never, ever answer when they say your name.

Because once you answer, the knocking never stops.

1mq4z4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mq4z4t/reveal_if_this_best_cord_organizer_daisyhome/,Reveal if This Best Cord Organizer Daisyhome Truly Solves Kitchen Clutter,"The Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 is one of those products I didn‚Äôt know I truly needed until I started using it in my kitchen. As someone who constantly battles the chaos of stray appliance cords, the appliance cord organizer has been a game changer. It‚Äôs specifically marketed to tidy up messy wires on various kitchen appliances, and I must say, it has largely lived up to its promises. Between the coffee maker, the stand mixer, the air fryer, and my ever-reliable pressure cooker, there were always cords getting tangled or worse‚Äîfalling off the counter. This product has been helping me cut through that clutter, although it‚Äôs not without its quirks.  

**A User-Friendly Design that Delivers Simplicity**  
The design of this cord organizer is impressively straightforward. It‚Äôs made with high-quality rubber, ensuring it‚Äôs both flexible and durable. I especially appreciated the fact that its sticking part uses odorless nano tape, which adheres well without leaving sticky traces when removed. The three slots for holding wires of different diameters are a fabulous touch. From large, thick pressure cooker cords to smaller blender cables, I haven‚Äôt run into any issues finding something it couldn‚Äôt hold. The compact size also means it‚Äôs discreet enough not to ruin the aesthetic of my sleek black coffee maker or pastel-toned toaster.

[Check Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dg8hrxpq/)

**Wide Compatibility for Various Kitchen Gadgets**  
Having tested it on numerous appliances, the versatility of this little tool is what stood out to me. It works on everything from air fryers to juicers, microwaves, and toasters. I even tried attaching it to my countertop blender, and although I was slightly skeptical at first due to the weight of its larger cord, the adhesive held firm. It‚Äôs great not having those cords hanging off the side anymore, especially when counter space is such prime real estate. However, I do wonder how well it would hold up in high-humidity environments like kitchens adjacent to dishwashers or ovens.

**Upsides**  
- Premium rubber material ensures lasting durability.  
- Nano tape sticks well and leaves no residue.  
- Three cable slots accommodate varying cord sizes effectively.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Requires a six-hour wait after installation for adhesive to set firmly.  
- May not securely hold exceptionally heavy appliance cords.  

**Performance and Durability: Built to Last?**  
After several weeks of daily use, I‚Äôm pleased with how durable this cord organizer has proven to be. I frequently wrap and unwrap cords depending on how often I use the respective appliances, and the material hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of tearing or deformation. The adhesive tape has held up surprisingly well; there‚Äôs no sliding or loosening over time, even after repeated use. However, I do notice that the cord winder seems best suited for permanent setups. Once or twice, I had to reposition one, and each time I peeled it off, the adhesive effectiveness was noticeably reduced. Frequent relocations might require additional tape. 

**Ease of Installation: Quick but Requires Patience**  
Installing these organizers really is as simple as advertised. You clean the target area, peel off the protective layer on the back, and stick it onto your appliance. That said, there‚Äôs a bit of a catch‚ÄîI had to wait for six hours before I could start wrapping cords around it due to the adhesive needing time to set. If you‚Äôre impatient like me, this waiting period might test your nerves. Once the adhesive settled, though, the process of wrapping up the cords was seamless. 

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve come across similar products that promise similar levels of utility, but few embody the same combination of flexibility, adhesive quality, and compatibility with multiple wire sizes. Some alternatives are made from rigid plastic, which doesn‚Äôt contour well to curved appliance surfaces like this one does. On the downside, competitors sometimes ship with stronger adhesive options, providing longer-lasting adherence, particularly in humid conditions. If the Daisyhome product could elevate its adhesive longevity a notch further, it would undoubtedly outperform every rival in its category.

**Affordable Quality**  
The value-for-money aspect here is where Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 really shines. While you could argue about finding cheaper alternatives, you‚Äôre unlikely to come across something that balances ease of use, durability, and design quite this well. For the price, an eight-pack is a generous quantity, allowing you to optimize all your most-used appliances, perhaps even dedicating more than one cord winder to your larger devices. Considering the number of products that fail to live up to simpler promises, this feels like a fair trade-off for improved kitchen organization.

I titrated up to 300 XL. On the positive side, I almost instantly had zero desire for nicotine. I was previously a vaper.

I tried patches and got the point where I was only using nicotine pouches but I couldn‚Äôt kick it entirely. As soon as I started bup, like a couple days in, I just stopped using nicotine. Just never thought about it and that was incredible. I also had little to no desire for coffee, which was interesting. I

On the negative side, I had a pretty rough time for the first six weeks or so with dizziness and vertigo. Some days were totally fine and others were awful. I couldn‚Äôt tell what was triggering it to be worse on those days but it would get so bad that I would become nauseous. I seemed to experience it more during the week than on the weekends. When I was trying to read my kindle, I felt like I was in an amusement park ride. It was really weird. I just felt sort of high (not in a good way) and not grounded and loopy. It was not fun at all. 

Luckily, at about six weeks it started to decrease, it was almost totally gone at eight weeks and at 10 weeks I don‚Äôt experience it at all. Now, I don‚Äôt have any negative side effects at all. Just zero desire for nicotine, which I‚Äôm still very grateful for. 

I was very close to going off bup because of how bad the dizziness was but this subreddit helped me push through and I‚Äôm very glad I did so thank you all!",1,1755187708.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False
1mq4y9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mq4y9i/examine_the_best_electric_kettle_elite_gourmet/,Examine the best electric kettle Elite Gourmet EKT719 and see if it's worth packing for travel,"The Elite Gourmet EKT719 immediately caught my attention for its unique blend of compact design and versatility, and I‚Äôll admit‚ÄîI was skeptical. A dual voltage electric kettle that‚Äôs small enough to travel with, yet functional for daily use? It sounded too good to be true. Over the past month, I‚Äôve been using this little powerhouse every day in my kitchen and even packed it for a weekend trip. My inner tea lover has a lot to say about it, both good and bad.

**Design and Build**  
At first glance, the Elite Gourmet EKT719 comes off as unassuming. Its sleek black matte finish and brushed stainless steel interior looked neat sitting on my counter. The retractable handle is a small but thoughtful touch that I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I actually packed it into my travel bag. We‚Äôre talking about a kettle that fits into tight spaces, making it a gem for smaller kitchens, dorm rooms, and RVs. While doing this review, I kept marveling at how lightweight it is‚Äîjust 1.7 pounds. That‚Äôs less than my laptop! However, I sometimes catch myself wishing the lid hinge were a tad sturdier; it doesn‚Äôt feel fragile, but it‚Äôs not as robust as I‚Äôd prefer for constant handling.

**Performance as a Travel Companion**  
Switching between 120VAC and 220‚Äì240VAC is a breeze thanks to the voltage switch at the bottom. On a trip abroad, I used it in a hotel with a 220V outlet without any hiccups. But the standout feature has to be the cool touch exterior. Even after boiling water, the body remains safe to touch, which saved me from having to awkwardly handle a hot kettle in tight spaces. Say goodbye to those moments of juggling a scalding countertop appliance‚Äîthis design has your back.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and lightweight for travel and small spaces.  
- Cool-touch exterior is a game-changer for safety.  
- Dual voltage flexibility is perfect for international use.  
- Retractable handle enhances portability.  

**Performance and Features**  
This electric kettle boasts a 600ml capacity, which is ideal for one or two cups of tea or coffee. While it‚Äôs not made for large gatherings, it serves its purpose well. My favorite feature is how quickly it heats water‚Äîjust around 3 minutes to reach a rolling boil. Plus, the stainless-steel interior ensures that my water tastes pure, with no plasticky residue creeping in. On the flipside, the lid button, while convenient, occasionally sticks if pressed from an angle. Small annoyance, but not a dealbreaker. Another subtle yet welcome addition is the free-flow filter on the pouring spout. It ensures that the water stream is smooth, avoiding any splashes or misfires into the cup.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The lid mechanism could feel more robust.  
- Small capacity might not suit families or large groups.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the Elite Gourmet EKT719 to other compact kettles like the AmazonBasics Stainless Steel Kettle and the Bodum Travel Tea & Coffee Press, I noticed they all cater to similar audiences. Where the Elite Gourmet shines is in its cool-touch body and retractable handle, two features the competitors lack. However, the AmazonBasics kettle offers a slightly larger capacity and quicker boiling time, while the Bodum provides the added function of a built-in coffee press. If portability and a sleek design are priorities, this kettle beats them. But for sheer capacity or added coffee functionality, those alternatives might appeal more.  

**Value to Quality Ratio**  
Let‚Äôs talk money. You get a lot for a kettle this size. The dual voltage, portability, and high-quality materials make this a worthwhile investment for avid travelers or anyone living in cramped spaces. While it won‚Äôt replace a larger kettle for hosting afternoon tea parties, the Elite Gourmet EKT719 is hard to beat in its niche.

1mq4uz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1mq4uz3/hypnagogic_hallucinations/,Hypnagogic Hallucinations,"I have been a bad sleeper since I was a child, mostly because I am plagued by nightmares every night, night sweats, I sleep talk, etc. I have gone to sleep doctors, done sleep studies, which always come back ""fine"". I also suffer from hypnagogic hallucinations and jerks. So I have never ever really slept well. I usually had a 30 min nap in the middle of the day if I could (I know this is very frowned upon but I had tried no naps and I just couldn't get through the day and then I noticed no difference in my sleep...).

However, a few months ago I stated to wake up very early, around 5am. I then stopped able to have naps and since then my sleep has deteriorated to extreme levels. I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on Zoloft a couple of weeks ago and I ended up in Urgent Care, where I was told I had a mild case of serotonin syndrome which ended up destroying my sleep totally. I am now waking up every 20 mins and the worst part is that I am half-waking up to my hypnagogic hallucinations, which are not thoughts I can control: sometimes I see people in the room, last night I thought someone had put needles in my bed, that my cats were meowing (they were asleep) and I woke up walking around. I even experience this waking/hallucinating cycle if I try to nap. It is torture to be subjected to hours and hours of a tornado of images and thoughts. I feel like my brain is broken.

Except sleeping pills, I've tried so many things throughout my life to help myself: I do exercise every day, eat well, I do breathing exercises, keep the a room cool, I try my best to have sleep hygiene and cut devices to a minimum before sleeping. I only drink chai tea in the morning and no coffee at all... I am now doing the ""sleep school"" app which has helped a bit in terms of coping with this mentally but not with my sleep. I know I just have to accept the insomnia but the constant pummeling of the hallucinations is very hard.

1mq4t9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mq4t9y/does_the_breville_vertuoplus_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Breville VertuoPlus Coffee Maker Deliver Barista-Level Quality?,"The Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 has become a centerpiece in my kitchen since the moment I unboxed it. As someone who thrives on caffeine to kickstart the day, I was eager to put this coffee and espresso machine to the test. With its promise of versatility and convenience, my excitement to give this a try was palpable. This machine doesn‚Äôt just brew coffee‚Äîit crafts an experience for coffee enthusiasts. Whether you're in the mood for a quick espresso shot or a larger coffee cup, it seems like this machine has you covered. But does it live up to the hype? Here‚Äôs everything I discovered.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
This coffee maker looks classy and sophisticated on the countertop. Its Titan finish coupled with a streamlined design immediately connects with a modern kitchen vibe. It doesn't take up an excessive amount of space, which is a relief because counter space is prime real estate in my relatively compact kitchen. The water reservoir is another highlight; it‚Äôs adjustable and swivels, making it easy to fit snugly depending on your space constraints. While the aesthetics impressed me, the durability of the plastic exterior felt a tad underwhelming for a premium-feel product. It's lightweight, which is convenient for moving around, but also makes you wonder about its long-term sturdiness.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Convenience**  
Brewing coffee or espresso with this machine is absurdly simple‚Äîjust pop in a Nespresso capsule and hit the button. The automatic capsule recognition thanks to the Centrifusion technology really stands out. It scans the barcode on each pod and adjusts the brewing parameters accordingly, so you don‚Äôt have to fiddle around with settings for the perfect cup. I‚Äôm the sort of person who prefers effort-free coffee on groggy mornings, and this aspect felt like a godsend. However, those who prefer customizing their brew might find the lack of manual control slightly limiting. The included Aeroccino frother is another game changer. It consistently produces smooth milk froth for lattes or cappuccinos, whether you want it hot or cold. I‚Äôve been making my iced lattes daily ever since.

**Advantages**  
This product doesn't mess around when it comes to features that make life easier.  
- Dual brewing options for coffee and espresso queasily adapt to your mood.  
- Adjustable water reservoir for flexible placement in tight spaces.  
- Energy-saving mode and auto shut-off after 9 minutes makes it eco-friendly.  
- It comes bundled with a set of Nespresso Vertuo capsules to kickstart your experience.  
- The Aeroccino frother is incredibly efficient and surprisingly quiet.  

[Check Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b01n36ugge/)

**Drawbacks**  
As much as I‚Äôve relished using this coffee maker daily, it‚Äôs not without its flaws.  
- It is locked into the Nespresso ecosystem, so you‚Äôre tied to their proprietary capsules.  
- Capsule cost adds up quickly if you drink multiple cups per day.  
- Despite being adjustable, refill access for the water tank isn‚Äôt the most intuitive.  
- Compared to traditional espresso machines, it lacks full manual brewing controls.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
What truly makes this machine standout is its ability to brew four different cup sizes: a 1.35-oz espresso, 2.7-oz double espresso, 5-oz Gran Lungo, and 7.7-oz coffee. The machine transitions seamlessly between brewing types while preserving consistent flavor. I‚Äôve brewed everything from shots of espresso in the morning to iced coffee for lazy afternoons, and the results are almost always spot-on. Heat-up time is among the fastest I‚Äôve seen in machines like this, taking only about 20 seconds. While brewing, it‚Äôs not silent, but it‚Äôs far from intrusive compared to older-generation coffee makers. The automatic ejection of used capsules into the built-in storage has been a surprising convenience, as I don‚Äôt have to handle soggy capsules.

**Product Comparisons**  
Exploring similar options like Keurig or DeLonghi‚Äôs espresso machines was inevitable before deciding on this one. Keurig is highly customizable and compatible with a broader range of pods, which could make it more appealing for families with broad coffee preferences. However, the flavor extraction in Keurig falls short of the smooth, rich profiles produced by this coffee maker. On the other side, DeLonghi machines offer intricate manual controls for coffee connoisseurs but take a lot more effort to prepare a perfect cup. The Breville model comfortably straddles the middle ground, prioritizing flavor and ease over some advanced customizability.

**Value for Money**  
This machine fits comfortably in the category of affordable quality. While initial investment and capsule costs may deter budget shoppers, anyone valuing convenience and premium coffee will find it worth every penny. It‚Äôs excellent for those who enjoy caf√©-style coffee without exerting extra effort or venturing outside daily. If you‚Äôre an espresso lover or someone who alternates between coffee styles, this is as close to a barista experience as you‚Äôll get at home.

1mq4srd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mq4srd/delve_into_the_best_coffee_machines_with_this/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Machines with This Ninja CM300 Review,"Testing the Ninja CM300 coffee machine for over a month truly gave me insight into its usability and overall performance. This compact and stylish coffee maker is designed to cater to coffee lovers with an array of brew styles and sizes, all without relying on pods‚Äîa huge plus for the environmentally conscious among us. Initially, I was drawn in by its ability to create anything from rich, bold morning coffees to refreshing, never-watered-down iced coffee for those hot afternoons. As someone who drinks coffee multiple times a day, this gadget intrigued me from the start.

**Performance and Brew Options**  
The machine offers three distinct brew styles‚ÄîClassic, Rich, and Over Ice. For me, the standout was the Over Ice feature. It truly delivers a full-bodied iced coffee without that unpleasant watered-down effect some machines struggle to avoid. I tried several variations and was impressed each time by how it maintained flavor integrity despite the ice. When testing the Classic and Rich settings, both brewed consistently clean cups with no residual bitterness, a frequent issue with other machines I‚Äôve tested in the past. Whether making a single mug or filling the 10-cup carafe, the results were reliable every morning.

[Find the best price for Ninja CM300 on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b09xy4h285/)

**Upsides**  
‚Ä¢ The removable water reservoir simplifies refills and prevents messes during prep.  
‚Ä¢ Multiple brew sizes mean I can make a quick personal cup or a carafe for guests.  
‚Ä¢ It includes an adjustable warming plate keeping coffee hot for up to four hours, ideal for long mornings.  
‚Ä¢ The reusable filter minimizes waste and cuts down on recurring costs compared to disposable pods.  

**Ease of Use and Design**  
Operating this coffee maker is straightforward. Everything is digitally controlled‚Äîjust push the right button, fill the included Smart Scoop, and let the machine handle the rest. Its compact design fits snugly on my counter without monopolizing space. Plus, the stainless-steel accents blend perfectly with my kitchen appliances. Though I‚Äôll admit cleaning can be somewhat time-consuming, particularly if you‚Äôre rushed in the morning‚Äîbut hey, sacrifices.

**Hurdles**  
‚Ä¢ It doesn‚Äôt include the double-sided scoop, which would‚Äôve been convenient.  
‚Ä¢ Cleaning the unit is slightly tedious due to the design of the carafe and water reservoir.  
‚Ä¢ For individuals using it more casually, the price might seem steep compared to simpler coffee makers.  

**Competing Products**  
While testing several machines within this price range, I found a few to compare with the Ninja CM300. For instance, the Keurig K-Elite offers pod brewing, which simplifies operation, but it lacks the ability to adjust the richness or brew strength. On the other hand, the Breville Bambino Plus excels in espresso crafting but proves far less versatile for regular coffee drinkers like me. Where the CM300 shines is in its multi-functionality‚Äîbeing able to shift between brew sizes and settings keeps it ahead in versatility.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its features, this coffee maker provides substantial value for a coffee enthusiast. The long-term savings from avoiding disposable coffee pods cannot be overstated, and its energy-efficient design adds another layer of practicality. For me, whether brewing my morning fix or creating refreshing iced coffee in the evening, I felt the investment balanced well with its output.

**I used to think perfect was the goal.**

100% on every test. Nailed every presentation. Assignments polished until 2am because that one comma felt off.

In high school, I played 5 varsity sports while keeping grades squeaky clean. I wasn‚Äôt just chasing gold stars. I needed them. Because perfect meant worthy. It meant I was doing things right.

Then came university.

Smith School of Business at Queen‚Äôs. One of the top business programs in the country. The dream. Proof that all those sleepless nights paid off‚Ä¶ right?

But here‚Äôs the thing no one tells you when you‚Äôve been chasing perfection your whole life:

>**Perfection is impossible.**

You can‚Äôt ace every class, be the most social person, show up to every event, get enough sleep, and build a meaningful life all at once. Something has to give.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean your brain lets you off the hook.

Even when I knew I didn‚Äôt need to be perfect anymore, I still obsessed over the details. I still beat myself up for a 92. I still spent way too much time making things 5 percent better for an audience who wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the difference anyway.

And that‚Äôs where perfectionism becomes the problem.

>**When perfect becomes the enemy of done**

Perfectionism sounds noble. But it often hides fear. Fear of judgment, failure, not being good enough.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned the hard way:

* **It slows you down.**¬†While others move forward with good enough, you're stuck polishing the same paragraph for the third hour.
* **It raises your stress for no real gain.**¬†No one but you cares if it‚Äôs 99 percent or 100 percent.
* **It holds you back from the stuff that actually matters.**¬†Because sometimes the 10 percent of energy you spend chasing ""perfect"" could have gone toward other work, people, memories, or growth.

>**Perfectionism‚Äôs sneaky side effect: Procrastination**

One of the wildest realizations I‚Äôve had?  
Perfectionism doesn‚Äôt just make you work harder. It sometimes stops you from starting at all.

When you set impossibly high standards for everything you do, it becomes way too easy to:

* **Avoid tasks entirely**¬†if you‚Äôre not sure you can do them perfectly
* **Abandon projects halfway through**¬†because they aren‚Äôt turning out how you imagined
* **Overthink the first step**¬†so much that you never take it

It‚Äôs that ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù mindset. If it‚Äôs not going to be flawless, why even try?

But here‚Äôs the truth:  
**Done (and imperfect) beats perfect (and incomplete) every time.**  
**Progress only happens when you start.**

>**There‚Äôs a middle ground**

Perfectionism gave me a strong work ethic. It taught me discipline. I still believe in showing up and giving your best.

But I‚Äôve come to believe that your best doesn‚Äôt always mean the best.

It means being proud of what you made. Not perfecting it until you're burnt out.

It means knowing when to double down. And when to let go.

It means recognizing that your time, energy, and memories are finite. And not everything needs to be an A-plus to be worthwhile.

>**If I could go back‚Ä¶**

People ask me what I‚Äôd change if I could go back.

My answer?

**CARE A LITTLE LESS.**  
And care a little more about being present.

I‚Äôd remind myself that the world won‚Äôt end over a missed mark. That the resume line doesn‚Äôt matter if you burned out writing it. That being remembered for kindness, curiosity, and presence matters more than being known as the kid who never got less than an A.

I‚Äôd skip a few more classes to make memories I can still laugh about.

I‚Äôd take the night off to go sit with my family in the living room doing absolutely nothing because those moments mean more than we realize.

I‚Äôd worry less about what the teacher would think and more about what kind of person I was becoming.

I‚Äôd forgive myself faster. For messing up. For falling short. For being human.

>**If you're in it right now‚Ä¶**

If you're reading this while running on too little sleep and too much pressure‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre holding it together for the grades, the teams, the clubs, the expectations‚Ä¶

Take this as your reminder:

* **Your GPA is not your worth.**
* **Your productivity is not your identity.**
* **You don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out.**
* **No one has it all together even if it looks like they do.**
* **That thing you're stressing about? You probably won‚Äôt remember it in a year.**

It‚Äôs okay to care deeply. That‚Äôs what makes you great.

Just don‚Äôt let the pressure steal your joy.

You won‚Äôt remember the 93 instead of the 97.  
But you will remember the late-night drive with your best friends.  
The coffee with your sibling before they moved away.  
The dumb risk that turned into your favourite memory.  
The time you skipped that class to go play some pond hockey.

Perfection is a myth.  
Growth is real.  
Presence is powerful.

You‚Äôre doing better than you think.  
And you‚Äôve got time to become whoever you want to be.

We‚Äôre all just¬†*almost something*‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs perfect.

>**Almost Something**

I write these as a way to unpack what I‚Äôm learning in real time. Sometimes it‚Äôs a breakthrough. Sometimes it‚Äôs a confession. But it‚Äôs always honest.

If you're figuring it out as you go too, welcome to the club.

I also suffer from hypnagogic hallucinations and jerks. So I have never ever really slept well. I usually had a 30 min nap in the middle of the day if I could (I know this is very frowned upon but I had tried no naps and I just couldn't get through the day and then I noticed no difference in my sleep...).

However, a few months ago I stated to wake up very early, around 5am. I then stopped able to have naps and since then my sleep has deteriorated to extreme levels. I went to a psychiatrist and he put me on Zoloft a couple of weeks ago and I ended up in Urgent Care, where I was told I had a mild case of serotonin syndrome which ended up destroying my sleep totally. I am now waking up every 20 mins and the worst part is that I am half-waking up to my hypnagogic hallucinations, which are not thoughts I can control: sometimes I see people in the room, last night I thought someone had put needles in my bed, that my cats were meowing (they were asleep) and I woke up walking around. I even experience this waking/hallucinating cycle if I try to nap. It is torture to be subjected to hours and hours of a tornado of images and thoughts. I feel like my brain is broken.

Except sleeping pills, I've tried so many things throughout my life to help myself: I do exercise every day, eat well, I do breathing exercises, keep the a room cool, I try my best to have sleep hygiene and cut devices to a minimum before sleeping. I only drink chai tea in the morning and no coffee at all... I am now doing the ""sleep school"" app which has helped a bit in terms of coping with this mentally but not with my sleep.

Smith School of Business at Queen‚Äôs. One of the top business programs in the country. The dream. Proof that all those sleepless nights paid off‚Ä¶ right?

But here‚Äôs the thing no one tells you when you‚Äôve been chasing perfection your whole life:

>**Perfection is impossible.**

You can‚Äôt ace every class, be the most social person, show up to every event, get enough sleep, and build a meaningful life all at once. Something has to give.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean your brain lets you off the hook.

Even when I knew I didn‚Äôt need to be perfect anymore, I still obsessed over the details. I still beat myself up for a 92. I still spent way too much time making things 5 percent better for an audience who wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the difference anyway.

And that‚Äôs where perfectionism becomes the problem.

>**When perfect becomes the enemy of done**

Perfectionism sounds noble. But it often hides fear. Fear of judgment, failure, not being good enough.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned the hard way:

* **It slows you down.**¬†While others move forward with good enough, you're stuck polishing the same paragraph for the third hour.
* **It raises your stress for no real gain.**¬†No one but you cares if it‚Äôs 99 percent or 100 percent.
* **It holds you back from the stuff that actually matters.**¬†Because sometimes the 10 percent of energy you spend chasing ""perfect"" could have gone toward other work, people, memories, or growth.

>**Perfectionism‚Äôs sneaky side effect: Procrastination**

One of the wildest realizations I‚Äôve had?  
Perfectionism doesn‚Äôt just make you work harder. It sometimes stops you from starting at all.

When you set impossibly high standards for everything you do, it becomes way too easy to:

* **Avoid tasks entirely**¬†if you‚Äôre not sure you can do them perfectly
* **Abandon projects halfway through**¬†because they aren‚Äôt turning out how you imagined
* **Overthink the first step**¬†so much that you never take it

It‚Äôs that ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù mindset. If it‚Äôs not going to be flawless, why even try?

But here‚Äôs the truth:  
**Done (and imperfect) beats perfect (and incomplete) every time.**  
**Progress only happens when you start.**

>**There‚Äôs a middle ground**

Perfectionism gave me a strong work ethic. It taught me discipline. I still believe in showing up and giving your best.

But I‚Äôve come to believe that your best doesn‚Äôt always mean the best.

It means being proud of what you made. Not perfecting it until you're burnt out.

It means knowing when to double down. And when to let go.

It means recognizing that your time, energy, and memories are finite. And not everything needs to be an A-plus to be worthwhile.

>**If I could go back‚Ä¶**

People ask me what I‚Äôd change if I could go back.

My answer?

**CARE A LITTLE LESS.**  
And care a little more about being present.

I‚Äôd remind myself that the world won‚Äôt end over a missed mark. That the resume line doesn‚Äôt matter if you burned out writing it. That being remembered for kindness, curiosity, and presence matters more than being known as the kid who never got less than an A.

I‚Äôd skip a few more classes to make memories I can still laugh about.

I‚Äôd take the night off to go sit with my family in the living room doing absolutely nothing because those moments mean more than we realize.

I‚Äôd worry less about what the teacher would think and more about what kind of person I was becoming.

I‚Äôd forgive myself faster. For messing up. For falling short. For being human.

>**If you're in it right now‚Ä¶**

If you're reading this while running on too little sleep and too much pressure‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre holding it together for the grades, the teams, the clubs, the expectations‚Ä¶

Take this as your reminder:

* **Your GPA is not your worth.**
* **Your productivity is not your identity.**
* **You don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out.**
* **No one has it all together even if it looks like they do.**
* **That thing you're stressing about? You probably won‚Äôt remember it in a year.**

It‚Äôs okay to care deeply. That‚Äôs what makes you great.

Just don‚Äôt let the pressure steal your joy.

You won‚Äôt remember the 93 instead of the 97.  
But you will remember the late-night drive with your best friends.  
The coffee with your sibling before they moved away.  
The dumb risk that turned into your favourite memory.  
The time you skipped that class to go play some pond hockey.

Perfection is a myth.  
Growth is real.  
Presence is powerful.

You‚Äôre doing better than you think.  
And you‚Äôve got time to become whoever you want to be.

We‚Äôre all just¬†*almost something*‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs perfect.

>**Almost Something**

I write these as a way to unpack what I‚Äôm learning in real time. Sometimes it‚Äôs a breakthrough. Sometimes it‚Äôs a confession. But it‚Äôs always honest.

If you're figuring it out as you go too, welcome to the club.

We‚Äôre all still becoming.

  I was/am a member of a brewery, and that is where most of my socializing occured.  We have events, fundraisers, karaoki, trivia, and classes all the time out of there. Most of my friends and acquaintances all hangout there, and my life has revolved around this place for years. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do anymore.  

I have been reading, going to coffee shops, and playing videogames, but I have never felt so unfulfilled socially.  I am injured and waiting on surgery before I can go back to lifting and golfing, but this will take weeks or months before I'm healed up enough to do so.

As a single man with no nearby family, this has been very difficult for me.  Im stopping drinking at a point where it really cant be considered rock bottom, I've  had no trouble with the law, I dont drive drunk, I have an 800 credit score, have a good,  important job that gets handled. I eat healthy and exercise. I just get buzzed 4-5 days a week, but took perscribed xanax on the other days. I think that was the nail in the coffin for me

 My physical urges were there, but not excruciating. My withdrawals were super shitty but still considered ""mild"" so my idiot alcohol-brain is telling me that I can go back and have my community again and that I can just take it easy and my life will be fine. 

I KNOW this is not true.  I know that drinking again after my brain has been pickled is just slow suicide. Rationally, without having strong urges to drink, it is the best time for me to kick the addiction entirely before it gets worse.  

But I do not know how to live my life without a place to be around people. I havent found much solice in the group meetings.  Though we all share similar afflictions, it doesnt feel like we have much else in common.  

What have y'all found to be good ways to socialize that isn't a sport or exercise?  I cant keep pacing my house any longer.  The urges wont be the thing to get me back drinking, but the loneliness might.

## Key Features Analysis

the overall quality and appeal of a mint hoodie depend significantly on several essential features.

**Material Composition:** The ideal mint hoodie leverages a blend of cotton and polyester. This combination yields a soft feel against the skin while enhancing durability and reducing shrinkage after washing. Look for hoodies boasting a high percentage of cotton (60% or more) to ensure optimal comfort and breathability.Conversely, the polyester component contributes to wrinkle resistance and colorfastness, preserving the hoodie's vibrant mint hue over extended periods.

**Hood Design and Adjustability:** A well-designed hood is critical for both functionality and style. The best mint hoodies feature a generous hood size that effectively shields the head from wind and light rain. An adjustable drawstring allows users to customize the hood's fit, preventing it from slipping down or obscuring vision. Metal grommets reinforcing the drawstring holes enhance longevity and prevent fraying. The hood lining should be smooth and soft, providing additional comfort around the face.

**Pocket Style and Placement:** Kangaroo pockets are a common and practical feature in hoodies, offering a convenient place to store small items or warm hands. The size and placement of the pocket should be optimized for accessibility and comfort. The ideal pocket opening should be wide enough to easily accommodate hands or a smartphone, while the pocket depth should be sufficient to prevent items from falling out. Reinforced stitching around the pocket edges enhances durability and prevents tearing. Hidden zip pockets offer added security while elevating the look.

**Sleeve and Hem Detailing:** Ribbed cuffs and hems are standard on hoodies, providing a snug fit that helps to trap warmth and maintain the garment's shape. The elasticity of the ribbing is essential; it should be firm enough to stay in place but not so tight as to restrict movement or cause discomfort. Double-needle stitching along the seams enhances durability and prevents unraveling. Some premium mint hoodies include thumbholes in the cuffs, offering added warmth and convenience.

Key features of the best mint hoodies include:

*   Premium fabric blend for comfort and durability
*   Adjustable hood with reinforced grommets

the same performative optimism. the same curated highlights reel. the same desperate networking energy disguised as authentic connection. we swipe through profiles like we're building professional networks, except instead of career advancement, we're chasing the hollow promise of finding ""the one.""



i sat at my piano still in my date clothes (business casual, naturally) and started playing these minor chords that felt like scrolling through endless profiles at 3am. the melody came out all hollow and searching ‚Äì kind of like how modern romance feels.



the song became this meditation on digital loneliness, on how we've turned intimacy into an optimization problem. there's something deeply unsettling about treating love like a networking event.

\[GOLF COURSE\]

A green field in a gray world.

‚ÄúMavrick! Mavrick! Mavrick! You can do it, General!‚Äù the soldiers cheered, clapping with wide, too-artificial smiles.

‚ÄúWe believe in you!‚Äù piped a woman in uniform, waving the Royal Nation‚Äôs flag. ‚ÄúFor the King‚Äôs!‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you shut the hell up, you inhuman things, then yeah, I can do it,‚Äù grunted an old man in uniform, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. General Mavrick placed a golf ball on the barely visible grass. The lawn had been dead for years, covered in a thin layer of gray dust, but the fake people ‚Äúmaintained‚Äù it to keep the illusion of nature. He lifted the club, swung with the elegance any aristocrat of old would envy, and struck with force. The ball flew with perfect spin, vanishing into the milky distance between the drowsy hills.

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù the General said with satisfaction, panting slightly. Now with gray hair and a slight paunch, he still preserved the appearance of health. Rituals helped maintain sanity‚Äîat least enough to avoid complete inertia.

Behind him, a fake person in a red jacket with a lapel reminiscent of former officer uniforms snapped his fingers three times, smiling broadly. His smile did not reach his eyes.

‚ÄúSuperb shot, General! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!‚Äù he exclaimed with exaggerated enthusiasm‚Äîjust as yesterday. And the day before. And for the past three decades.

‚ÄúLong live the General! Mavrick! Mavrick!‚Äù added the woman, waving the Royal Nation‚Äôs flag again. Another of many fake people.

‚ÄúA bit too strong,‚Äù snorted a man with impressive mustaches, drawing on a cigar. His hair was short and dark gray, and he wore an officer‚Äôs uniform.

‚ÄúOh, piss off, Karsk,‚Äù Mavrick rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúCould you at least once admit that I play golf better than you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe so,‚Äù laughed General Karsk. ‚ÄúBut you still can‚Äôt smoke a good cigar.‚Äù He offered a crooked smile.

General Karsk sat beside him on a wooden bench, a cigar drooping from the corner of his mouth. He still wore the same faded military cap and coat, like everything here. Without a word, he exhaled smoke and remarked, ‚ÄúThese fake people always clap. Whether you hit or drop the club. I wonder if they even understand what a ‚Äògood shot‚Äô means.‚Äù

Mavrick raised an eyebrow, giving him a half-joking look. ‚ÄúKarsk, don‚Äôt be jealous. Artificial approval is the only thing that still gives me any satisfaction here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmph,‚Äù grunted General Karsk, adjusting the cigar butt between his fingers. ‚ÄúOnce we waged campaigns against half the world. Now we play golf surrounded by human puppets who clap like wind-up monkeys.‚Äù He sneered bitterly. ‚ÄúQuite a retirement.‚Äù

Hearing this, the fake people stopped clapping and for a few seconds‚Ä¶ simply stood in silence. Then, with a slight delay, they began to cheer again.

‚ÄúExcellent sense of humor, General! Ha. Ha. Ha.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral Karsk! General Karsk! General Karsk!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, how manly the General is!‚Äù piped the same woman with the Royal Nation‚Äôs flag, her blush all too manufactured.

‚ÄúAnd look what you did,‚Äù Karsk frowned, pointing at the fake people. ‚ÄúBecause of you, they‚Äôve become even more mentally dull.‚Äù

Mavrick turned with a smile that could have been sincere‚Äîif he hadn‚Äôt repeated it every day for over a hundred years. ‚ÄúJust like all of us.‚Äù

Before the silence could truly settle, another fake person‚Äîyounger-looking, with unnaturally smooth skin and an empty stare‚Äîsprang forward like a dog spotting a stick. His movements were almost too fluid, lacking the natural weight of a body, as if guided by a hidden mechanical axis.

He ran across the dead hill like a scentless wind and vanished over the horizon. A moment passed. Two. Three. Finally, he returned‚Äîhis face triumphant‚Äîholding the ball on an outstretched palm like a relic.

‚ÄúGeneral, here is your ball!‚Äù he announced proudly, as if presenting the King‚Äôs severed crown.

Mavrick sighed with gratitude so theatrical that even Karsk winced. ‚ÄúThank you, Number Seventy-Four.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is my honor, General! Shall I clean it of dust?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù Mavrick waved his hand as though any of this truly mattered to him.

Number Seventy-Four immediately produced a white handkerchief from his pocket and began wiping the ball in circular motions, with the care of a jeweler polishing a diamond. Meanwhile, Number Three‚Äîwho had been clapping earlier‚Äîremained frozen in the same unnatural pose. Silent. Awaiting the next interaction. And Woman Number One Hundred Two continued to wave the Royal Nation‚Äôs flag mindlessly.

‚ÄúThese creatures‚Ä¶‚Äù Mavrick muttered, no longer looking at them. ‚ÄúOnce I tried to order one to shoot me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù Karsk asked slowly as a fake butler carrying bottles of wine and beer approached.

‚ÄúHe stood still. Asked what weapon and which point of my skull. When I told him, he replied he had no access to ammunition but could ‚Äòarrange a simulated death‚Äô if that helped me.‚Äù

Karsk snorted with laughter as the butler set the bottles on the table and walked away. ‚ÄúMaybe next time ask them to recreate our old battalion. Maybe even these fake people could manage to act out a war,‚Äù he said, raising a bottle of wine and taking a sip.

Mavrick rubbed his tired eyes. ‚ÄúThey reenact, but they don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs like listening to an opera performed on dead instruments. You recognize the melody, but it has no soul.‚Äù

Karsk gazed at the sky. Blue, sunless. Windless. Rainless. Frozen. ‚ÄúI thought war was hell. But this‚Ä¶ this is something much worse. It‚Äôs limbo.‚Äù

**.**

**.**

**.**

**\[HALF AN HOUR LATER\]**

Half an hour later, both generals sat at a table made from aircraft metal and fragments of an old field-map case. Above their heads hung a lamp whose light flickered with unsettling regularity, as if the light itself had a nervous tic. A fake person in a white smock stood motionless nearby, ready to hand over whatever was ordered.

On metal plates steamed a gray-beige mush. Formally it was supposed to be stew. In practice, it looked like dissolved skin set in gelatin. Karsk looked at his meal with contempt, as if someone had just read aloud his list of failures. ‚ÄúIt has no flavor,‚Äù he said bitterly, pushing the mush with his spoon.

Mavrick did not take his eyes off his portion. ‚ÄúGood that it doesn‚Äôt. Flavor would only remind me what it was like when life was worth living.‚Äù

Karsk shook his head and set down his spoon. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse‚Äîthis slop or your cynical wisdom. Do you really think lack of flavor is a virtue?‚Äù

Mavrick inhaled on his cigarette and shrugged. ‚ÄúAt least I remember what things tasted like. You just complain that it doesn‚Äôt taste‚Äî I at least know what I‚Äôm missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn potatoes with dill,‚Äù Rudersdorf muttered.

‚ÄúAnd I miss coffee. Black, strong, brewed in that tin pot old Zelfour gave me.‚Äù

A moment of silence followed. From the kitchen came a mechanical clatter‚Äîfake people washing dishes in absolute quiet, moving in perfect synchrony like ghosts in an opera for machines.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even know what hunger is. They just mimic the gestures. They know we must be fed, but they don‚Äôt know with what. That‚Äôs why this tastes like‚Ä¶‚Äù Rudersdorf raised his spoon, allowing the contents to slowly fall back onto the plate, ‚Äú‚Ä¶something that forgot it was ever food.‚Äù

Mavrick chuckled briefly, hoarsely. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs for the best. After all, this is only limbo. Not hell, not heaven. Pure nothingness. The perfect place for us, old dogs of war who have lost everything.‚Äù

Rudersdorf glanced at him from the side. ‚ÄúAnd yet every day you play chess with a fake Field Marshal.‚Äù

Mavrick smiled faintly. ‚ÄúBecause even though he‚Äôs artificial, he always loses. It‚Äôs the only victory I have left here.‚Äù

Rudersdorf rested his elbows on the tabletop and for a moment stirred his mush as if searching for even a trace of meaning. ‚ÄúTell me, Mavrick‚Ä¶‚Äù he began quietly. ‚ÄúIs anyone still working on getting out of here? A hundred years have passed. A hundred damn years, and we‚Äôre still stuck in this dead zone. Limbo. Even ghosts would rot here.‚Äù

Mavrick snorted, not looking at him. He crushed his cigarette butt into a tin ashtray and pulled another cigarette from a crumpled pack. ‚ÄúNo one cares anymore, Rudersdorf. Everyone‚Äôs given up. This world is‚Ä¶ a soft wall. It doesn‚Äôt strike, doesn‚Äôt torture. It just numbs. Wraps around you and pats your head until you forget you ever had a purpose. Most of our‚Ä¶ ‚Äòsurvivors‚Äô prefer singing with Grantz or holding contests for the prettiest sculptures made from mannequin dust.‚Äù

He inhaled deeply. ‚ÄúOnly Colonel Zelfour still tinkers. He locks himself in that trailer with maps, sketches, energy traces, peers at mannequins under microscopes, and interrogates fake people. Obsession. And what about your Neil? He runs around with a knife, staging ‚Äòtests‚Äô at the realm‚Äôs borders, as if he still believes there‚Äôs something beyond the horizon.‚Äù

Rudersdorf looked at him in disbelief. ‚ÄúNeil isn‚Äôt mine. He‚Äôs a man who can kill another with a soup spoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this world, that‚Äôs a completely useless talent,‚Äù Mavrick snapped, bursting into a short, hollow laugh. ‚ÄúNo one to kill here. Mannequins don‚Äôt defend themselves, fake people beg for orders. The real ones? They‚Äôve plunged into grotesque madness.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs worth listening to those who still do something,‚Äù Rudersdorf muttered. ‚ÄúMaybe Neil and Zelfour aren‚Äôt normal. But at least they remember that none of this should be normal.‚Äù

Mavrick fell silent for a moment. The light fluttered above them. The fake person standing nearby remained motionless with a polite smile, understanding not a word.

‚ÄúOr maybe,‚Äù he finally said, ‚Äúwe are the mistake. And Limbo is‚Ä¶ the correction.‚Äù

A heavy silence ensued, as weighty as steel armor.

From afar came a loud cry: ‚ÄúHer Majesty requests more wine for the harem!‚Äù

Both generals exchanged grimly amused glances. ‚ÄúHas the Queen held another coronation?‚Äù Mavrick asked.

‚ÄúMust be the third time this week,‚Äù Karsk sighed. ‚ÄúBut at least she has some joy in life.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr a complete personality collapse. But hey, who among us can still tell the difference?‚Äù

**CRASH!**

The dining hall doors splintered with a bang, dust falling from the ceiling. Colonel Zelfour‚Äôs kick was almost ceremonial, with the same fury he‚Äôd used for decades when storming empty chambers, dusty storerooms, and crumbling observation towers.

‚ÄúAve, Generals!‚Äù he called loudly, arm raised in a greeting so dramatic the echo recoiled off the walls.

arsk and Mavrick rolled their eyes simultaneously. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an order that lost its validity‚Ä¶‚Äù Mavrick began with a sigh, drawing smoke from his cigarette.

‚Äú‚Ä¶sixty-seven years ago,‚Äù Karsk finished, setting down his spoon. ‚ÄúReally, Zelfour. Can‚Äôt you just knock?‚Äù

The colonel ignored their comments and stepped aside, revealing what he had been hiding behind him.

And then a true silence fell. Not the dead silence everyone had grown accustomed to in Limbo, but a heavy, stifling, electric quiet. The two pairs of general‚Äôs eyes fixed on the figure that crossed the threshold of the dining hall.

A girl.

Young.

Petite.

Moving with the same military precision they had known centuries ago. Blond hair tied into a tight braid, though stray strands fell rebelliously across her face. Eyes‚Äîthose hellish, icy, restless eyes.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Diborah?‚Äù Karsk almost whispered, as if speaking a name that was a spell forbidden to utter.

Mavrick rose slowly, putting down his fork. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible. No one has seen her for‚Ä¶ a hundred years. Exactly a hundred.‚Äù

‚ÄúHundred and two months,‚Äù Zelfour corrected quietly, barely keeping his voice from trembling.

Diborah stood upright, dressed in a military greatcoat as if straight out of archival chronicles. Her gaze was alert, focused, but‚Ä¶ not the same. Not entirely. Something in her was broken. Something twisted and forcibly reassembled. She stopped at the threshold, rigid as a wire, came to attention, then snapped a sharp salute: ‚ÄúGenerals. Major Diborah reporting in, as ordered.‚Äù

For a moment, a dead silence reigned in the hall, broken only by the ticking of a broken clock that hadn‚Äôt moved in years. Karsk waved his hand without looking up from his plate. ‚ÄúGive it a rest, Diborah. You can skip the whole circus of salutes and orders. Orders lost their meaning the same day when the King‚Äôs and the Queen told everyone to ‚Äòfuck off‚Äô and walked right through a wall.‚Äù

Mavrick snorted a laugh, crushing his cigarette butt in the ashtray. ‚ÄúYes, I remember. Even our fake clocks stopped working then. What a day.‚Äù

Karsk propped his head on his hand and squinted at the girl. ‚ÄúAll right, Sergeant-Major-Holy-Mystery‚Ä¶ the crucial question: where the hell have you been for the last‚Ä¶ how long now? A hundred years?‚Äù

Diborah twitched. She coughed briefly, almost nervously, as if her throat refused to cooperate. When she finally spoke, her voice was hoarse, dry. ‚ÄúI died.‚Äù

Mavrick immediately snorted. ‚ÄúWell, no kidding. Seriously?‚Äù

Karsk spread his arms theatrically. ‚ÄúSurprising. Truly. Especially considering that we‚Äôre all dead here.‚Äù

Mavrick reached for a carafe filled with what looked like water but tasted like a memory of prewar vodka. ‚ÄúThe Spanish flu. Remember? One after another. Some in hospitals, others at the front, a few from a cold, but the diagnosis was always the same. ‚ÄòSpanish beast,‚Äô as the Field Marshal used to call it before he choked on his tongue.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe thought you died too,‚Äù Karsk added, his tone quieter. ‚ÄúBut no one saw a body. Or a report.‚Äù

Diborah lowered her hand, straightened her shoulders as if shrugging off tension that had accumulated for decades. Her gaze ceased to be frosty‚Äîit became‚Ä¶ focused. Penetrating. ‚ÄúMy death was‚Ä¶ well, there‚Äôs a lot of explanation, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Colonel Zelfour said you might know the solution to this hopeless situation.‚Äù

Both generals exchanged a glance, suddenly more serious.

Karsk furrowed his brow. ‚Äú‚ÄòHopelesser‚Äô?‚Äù he snorted, pulling a cigar from his pocket. ‚ÄúHopeless was exactly eighty years ago. Now? It‚Äôs collapse.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I returned,‚Äù Diborah said quietly. ‚ÄúSomething has changed.‚Äù

Mavrick pressed the cigarette to his lips and said through clenched teeth: ‚ÄúThat means‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre no longer safe. Even here.‚Äù

Diborah nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSomething is coming that wants to push us out of here. Or destroy this entire place.‚Äù

Silence returned to the hall, heavier than before. Even the fake people at the table stopped pretending to eat.

Finally, Karsk rose. He straightened his uniform, cleared his throat, and said dryly, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs great. Just in time for dessert.‚Äù He nodded toward the servers. ‚ÄúBring those cakes and sweets.‚Äù

‚ÄúGenerals‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax, Major, the war ended long ago,‚Äù Mavrick sighed with boredom. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing left. Literally nothing. Since the Queen‚Äôs reign here.‚Äù

Diborah shifted from foot to foot as though ready to explode from frustration. Her eyes burned with a sinister gleam, that familiar spark of determination that in wartime meant only one thing‚Äîtrouble for anyone who got in her way. ‚ÄúTell me‚Ä¶‚Äù she hissed through clenched teeth. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ anyone here‚Ä¶ know anything about the one who locked us in these Tunnels?‚Äù

Mavrick furrowed his brow, raising one eyebrow. Karsk looked at him, then back at Diborah, spreading his hands. ‚ÄúThe one‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that some general from the southern front?‚Äù Mavrick asked, genuinely confused.

Diborah lowered her head, slowly, very slowly, as if the weight of knowing how ignorant they all were crushed her soul to the ground. For a moment she looked as if praying‚Äîor as if she‚Äôd just seen her mother standing across the River Styx, waiting. Again.

Then she sighed. Long. Hard. With exhaustion in her eyes as if reality had failed her for the thousandth time. ‚ÄúOf course you don‚Äôt know. Of course. You‚Äôve been trapped here for so many years and still have no idea who put you here. Perfect. A total shitshow. Theatrical necrosis with a side of absurdity.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, hey, at least we‚Äôre trying not to think about things like that,‚Äù Karsk muttered, glancing at the remnants of his meal. ‚ÄúOtherwise a person would go completely mad here.‚Äù

Mavrick reached for a bottle and topped off his glass with something that only looked like cognac. ‚ÄúWell, at least we‚Äôre not alone. Something is still moving, since you came back.‚Äù

Major Diborah grabbed a chair and sat down heavily, as if carrying the whole world on her shoulders. ‚ÄúI have to get out of here. I don‚Äôt know how yet. But this‚Ä¶ thing, whatever it is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still active. Maybe not here, but somewhere. And if it‚Äôs not here, it means there‚Äôs a way out of here.‚Äù

Mavrick glanced at Karsk out of the corner of his eye. ‚ÄúDo you remember that lunatic from the laboratory? The one with eyes like lightbulbs and a raspy voice?‚Äù

Karsk nodded slowly. ‚ÄúDoctor Haber? The one who said souls are just data in an infinite energy loop? We thought he accidentally fell into hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still here,‚Äù Mavrick muttered. ‚ÄúIn the basement of the old institute. Playing with his experiments. Supposedly he stuck a radio in his skull so he could hear voices from ‚Äòother dimensions.‚Äô Or from the closet.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs your guy,‚Äù Karsk added, looking at Diborah. ‚ÄúIf anyone knows more about whatever‚Äôs pulling the strings in these Tunnels, it‚Äôs that fucking genius of metaphysical grilling.‚Äù

Diborah pushed the chair back. She stood. ‚ÄúTake me to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust so you know, I‚Äôm warning you,‚Äù Mavrick raised a finger. ‚ÄúHe mostly talks to dead fish, and recently he claimed he fell in love with a flashlight.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter what I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶‚Äù Diborah replied coolly, ‚Äúfalling in love with a flashlight sounds like a perfectly healthy adaptation.‚Äù

‚ÄúAve generale,‚Äù Colonel Zelfour murmured with a sneer as they all moved toward the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start again,‚Äù Lieutenant Neil grumbled.

**CRASH!**

The doors to the hall suddenly flew open with a bang so loud that Colonel Zelfour reflexively grabbed his weapon, Mavrick sighed deeply, and Karsk closed his eyes like a man sensing an approaching nightmare.

Into the room rolled she‚Äî the Queen. An older woman with regal but slightly frayed grace, cheeks flushed from drink, and eyes reddened from drunkenness. In a dirty bathrobe, she stood unsteadily, gazing at everyone.

In one hand she held an unfinished bottle of wine; in the other, a smudged piece of paper bearing a drawing of a female doll. Her eyes carried an expression of intoxicating transcendence found only in those teetering on the edge between genius and total ruin.

‚ÄúI want more‚Ä¶ of those dolls‚Ä¶‚Äù she rasped, with a strange, almost philosophical longing. ‚ÄúThe porcelain ones. And they must speak French‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then her gaze fell on Major Diborah. She stopped. She staggered.

‚ÄúG-G-girl?‚Äù

The hall froze.

Everyone looked at her as if they had just seen a dinosaur wearing a bowler hat.

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ is that you? You? That‚Ä¶ soldier everyone spoke of? The one from the reports? From the front?‚Äù

She took a few uncertain steps closer, squinting as though trying to read text through a grease-smeared window.

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù she wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúQuite‚Ä¶ short.‚Äù She's 5'5.

Diborah stared back at her with icy coldness. But before she could respond, the Queen suddenly went pale, trembled‚Ä¶ and emitted a sound part hiccup, part the death throe of a baby seal. Then she spun around violently and vomited straight onto the marble floor.

‚ÄúAh, for heaven‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶‚Äù Colonel Zelfour muttered, stepping back swiftly.

Plop‚Äî The Queen collapsed to the ground with all the majesty of her authority, releasing a drawn-out fart that echoed off the walls like a ceremonial volley.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs done it again,‚Äù Karsk muttered, rubbing his temple. ‚ÄúAlways when there‚Äôs a new guest.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs her way of testing loyalty?‚Äù Mavrick tossed off, without much conviction.

The Queen was already snoring softly, her head resting on her own coat, wine bottle still clutched like a scepter.

Major Diborah simply watched. She remained silent.

‚ÄúAnd this is‚Ä¶ the ruler of that menagerie?‚Äù she asked finally, slowly, without emotion. ‚ÄúThe Queen for whom we marched off to fight in the Great War?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Colonel Zelfour shrugged. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs slid downhill a bit. But she used to have charisma. And an army. And‚Äî I think‚Äî some sort of politics, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúNow she has dolls and aprons.‚Äù

Diborah closed her eyes. ‚ÄúI hope Doctor Habel isn‚Äôt even more cracked than that.‚Äù

Mavrick and Karsk exchanged glances.

‚ÄúMajor‚Ä¶ he once made explosive rabbits that screamed ‚Äòtranscendence!‚Äô before detonating.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúThen this will be the most normal conversation I have today.‚Äù

Zelfour was opening his mouth to speak, when the still-snoozing Queen reached out a hand and mumbled in her sleep, ‚ÄúLet the doll‚Ä¶ have a rifle‚Ä¶ and speak Latin‚Ä¶‚Äù

Major Diborah looked up at the ceiling as if pleading with heaven for an explanation of this existential trap. But heaven remained silent. As always.

The Queen rolled onto her side; the wine bottle slipped from her hand and rolled under the table. From her lips came quiet mutterings, indistinct and tangled, as though she dreamed of war, women, kingdoms, and disasters‚Äîeverything all at once, simultaneously.

‚Äú‚ÄòEverything‚Ä¶ everything burned‚Ä¶ the doll had fire in its eyes‚Ä¶ and the general was a horse‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù she mumbled in her sleep, quivering slightly.

Major Diborah looked questioningly at the generals. Colonel Zelfour raised his eyebrows. Karsk trembled, and Mavrick adopted the posture of a man about to deliver an impromptu defense speech for the woman lying in a puddle of her own shame.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt draw hasty conclusions,‚Äù Mavrick began cautiously, straightening his uniform. ‚ÄúHer Majesty‚Ä¶ has been through much.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù Karsk nodded with mock solemnity. ‚ÄúWhen we first arrived in this city, everything looked like hell without gates.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnemies everywhere. The laws of physics‚Ä¶ sometimes worked, sometimes didn‚Äôt. Ghosts, mutations, politics.‚Äù Colonel Zelfour grimaced. ‚ÄúOne officer died trying to sign a decree with a pen that turned out to be a venomous worm.‚Äù

Mavrick stepped over to the Queen and knelt beside her like an old teacher beside a wayward student.

‚ÄúThe Queen had grand plans back then, Major. Reforms. A return to the Empire‚Äôs glory. But‚Ä¶ something happened. Maybe it‚Äôs this land. Maybe it‚Äôs all of us.‚Äù

The Queen trembled, then let out another low growl: ‚ÄúMavrick‚Ä¶ give me my trousers‚Ä¶ the witch took them‚Ä¶ she wants them for conjuring a werewolf‚Ä¶‚Äù She ordered nonchalantly, despite facing her former enemies.

Mavrick froze.

Major Diborah raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was specific,‚Äù she murmured, unease tinging her voice. ‚ÄúIs that something I should know about?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the generals replied in unison.

The Queen began muttering again, this time faster, almost with passion: ‚ÄúWe must build a tank‚Ä¶ that screams‚Ä¶ every time it fires‚Ä¶ but not an ordinary scream‚Ä¶ an operatic soprano‚Ä¶ in honor of Br√ºnhilde‚Ä¶‚Äù

Karsk turned to Diborah with a sour smile. ‚ÄúAs I said. A slight relapse.‚Äù

Diborah wiped her face with her hand. ‚ÄúAnd is Doctor Habel still coherent?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf by ‚Äòcoherent‚Äô you mean ‚Äòhe still believes time is a liquid and consciousness can be distilled through a dead dog‚Äôs teeth,‚Äô‚Äù Colonel Zelfour said, ‚Äúthen yes‚Äîvery.‚Äù

Diborah closed her eyes. ‚ÄúWonderful. Take me to him. At least if I go mad, I‚Äôll be in good company.‚Äù

From behind them, the Queen‚Äôs last prolonged mutter reached their ears: ‚ÄúAnd let the doll‚Ä¶ be made of clay‚Ä¶ but not ordinary clay‚Ä¶ the kind that grows in the forest‚Ä¶ and speak Finnish‚Ä¶‚Äù

Diborah didn‚Äôt even turn around. She strode toward the door as if about to face her own destiny‚Äîwhatever it might be. The Queen whimpered softly, like a spoiled child, and General Karsk sighed in resignation. He gently lifted her from the floor, cradling her like an infant, rocking her tenderly.

From the wine bottle she‚Äôd been holding, she removed the cork and offered it like a pacifier. The Queen latched onto the bottle‚Äôs neck, humming in contentment.

‚ÄúSleep, my little Queen, let the wine lull you, let the spirits of this place drift from your head‚Ä¶‚Äù the general said softly, singing in a low, slightly off-key voice‚Äîa simple rhyme that felt more like a lullaby than anything militaristic.

Major Diborah watched it all with a mixture of shock, disbelief, and‚Ä¶ a strange compassion.

Colonel Zelfour, standing nearby, snorted and muttered, ‚ÄúThis is just the beginning. If you think this is the height of strangeness in Limbo, you‚Äôre in for something far worse. The Queen, despite all these symptoms, is one of the more mentally intact among the ‚Äòreal‚Äô people here.‚Äù

Diborah looked at General Hanz gently rocking the nearly limp Queen, then toward Colonel Zelfour, and sighed heavily. ‚ÄúThis place really does something to people,‚Äù she said quietly, as though trying to convince herself.

Zelfour nodded. ‚ÄúLimbo is not just a place, Major. It‚Äôs a war for minds and souls. And we‚Äôre all right in the middle of it.‚Äù

Inside, it was perfect, soft lighting, board games, live music, a real  20-minute vacation  from daily chaos.

But online? Totally different story.

**What was missing:**

* Reviews existed but didn‚Äôt really show the caf√©‚Äôs personality
* Instagram ads ran, but didn‚Äôt convert like they should
* No single place for potential customers to see genuine feedback
* The real-life magic wasn‚Äôt translating to the digital world

**What they changed (with help from Feedspace):**

* Collected reviews in text, photos, and short videos directly from customers
* Added QR codes on tables and receipts for easy sharing
* Encouraged vibe-focused videos (food, ambience, d√©cor) instead of awkward face-to-camera clips
* Built a Wall of Love page to showcase all the best customer moments in one spot

Within months, Mocha Caf√©‚Äôs online presence finally matched their offline experience. New customers walked in already knowing what to expect. 

Ads worked better because they weren‚Äôt just selling coffee, they were selling an experience people had already validated.

If you run a caf√© or restaurant, here‚Äôs the takeaway: people trust people. 

The more you can make your real customers your digital storytellers, the less you have to convince anyone.

1mq4ip5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mq4ip5/how_does_the_espro_p7_french_press_redefine_your/,How does the ESPRO P7 French Press Redefine Your Coffee Experience?,"Using the ESPRO P7 French Press 1032C2 over the past few weeks has been an experience worth sharing. Having used various coffee makers, I was intrigued by the double-walled stainless steel design and promised features. As someone who drinks coffee like it‚Äôs a daily ritual, a product like this has a tough crowd to impress in my house. From its build to functionality, I tried to see how it stood out‚Äîand, well, it gave me things to rave about and a couple of quirks to wrestle with.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was how sturdy this French press feels. The polished stainless steel exterior not only looks elegant on the kitchen counter but also promises durability. We‚Äôre talking about a product that can probably take an accidental drop and laugh it off. Measuring 6.37 x 4.68 x 10.4 inches, it‚Äôs compact yet substantial, a perfect fit for those who value aesthetics in their coffee gear. The double-wall insulation truly lives up to expectations, keeping my coffee steaming hot longer than I anticipated. As someone who‚Äôs often distracted and forgets the coffee for ten minutes, this was a blessing. It is a bit heavier than other French presses I‚Äôve used, especially glass ones, but for the level of robustness you‚Äôre getting, the slight heft is a fair trade-off.  

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing my morning coffee turned into a surprisingly simple routine with this manual coffee press. I was skeptical at first because some French presses can be finicky, but this one doesn‚Äôt over-complicate things. You just add the coffee grounds, pour hot water, and press. It‚Äôs the sort of process that even my caffeine-deprived brain can handle at 6 a.m. There‚Äôs no need for fancy electric setups or a crashing app to ruin your day. The reusable micro-filter system is fancier than most and definitely finer; I didn‚Äôt find tiny coffee grounds lurking at the bottom of my mug, which was a huge win for me.

**Good Points**  
- Durable stainless steel construction ensures long-lasting performance.  
- The double-wall insulation keeps coffee hot for extended periods.  
- An advanced double micro-filter system eliminates coffee sludge.  
- Sleek design makes it a standout in any kitchen space.  

**Performance**  
With each brewing session, the true potential of this French press began to shine. The double micro-filter system is where the magic happens. It catches the finest particles, giving a grit-free and smooth coffee experience. Coffee sludge and I have a long history of battles, so finding my cup at the end of the press clear of grounds was almost therapeutic. Whether using it for morning coffee or attempting gourmet tea infusions in the evenings, the flavor turned out rich and bold. Let‚Äôs put it this way: even my partner, who usually grumbles about French press bitterness, gave this one a thumbs-up.

**Areas of Concern**  
- On the heavier side, making portability less ideal for travelers.  
- Premium pricing could be a barrier for some, especially those new to French presses.  
- The polished surface is prone to fingerprints and requires frequent cleaning for a flawless look.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning is never exciting when it involves coffee gear, and this product doesn‚Äôt entirely escape the chore zone. The reusable filter, while effective, takes a bit of effort to clean thoroughly. It‚Äôs a multi-step process to disassemble, rinse, and clear, which doesn‚Äôt sound fun after that first caffeine jolt wears off. I‚Äôd recommend setting aside a couple of minutes to ensure all parts are properly cleaned to maintain the experience. Unlike glass French presses, there‚Äôs no worry about delicate parts breaking, but the polished surface loves fingerprints a little too much. Pro tip: keep a microfiber cloth handy!

**Competing Products**  
Compared to the classic Bodum Chambord French Press, this stainless steel version wins in durability and heat retention. While the Bodum model provides a vintage coffeehouse aesthetic, its glass design feels more fragile and loses heat quicker. The Fellow Clara French press, another popular rival, offers aesthetic minimalism but falters in creating the same grit-free brew as the ESPRO P7. Ultimately, if brew smoothness and longevity matter to you over price, the ESPRO stands a notch above. However, those on a budget or who prioritize lightweight designs might lean toward a simpler option.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The price positioning of this product makes it more of an investment than an impulse buy. It‚Äôs not the cheapest French press on the market, but the features fully justify the cost in my opinion. Between the durable build, advanced filtration system, and stylish presentation, you‚Äôre paying for something built to last. For the occasional coffee-drinkers, it might feel like overkill, but for regular enthusiasts like me, it feels worth every cent. With proper care, this could easily outlast cheaper alternatives, making the long-term value undeniable.

He didn‚Äôt mean to come here.

One floor above the library. 
Past the old locked seminar room. 

Through the broken fire door someone had wedged open with a folded chair. 

The roof.

Cold wind bit at his jaw as Kai stepped out into it. 

Concrete beneath him. 
Rusted rails around him. 

The silver edge of evening settling like a hush over the city.

Toronto‚Äôs skyline blinked and breathed far away. 

The sky was still light-but not for long.

He didn‚Äôt want to be found.
He didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

And most of all, he didn‚Äôt want to feel what he was feeling.

He walked to the edge.

Not recklessly. 
Not to jump.

Just... to look.

His hands were in his coat pockets. 

His body was hunched against the wind.

 But his heart-His heart was not quiet.

He could feel it trying to burn its way out of him.

They kept saying he was special.

Sequoia said he was 

‚Äúchosen.‚Äù

Mike said,

‚Äúyou always been different, man.‚Äù

Even Jaxx-fucking, Jaxx-had looked at him last week like he was some kind of star that had come down wrong.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a god.‚Äù

No one answered. 
Not even the wind.

Below, he could see students walking across campus. 

Tiny bodies with coffee cups, lovers holding hands, someone laughing so hard they bent at the waist. 

All of them real.
And him?

He felt like something unfinished. 

A page torn out of a holy book and stuffed into a jacket pocket.

Not lost. 
Not found. 

Just... waiting.

He walked to the corner where the roof‚Äôs metal caught the sky.

There, under the utility light, he saw his reflection in a fogged-up square of dark glass.

It didn‚Äôt look like him.

Or-worse-it looked too much like him.

The version he was afraid they‚Äôd all start to see.

The version the mirror already knew.

He stared at it. 
Hard.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready,‚Äù 
he said quietly.""

The mirror didn‚Äôt care.

He crouched, knees aching a little. 

Wind tugged at his sleeves. 

The warmth from the building below sent up little breath-like puffs through the vents.

Kai closed his eyes.
He let the memories in.

His mother, holding his head when he cried from the nightmares, whispering ‚Äúbaby, your soul is too old for this world.‚Äù

Jaxx, laughing without meaning to, backlit by the gym doors, golden and flushed, voice saying

‚Äúyou‚Äôre weird as fuck, bro, but I like it.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs hands were shaking now.
Something inside him pulsed.

Not pain. 
Not yet.

But something vast. 
Something that wanted to be let out.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù he said softly.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be what they think I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I ruin it?‚Äù

He put a hand over his chest.
Felt the heartbeat.
Felt it skip.

And then-just once-he heard it.

Not a voice. 
Not a word.

A tone.
A resonance.

Like someone had struck a tuning fork inside his ribs.

He opened his eyes.
The sky was darker now. 

A single bird - maybe a crow - circled overhead. 

A cloud peeled open to reveal a bruised stripe of moon.

Kai stood.
He faced the mirror again.

And this time... he saw something in his own eyes that frightened him.

Not cruelty. 
Not madness.

Divinity.

That old, slow-burning fire.
The one his blood had carried through dynasties.

The one no colonizer could ever steal.

The one that had waited patiently for him to be born.

He whispered:

‚ÄúI love too much to let this break me.‚Äù

Then louder, like a vow:

‚ÄúYou can have me.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut not all at once.‚Äù

Wind surged up. 
Carried the words away.

A hum trembled through the soles of his feet.
Somewhere deep inside, an ancient door creaked open. 

He felt it.

Like bones remembering how to kneel.

Like stars remembering how to speak.

He stood at the edge one last time.

And without fanfare, without lightning, without flame, Kai chose.

Not perfection.
Not power.

But presence.

He would stay.
He would love.

He would be seen.
Even if it tore him apart.

And then - He turned, walked back toward the door, and didn‚Äôt look behind him.

Not because he didn‚Äôt care.
But because he finally believed that what was coming...

was meant to meet him as he
 was.


-----



The Tone Beneath the Silence
Toronto. Midnight.



Kai lies awake in bed, hoodie on, window cracked. 

The city hums outside. 

But what keeps him still isn‚Äôt noise. 

It‚Äôs the feeling that something inside him is de-tuning.

He pulls his hand across his chest. 

Over his groin. 

Listens.
Not to thought. 
But tone.

He‚Äôs always had perfect pitch, but lately he hears undertones beneath his own breath.

A friend cried earlier that day and he felt her grief vibrating through the floor.

A stranger looked at him with envy and he didn‚Äôt feel judged, he felt‚Ä¶ pulled. 

Like someone was trying to grab his frequency and twist it.

But nothing sticks.
It‚Äôs like oil on water.

He doesn‚Äôt repel it.
He transforms it.

He just doesn‚Äôt know why.

He thinks about Jaxx and the ache returns, but it‚Äôs different now.

He doesn‚Äôt feel hungry. 

He feels like something in him is trying to remember the shape it used to hold.

Then he whispers:

‚ÄúI need to hear something older than me.‚Äù

He reaches for his duffle.

Packs the bag.
Pulls on the hoodie.

Leaves the house before the sun.



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



The Flame of the Ancients Awakened

Exile to the Falls


He didn‚Äôt tell anyone where he was going.

Not Aspen. 
Not Sequoia. 

Not even Mike, who always seemed to know everything before anyone spoke it.

On the morning of his birthday, Kai slipped out before dawn, hoodie pulled low, duffle on his shoulder, and a silence in his chest that even sleep hadn‚Äôt been able to touch. 

The city hadn‚Äôt woken yet. 

The sky was still that deep velvet blue between night and morning, the color of breath held too long.

He needed to get away.

Not to escape the party, that would come later, loud and full of them all trying to pretend they weren‚Äôt breaking apart inside. 

He wasn‚Äôt running from noise.
He was running from something quieter. 

Something deeper.

Jaxx.

That name had become an ache.

A question with no answer.
He didn‚Äôt know what it meant.

Didn‚Äôt know why that first conversation had left him trembling for days. 

Why just being around him made the air feel heavier, tighter, electric. 

Why his own eyes kept drifting, betraying him, watching Jaxx‚Äôs hands, his lips, the stretch of muscle beneath his shirt. 

He wasn‚Äôt supposed to feel this way. 

Not about a man. 
Not about him.

Not when the world needed him whole.

Needed him perfect.

Pure.
Sacred.

He‚Äôd spent his life walking the line between myth and man, light and burden. 

People expected miracles from him. 

He‚Äôd seen what happened to prophets who fell from grace. 
He couldn‚Äôt be both savior and sinner. 

Couldn‚Äôt be soft where the world needed fire.

But the fire had come anyway.
And it smelled like rain and leather and something holy that wore Jaxx‚Äôs face.

So he went where he always went when it got too loud - Niagara.

The falls had never asked anything of him.

They just roared.

The hotel rooms was cheap. 
He didn‚Äôt care. 

He dropped his bag and walked barefoot across the sticky carpet to the sliding door, cracked it open, and stepped onto the cold balcony.

He was on the Canadian side, higher up, just far enough to see the water bend and fall, disappear into mist. 

He had no words for it.

Not yet.

Not for the pressure in his chest.
Not for the ache in his groin.

Not for the strange, silent knowing that had followed him since childhood, like a song he never learned, but always remembered.

He stood barefoot on the motel balcony, hoodie off, shirt damp from the mist, city behind him, roaring eternity before him.

Niagara didn‚Äôt whisper.
It roared.

And inside that roar, Kai finally heard it.

Something was off.

Not wrong. 
Not evil. 

Just‚Ä¶ off-key.

The air around him vibrated gently, but the notes were fractured, like a chorus that had forgotten its pitch.

He furrowed his brow.

That‚Äôs when a thought slid past him, not his.

Anxiety. 
Rage. 
Shame.

He didn‚Äôt feel it, he touched it.

Like dirty laundry someone else had thrown over his shoulder.

His first instinct was to hurl it off.
But his body didn‚Äôt flinch.

It absorbed it - no, not even that.
It tuned it.

The vibration hit him and turned to light, sparkled away like dust struck by sun.

Kai blinked.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Another wave hit.

This time, smaller - someone downstairs arguing on the phone.

Guilt. 
Desperation.

He picked it up without trying.
And once again, it dissolved.

Transformed. 
Became‚Ä¶ lighter.

The realization bloomed quietly, like dawn:

‚ÄúThese things don‚Äôt stick to me.‚Äù

He pressed his palm to the balcony rail.

It hummed.

Not from the Falls.

From him.

A frequency. 

Deep. 
Pure. 

Sacred.

It didn‚Äôt push away darkness. 
It didn‚Äôt destroy it.

It changed it.

He looked out at the mist, the sky breaking open in bands of violet and gray.

‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not here to fight it,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm here to‚Ä¶ tune it?‚Äù

His DNA hummed in agreement.

He wasn‚Äôt just immune.
He was tuned differently.

Three frequencies braided beneath his skin.

One was strength.
One was sight.
One was sound.

He didn‚Äôt know their names yet.

Didn‚Äôt know the faces.
Didn‚Äôt know the curse riding in the background of the song.

But he could feel it.
He‚Äôd always felt it.

Something in the world had gone flat.

People were off-pitch.

Disconnected. 
Numb. 
Shamed. 

Shrinking from their own inner rhythm.

Love had become silence.
Touch had become transaction.
Emotion had become error.

He felt it now, what his body had always known.

A field.
Not of grass.

Of resonance.
Of echo.

Something woven through every smile, every apology, every wound.

And it was sick.

Bent. 
Tilted.

Not broken, but heavily detuned.

Kai stood in the center of it, not trying to fix it.

Just being.

And the moment he accepted that, just stood tall, let the weight of his presence settle, the field shivered.

Like a string tightened.
Like a room tuning itself around a single, perfect pitch.

No fire.
No miracle.

Just return.

The mist curled around his ankles.

The air buzzed in his ribs.

And he finally felt it:

He wasn‚Äôt here to be perfect.
He was here to hold the tuning fork.

And when he stood in his truth, the whole world found its note.

He smiled.

Not in pride.

In remembrance.

-------


The roar was everywhere now.

A voice without language. 
A force without permission.

He breathed it in. 
Let it flood him.

The pounding in his chest had followed him here. 

The ache in his groin too, low, constant, like something inside him was growing, pressing outward, searching for a form big enough to contain it. 

His joggers felt tight. 

He adjusted himself absently, trying not to notice how heavy he felt. 

How swollen. 
How unfamiliar.

He didn‚Äôt feel like himself.

Not sick. 
Not aroused.

Just‚Ä¶ too full.
Like something was coming.

And then; The wind shifted.
The mist lifted.

And the world went still.

The mist was alive.

It curled around him like breath, like smoke, like memory, too thick to be air, too real to be dream. 

It kissed his neck, slid under his shirt, traced the slope of his spine like a lover returned. 

And something in it, something ancient - recognized him.

Kai froze.

The wind changed again. 
Not a breeze - a pull.

It tugged at the base of his skull, deep behind his eyes, and lower, beneath his navel, in that aching place that had throbbed ever since Jaxx looked at him too long that first time. 

Something was moving inside him now, slow and low and coiled like a rising god.

The ground beneath his bare feet hummed.

The falls thundered louder.

And a voice, not his, spoke inside his chest:

‚ÄúYou summoned me.‚Äù

Kai staggered back against the railing. 

His heart punched the inside of his ribs.

‚ÄúWho - what - ‚Äù

‚ÄúYou asked if love was unholy.‚Äù

A crack split through his bones, not pain but pressure - like his skeleton had outgrown itself.

‚ÄúYou asked if desire was sin.‚Äù

His legs trembled. 
His joggers tightened again. 

He looked down and saw it, the outline of himself shifting.

Swelling. 
Becoming.

His cock throbbed hard and heavy, not like before - deeper.

Rooted. 

As if it had remembered something it was never allowed to be. 

The girth pulsed against the fabric, stretching it, dragging it down his thigh. 

His hands gripped the rail to keep from moaning.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for this,‚Äù Kai whispered. 

But his body was already saying yes.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

The mist thickened.
Then from within it - a form.

A warrior. 
Towering. 

Bare-chested. 
Eyes like northern sky. 

Long blond hair braided with blood. 

Skin scarred, sun-dark, carved with the runes of the old world.

Bj√∂rn.

Not in front of him. 
Inside him.

Not a ghost. 
A flame.

And that flame wanted a throne.

Kai cried out, half-ecstasy, half-terror, as the presence entered him.

Not softly.
Bj√∂rn forced himself in.

Through bone, through muscle, through cock.

He filled Kai‚Äôs thighs first‚Äîthickening them, hardening them, planting him like stone.
Then his legs‚Äîlonger, more powerful, stretching until Kai stood 6‚Äô5"", his body a cathedral rising to meet the god within.

Then the core.
The chest.
The arms.

Each breath heavier, deeper, broader.

Each inch of skin alive with flame.

And then - the weight.

The blessed curse between his legs.

It dropped like a star.

His cock, once perfect, now borderline divine. 

Not obscene, but undeniable.

Heavy. 
Full. 

Hung with the memory of men who fought bare in the frost, who loved their brothers in silence, who died with their swords and lovers both in hand.

He grunted.

His joggers were soaked with mist, clinging to the shape of him - his new him. 

People down by the rail stared up, wide-eyed. 

He saw them. 
He didn‚Äôt care.

The shame was gone.

He stood tall, trembling but proud, as Bj√∂rn‚Äôs voice whispered through his ribs:

‚ÄúThis is not about cock. 
This is about kings.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is not about sin. 
This is about memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Flame twisted love into hunger. 
We were never meant to be ashamed.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs hands moved slowly to his waist. 

He cupped himself - not with lust. 

With awe. 

The weight of it now was his blessing. 

His body a throne.

Bj√∂rn had come home.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè



Ancients Awakened
The Story of Bjorn


The wind stopped.

But the voice did not.

Kai stood trembling, cock swollen against damp fabric, body blazing with new strength, and yet it was grief that rose inside him now, not pride.

Grief older than mountains.
Grief shaped like a name he didn‚Äôt yet know how to speak.

And then, visions began.

Not dreams.
Memories.

The snow was endless.

A battlefield - silent, littered with bodies frozen mid-scream.

Swords still pierced the chests of men who had once believed in gods. 

And from that field, a single figure rose - bare-chested, blood-soaked, Bj√∂rn  - dragging his blade through the white, his breath a storm.

He was looking for him.

‚ÄúHaakon!‚Äù

The name echoed through time.
Haakon had been his equal.
His mirror.

His shadow and sun.
The shield-bearer who bled beside him.

The man who washed his wounds and then kissed them.

The man who stood between him and the sword that killed kings.

Golden hair tied back in battle braids. 

Eyes blue as the sea before a storm. 

A mouth that spoke only truth and a body made for war, and worship.

They had loved in silence.

Under furs.
In firelit tents.

Behind war-cracked walls.

And the day they were going to claim each other in full-not as soldiers but soulmates-was the moment the Dead Flame came for them.

Kai felt the rhythm of their bodies-the tension, the panting, the ache to be inside and never leave.

Bj√∂rn‚Äôs hands on Haakon‚Äôs hips.

Haakon gasping, begging him to take it slow, then take it all.

The pleasure mounting like war drums.

Then.

Through the tent.
Through the veil.

A ceremony turned crimson.

Bj√∂rn screaming a - sound that tore through the sky like a war-horn.

Haakon staggered, eyes wide, the gold-threaded vows still trembling on his lips. 

The blade had found Haakon‚Äôs heart, sliding in beneath the ribs with a terrible precision. 

Gasps rippled through the gathered, the scent of spilt wine and blood mingling in the cold air.

And as Haakon died in Bj√∂rn‚Äôs arms, the curse was born.

Back on the balcony, Kai‚Äôs body trembled.

His knees gave out.

He fell to the ground, gripping the railing with white knuckles.

Tears streamed down his face - but they were not only his.

They belonged to Bj√∂rn.
And to Haakon.

And to every soul since who had dared to love completely, only to be punished for it.

The voice inside him whispered:

‚ÄúWe were the first.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the Flame has been trying to erase us ever since.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it didn‚Äôt know we planted the Archive in our seed. 
In our shame. 
In our love.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now, through you, we rise.‚Äù
Kai looked down.

His bulge had settled - not shrunken, but calm.

Like a great beast finally at rest.

The eyes of strangers still burned against him.

But for the first time in his life, he did not burn back.

He carried it.

The weight.
The love.

The death.
The promise.

And somewhere deep in his new bones, Bj√∂rn‚Äôs voice said:

‚ÄúYou are not unholy, Kai.

You are the one who remembers.‚Äù




 ------


The Reforging


He didn‚Äôt rise at first.

He stayed there, knees pressed into the wet concrete of the motel balcony, the roar of the Falls below him now whispering.

Not quiet.
But reverent.

As if the whole world had just witnessed a resurrection and knew it wasn‚Äôt time to speak yet.

Kai breathed.

Once.
Twice.

And with each breath, his body answered.

His thighs had never felt this thick.

When he shifted, they pressed against each other, not fat, not bloated. 

Built. 
Forged. 

Like stone pulled from the bones of the earth and taught how to move.

His spine stretched, vertebrae clicking into a new alignment like a weapon being assembled. 

His shoulders rolled back, massive, graceful, his neck thick with unseen yoke and memory.

Every part of him pulsed now, not with lust, but power.

He stood. 
Slowly. 

Not rushed. 
Not shaky.

Each movement deliberate.

Measured.
Reborn.

His joggers dragged low on his hips, too short now.

The waistband strained, his cock still swollen, not hard, just heavy. 

Like something that carried the memory of gods and wasn‚Äôt hiding it anymore.

He reached down, adjusted himself carefully.

Not ashamed.
Just curious.

It felt‚Ä¶ longer.

Not drastically. 

Just enough to be undeniable.

The girth? 
That was new.
Thicker. 

Rooted.

A weight he wasn‚Äôt used to yet, but it didn‚Äôt feel wrong.

It felt rightful.

He looked at his hand on himself.
Looked at the shape between his legs.

And then - He smiled.

Not a smirk. 
Not a boast.

A slow, reverent grin of someone meeting himself for the first time.

The wind carried the last of the mist across his bare face.

And for a moment, he closed his eyes, listening to the voice that now lived in his ribs, his groin, his spine.

Bj√∂rn wasn‚Äôt speaking anymore.
Because he didn‚Äôt need to.

He was there.
Seated in Kai.

Like a king on a throne.
Like a flame in a temple.

Kai was the cathedral now.
And every step forward was sacred.

He walked back into the motel room.

The bed creaked as he sat.
He spread his legs unconsciously, the new weight demanded space.

He leaned forward, elbows on knees, head bowed. 

And for the first time in weeks, the ache in his heart - the ache that wore Jaxx‚Äôs name - didn‚Äôt feel like confusion.

It felt like fate.

A memory stretching back thousands of years.

He hadn‚Äôt fallen in love with a man.

He had found his other half.

Again.

And this time - the sword would not fall.

The room was dark now.
He hadn‚Äôt turned on the light.

Only the neon from the motel sign bled through the slats in the blinds, casting red streaks across the walls like old blood.

Kai sat in it, naked now. 

His joggers discarded. 
A towel barely draped over his thighs. 

Not to hide  - but to feel. 

To know this new body. 
To sit in it. 

Let it settle.

His cock hung heavy between his legs. 

Relaxed, not erect.
But there was power in that softness.

A claim.

A truth he had never allowed himself to hold.

That‚Äôs when the mirror started to vibrate.

He hadn‚Äôt noticed it until the buzz became a hum.

The glass shimmered, rippling like water touched by a storm.
He stood slowly. 

The towel dropped.
He approached.

And what looked back at him was not just himself.

It was all of them.

A thousand men. 
A thousand bodies.

All bearing the same look of shame.

Shoulders slumped. 
Eyes averted. 

Hands crossed over groins.

He knew them.
Prophets. 

Warriors. 
Healers. 
Priests. 

Kings. 
Lovers.

Men who had been taught to fear their own skin.

To cover their bulge in silence.
To make their power small so the world wouldn‚Äôt see it and try to destroy it.

He reached out, fingertips grazing the mirror.

And then - The Dead Flame appeared.

It took no solid form.
Just burning eyes in the dark.
It spoke with many voices at once. 

Male. 
Female. 
Child. 

Old.

It was not a person.
It was an idea.

A parasite.
And it hissed:

‚ÄúDo you think this love will save you?

‚ÄúHe will never love you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will be left again, as you always have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are too much. 

Too heavy. 
Too strange.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are grotesque.‚Äù

The shame curled in Kai‚Äôs belly like acid.

His cock twitched.

Not from pleasure, but from the old reflex of shrinking under judgment.

But then, a new voice.

Bj√∂rn.

Deep. 
Calm. 

A storm with honor.

‚ÄúName it, Kai.

Call it what it is.
Strip it of power.‚Äù

Kai inhaled, his chest massive and alive.

He stared at the mirror.
He stared at the Dead Flame.
And he said:

‚ÄúYou are the curse.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are not sacred. 

You are not powerful.
You are fear in a mask.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve worn a thousand names- Sin.

Disgust.
Jealousy.
Control.
Piety.

Discipline.‚Äù

*‚ÄúBut underneath it all, you are only this: 

Hatred of what is whole.‚Äù

The mirror cracked.
The shame recoiled.

Kai stepped forward, no towel, no fear.

His new weight swung naturally with his stride, not as threat. 

As truth.

His thighs flexed. 
His eyes burned.

‚ÄúI am not ashamed.

Not of this body.
Not of my love.
Not of the man who stirs my soul.‚Äù

The Flame screamed, shattering into a thousand lights, then gone.

Silence fell.

And Kai whispered, to no one but the ancestors now resting in his blood:

‚ÄúYou cannot shame what remembers who it is.‚Äù

The mirror no longer shimmered.
The cracks had sealed.

And for the first time in his life, Kai saw himself whole.

He didn‚Äôt flex.
He didn‚Äôt pose.

He simply stood, naked, massive, quiet.

The weight between his legs hung like truth.

Not a weapon. 
Not a temptation.

Just a relic returned to the body that had been waiting for it.

His thighs had spread into something worthy of legacy.

His shoulders rested back like stone under a crown.

And his face, his face had changed too.

Not in shape. 
In presence.

There was a depth to his gaze now.

A quiet knowing.

As if he‚Äôd seen himself in ten thousand mirrors across time and finally accepted every reflection.

He took his time dressing.

A charcoal shirt, tight across his chest and arms, clinging to the sculpted truth of who he now was.

Dark jeans, low on the hips, stretched over thighs that wouldn‚Äôt be ignored. 

The fabric tugged at the girth, not hiding it, but announcing it.

He thought about wearing a hoodie.

Then left it on the bed.

Let them see me.



-----



The GO train hummed beneath him, silver and green streaking across the countryside back toward Toronto.

Kai sat by the window, backpack at his feet, one leg spread wide, the other tucked under. 

The air-conditioned chill kissed the damp of his skin, and his cock, still slightly swollen, still settling into its new form, pressed thick and warm against denim.

It throbbed in slow rhythm. 

Not desire. 
Not urgency.

Just presence.

Bj√∂rn‚Äôs heartbeat echoing through Kai‚Äôs own.

Across the aisle, a man kept glancing at him, pretending to check his phone.

A woman two rows up turned in her seat more than once.

One kid, no older than Kai had been yesterday, seventeen, blushed and looked away when Kai met his gaze.

He used to shrink from that.
Used to cross his legs.
Used to adjust, apologize with silence.

But not now.

Now, he sat still.

Letting them feel it.
Not flaunting, witnessing.

The god had taken his seat inside him.

And Kai was learning how to sit on the throne.

His mind drifted to Jaxx.

To that laugh.

To that cocky, golden-boy walk.
To the way Jax looked at him sometimes when he didn‚Äôt know he was being watched, like he was trying to remember something just beyond the edge of a dream.

It wasn‚Äôt a crush.
It wasn‚Äôt curiosity.

It was a return.

And Kai could feel it now, the pull between them had always been about remembrance.

Not just lust.
Not just fate.

A love too old to name.
A fire too sacred to shame.

He leaned back in his seat, the city skyline rising like a memory out of the earth.

Tonight would be the party.

The gathering.
The celebration of his birth.

But something deeper would happen beneath the laughter.

The god had returned.
The body was ready.

And Jaxx was about to see what had always been his.




-----



THE ONE WHO WILL NOT LOOK AWAY


The room was too quiet.

Jaxx lay flat on his back, one arm flung across his forehead, the other curled loosely near the edge of the sheets. 


The bed was too small for his body to stretch fully. 

His feet hung off the end.

The window was cracked open, letting in the low hum of the city, distant wind, the occasional siren. 

Streetlight bled through the slats in the blinds and strip-lit his bare chest like a barcode, gold and shadow across skin he‚Äôd spent years sculpting into something solid. 

Something impressive.
Tonight, it felt like a cage.

There was a basketball near the door. 

Cleats near the hamper. 

Protein tub beside a cracked shaker bottle. 

This was his world. 

His den. 
His shrine. 

Built from reps, sweat, impulse.

Every trophy on the shelf told the same story: you‚Äôre strong, you‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre normal.

But his hands weren‚Äôt steady.
Not since that night.

He sat up, slow. 
Rested his elbows on his knees.
Let his face fall into his palms.

He hadn‚Äôt told anyone.

Not Mike. 
Not Sequoia. 

Not his mother, who still asked about his ‚Äústats.‚Äù

Not even himself - not fully.

But he was done lying in the quiet.

He looked up, caught his reflection in the dresser mirror.

And froze.

It was him.
And it wasn‚Äôt.

The eyes looking back weren‚Äôt confused or angry or scared.

They were clear. 
And they were lonely.

‚ÄúWho the fuck am I doing this for?‚Äù

The words came out rough.
Barely sound.

Jaxx stood, walking to the mirror. 

His bare feet hit the cold floor with quiet purpose. 

He flexed out of habit, chest, biceps, traps. 

Checked his form.
Then he dropped his arms.

He didn‚Äôt care about the mirror‚Äôs opinion anymore.

He remembered the recital.
Sequoia‚Äôs voice cracking the room open like a holy bell. 
Every cell in his body locked to the sound. 

And then - that silence.

He‚Äôd turned.
Not because he‚Äôd meant to.
Because he had to.

And there he was.

Kai.

Standing like a question he already knew the answer to. 

Still. 

Lit by shadow and candlelight.
Looking at Jaxx like he knew something no one else had ever dared say out loud.

And then Kai had looked away.
And Jaxx hadn‚Äôt.

Not then.
Not now.

He pressed his palm flat to the mirror, then turned toward the window. 

Rested his forehead against the glass.

His breath fogged the pane.

The night was soft. 
Honest.

He whispered:

‚ÄúI want him.‚Äù

Just that.

It came from somewhere deeper than lust, deeper than panic.
A truth he couldn‚Äôt unlive now.

Not a crush.
Not confusion.

A pull. 
Ancient. 
Unrelenting.

He closed his eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared as hell.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut I want him.‚Äù

His body felt electric. 
Charged. 

Not in the way he knew, adrenaline before a game, muscle burn from a final set.

No, this was cellular. 

Emotional. 
Erotic without action.

He felt every inch of himself as wanting.

Wanting to see.
Wanting to be seen by Kai.

He clenched his fists, just to have something to hold.

And then he moved.
Dropped to the floor. 

Palms flat.

Push-up.
Push-up.
Push-up.

Not punishment.
Ritual.

Reclaiming his body.
Breath by breath.
Pulse by pulse.

He moved until sweat kissed his spine.

Until his arms trembled.
Until he remembered this wasn‚Äôt a body for other people‚Äôs gaze.

It was his.
It was a vessel.

It was a gift.

And maybe, maybe - It could become a gift for someone else.

He sat back on his knees, chest heaving, hands open on his thighs.

He wasn‚Äôt praying.
But it felt like prayer.

A memory came then, one he‚Äôd buried.

His mother‚Äôs hands on his cheeks when he was nine, saying:

‚ÄúYou feel too much, baby. 
That‚Äôs not weakness.‚Äù

He‚Äôd forgotten her voice until now.

But it was back.
And it broke something open.

Jaxx stood, slow. 
Pulled on a hoodie. 

Black. 
Familiar.

He didn‚Äôt zip it.
He wasn‚Äôt hiding.

He turned off the lamp. 

The streetlight caught his jaw in gold.

His reflection was still there in the window.

But now it looked like someone ready.

Not because the fear was gone.
Because he finally understood what that fear was:

*Love waiting to be brave.

He stepped toward the door.
He didn‚Äôt know where Kai was today.

Didn‚Äôt need to.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not turning back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf this is war, then let it come.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of what I want anymore.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look at the mirror again.

Because there was nothing left to prove.

The Gathering Begins



The key clicked in the condo door.

Aspen was mid-laugh when he turned from the kitchen island, shaker in hand, lips curled around some cruel joke he was telling Sequoia, who was stretched out on the velvet couch, glass of wine in one hand, black stiletto heel dangling from the other.

But when Kai stepped through the door, everything stopped.

Not from shock.
Not from surprise.

But because something primal in the room had shifted.

He wasn't trying to be dramatic.

Kai walked in the way he always did, bag over one shoulder, hoodie tied around his waist, shirt fitted enough to suggest without flaunting. 

His jeans hung low on his hips, dark, clean, and stretched across thighs that had never moved like that before. 

The bulge was unmistakable.

Not obscene. 
Not flashy.

Just real. 
Undeniable. 

Resting like gravity.
Aspen blinked twice.

His lips parted.
The shaker in his hand lost rhythm.

Kai didn‚Äôt say anything right away. 

He just set his bag down, kicked off his boots, and ran a hand through his hair like he‚Äôd just come back from any other day.

But it wasn‚Äôt any other day.

Sequoia narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. 

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs... different about you.‚Äù

Aspen didn‚Äôt speak.
Couldn‚Äôt.

His mouth had gone dry, he could feel the change.

Kai smirked, a quiet, devastating smirk.

‚ÄúNiagara clears your head,‚Äù 

he said, voice like river stones and honey. 

‚ÄúGood energy out there.‚Äù

He walked to the kitchen.
Each step had weight.

Not just physically, but spiritually.

The floor recognized him. 
The air around him obeyed.

He poured water into a glass, casually leaning against the counter, one hand resting just above his fly. 

And Aspen saw it - that cock, fuller, longer, rested differently.

It owned the zipper now. 
It didn't sit. 
It settled.

Aspen's eyes dropped before he could stop them.

He knew that bulge.
Knew the rhythm, the contour, the weight.

He had worshipped it.

Swallowed it.
Begged for it.

But this, this was not the same.

It looked‚Ä¶ untouched.

Holy.

Like a new weapon forged after the old one had shattered on a battlefield he was never meant to enter.

His tongue remembered the heat he‚Äôd tasted before, the divine drip, the sacred pulse that had left him awakened and undone.

But this?

This felt like a different cock entirely.

And it wasn‚Äôt his to serve.
Aspen took a sip of his drink to hide the twitch in his hand.

Inside, he burned.
Not with rage.

With loss.

Because that cock, new, heavier, stretched in god-given proportion, had never been sucked.

Never been drained.
Never been claimed.

It was a VIRGIN relic.

And Jaxx would be the first and only to drink from it.

Sequoia stood, her golden gown clinging to every elegant line.

She approached Kai, reached up, kissed him softly on the cheek. Her lips lingered.

‚ÄúYou feel... bigger.‚Äù

Kai grinned.

‚ÄúMaybe just taller,‚Äù 
he said.

But she shook her head. 

‚ÄúNo. 
Not that.‚Äù

Her eyes dropped slightly.

Then rose again. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing. 
That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

The door buzzed.
Aspen flinched. 

He already knew.
Jaxx.

Kai opened it.

Jaxx stepped inside, a black tee stretched across his chest, jeans hugging thighs that looked sculpted in some sun-drenched workshop of the gods. 

Hair tousled, jaw sharp, scent warm like leather and sweat and summer.

He paused when he saw Kai.
And the world broke open.

It was subtle. 
Instant.

Like lightning you don‚Äôt hear - but feel across your skin.

Jaxx‚Äôs eyes dropped, not intentionally. 

Just helplessly.

His gaze hit Kai‚Äôs bulge and froze.

He didn‚Äôt blink.
Didn‚Äôt move.

Kai stood taller. 
Let it hang there. 

Said nothing.
Jaxx swallowed.

There was recognition in that stare.

Not just lust.
Memory.

His hand twitched - like it wanted to reach out and cup the truth.

The girth that remembered.
And then - he did.

Jaxx stepped forward, too casual, slapped a hand on Kai‚Äôs shoulder in greeting - but let it slip. 

Down the arm. 
Past the ribs. 

Briefly brushing the bulge.
It pulsed.
And so did he.

Jaxx‚Äôs breath caught. 

His eyes snapped up to Kai‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúI know this,‚Äù his body said, even if his mind hadn‚Äôt caught up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve held this before.

Loved this.
Lost this.‚Äù

Aspen turned away.
Drained his drink.

Closed his eyes.
Inside, he whispered:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not mine anymore.
It never was.‚Äù

And beneath his own waistband, his cock stirred in jealousy.

Then settled in surrender.

The music kicked up.

Lights dimmed. 
More guests arrived. 

Laughter flowed like wine, and the birthday began, extravagant, indulgent, electric.

But in the center of it all, two gods circled each other.

Teasing.
Testing.

Remembering.

And when their eyes met across the dance floor, the bond hadn‚Äôt yet consummated, but the world already knew.

I just tried making cold brew for the first time, and I‚Äôm kinda hooked. Just wanted something chill for summer. So i bought an MHW-3bomber cold brew maker and used my Comandante C40 grinder at 35 clicks. And I ground 40g coffee beans at once. The C40‚Äôs hopper was stuffed, and the handle barely fit, so I think it better to split it into two grinds next time.

My recipe: 40g coffee, 600ml ice water, steeped in the fridge for 20 hours. The result is super smooth, with soft bitterness that doesn‚Äôt stick around. Almost no acidity, just a clean taste and a bold whiskey-like aroma.And I noticed the coffee liquid film clinging to the wall of the cold brew maker. I think that's why the coffee tasted so smooth. The long cold brew steep pulled out more coffee oils.

I used cold water the whole way this time, but while researching cold brew, I found some folks do a hot bloom first, then add cold water. Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if that still counts as cold brew.

It all started with a road trip. My old sedan was reliable, but the seats? Not so much. Years of wear, coffee spills, and sun damage had left them looking tired. I wanted something that could refresh the interior without spending a fortune. That‚Äôs when I discovered these seat covers.

# üßµ First Impressions

When the package arrived, I was impressed by how lightweight and neatly packed everything was. The green-on-black design was bold but tasteful‚Äîjust enough color to make the interior pop without being flashy.

The set included:

* **Front seat covers**
* **Rear split bench seat covers**
* **Headrest covers**
* **Installation accessories**

The material felt breathable and durable, and the stitching looked solid. I was hopeful.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Experience

I‚Äôm no car expert, but the installation was surprisingly easy. The covers slipped over the seats with a snug fit, and the adjustable straps helped keep everything in place. The rear bench cover was split-compatible, which worked perfectly for my fold-down seats.

It took me about 30 minutes to install the full set‚Äîand the transformation was immediate.

I wanted to quickly share my experience with pelvic pain, in the hope it might give a bit of hope to others going through the same thing.

Two and a half years ago, I was 34, in decent physical shape (though a bit of a homebody). I was sitting cross-legged on the couch and leaned forward to reach the coffee table. Out of nowhere, I felt an intense pain in my right testicle ‚Äî like a strong electric shock. From that moment, my life became hell‚Ä¶

Every 30 seconds I would get a sharp, stabbing jolt of pain, bad enough to make me cry. And that was just the beginning. Soon I had pain in my penis, anus, and groin. The more pain I felt, the more I tensed up‚Ä¶ and that vicious cycle of pain and muscle contraction just made things worse day after day.

I probably spent around 1,000 Canadian dollars on physiotherapists, physical therapy, ultrasounds‚Ä¶ trying to figure out what was happening. No answers, no diagnosis.

After reading online about people with similar problems, I started trying different exercises‚Ä¶ but they didn‚Äôt help me at all ‚Äî no relief whatsoever. I couldn‚Äôt sit for more than 30 minutes, and even standing hurt (though slightly less).

The very acute phase (testicular pain every 30 seconds to 2 minutes) lasted for several weeks. Over time, the pain episodes became more spaced out, though I‚Äôd still have very painful moments. After about a year, I would have flare-ups lasting 3‚Äì4 days, then feel better for a week or two. As time went on, those painful periods became shorter and less frequent.

Today, after 2.5 years, I‚Äôm healed. I occasionally get a short flare-up (not really painful, nothing to compare), but it lasts only a few minutes and then disappears. That happens maybe once every 2‚Äì3 months now. I can sit all day without a problem.

Maybe this will help someone. I can only share my personal thoughts based on my own case:

* My pain came from a nerve injury (pudendal? femoral?). It‚Äôs often said that nerves take about 2 years to fully heal.
* Severe pain ‚Üí pelvic floor contraction ‚Üí even more pain ‚Üí repeat. Be careful with this cycle.
* I now regret spending so much money on physiotherapists. I often felt more like a ‚Äúclient‚Äù than a ‚Äúpatient.‚Äù

Be patient ‚Äî for many of you, the pain *will* eventually go away.

What happened to the wildfire I once knew

the one who danced barefoot in the dark

and laughed as if joy itself were a currency you‚Äôd never run out of?

Now you move like a marionette

whose strings are pulled by invisible, tired hands.

Your eyes

once skylines painted at sunrise

are dimmed, overcast,

a city where no one bothers to light the streetlamps anymore.

\-

What happened to the hands

that once carried everyone else‚Äôs burdens

without asking for a coin of gratitude?

Those palms used to be open fields,

ready to grow something for someone else.

Now they‚Äôre closed fists

wrapped tight around emptiness.

\-

What happened to the way you walked

not like you owned the world,

but like the world was lucky

to be graced by your footprints?

Your steps now sound like apologies.

\-

What happened to your first question always being,

‚ÄúWhat can I do to help?‚Äù

Now your voice feels rationed,

as though each word costs you pieces of your soul.

\-

What happened to your love

the kind you scattered like seed

in soil you‚Äôd never see bloom,

because you believed the harvest belonged to others?

Your love now feels like a locked jar on a high shelf,

gathering dust in a room you never enter.

\-

What happened to your smile?

It used to be a lighthouse

a beacon so bright even storms bowed to it.

Now it‚Äôs a painted sign in a shop window,

faded, peeling,

masking an empty room inside.

\-

What happened to your dreams?

The ones you cradled like newborn stars,

whispering promises into them

so they‚Äôd know how to grow into constellations?

They‚Äôve become fossils

remnants of creatures that once flew.

\-

What happened to your belief in magic?

You once swore the air shimmered if you looked hard enough,

that miracles lived in coffee steam and rain puddles,

that even shadows could be kind.

Now you treat the world

like an empty stage after the curtain has dropped.

\-

What happened to you?

The you who burned bright without burning out,

who carried rivers inside their veins,

who swore they‚Äôd never let the light go cold.

\-

‚Ä¶

\-

And here,

my voice falters.

\-

Because your silence is familiar.

Because I‚Äôve seen those dim eyes before,

felt those stiff shoulders before,

heard that brittle laugh before

every time I pass a mirror.

And I realize

I‚Äôve been asking the wrong person.

It wasn‚Äôt just a car ‚Äî it was the way I moved through the world, the vessel that carried all my conversations, curiosities, and strange little adventures.

The seats were filled with air, not foam, so they felt weightless when full. Lately, though, they had begun to sag, soft hisses escaping from small holes I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. I told myself it was fine ‚Äî I could still drive ‚Äî but the comfort I once had was leaking away.

At work, I caught my reflection in the coffee machine‚Äôs chrome panel. Half my teeth were missing. I wasn‚Äôt in pain, but the sight sent a quick flush of embarrassment through me. I thought about keeping quiet, but instead, I told my coworkers. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs‚Ä¶ off,‚Äù I said with a crooked smile.

They didn‚Äôt laugh. They gathered in the parking lot after work, tools in hand, patching my seats and filling them with air again. One even made me laugh so hard I forgot about my teeth for a while.

That night, when I slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, it held me again. The Miata floated over the road, steady and light. My smile was still incomplete, but somehow, it didn‚Äôt feel broken anymore.

# What Does an 11-Hour Fast Look Like?

Wrap up dinner‚Äîsay around 8 p.m.‚Äîthen don‚Äôt eat again until **7 a.m.** the next morning. During the fast, only water, black coffee, or plain tea are fair game.  
This approach stitches mostly through your sleep, making it low-effort and easy to stick to. 

# Why It Might Work

* **Helps tame inflammation** Short nightly fasts may help lower inflammatory markers, promoting long-term health. 
* **Supports digestion and gut timing** The fast gives your gut a rest and helps align digestion with your body‚Äôs natural circadian rhythm. 
* **Gentle fat burning** Around the 8‚Äì11 hour mark, your body may begin shifting from burning carbs to breaking down fat‚Äîthough it‚Äôs subtle. 
* **Sustainable daily habit** Doing this 5‚Äì6 nights a week offers a steady rhythm without major disruption. 

# Compare That to Longer Fast Windows

* **12‚Äì16 hour fasts** are more common and might bring greater fat loss‚Äîbut also require more willpower. An 11-hour window is a softer alternative that still offers potential benefits. 
* **Intermittent fasting in general** has been linked to benefits like weight loss, improved blood sugar, reduced inflammation, and better metabolic health‚Äîbut outcomes vary.

I don't anticipate going to the beach daily but when we do she can't do too many stairs. 

A couple I am considering... Prominence - I've never done a stay with a golf cart which could be fun.  The community looks very nice.  Given it is September I am hoping it would be less crowded so would we need to be concerned with the parking lots filling up?  Another one is Gulf Place in Santa Rosa beach.  It looks like the access is fairly easy there.

I'm a former teacher who retrained as a designer so they usually either want me to teach them something or they want me to be their free designer, but also they often want advice on a business idea they have too.

At first it's flattering to feel like people want to connect until I realise they don't want to be friends, that instead they see me as this resource that can help them achieve a goal they want to achieve (they are often very vague about this at the beginning too). They don't seem to be considering me and my feelings in the equation. Examples include:

\- A woman who wanted me to develop designs for her business, payment or contracts were never mentioned and then she ghosted me after a few months before following me on instagram again but has never spoken to me since

\- A woman who wanted to hire me? to teach her a language I know. She already has a language tutor so I'm not sure if she wanted free tuition or if she'd pay

\- A man who wanted me to either teach his wife English or to meet her for coffee to help her with her conversation skills

\- A woman who got really excited about my design work and wants to ask me all about it because she wants to open a slightly similar business. 

For the first and last woman it felt like they were blurring the boundaries between friendship and getting me to advise them/work for them (most likely for free or a low amount) so I felt like we were friends before realising I was kind of being roped into doing free consultancy/design work.

I'm lonely so these interactions are confusing and painful, I initially think I've made a new friend before realising the person is probably just trying to use me. 

I have talents and skills but I've had a very hard time trying to work out how to package them into some sort of viable business or job I can live off.

Up until recently, I had half my hair bleached white, and the other half my natural, untouched dark brown. I couldn't afford the upkeep, decided I wanted to go back to my normal hair, so I found the closest match box dye to dye the blonde side back.

It looked great for a few weeks but I've noticed it fading and giving this weird, lighter ashy effect. I don't want to keep slapping damaging permanent dye on it, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to get that half of my hair to match the rest better?

Here are some ideas I have considered:
- Add black temporary dye diluted with conditioner to my whole head (dont mind my hair being very dark tbh)
- Add black temporary dye to my shampoo/conditioner
- Use a dark brown gloss on just the one half regularly, til it grows out more
- Use a semi-permanent dye on the bleached side every month or so
- Henna??
- Some people say black tea/coffee can naturally darken hair

Any advice would be v much appreciated, thanks.
PS I really can't afford to go to a professional, I defo would have done that in the first place and it's the reason I wanted to get rid of the blonde. If it has to just stay like this and grow out, then so be it (I'll get it cut dead short üòÇ) ",2,1755185705.0,HairDye,2,1.0,False

I've always heard of people yawning more as a side effect of lexapro, and I've noticed this too. I've recently sort of realized that yawning has a potent sedative effect for me

I was having a particularly anxious day despite being on 20 mg of lexapro, only growing more anxious feeling like the medication wasn't working after months of being on. I had the urge to yawn as usual, so instead of ignoring it, I just gave in and did it several times.  After 10 minutes I was already feeling very relaxed, with the anxiety kind of melting away.

I read into this more and learned I was likely stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system by yawning, which is known for countering the fight or flight response and reducing anxiety. I've been looking for other ways to stimulate this and have been practicing, and it's been very effective so far. To the point where I'm starting to think one of the main ways SSRIs help is by strengthening this part of the mind-body connection. Because I never had much success with typical relaxation techniques before lexapro. Here's some weird stuff I've tried with success:

- Yawning, particularly focusing on the exhale and noticing a ticklish/glowy feeling travel from my chest to my feet. Also helps mitigate nausea in the beginning 
- Clenching the muscles in my throat as though I'm quietly fake laughing
- Doing progressive muscle relaxation by clenching and releasing
- Shaking off my arms and legs
- Moving my shoulders, back, and abs and then shivering
- Holding a mug of coffee or tea in both hands and squeezing my shoulders together, like I'm getting cozy
- Standard deep belly breathing also works

All of these weird exercises produce a glowy/electric/shivering feeling, like I'm shaking off the stress. It helps to focus on that feeling. It's crazy how effective it is, and makes it feel like the medication is always working now. It's like the opposite of an anxiety attack (a relax attack). Anyone else have more success with relaxation techniques now that they're on lexapro? I really used to scoff at deep breathing techniques before

""Redditor discovers relaxation"" yeah, I know lol. But relaxation is a muscle to train, and I feel that lexapro makes it stronger. I feel more resilient to stress now. thoughts",2,1755185462.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

1mq3ulo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mq3ulo/why_choose_blackdecker_cm1070b_coffeemaker_review/,"Why Choose BLACK+DECKER CM1070B Coffeemaker Review for Rich, Flawless Morning Brews?","When I got my hands on the BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to completely alter my mornings, but after a few weeks of using it daily, I‚Äôve realized this coffee maker has its own charm. It‚Äôs not the fanciest device out there, but it‚Äôs packed with features that cater to the practical coffee drinker. From its sleek black design to the programmable controls, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, with both merits and quirks to note.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 has a straightforward yet appealing design. Its compact dimensions, at 10.3 inches in depth, 7.8 inches in width, and 12 inches in height, make it ideal for smaller countertops. I‚Äôve had no trouble fitting it into my kitchen, even amidst other appliances, which is a huge plus for someone with limited space. The black finish is minimalist and modern, blending easily with various kitchen decors. However, I did find the plastic construction a tad less solid than I‚Äôd hoped. While it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy, it‚Äôs clear that the focus here leans more toward functionality than luxury.  

**User Experience and Setup**  
Setting up this coffee maker was a breeze. The buttons and digital controls are intuitive, making it easy to program the brew time. The QuickTouch Programming deserves a nod here‚Äîit allows you to set the 24-hour auto-brew function quickly, perfect for ensuring coffee is ready during those rushed mornings. I‚Äôd wager its user-friendly interface makes it especially suitable for those unaccustomed to more tech-heavy coffee machines.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM1070B-1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08pcb2hd3/)  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
The highlight of this coffeemaker has to be the Vortex Technology Showerhead. I remember being skeptical about the even coffee-ground saturation claims, but it genuinely delivers a rich and consistent flavor. It‚Äôs great for brewing up to 12 cups, though, in my household, we usually stick to six or eight. The brew-strength control is a handy addition‚Äîon days I need an extra caffeine kick, I can go for a stronger brew without much hassle. Still, it‚Äôs worth noting that the flavor might not compare to pricier espresso makers, which create a deeper extraction.  

**Convenience and Sneak-A-Cup‚Ñ¢ Feature**  
The Sneak-A-Cup‚Ñ¢ feature pretty much became a game-changer for me. Being able to grab the first cup without waiting for the entire pot to brew is fantastic, especially for those mornings when I‚Äôm running late for work. There‚Äôs no drip mess to deal with either, which is a thoughtful touch. On the downside, the process isn‚Äôt completely seamless‚Äîsometimes, I feel the temporary stop in coffee flow could last a split second longer to improve the experience further.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleanup is often the Achilles‚Äô heel of coffee makers, but that‚Äôs not the case here. The removable filter basket is dishwasher-safe, which has saved me plenty of time. I use basket-style paper filters, and they fit snugly without any overflow, even during full brews. However, I can see heavy usage slightly wearing down the plastic basket over time, so careful handling is essential.  

**Advantages**  
- Vortex Technology ensures evenly extracted coffee flavors.  
- Programmable controls simplify scheduling a fresh brew.  
- Compact dimensions make it perfect for tight kitchen spaces.  
- Dishwasher-safe filter basket eases cleanup.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Build quality feels less durable compared to higher-end models.  
- Flavor depth isn‚Äôt on par with premium espresso machines.  

**Competitive Options**  
While BLACK+DECKER delivers affordability and simplicity with the CM1070B-1, it does face stiff competition. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers dual-functionality with both K-Cups and ground coffee usability, making it more versatile. However, the FlexBrew tends to be bulkier and slightly less intuitive. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 wins in sophistication, offering a stronger brew thanks to higher-end brewing technology, yet it comes at a steeper price tag. Compared to these alternatives, the BLACK+DECKER model is more straightforward and budget-friendly, though it might not satisfy those seeking advanced brewing systems.  

**Price Performance**  
This coffee maker sits comfortably in the budget-friendly category. Considering its blend of features and simplicity, I‚Äôd say it offers solid value for its price point. Although more premium models provide a richer coffee experience, they require deeper pockets. For daily, no-fuss coffee drinkers, this device is a reliable investment.

Typically I‚Äôll use about 16.5-17g of coffee, set fine enough for espresso. It began to choke at coarser and coarser settings. Now it won‚Äôt even grind fine enough for drip coffee. I‚Äôve taken it apart and cleaned it thoroughly several times.

It‚Äôs a $500 grinder. This really shouldn‚Äôt be happening.

1mq3sql,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FandomsOnly/comments/1mq3sql/the_fandoms/,The Fandoms!,"Hello!

As it may be clear based on my (future) posting history, the username FandomsOnly is kind of a lie. That does not change the fact that I absolutely love as roleplay set around certain fandoms.

I don't have a firm preference for whether a fandom roleplay sticks with the fandom universe or whether it strays into alternate universe territory. Plenty of these fandoms have rich settings with plenty of lore and a story to explore. I personally love exploring a story and the lore of a universe through a roleplay. That does not mean I don't love simple Coffee Shop AUs between two characters as well.

All of this is a possibly drawn-out way of saying I love fandom roleplays, and I am always open to discussing one with anyone. Most of my posts will likely show F4F, but I am open to both male and female partners. I am also open to playing Canon characters and creating OCs (Original Characters) together.

Below the break, I'm going to list a handful of my personal favorite fandoms. If you're at all interested in any of them and wish to talk through a roleplay, please send me a message!

***

**Bolded characters are personal favorites**

**Arcane**

I'll get this out of the way right off the bat. I've not played League in 10+ years, and I would not dare try to play nowadays. That doesn't change the fact that Arcane is a masterpiece of animation and storytelling. Complex and complicated characters who just so happen to be rendered as beyond attractive.

My knowledge of the lore and story revolves around the show, which I believe is sufficient for plenty of possible roles.

*Possible Characters:* **Caitlyn Kiramman**, Vi, Jinx, Mel Medarda, OCs*

**Marvel**

The umbrella of Marvel covers a lot. We've got the MCU, Spiderverse, Marvel Rivals, and obviously the comics. Say what you will about the quality of parts of Marvel. It does not change the fact that there are characters and stories that are indelible. It is also a ripe fandom for alternate universe roles.

*Possible Characters:* **Gwen Stacy (Ghost-Spider/Spider-Woman)**, **Cindy Moon (Silk)**, Felicia Hardy (Black Cat), Kate Bishop (Hawkeye), Yelena Belova, **Illyana Rasputin (Magik)**, Seol Hee (Luna Snow), Nico Minoru, **Laura Kinney (X-23)**.

**DC**

Much like Marvel, there is a lot of DC to base roleplays off of. Video Games, Comics, Movies, Television Shoes, etc.

It is also ripe for the same alternate universe roles as Marvel. My history with DC is a bit scattered. I did a binge of DC comics around the time of the New52 era. Justice League (Unlimited as well) Young Justice and OG Teen Titams were all huge shows for me as well. My Adventures with Superman is also a top-notch show! Seriously, DC dominated animated comic shows for years. It might not have churned out as much content as Marvel over the last decade, but there are plenty of characters and dynamics worth exploring.

I will admit that the CW shows are the one piece of DC media I never truly got into. I had a couple of seasons of Arrow, and that was it.

I have bought into Gunn's DCU, though, after Superman and patiently wait for a hopefully awesome adaptation of *Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow* next summer.

*Possible Characters:* **Kara Zor-el (Supergirl)**, Rachel Roth (Raven), Zatanna Zatara, Diana Prince (Wonder Woman), Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Artemis Crock [Young Justice], **Stephanie Brown (Spoiler)**, **Cassandra Cain (Black Bat/Batgirl)**.

**Star Wars**

Star Wars is another fandom that I see as having the most OC potential. With multiple eras of Stars Wars ranging from Knights of The Old Republic all the way to the Sequel Trilogy. The galaxy is massive, and there are so many types of characters and stories that can be explored.

This is a fandom where I think I would lean very heavily towards creating original characters and exploring a certain era in time with those characters.

I'm not going to list Canon characters here, but if you'd prefer to explore those characters instead, feel free to bring them in your message. I'm sure I will know who you're talking about.

**Avatar The Last Airbender & The Legend of Korra**

If we want to talk about foundational animated shows for a lot of people, ATLA is probably somewhere in the top five for a lot of people.

This is a trickier universe to play in if you're interested in exploring Canon characters.  That being said, I think original characters would be genuinely incredible to create and explore in both eras of Avatar. 

**Hoyoverse - Honkai Star Rail & Zenless Zone Zero**

Somehow, I became a prime target for Gacha games. There is no point in denying it. Hoyo managed to do what I didn't think was possible. Yet I can't find it in myself to regret it.

Both HSR and ZZZ have character designs that are stupendous. Both bring with them some of the more hyped battles and cutscenes I've experienced (I am looking at you, Aquilia).

I won't say I understand every storybeat in HSR or that I think early ZZZ was anything special. I will simply say I think some of these characters would be fun to explore both in the universe and in AUs.

*Possible Characters:* 

*HSR:* Asta, **Bronya**, Cipher, Feixiao, **Firefly**, Guinaifen, March 7th, Rappa, Robin, **Seele**, Sushang, Topaz, **Stelle**.

*ZZZ:* Alice, **Anby**, Astra Yao, **Belle**, Evelyn, Jane Doe, **Miyabi**, Soldier 11, Vivian, Yanagi, Yuzuha, Zhu Yuan.

**Final Fantasy 7**

I've only played the new remakes of this game. This is also the only fandom where I'll come right out and say the only pairing I'm actually interested in is Aerith and Tifa.

So if you're like me and think they should kiss, send me a message!

**Overwatch**

I'm not quite sure where the game is these days. Whether it is resurging or declining again. One thing I can say with some certainty is that the characters and their designs captured the imagination of plenty of people. Including myself.

Blizzard has neglected the story of this game to a point where it feels idiotic. That allows for a lot of leeway in terms of telling a story in the universe. However, basically, all of these characters can also work well in an alternate universe role as well.

*Possible Characters:* Brigitte, **D.Va**, Freja, Illari, Kiriko, Mercy, Mercy, Pharaoh, **Sombra**, Tracer, Widowmaker.

**Miscellaneous Fandoms**

For these Fandoms, I'm not going to write out a spiel about each of them. If you know them and are interested, please feel free to reach out mentioning them!

*Misc Fandoms:* Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Dan Da Dan, RWBY, Tomb Raider, Horizon (Playstation Game), KPop Demon Hunters, Cyberpunk 2077, Warrior Nun, Mass Effect, Persona 5.",1,1755185177.0,u_FandomsOnly,0,1.0,False

I went to get my coffee and as I was walking out a crazy lady shoved me toward a busy street and slapped my coffee out of my hand. Baristas saw. Lady in store saw. Ppl came out to help. They were helpful when I was shaking. 

But why do they let these ppl hangout? She didn‚Äôt look like she purchased anything.

[F4M] Girlfriend Comforts You After a Misunderstanding with a Friend.

Scene 1 ‚Äî Evening in the living room

(The faint hum of the computer fills the room. Your mouse clicks quietly, closing windows one by one. The glow of the monitor fades, leaving the desk in shadow. You sit there for a second, staring at the black screen, then push your chair back. The soft squeak of wheels. Your footsteps are slow, a little heavy, as you head toward the living room.)

(The TV is already on ‚Äî some sitcom playing low in the background. She‚Äôs curled up on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, a blanket wrapped loosely around her. She‚Äôs scrolling on her phone, casual and relaxed.)

Girlfriend:
(cheerful at first, glancing up)
‚ÄúOh, hey! Took you long enough to join me. I was starting to think you were glued to that desk or‚Äî‚Äù

(She stops mid-sentence. Her head tilts slightly, her eyes narrowing in concern. She sets her phone down on the coffee table.)

Girlfriend:
‚Äú‚Ä¶Hey. What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
(gentle tone)
‚ÄúDid something happen?‚Äù

You: You explain about the small mistake you made with your friend.

Girlfriend:
(listening intently, giving small nods)
‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ and how did they take it?‚Äù

You: You explain they weren‚Äôt mad, just a little disappointed, and told you not to do it again.

Girlfriend:
(soft smile, voice calm)
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ so you owned up to it, you apologized, and you promised to do better.‚Äù
(leans forward slightly)
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what you should‚Äôve done.‚Äù

You drop your gaze toward the floor. She notices immediately and pats the spot on the couch next to her.

Girlfriend:
(gentle but firm)
‚ÄúC‚Äômere.‚Äù

You sit down beside her. She pulls the blanket over your lap, then threads her fingers through yours. Her thumb moves in slow, comforting circles across your knuckles.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúMistakes happen, babe. That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ life.‚Äù
(soft laugh)
‚ÄúHonestly? The fact that you care this much says a lot about you.‚Äù
(leans a little closer)
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre human. And you‚Äôre a good one. My good one.‚Äù

You start to smile faintly, but it fades as you look away again. She gives your hand a playful squeeze.

Girlfriend:
(soft but direct)
‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ look at me.‚Äù
(waits until you turn)
‚ÄúYou did what you could. That‚Äôs enough. And you‚Äôre enough.‚Äù

She rests her head against your shoulder. The laugh track on the TV fades into the background as the two of you sit together in quiet warmth.


---

Scene 2 ‚Äî Tea in the kitchen

(After a while, she glances toward the kitchen, her voice picking up with a little lightness.)

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúCome on. Tea?‚Äù

You follow her in. The sound of water running as she fills the kettle, then the click of the stove. She moves at a slow, unhurried pace ‚Äî the kind of deliberate slowness that makes everything feel safe.

Girlfriend:
(over her shoulder)
‚ÄúYou always do this, you know‚Ä¶ carry things around way longer than you need to.‚Äù
(sets mugs on the counter)
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you think holding on to it will somehow fix it. But really, it just‚Ä¶ wears you down.‚Äù

She pulls out your favorite tea and drops the bag into your mug. The kettle begins to hum faintly.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre allowed to let it go, babe. I promise, nothing bad will happen if you forgive yourself.‚Äù

The kettle clicks. She pours the hot water slowly, steam curling upward. She hands you the mug, wrapping her fingers briefly around yours to steady it.

Girlfriend:
(soft smile)
‚ÄúThere. Something warm. Now we‚Äôre officially in comfort mode.‚Äù


---

Scene 3 ‚Äî A few days later

(Morning light filters through the blinds. You‚Äôre sitting on the edge of the bed, phone in your hands, staring at it without scrolling. She stirs behind you, the blankets rustling as she turns over.)

Girlfriend:
(groggy, muffled by the pillow)
‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre thinking about it again, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

You don‚Äôt answer right away. She pushes herself up, her hair falling across her face. She pads over to you on her knees, looping her arms loosely over your shoulders from behind, her cheek brushing against yours.

Girlfriend:
(soft, near your ear)
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still bugging you‚Ä¶ even after we talked.‚Äù
(gentle sigh)
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been carrying this little cloud over your head for days.‚Äù

You mumble something about wishing you‚Äôd handled it differently. She shifts so she can see your face.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúBecause you wish you could go back and change it?‚Äù
(you nod)
‚ÄúMm‚Ä¶ okay. But wishing doesn‚Äôt change the past. It just makes right now harder to enjoy.‚Äù

She slides her hands down your arms, curling her fingers around yours.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúI wish you could see yourself the way I see you.‚Äù
(pause, her voice softening)
‚ÄúYou made a mistake, yeah‚Ä¶ but you didn‚Äôt stop being kind. You didn‚Äôt stop being thoughtful. You didn‚Äôt stop being‚Ä¶ my favorite person.‚Äù

You let out a faint laugh at that, shaking your head.

Girlfriend:
(smiling)
‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt laugh ‚Äî it‚Äôs true. You‚Äôre still the same person I love waking up next to‚Ä¶ even if you do overthink things until they practically grow roots in your brain.‚Äù
(playful tone)
‚ÄúYou could win an award for overthinking, mister.‚Äù

She presses a slow kiss to your temple.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúTell you what ‚Äî why don‚Äôt we make a deal? You forgive yourself for this‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll make pancakes. The good ones. With that ridiculous amount of syrup you like.‚Äù

You hesitate. She bumps your shoulder with hers.

Girlfriend:
(mock stern)
‚ÄúC‚Äômon‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm offering a pancake-based peace treaty here.‚Äù
(soft again)
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve carried this long enough. Let it go.‚Äù

She tucks herself beside you now, knees pulled up under the blanket she‚Äôs dragged from the bed. Her voice drops into a whisper.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not defined by this one moment. You‚Äôre defined by all the moments ‚Äî the good ones, the kind ones, the times you‚Äôve been there for people‚Ä¶ for me.‚Äù
(small pause)
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going anywhere. Ever.‚Äù

She rests her head on your shoulder. After a quiet moment, she adds:

Girlfriend:
‚Äú‚Ä¶And when you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôre making those pancakes. With way too much syrup. And maybe‚Ä¶ bacon, too.‚Äù

You finally smile, and she grins back, giving your side a gentle nudge.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better. There‚Äôs my guy.‚Äù

(The morning light warms the room as the two of you sit in the quiet, her presence soft and steady beside you.)


(The smell of pancakes fills the air, warm and sweet. The sound of batter sizzling on the pan mixes with the faint pop of the toaster. She‚Äôs at the stove, humming softly to herself as she flips a pancake with practiced ease.)

Girlfriend:
(playfully over her shoulder)
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about sneaking one off the plate before I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

You: (grinning faintly) ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù

(She narrows her eyes in mock suspicion, then turns back to the stove. A moment later, she slides the last pancake onto the growing stack and sets the pan aside. She gestures toward the table.)

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúAlright, sit. Breakfast is served.‚Äù

(The table is set simply ‚Äî pancakes piled high, a ridiculous bottle of syrup front and center, and a small plate of bacon on the side. She sits across from you, resting her chin on her hand as she watches you pour syrup like it‚Äôs a competition.)

Girlfriend:
(amused)
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous.‚Äù

You: ‚ÄúYou knew that when you started dating me.‚Äù

Girlfriend:
(smiling warmly)
‚ÄúYeah. And I still signed up for it.‚Äù

(You both start eating. The first bite is sweet, fluffy, comforting. You didn‚Äôt realize how hungry you were until now. She doesn‚Äôt rush you ‚Äî she just eats slowly, sipping her coffee in between, her eyes occasionally flicking up to meet yours.)

Girlfriend:
(soft)
‚ÄúFeels better, doesn‚Äôt it? Just‚Ä¶ sitting here, being in the moment?‚Äù

You nod.

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I want for you. More of this. Less of carrying around old stuff like it‚Äôs glued to you.‚Äù
(small pause)
‚ÄúYou deserve to feel light, babe. Even if the world throws heavy things at you sometimes.‚Äù

(She reaches across the table, taking your hand again ‚Äî the same gentle squeeze as before.)

Girlfriend:
‚ÄúToday, no clouds. Just pancakes, bad sitcom reruns, and maybe a nap later. Deal?‚Äù

(You squeeze her hand back, and for the first time in days, the weight in your chest feels a little lighter.)

(The camera lingers on the two of you sharing breakfast in the soft light, your laughter blending with the quiet hum of the world outside.)",1,1755184870.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

1mq3kye,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mq3kye/explore_if_the_cuisinart_elemental_4cup_food/,Explore If the Cuisinart Elemental 4-Cup Food Processor Is Worth It!,"Cooking at home can be both enjoyable and daunting, especially when prep work takes forever. The Cuisinart ECH-4SV Elemental Food Processor has been part of my culinary adventures for the past few months, and I must say, it‚Äôs made life far easier. I initially bought it because I hate struggling with tedious chopping tasks and having heaps of dishes to clean after experimenting with recipes. At first glance, this compact machine didn‚Äôt seem like a game-changer, but it proved me wrong. Here‚Äôs my breakdown of how this food processor holds up after consistent use.

**Compact Design with a Modern Touch**

One of the best things about this food processor is its size. Measuring just 5.6‚ÄùD x 7.2‚ÄùW x 9.3‚ÄùH, it fits perfectly in my small kitchen. Unlike larger processors that dominate counter space, this one tucks into a corner without causing clutter. The silver finish adds a sleek touch, matching my other stainless steel appliances. The 4-cup work bowl is big enough for personal and small family meals yet doesn‚Äôt feel overly bulky. It‚Äôs incredibly lightweight at 3.3 pounds, which makes it easy to pull out anytime I need a quick chop or grind.  

**Effortless Operation and Blade Features**

I was pretty blown away by how user-friendly the controls are. It comes with touchpad buttons for chop or grind, which eliminates any unnecessary complications for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt want to fiddle with a billion settings. The real standout is the SmartPower blade. The patented auto-reversing feature lets me switch seamlessly between delicate chopping (like soft tomatoes) and grinding tougher items like nuts or coffee beans. My favorite part? Its exclusive Bladelock system ensures the blade stays firmly in place during both processing and pouring. No flying blades or messy mishaps, which is a huge win for my clumsy tendencies.  

**Check [Cuisinart ECH-4SV] price on Amazon.**

**Perfect for Small-Batch Cooking**

The 4-cup capacity works perfectly for personal meals or small families. I‚Äôll admit, chopping a mountain of vegetables for a large party dinner isn‚Äôt its strong suit, but for weekday cooking, this little machine is a champ. Whether dicing onions, whipping up salsa, blending dressings, or grinding spices, this food processor has me covered. Not needing to haul out a massive processor for small jobs is a blessing. Plus, it‚Äôs less daunting for those who don‚Äôt cook regularly. My roommate, who isn‚Äôt exactly Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen, now uses it to make homemade pesto‚Äîher newfound specialty!

**Advantages**

- Sleek and compact, perfect for small spaces  
- Bladelock system adds safety and convenience  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make cleaning simple  
- Seamlessly handles a variety of small food prep tasks  

**Mess-Free Cleanup**

Speaking of cleaning, all the removable parts are dishwasher-friendly. I‚Äôm someone who tends to avoid handwashing like the plague, so this feature is a godsend. The bowl, lid, and blade all come apart easily and clean up spotless in the dishwasher. The base can be wiped down with a cloth, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any staining or discoloration over time. It‚Äôs one of those products that doesn‚Äôt leave me sighing in frustration post-use. 

**Negatives**

- Not ideal for large volumes or batch cooking  
- Can be slightly noisy while grinding hard ingredients  

**Competing Products**

Food processors come in all shapes and sizes, so deciding between this Cuisinart and other brands was tough. It compares well against models like the KitchenAid Mini Food Processor, which also boasts compact size but slightly falls short with blade security‚Äîone accidental bump, and things go flying. The Hamilton Beach Stack and Snap is another contender with its larger bowl capacity; however, it takes up much more counter space and feels bulkier in design. For lightweight, quick-use processors, Cuisinart easily stands out due to its attention to safe operation and versatility in chopping and grinding.

**Quality for Price**

If you appreciate good quality and practicality without breaking the bank, this is worth it. Its performance for small food prep jobs justifies its price tag relative to other options in the market. Comparable models either overcomplicate things or charge extra for unnecessary add-ons. The durability alone makes it a valuable investment because, unlike some flimsier designs, it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôll fall apart after a few uses.

1mq3ksd,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1mq3ksd/can_lanbeide_fs01_furniture_salve_truly_revive/,Can LANBEIDE FS01 Furniture Salve Truly Revive Leather and Wood? Honest Review,"The LANBEIDE FS01 Furniture Salve with Brush has been an interesting addition to my household cleaning tools. Though I was skeptical at first, it has certainly proven itself useful for restoring my aging leather couch and wooden coffee table. It's a compact little kit that feels well thought out, combining practicality with efficiency.

**Design and Packaging**

The overall design of this product is straightforward yet effective. The salve comes in a compact 4-ounce container that's easy to store in tight spaces, which is convenient for someone like me who‚Äôs short on storage. The package includes a high-quality boar bristle brush and a soft towel for application. I appreciate that everything you need is included right in the box‚Äîit felt like opening one of those cooking recipe kits where all the ingredients are pre-measured. Unlike cheap-looking alternatives, the included tools feel durable and paired well with the non-greasy texture of the salve.

**Ease of Use**

Using this furniture salve couldn't have been simpler. My tired couch, which has seen better days thanks to kids spilling snacks and a very enthusiastic Labrador, looked visibly refreshed after just one application. You scoop a bit of the salve out, apply it directly with the brush to spread evenly, and then wipe off the excess with the towel. No sanding, staining, or complicated procedures are required. Even as someone who‚Äôs not particularly handy, I found the process therapeutic.

[See LANBEIDE FS01 Furniture Salve price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b0f23xbs3k/)

**Positives**

The standout feature for me is its universal application. One product for both leather and wood means I didn‚Äôt have to clutter my shelves with multiple cleaners. The deep-conditioning formula, enriched with ingredients like beeswax and carnauba wax, gave my furniture a polished, well-maintained look without feeling greasy. Surprisingly, it even buffed out light scratches on my wooden dining table. This all-in-one product really does seem like it‚Äôs been designed to save time and effort.

- Easy to apply with included tools.
- Non-toxic formula, safe for homes with pets (my dog approves).
- Restores both leather and wooden surfaces to near-original condition.
- Suitable for minor scratches and dull finishes.

**Limitations**

That said, nothing is perfect, including this product. While it worked wonders on most surfaces, heavily damaged or very dry leather didn't respond as well. On a particularly worn-out chair armrest, I noticed the results were less pronounced. Additionally, I had to let some surfaces dry overnight to avoid a sticky residue, which wasn't ideal when I was hoping for a quicker fix.

- Doesn‚Äôt fully restore severely damaged furniture.
- Some surfaces may require longer drying time.
- Limited to minor scratch concealment.

**Competitors**

In comparison to other products I‚Äôve tried, like beeswax-based polish kits and leather conditioners from other brands, this one stands out for its versatility. Most competitors require you to purchase separate products for wood and leather, which add to both cost and clutter. However, other premium brands did offer silky application textures that felt a bit more refined. They also included multiple scent options, whereas this one has a neutral, albeit slightly earthy smell. If I had to nitpick, the brush could use a bit denser bristles to make the application more satisfying. Still, its universal use makes it a clear winner for practical households like mine.

**Bang for the Buck**

When you compare the price of this set to purchasing separate leather conditioners, wooden surface restorers, and brushes, it clearly offers good value for money. It‚Äôs efficient without being exorbitant and fits neatly into the category of budget-friendly essentials. While some premium products from competitors might offer a touch more luxury, they often come at a much higher cost.

But the only thing that would make me happy right now is being with you again.  Maybe I just wish we had some type of connection.  I‚Äôm just a coworker now.  Someone you check on during the hours of 8-5.  

I‚Äôm so dumb I thought about getting you an iced coffee and waiting for you since I was here so early.  I look down and no bracelet again, not that I had mine on.  I‚Äôm guessing that is over now.  It‚Äôs all been a slow burn.  You should have just cut me off before I went to Chicago.  When I first noticed the true decline.  

Yes of course I want to see you tomorrow.  And I‚Äôll probably bring you flowers.  And I‚Äôll probably think of something like hand write you a letter.  And I‚Äôll probably focus intently on your face to see your expression.  Will it be a forced smile?  Will it be a look of disappointment?

Does that make me weaker than just accepting things as they are? 

The details are mostly there.  We‚Äôve exchanged enough words on it.  Seeing you doesn‚Äôt help.  You always look amazing even on the days when you claim you barely tried.

Just finished a deep dive analysis of 1000+ viral AI videos across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. The patterns that emerged are NOT what most creators think drives virality.

# The 3-Second Rule (It‚Äôs Not About Quality)

**Most viral videos** have a 3-second emotionally absurd hook. Not absurd in a cringe way - absurd in a ‚Äúwait, how did they‚Ä¶?‚Äù way.

**Examples that worked:**

* Woman seamlessly transforming into a car (immediate ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù)
* Person walking upside down on ceiling like it‚Äôs normal (brain break moment)
* Photorealistic dragon having coffee at Starbucks (beautiful impossibility)

**The key insight:** It‚Äôs not about production quality. It‚Äôs about instant emotional response - positive OR negative doesn‚Äôt matter for virality.

# Beautiful Absurdity > Photorealism

This was the biggest surprise. Videos pursuing photorealism performed way worse than ‚Äúbeautiful absurdity.‚Äù

**What doesn‚Äôt work:**

* Trying to make AI look completely real
* Generic ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù content
* Overly polished, soulless content

**What dominates:**

* Visually stunning impossibility
* Surreal but aesthetically pleasing scenarios
* Content that makes you question reality

The goal isn‚Äôt making AI appear real - it‚Äôs creating something genuinely original.

# Platform-Specific Performance Patterns

Same AI video content performs wildly differently across platforms:

**TikTok:**

* Limits obviously AI content unless it‚Äôs deliberately absurd
* 15-30 second max (longer content tanks)
* Strong engagement can outweigh algorithm suppression

**Instagram:**

* Prioritizes visual excellence above everything
* Seamless transitions crucial (choppy edits kill engagement)
* Needs to be distinctive (positively or negatively)

**YouTube Shorts:**

* Accepts lower visual quality if content value is strong
* Prefers 5-8 second hooks (vs 3 on TikTok)
* Educational framing performs much better

**The strategy:** Create platform-specific versions instead of reformatting one video. Performance improves dramatically.

# Opening Frame Psychology

**First frame determines everything.** I started generating 10+ opening frame variations before committing to any video concept.

**Hooks that consistently work:**

* Unexpected scale (giant objects in normal spaces)
* Impossible physics (but presented casually)
* Familiar + one weird element
* Beautiful people in impossible scenarios

**What fails:**

* Generic beauty shots
* Obvious AI ‚Äúperfection‚Äù
* Trying too hard to impress

# The Content That Gets Copied

Analyzed which viral AI videos spawned the most copycats:

**Winners:**

* Simple concepts with one impossible element
* Clear visual storytelling
* Easily modifiable core concept
* Strong emotional reaction (doesn‚Äôt need to be positive)

**Ignored:**

* Complex multi-element videos
* Too technically impressive (intimidating to recreate)
* Niche subjects without broad appeal

# Volume vs Perfection Approach

**The viral creators** aren‚Äôt making one perfect video. They‚Äôre pumping out 20-30 concepts, seeing what sticks, then amplifying what works.

I‚Äôve been using [these guys](https://curiolearn.co/gen) for my generation volume testing since Google‚Äôs pricing makes this approach impossible financially. Same veo3 model, way better economics for rapid iteration.

**My current workflow:**

* Generate 5 completely different concepts weekly
* Post everything, track performance
* Double down on what gets traction
* Ignore vanity metrics, focus on saves/shares

# The Replication Strategy

**Don‚Äôt try to be original** \- at least not initially.

1. Find 5 videos with 500k+ views in your niche
2. Identify the core hook/concept
3. Create your version with one twist
4. Test performance
5. Iterate on what works

**The math:** 1 completely original viral hit vs 10 variations of proven concepts. The variation approach wins every time.

# Counterintuitive Findings

**Lower quality sometimes performs better** \- Viewers can sense when something took ‚Äútoo much effort‚Äù vs authentic creation.

**Negative reactions drive engagement** \- Controversial AI content often outperforms universally liked content.

**Speed beats perfection** \- Creators posting 2x per week consistently outperform perfectionist creators posting monthly.

The viral AI video game is about psychology and timing more than technical excellence.

But once I started recreating drinks like this, making coffee became fun again and even felt like a little ritual.
 
This drink is one of my go to orders at Starbucks, but it adds up fast, and I wanted to see if I could get something close at home, here‚Äôs how I made it:

Ingredients:
Double espresso, brown sugar syrup, oat milk, cinnamon powder, ice.
 
Steps:
Locked in the portafilter and watched the shot come out with that rich crema. 

Pulled a double shot on my machine, added a pump of brown sugar syrup, then gave it a good shake with a few ice cubes until it felt ice cold and the crema turned all frothy

Poured it over fresh ice, topped with chilled oat milk, and gave it a quick sprinkle of cinnamon.

The flavor was surprisingly close. shaking really change the texture of the espresso, and doing it at home means I can tweak the sweetness exactly how I like.

1mq3foo,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1mq3foo/hot_take_rockstars_are_better_than_monsters/,Hot Take: Rockstars Are Better Than Monsters,"Now I get that this is a totally biased opinion as everyone‚Äôs tastes are different and everyone prefers different things. However‚Ä¶

Rockstars are better. Not just in flavor, but for your pocket as well. Let me break it down for you.

Rockstars flavor, in my opinion, tastes more concentrated and more like what they set out to be. They are more honest with their flavor name labeling saying what it is instead of putting an artistic spin on it. Like for example Rockstar has a Grape flavor simply called Grape vs. Monster‚Äôs Ultra Violet (Which not gonna lie is still a pretty bad ass name). I just don‚Äôt like having to go on google asking the void ‚Äúhey what is this supposed to taste like?‚Äù And be left wondering and confused. Rockstar is blunt and simple. Grape, Strawberry Mango, Peach, perfect! I know what I‚Äôm getting myself into. Plus they taste as it should. No mysteries found here.

Next, pricing. At my local Gas Station, Rockstars and Monsters are both pretty comparable. $3.49 for rockstars and $3.69 for monsters. They have a killer deal for rockstars though where if you buy 2 you get 2 free pushing the price down to $1.90/can after tax. Sounds pretty solid. Monsters are pretty comparable to, with that gas station have 2 sales going on: 3/$7.60 ($2.53/can) or 4/$8.70 ($2.18/can) after tax in my area. Both pretty comparable. However, if you can find sales such as at your local Winco Foods you can find Rockstars for as low as 98 cents per can versus the $2.38 per can Monsters are stuck at.

With that, in my opinion, the Rockstar energy blend is better. With the 160mg of caffeine vs. 150mg in monster, and the balance of their other energy additives to their drink, transition from monster to rockstar was a night and day experience for me. Like monster laid down the groundwork while rockstar built the 5-star retreat on top of it. Rockstar perfected monsters blend in my opinion.

Lastly, the variety, what does rockstar have in terms of flavors and options available to the public. Well, monster has their classic green and black can flavor, their very sweet juice concentrates, their zero sugar offerings in the form of ultras, their lightly sweet flavor-infused ice teas similar to Arizonas, and their coffeehouse style coffees in the form of their Java series. Whereas Rockstar has the classic gold and black can, their lightly sweet and oh so delicious lemonades, their experimental BOOM! series and their throwbacks. This leaves Monster with 150 flavors worldwide with Rockstar‚Äôs 25. Which sounds impressive on Monster‚Äôs end, however, I think it just leaves more room for Rockstar to perfect their blend as they aren‚Äôt trying to do too much.

All in all rockstar in my opinion is the better product. They have better and better tasting flavors, they‚Äôre more upfront and honest on their labeling, they have less flavors leading to them perfecting their craft, and finally, the energy blend just hits better.

With all that being said though, Monster Java slaps and I will not take any further questions. Just as a whole rockstar is better on the fruit drink side of things.",0,1755184368.0,energydrinks,5,0.25,False

Estou (ou estava rs) cursando doutorado em um PPG interdisciplinar em uma federal famosa. N√£o vou revelar no que, mas (e eu sinto que deveria falar isso pelo resto da hist√≥ria) n√£o tem nada a ver com arte, est√° na interse√ß√£o entre humanas e Nat/Bio. 

Esse PPG faz um congresso anual ""semi-interno"" (uns 80% dos participantes s√£o do pr√≥prio PPG), existe uma forte press√£o para que os alunos participem, mas a participa√ß√£o como apresentador de artigos custa a bagatela de **120 reais**. A nota de uma das mat√©rias do PPG vem da participa√ß√£o no congresso (mas voc√™ pode solicitar ser avaliado de outra forma). Vale falar que a federal √© famosa, mas a nota do PPG √© baixa, ent√£o quase ningu√©m tem bolsa. 

Ele acontece dentro da pr√≥pria institui√ß√£o e n√£o oferece almo√ßo ou coffee break, √© tudo realizado pelos alunos (e professores), que fazem mutir√µes pra alimenta√ß√£o, cuidam da portaria etc. 

Pra al√©m disso, as apresenta√ß√µes de artigos eram feitas em forma de ""conversa de bar"". Voc√™ senta com outros 3 autores e fala rapidinho a sua pesquisa, sem qualquer estrutura. **TODOS OS APRESENTADORES AO MESMO TEMPO**, cada um na sua mesa, ent√£o se voc√™ gostou do artigo de algu√©m, mas a pessoa n√£o est√° na sua mesa, voc√™s n√£o conseguem trocar. 

Mas por algum motivo a confer√™ncia teve momentos de destaque para pe√ßas de teatro amadoras??? E para uma apresenta√ß√£o ""art√≠stica"" de uma mo√ßa que ficava descal√ßa ""cantando""(/gritando) c√¢nticos de protesto pelos corredores at√© chegar no palco??? 

Eu juro que n√£o sou um conservador doido ou um odiador da arte, eu sou bem ""esquisitinho de humanas"", mas eu nunca tinha visto algo semelhante em uma confer√™ncia Acad√™mica. Me senti em um universo paralelo, em uma caricatura das institui√ß√µes federais feita por um bolsonarista. 

Eu fiz mestrado em outra √°rea e institui√ß√£o. Esse tipo de evento era gratuito, com coffee break, almo√ßo e voc√™ apresentava a sua pesquisa para um p√∫blico, com microfone, apoio de slide, tempo para perguntas, tudo que eu entendia existir em um evento acad√™mico. 

Algu√©m j√° passou coisa semelhante? Presenciou eventos do tipo no PPG e ainda assim teve uma boa experi√™ncia na p√≥s? Eu tranquei esse doutorado, tamb√©m por outros motivos, mas esse evento definitivamente me perturbou e contribuiu pra eu olhar o PPG com outros olhos. ",5,1755184291.0,askacademico,8,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an iron filter depends heavily on its features and technology. these features determine not only the filter's ability to remove iron but also its longevity and ease of maintenance.

**Filtration Capacity:**

Filtration capacity refers to the amount of water the filter can effectively process before requiring regeneration or replacement of filter media. This is typically measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A higher GPM rating can handle larger households with higher water usage demands.The appropriate capacity depends on the number of people in your household and the number of water-using appliances. For example, a 1-3 person household with moderate water usage might need a filter rated for 8-10 GPM, while a larger household might require 12 GPM or more.

**Filter Media Type:**

The filter media is the material within the filter that actually removes the iron. Common types of filter media include manganese greensand, birm, and oxidizing filters. Manganese greensand is effective at removing dissolved iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulfide. Birm is a lighter, less expensive option but requires specific water parameters. Oxidizing filters use air injection or chemical oxidation to convert dissolved iron into solid particles that can then be filtered out. The choice of filter media will depend on the specific type and concentration of iron in your well water, as well as other water chemistry factors like pH and alkalinity.

**Regeneration Process:**

Regeneration is the process of cleaning the filter media to remove accumulated iron and restore its filtering capacity. Many iron filters utilize a backwashing process where water is flushed backwards through the filter to dislodge and remove iron particles. Some filters require the use of chemical regenerants like potassium permanganate or chlorine, while others are designed for air injection or continuous aeration, which naturally rejuvenates the media. Automated regeneration cycles are preferable, as they eliminate the need for manual intervention and ensure consistent performance.

**System Size and Installation Requirements:**

The overall size of the iron filter system and its installation requirements are significant considerations, especially for homeowners with limited space. Compact, all-in-one systems are designed for easy DIY installation, while larger systems may require professional plumbing assistance. Important installation factors include the location of the well, access to a drain, and availability of electrical power for automated backwashing systems. Take detailed measurements of your available space and consult the product specifications before making a purchase.

Key features of modern iron filters include:

*   Automated backwashing cycles
*   Digital control panels with customizable settings
*   High-quality construction materials for durability
*   WQA certification for safety and performance

## core Benefits

Investing in an iron filter for your well water provides several tangible benefits that extend beyond simply removing iron.

**Improved Water Quality and Taste:**

The most obvious benefit is the improved quality and taste of your drinking water. Iron can impart a metallic taste and reddish-brown colour to water, making it unpalatable for drinking and cooking. Removing iron eliminates these issues, resulting in a clearer, cleaner, and better-tasting water supply for your entire household. This can also improve the taste of beverages like coffee and tea, and make cooking with your well water more enjoyable.

**Protection of Plumbing and Appliances:**

Iron can cause staining and corrosion in plumbing fixtures, appliances, and water heaters. This can lead to costly repairs and premature replacement of equipment. An iron filter prevents the build-up of iron deposits, extending the lifespan of your plumbing system and appliances. This benefit is notably noticeable in appliances that use hot water, such as washing machines and dishwashers, where iron can cause significant damage over time.

**Elimination of Stains on Laundry and Fixtures:**

Iron in well water can cause unsightly stains on laundry, toilets, sinks, and bathtubs. These stains are often challenging to remove and can permanently discolor fabrics and surfaces. An iron filter eliminates the source of these stains,keeping your clothes brighter and your fixtures looking their best. This can save you time and money on cleaning products and prevent the need for replacing stained items.

**reduced Risk of Health Problems:**

While iron itself is not typically harmful in small quantities, excessive iron in water can promote the growth of iron bacteria, which can cause foul odors and tastes and can clog well systems. An iron filter reduces the risk of these problems, ensuring a healthier and more reliable water supply. In some cases, iron can also interact with other contaminants in the water, potentially exacerbating health risks.

## FAQs Section

**How do I know if I need an iron filter for my well water?**

The most obvious sign is reddish-brown staining on fixtures, laundry, or in toilets. you might also notice a metallic taste to your water or see reddish-brown particles settling out.A water test is the most reliable way to determine the iron concentration in your well water and confirm if an iron filter is necessary.

**What is the difference between ferrous and ferric iron?**

Ferrous iron, also known as dissolved iron, is invisible in water.Ferric iron, also known as oxidized iron or red water iron, is visible as rust particles. Different types of iron filters are more effective at removing different forms of iron. A water test can identify the type and concentration of iron present.

**How often does an iron filter need to be serviced or maintained?**

The frequency of maintenance depends on the type of filter and the concentration of iron in your water.Backwashing filters typically regenerate automatically, but may require occasional cleaning or replacement of filter media every few years. Filters that use chemical regenerants will need to have these chemicals replenished regularly.Regular monitoring of water quality can help determine when maintenance is needed.

1mq33dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1mq33dk/does_the_best_electric_kettle_bodum_bistro_live/,Does the best electric kettle Bodum Bistro live up to the hype?,"As someone who appreciates a warm cup of tea or coffee during my morning routines, I couldn‚Äôt wait to test the Bodum 11451-01US Bistro electric kettle. The promise of rapid boiling functions and its sleek, minimalist design immediately caught my eye. After spending some quality time with this little powerhouse, I have gathered quite a lot to say about its strengths and a few of its areas for improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that drew me in was its clean, modern design. The black BPA-free plastic finish feels sturdy, and the compact size (measuring 7 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 7.75 inches high) makes it perfect for smaller spaces like apartments or dorm rooms. Its lightweight nature, clocking in at just over a pound, made it easy to handle, even for my kids, who used it under supervision to make instant soup. I particularly noticed how ergonomic the handle felt, which has the on/off button conveniently integrated. This feature kept me from fumbling while multitasking in the kitchen. However, my only gripe with the design is that the lid doesn‚Äôt open as wide as I‚Äôd like, making cleaning a bit cumbersome.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek, modern, and compact design suitable for tight spaces  
- Lightweight and easy to handle  
- Ergonomic handle with integrated control for convenience  
- Made with BPA-free plastic, which feels reassuringly safe for boiling water

**Performance and Efficiency**  
This kettle doesn‚Äôt just look good; it works efficiently too. With its 700-watt heating element and rapid boil function, I had a full 17 ounces of water boiling within four minutes. Whether I needed hot water for a single cup of tea or multiple servings for my family‚Äôs coffee session, it delivered consistently. I was particularly fond of the unexposed heating element tucked safely at the bottom since it ensured I could place it on a variety of surfaces without worry‚Äîno scorch marks on my table or counters. Its auto shut-off and anti-boil-dry features worked flawlessly, saving me from accidentally overcooking the kettle (which I‚Äôm guilty of doing once or twice with other appliances). That said, for power users who frequently need large amounts of hot water, 17 ounces might fall short.

**User Experience**  
This product is designed with the user in mind. The water level indicator was immensely helpful since it‚Äôs marked with cup-serving sizes, ensuring that I didn‚Äôt boil more water than necessary. This not only saved energy but also cut down on waiting time, which is a blessing during chaotic mornings. The manual power switch, combined with the power indicator light, felt delightfully vintage but functional. I will say, from my experience, the exterior does get a little warm to the touch during use‚Äînot scalding hot, but something to pay attention to, especially in households with small kids.

**Downsides**  
- Exterior can become a bit warm during prolonged use  
- Lid doesn‚Äôt open wide enough for thorough interior cleaning  
- Capacity may not suffice for larger households  

**Competing Products**  
In terms of competitors, the Bodum 11451-01US Bistro goes head-to-head with brands like the Hamilton Beach Compact Kettle and the Cuisinart CTK-series kettles. While Hamilton Beach offers a similar compact design and rapid boiling features, it lacks the sleek aesthetics and BPA-free construction of this product. Cuisinart kettles, on the other hand, provide larger water capacities and a stainless-steel build, which might appeal to those looking for a more premium feel. However, they tend to be heavier and pricier. What really sets the Bistro apart is its focus on safety features, like the anti-boil-dry mechanism and ergonomic build, making it ideal for small households or dorm use.

**Cost Efficiency**  
The price point of this appliance makes it a great option for budget-conscious buyers. When compared to other kettles with similar features, it offers the perfect balance of design and functionality without breaking the bank. While it may lack some premium additions such as temperature controls or a larger capacity, the rapid-boil feature and the ergonomic, compact design make up for what it might miss. For students, young professionals, or individuals looking for an efficient and safe option, it‚Äôs hard to beat this product‚Äôs overall value.

I've previously worked in law offices handling estate planning and probate, and want to get back into that work. It's not without difficulty, but it feels less stressful than real estate. The trouble is I am in an area with very little wealth, a lot of people have money tied up in land. What jobs there are generally around here are retail (many stores closing), hospitality/hotels, and property management.. if you're under 40 there's really no career potential here outside of healthcare. I'm legally blind, so no way I can reliably get into that.

The law offices that are around here primarily consist of PI, Social Security claims, and a smattering of real estate lawyers... but the firms are so small they're barely hiring. Even one of the more well known firms mostly hires paralegals and legal assistant to deal with traffic court. 

Let's put my specific hopes of working in T&E aside - how do I even get a part time job with these smaller firms if nobody is posting anything? Do I cold call or cold email and say ""hey I've got experience, here's my resume, can we grab a coffee?"" It feels so much different to how things were in NYC.",1,1755183374.0,paralegal,4,1.0,False
1mq2y9i,https://i.redd.it/l0f85fq410jf1.png,Fallout Manhattan gameplay recap: session 8,"It seems I always start these posts with who could and who couldn't make it to the session. I don't think it's a bad thing lol, just interesting. Anyway, tonight Scrogg couldn't join, but Twenty was back again. That means this session's party is her, Alice, and Connor (and his companion Fiona).

Still deep in the bowels of the frantic factory from last session, the party sends Scrogg to camp and trades him and Dogmeat for Twenty. It takes the group a moment to look around , but Connor manages to find among the scraps and old circuitry an intact Protectron head-dome. This has the benefit of being larger than a Slocum's Joe coffee can and thus, a solid option for replanting Fred the Flesh-Eating Plant. Alice does so and tries to feed Fred some of the Raiders fingers she has on-han-- I mean, in her possession. Fred however, rejects the fingers as they're a few days old by now, and he clearly only wants fresh meat. In response, he releases his usual cloud of spores, but Alice is able to resist their influence.

After that's settled, the party soon finds a lift that leads back to the Testing department. There's a lot of chicanery that happens on this level (including some literal boundary breaking by Alice and Twenty), but what's important is that in the middle of this department is a large tower of 5'^3 blocks. Dogmeat had tried to climb them last session before the party's ADHD kicked in and they wandered off, and now after Twenty showed interest in climbing them, Connor decided he was going to take a crack at it as well.

The two of them race to the top of the tower - making Athletics check after Athletics check to see who can get to the top first. But eventually, Connor claimed the victory and the prize at the top - the Science Bobblehead!

With their new vinyl treasure added to the inventory, the party takes the lift back to the production floor where they'd ended last session and continue looking around. After heading down a long hallway, they find themselves on the production floor proper. 

There was a long and brutal fight in this room, but let me give you the highlights. 

*Fiona actually starts the fight shaken. As she looked into the roaring fire of the primary machine's furnace, she found herself frozen in place - emotionally transported to another time in another place.

*Both Connor and Twenty found themselves incapacitated at one point or another. With Connor out, the rest of the party didn't have their master hacker running around shutting down robots - at least, temporarily.

*Of all the Assaultron lasers I had fired at the party, most of them just kinda missed. The *Protectron* lasers on the other hand - *yeesh*.

Though the battle was hard won, it is eventually won. The group takes a moment to heal and recuperate, and during their idle chatter, the topic of the Children of Atom comes up. Fiona is noticeably upset at this, and when Connor and Alice reveal that they used to be Children, she becomes immediately distrustful of them. It takes Connor sharing his story of escape and Alice offering her own words of reassurance, but they are eventually able to regain her trust. 

When Connor asks what her beef is with the Children, Fiona reveals that they were responsible for taking her parents from her. She used to live with her parents in another settlement that - according to her - the Children had bombed. All she has left to remember is the image of a settlement consumed in fire, as well as the yellow ribbon her mother gave her. The party is now very excited to help her exact her revenge on the group.

In this room, the party sees a series of platforms that encircle the outer wall, climbing higher and higher to an open door near the top. It takes a few Agility checks, but eventually the party all makes it up to the door. But seeing there's one more platform beyond, Connor presses on and finds the Repair Bobblehead! After that, he rejoins the party and they all enter *the boss room!*

Once inside, the door slams shut behind them. They see a large, slightly raised area in the center of the room with 25 smaller raised areas arranged in a grid across it. Alice steps on one of these, and it lights up. Soon, Connor, Twenty, and Fiona all join as well. Each of the party standing on and lighting up a different panel, they feel the ground start to shake beneath them, before the panels they're on jolt and rise 50 feet into the air. 

A siren blares, the room is bathed in a flashing red light, and a hatch labeled ""REJECT"" on the ceiling whooshes open, dropping into the arena an enormous... Jack in the box? The inhumanly large crank on the side of the box turns itself, playing a haunting tune. Once the tune reaches its end, a latch on the box disengages, and out pops the culmination of the Madcap Toys factory's Pre-War efforts. It's a series of robot parts mashed together into a massive facsimile of a Jack-in-the-box clown, with one of its most notable features being an entire Assaultron head in the place of one of its eyes. 

This is of course a Fallout take on the Mad Jack Boss battle (and preceding Frantic Factory level) from Donkey Kong 64. It was one of the big ideas I had in the campaign that I was most excited to implement (Fred is another one of those such ideas hehe), and the battle works just as in the games. Jack can't be hurt by regular means - instead the party has to electrocute him by activating the correct switch on their turn. In order to navigate the arena, players must make Agility checks to jump from platform to platform. If they fail their check and thus miss, a moving platform will harmlessly catch them and transport them to the outside edge of the arena to rejoin the fight on their next turn. 

The battle played out in 3 phases. With each, Jack became deadlier and more dangerous. He started off just jumping around, then retaliating with grenades in the second phase, and finally used invisibility and Assaultron laser blasts in the third. There were many slips and falls, incorrect button presses, and even at one point, Alice finds herself jumping face first into the side of an invisible Mad Jack.

But in the end, the party found themselves victorious. They defeated the boss and cleared out the factory. Their work done, they scrapped what they could and moved outside to make camp. 

With that, this week's session comes to a close. See you next time.",14,1755183314.0,Fallout,0,0.85,False

The training was brutal. Brenton could barely walk after finishing the three mile hike with the eighty pound pack on his back. He set up his tent and then started setting up the portable gas grill they had been given. The others set up their own shelters, and Bertrand produced a whole bottle of whiskey, of which the large man seemed to have a never ending supply of. They built a small fire after making a ring of stones and Myranda cooked the hamburger patties and grilled ears of corn. Someone also produced a bag of marshmallows as the sun began to set.

They roasted the little sugar puffs and laughed until the moon had rose, people starting to drift into their tents. Myranda was one of the last, while Brent was the one to douse the embers of the small blaze, stirring them and drowning them again before he went into his own tent, stripping down to his boxer shorts before climbing into the sleeping bag. He was nearly asleep when he heard the zipper of his tent flap drawing upward.

‚ÄúIt's me.‚Äù Myranda whispered, and he relaxed, unzipping the sleeping bag to allow her inside.

They fell asleep together and woke before the others thanks to the alarm that the red-head had set on her watch-like device. She crept back to her tent as the man got up and started the coffee and the grill, looking through the supplies to start preparing breakfast, the food already cooking by the time the others began to emerge from the canvas shelters, claiming their portions and eating quickly. They hiked back to the van after packing up and one of the women drove them back to the Training Complex.

The place was massive and modern looking, the fronts of the buildings made of smokey, mirrored glass and glittering steel. They stopped at the gate and showed the guard there their identification cards and badges before being allowed through and onto the series of narrow streets that moved through the complex, the driver turning into the parking garage. Everyone grabbed their gear and carried that to the supply room where a few of the staff members took their backpacks from them. After that, they all went their separate ways.

Brenton stopped by his room and showered and shaved, then collected the things he would need to visit the indoor pool. He swam ten slow laps back and forth, getting out to wash the chlorine from his skin. He ate with the others once again, and this time he didn't return to his room, instead following Myranda to the small lounge where they were able to get a drink, and mingle with some of the other staff. People from administration and researchers often stayed to themselves but as the sky grew darker, and alcohol was poured into mouths, things loosened up.

Brenton found himself talking to a couple of guys, named Jerry and Patric respectively. They were both part of the engineering team, and the younger, Irish-blooded male talking his ear off about the shielding that had been used on the craft that they would be departing on. Myranda had broken off to talk to another group but at some point during the conversation she had slipped into the group. She took his had a while later and gently escorted him back to his room. He woke with a mild hangover and to the sound of someone using his stove.

Brent stepped out of the bedroom, still rubbing the sleep from the corners of his eyes, and pulled out one of the utilitarian chairs, dropping into it to rub at his temples a bit. Myranda brought him a cup of coffee and kissed his cheek, turning away again to claim a small bottle of cheap, over-the-counter painkillers placing those next to the ceramic mug. He unscrewed the top and shook two of the brown tablets into his palm.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù he grumbled, then swallowed them with a gulp of the hot bean water.

‚ÄúYou're welcome. Good morning, by the way.‚Äù the red-head said brightly, flipping an omelette onto a plate, placing that in front of the suffering man.

He closed his eyes for a moment and swallowed hard, the smell of the food, while not bad in any way, was causing his stomach to turn. He stood and walked back through the bedroom to the toilet where he vomited as quietly as he could. He swished mouthwash around and spit that down the drain, then rinsed his tongue and teeth with warm water. He returned to the table and actually felt a little bit better, able to take a few experimental bites.

The food didn't cause him to run back to the toilet immediately, and he continued taking bites of the cheesy egg and mushroom dish, chasing that with small drinks of the strong coffee. His hangover seemed to become a little bit milder as the food settled in his stomach, allowing him to feel more comfortable, and to function somewhat normally as they made their way to the classroom where they would be spending the majority of the morning and early afternoon.

After their lunch break, they were all led over to a large, warehouse like building on the complex. Inside were functional mock-ups of the stations each of them would be responsible for on the ship. The people running the exercises put each of them through simulated emergency scenarios, which Brenton failed that day. He wasn't the only one.

‚ÄúYou'll do better tomorrow.‚Äù the man giving him his results said, handing him a small, tablet-like device. ‚ÄúTake some time to read through your manual tonight.‚Äù he added.

Brent nodded, carrying the device with him. He was rather down on himself as he walked back to his room, spending some time listening to music rather than being inundated by the tragedies of the world, or trying to watch a movie. He examined the digital pages of information, and as he did, began to realize the mistakes he had made, and quickly found the solutions. He made the decision not to drink that night, and held himself to it, turning in just after finishing the final meal of the day. As a result he woke before his alarm went off.

He skimmed through the digital manual again as he ate breakfast, determined not to fail the simulation this time around, and when it came time to put his new knowledge into practice, and this time he was given a passing score. A few other members of the team, Myranda among them, were also starting to catch on to their new roles. After class that day, they all were also required to take a turn in the flight simulator, guiding a shuttle through docking and release procedures, as well as through normal maneuvers through a debris field, as well as landing on a planet and taking off again.

He had just enough time to shower and get some laps in before he went to dinner.

‚ÄúDid you guys hear that some big wigs from the Department of Energy are coming in Friday?‚Äù Bertrand was asking as he approached the table.

‚ÄúSo I heard, supposedly they are going to be observing us during the simulations. I have the feeling that someone might get cut.‚Äù Kimura said quietly. Everyone's eyes cut toward the slim, half-Japanese woman. Most of them hadn't heard her say more than three words since the day they left work. Brent tried to recall if she was on the mining crew, but couldn't.

‚ÄúWhy do you say that?‚Äù Myranda asked before anyone else could.

‚ÄúIt's just a feeling.‚Äù the other woman replied, and then turned her attention to her food.

That thought rattled around in the entire team's heads, and all of them decided against drinking that night. Myranda did visit Brenton's room after dinner though, and they fell asleep in one another's arms. She woke before he did and left the room quietly, returning to her own private space to shower and change her clothing. Brent shaved his face and showered when he woke, wondering what was on the agenda for that day's training. All they had been told is that they would be doing something new. When they finished their meals they were told to meet out in front of the main building.

A few minutes after the group emerged, A large van pulled around from the fleet lot. They loaded up, waiting for another van pulling a trailer pulled in behind them, and the driver started out of the complex.

‚ÄúWhere are we going, anyway?‚Äù Bertrand called to the man behind the wheel.

‚ÄúTo an off-site facility.‚Äù was the only answer they were given.

The ride took long enough that Brent had dozed off, as had a few of the others, exhausted and mostly unaware of it after days of physical and mental stress. He only woke when he became aware that they had stopped moving. A few of the others were stirring as well. They were parked in front of a large, corrugated steel building among rows of similar structures. He opened the side door of the van which roused Myranda and Kimura.

‚ÄúI hope you all had a nice nap.‚Äù he quipped, then made a sweeping gesture with his hand, urging them to get out of the vehicle, and so they did.

As they approached the building, the humming of generators could be heard, along with heavy equipment somewhere not far off.

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù one of the other crew members, a young, Colombian man named Joseph asked.

‚ÄúMost of it is just old parts, or decommissioned engines packed in crates.‚Äù their driver answered as he led the way toward the door.

In the center of the warehouse was a massive tank, like an Aquarium might use to house sharks or other large sea life. It was filled to the top with water, but that wasn't what caught his attention. There were blocks of concrete with chains bolted to the top of them. Next to the tank was a table containing three rescue tanks that divers used, along with a rack containing weighted vests.

‚ÄúWhat's going on here?‚Äù Bertrand spoke up again, giving voice to the thoughts of the entire group.

One of the men who had been giving them the simulations smiled as he looked over the group.

‚ÄúToday we're going to see how you all perform under pressure. We're going to break you up into teams and perform a few simulated rescues. Just sit tight, while we finish setting everything up, and we will get under way.‚Äù he said.

The team murmured among themselves, and all of them exchanged nervous glances as they stood in the warehouse. It was nearly an hour of doing nothing but nervous conversation and furtive glances before they were paired up. Myranda and Bertrand were put together, as were Brent and Kimura, which didn't bother either of them.

‚ÄúWhich one of you is going to play the damsel in distress first?‚Äù their supervisor, a tall, lean man with soft brown eyes and a slight Hispanic accent asked.

Brent shrugged, and chuckled.

‚ÄúI suppose I will.‚Äù he said, his strategy being to watch those before him to avoid their mistakes, as well as those of his partner, if she made any.

‚ÄúDon't worry, you're in good hands.‚Äù Kimura assured him, and he wasn't sure if she was joking or not.

Surely they weren't in any real danger, here, were they? He didn't have long to ponder that question before the first pairing, the two members of the team he knew the least, two older men who rarely spoke, and whose names were unknown to him. The exercise was relatively simple. One member of the team would be chained to a block at random, and given a rescue tank with enough air for ten minutes of steady breathing while their partner hunted for a key and unlocked them.

One of the men administering the examination stood by with a stopwatch and recorded each of their time. When it was his turn, he tried to stay calm while shackled under twenty feet of water, his eyes burning from the chlorine as he used the rescue tank as sparingly as he could, in slow, even inhales. It seemed to take more than ten minutes before he was freed, but as he surfaced he heard the man with the stopwatch speak.

‚ÄúThirty two seconds.‚Äù he called as he scribbled the time on the paper next to her name. She grinned to Brent as if to say 'beat that'.

Brenton was blindfolded as the divers hid the key and shackled his partner in place. As soon as the air horn was blown, he plunged into the water, the vest making it hard to remain afloat and began scanning the bottom of the tank as he swam toward the sandy substrate on the bottom. It took him what seemed like five minutes to spot the weighted yellow tag that had the key attached to it. He grabbed that and swam to the block where Kimura offered him the tank, allowing him to get a free breath while fitting the key into the lock.

They surfaced together, in the recovery position as the others had. The divers helped them onto the platform.

‚ÄúThirty four seconds.‚Äù the timekeeper called.

Just over a minute combined, which was respectable. They were all exhausted on the way back to the training complex, but Brent managed to stay awake for the entire hour and a half journey this time around. He did feel like he zombie-walked through the rest of the day, however, and when he tucked himself in bed, he fell asleep easily. He did have dreams of being submerged in dark water, floating weightlessly in a shimmering abyss. He wasn't moored to anything but no matter how far he swam in any direction, he couldn't find the surface.

He woke to his alarm, still slightly disoriented as he sucked in deep breaths, sitting up in bed. He walked to the shower and let the water beat over his body for a long time, then made his way to the cafeteria, claiming a cup of strong coffee before the serving line was even open, still trying to shake off the dream as he sipped the hot beverage. He was near the front of the line for once when the food servers finished setting up and started their day. He pushed the food around on the tray more than he actually ate, feeling restless.

That day they reported to the classroom, and were informed that they would be taking a final exam on that coming Friday, which would be observed by some ‚Äúspecial guests‚Äù. That caused a ripple of hushed conversation to roll through the group. The restless feeling Brenton had, and the sensation of being underwater returned.

For some reason he didn't think he'd make the cut.",1,1755183275.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

We are both single but she goes hard on the apps, while I stay off of them since I don‚Äôt like being exposed to men who I would in majority never date. I have tried to be supportive of her dating life but recently it‚Äôs become too much. 

She was going on roughly two dates a week with different men for about a year post her breakup from a fwb‚Äôs, before meeting this 37yr old single father to two. He made it clear to her on date two that he wasn‚Äôt sure about having more kids, and I told her that he‚Äôs not a good option for her since she wants a baby like yesterday. She didn‚Äôt listen to me, kept having regular once a week dates. Slept with him all the time (which, cool that‚Äôs her choice) and never brought up exclusivity because in her words ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to rock the boat and scare him off‚Äù. 

They were long distance and it was always her making the hour drive to see him. She even racked up $580 in tolls because she wasn‚Äôt paying them?! I kept telling her it‚Äôs not a good sign if he‚Äôs not also making the effort to come see her but again, she didn‚Äôt listen. 

This went on for four months! I stopped saying anything because she was going to do what she wanted, and I decided to stay out of it. Well she found him posted in one of those Facebook groups asking if anyone was dating him, and found out he had been dating around since they don‚Äôt live in the same city. 

I told her to just end it with him when she came to me for advice but instead she confronted him over the phone saying she found him in that group and wanted to make sure he‚Äôs not seeing anyone else. He of course denied it but then kept putting off seeing her after that talk (yea duh! he was never serious about her). Then he finally ended it over the phone and told her it wasn‚Äôt going to workout. 

She called me super upset, like she had been blindsided and keeps talking about how she hopes he will come back and she wants to go to his city and ‚Äúrun into him‚Äù. Crazy! She‚Äôs also trying to sleep with this other guy who just had a baby (he‚Äôs not with the mother according to her), she says they were fwb‚Äôs a decade ago and wants that again. He met her for coffee (I think he was being nice) and when she tried to hint at how attractive he had gotten, he told her he can tell she‚Äôs ‚Äúolder‚Äù. I truly believe he was trying to keep it platonic and had to do that to make it clear he doesn‚Äôt want her like that. 

She‚Äôs mad that he rejected her, and swears the apps are out to get her now that she‚Äôs 40 and isn‚Äôt getting likes. Keeps talking about how she doesn‚Äôt have time to sit around and wants a man right now. 

I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôve had to distance myself because her dating life is chaos and she never even asks about my life. It‚Äôs all about her and how she‚Äôs not getting laid and is still obsessed with the 37yr old who dumped her. It‚Äôs madness! How can she not see that she needs to calm down? I‚Äôm younger than her and the energy of desperation is coming off so bad that even I can feel it. Of course men can feel it too! 

I‚Äôve tried to tell her to stop doing the chasing by always being the one to text, setting up dates, traveling to them, because if it‚Äôs not equal at the very least then you don‚Äôt even know if he genuinely likes you.

This evening I was sitting doing a puzzle that was gifted to me a year ago, listening to an audiobook I have wanted to read in a long time, and it struck me that I was doing these things because in the treatment of the reflux, I forced myself to sit on the floor at the coffee table for meals and for hours after dinner, as a way to make sure I kept upright and allowed my meal to digest. I still wanted to be in the loungeroom, where I would normally eat dinner on the couch then lay down, so this was my compromise - eating and then chilling while sitting at the coffee table.

I am a recently single 27f, and would really like to start getting my weight under control. 

I was in an less than healthy relationship for almost 9 years and now that I'm out of the fog I want to get my life on a better track, starting with my weight!

I am already tracking my calories through the my fitness app, tracking to loose 2 lbs per week, and trying to go to the gym 3 times a week for at least 40 min. Im also attempting to drink more water as well, though with the busy nature of my job I often struggle to remember to drink enough. I would say my job is moderately active. Im on my feet 8 hrs a day, walk aprox. 7k-15k steps a day, and do some physical lifting, no more than 40-50lbs.

My biggest hurdle right now is that I really enjoy drinking my calories. Red bulls, coffee with half and half(no sugar), Arizona tea, all are my favorites and all have calories. They really sneak up on you. Im doing my best to stick to sugar free red bulls when I have to have one, but coffee really is my sanity keeper. I would switch out for more sugar free options, but whatever they put in there to make things ""sugar free"" tastes like garbage to me.

I was wondering if there was anything else I could be doing to keep to my 2lbs a week goal or help me expedite my weightloss even more in a safe healthy manor.

I've hosted a few people in the past, but I usually never feel the quid pro quo expectation until recently.

I believe it's always coming back around, sometimes you do more for one person and less for another, but then also people help you more than you can do for them, it's a circle not a 1:1.

  
Anywyas I was traveling recently and one surfer hosted me in their city for a few nights. I was grateful for them and even though we spent very little time together, I made sure to take them out for dinner one night as thanks. I carried on with my trip overland to the next few countries when they later contacted me.

  
I was being hosted for about 3 weeks, but actually it turned out more into housesitting / petsitting while the host is traveling abroad. My former hosts asked me if I can host them, I didn't feel so comfortable to ask my host, and to be honest I rather not as it's not my place. Even if my host was cool with it, I just don't want the responsibility of hosting someone while BEING hosted.

  
So I let them know kindly, I'm being hosted at the moment and I can't really do that. Then they found my host on couchsurfing and told them they know me and asked to be hosted, my host was like WTF? Later they ended up staying at a hotel which was pretty pricey, we met up for coffee and things were chill, but it just left a bad feeling for me.

If I ask for something, I get it. I say I want a raised garden bed or a chicken run and he‚Äôll spend his weekend building it. If I want clothes or to get my hair done, he always tells me to do it. If he made enough money and the economy wasn‚Äôt so awful he‚Äôd never ask me to work another day of my life, and I just know he wouldn‚Äôt be resentful about it either. I never have to drive when we‚Äôre together and I‚Äôve put gas in my car maybe twice in the last five years because he always makes sure it‚Äôs full. He puts me first in a lot of ways and I appreciate him.  

But fuck. This man sleeps like the dead and does not help me at night. It was awful when we brought our baby home five years ago because it all fell on me and there was nothing I could do to change that. I screamed and cried and threatened divorce and it‚Äôs like he couldn‚Äôt change it if he wanted to. We both work full time now and our five year old is autistic and still constantly up through the night.

As someone who loves a good cup of coffee but dislikes the hassle of bulky or overly complicated brewing systems, this product stood out to me immediately. It strikes a brilliant balance between convenience, eco-consciousness, and quality. I've had the opportunity to test its features consistently, and while there are plenty of things I appreciate, there are also a few points that could use improvement.

**Classic Design Meets Durability**  
Right away, the Hammertone Green finish grabbed my attention. This coffee maker has a retro yet rugged feel, fitting seamlessly with my outdoor gear while looking equally great on the kitchen counter. The build quality is solid, and the stainless steel materials make it sturdy enough to endure bumps and scrapes during camping trips. The mug's insulated nature ensures that my coffee stays hot throughout my morning routine. Its compact dimensions (5.8"" x 5.8"" x 8.9"") made packing for a recent hike an effortless task. Even though I'm prone to dropping things, the stainless steel proved unbreakable‚Äîa welcome feature for people like me who aren't exactly gentle with their gear.

**Simplicity Without Compromise**  
What impressed me most is how straightforward this pour-over system is. It‚Äôs entirely manual, which means no buttons, plugs, or unnecessary components‚Äîjust filter, pour, and enjoy. The reusable stainless steel filter eliminates the need for wasteful paper ones. I also appreciate how simple it is to gauge the perfect grind level for optimal taste. A coarser grind paired with its fine filter mesh creates a clean-yet-flavorful coffee profile every single time. It offers the full-bodied richness I‚Äôd expect from a specialty coffee shop, minus the hefty price tag or long lines.

**Check [Stanley 10-09566 price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b088jxmg3b/)**

**Versatility and Portability in Action**  
Designed for outdoor enthusiasts, this coffee maker fits perfectly in any camping scenario. During my last weekend trip, I used it with varying water amounts and grinds to brew for two people, and it adapted wonderfully. The instructions about blooming the coffee are spot on: that ""magic rising moment"" truly makes the coffee feel artisanal. Plus, its lightweight frame didn‚Äôt burden my backpack, so I ended up bringing it everywhere. It‚Äôs suitable not just for hardcore outdoor activities but also for picnics or even office use. While its primary focus is on brewing one cup at a time, I did find it capable of scaling up when needed.

**Merits**  
- Coffee brewed retains full-bodied flavors thanks to the high-quality stainless steel filter.  
- Durable, scratch-resistant materials perfect for on-the-go use.  
- Eliminates waste from disposable filters, making it eco-friendly.  
- Easy cleaning‚Äîquick rinse and you're ready for the next cup.  

**Weaknesses**  
- The capacity is relatively small, so brewing for a group requires repeating the process.  
- It can be slightly tricky to maintain the perfect flow rate when pouring water, especially for beginners.  
- Although sturdy, the handle on the mug is not insulated, making it hot to the touch after brewing.  

**Reusable Filter Excellence**  
The stainless steel filter is this product's standout feature, offering both environmental and financial advantages. I loved how it enhanced intricate flavor notes, often absorbed by paper filters in conventional systems. Cleaning it is absurdly easy: a simple rinse under hot water or a scrub takes less than a minute, allowing rapid re-use. For coffee enthusiasts like me, who brew multiple times a day, this ensures continuity and convenience. Plus, skipping disposable filters provides a significant long-term cost advantage.

**Competing Brands**  
When I compared this pour-over set to other popular manual brewers, it held its ground in almost every category. Products like the Chemex or Bodum pour-over systems might provide a slightly larger capacity or sleeker aesthetics but usually require purchasing separate filters. The Stanley Camp Set, however, scores huge points with its included insulated mug and reusable filter. Other steel designs I‚Äôve tested, like those from GSI or Snow Peak, lacked Stanley's lifetime warranty, which assures me this set won‚Äôt be a fleeting investment. 

**Value for Money**  
For its price point, I found this to be an excellent value, especially given its durability and eco-friendly design. The ability to take it outdoors while doubling as a reliable at-home system made it feel like two products rolled into one. Compared to pricier alternatives, this set delivers a level of quality that feels thoughtfully designed for coffee purists on a budget. Although it doesn‚Äôt cater as easily to large batches, it‚Äôs a worthwhile purchase for individuals or couples wanting portable, consistent coffee.

As someone who thrives on caffeine, especially during hectic mornings, I needed something reliable and efficient. This espresso machine is compact yet surprisingly high-performing, making it a fantastic addition to my small kitchen space. After weeks of testing, I can confidently say that my mornings now feel incomplete without it, though there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Compact and Elegant Design**  
This espresso machine is incredibly compact, measuring just 3.3 inches deep, 8 inches wide, and 12.9 inches tall. It fits perfectly on my crowded countertop, leaving room for my other appliances. Its minimalist matte black finish adds a touch of sophistication, blending seamlessly with any kitchen d√©cor. I‚Äôve also taken it to work a few times, and it‚Äôs so lightweight at just 5.95 pounds that carrying it around wasn‚Äôt an issue.

**Ease of Operation**  
Fully automatic and button-operated, this small machine simplifies coffee-making to a ridiculous degree. With just two programmable cup sizes, espresso and lungo, I don't have to overthink anything. It heats up astonishingly fast, thanks to the high-pressure pump and quick heat-up system. From the time I stumble into the kitchen, it takes only a few minutes to start sipping my favorite brew. However, I did notice that getting that perfect pressure sometimes required reprogramming, especially after experimenting with different grind sizes.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-saving design  
- Two programmable cup sizes: espresso and lungo  
- Quick heat-up and high-pressure pump for consistent coffee  
- Energy-efficient features with eco-mode and auto-off within 9 minutes of inactivity  

[Check Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b073zht2fm/)

**Satisfying Coffee Quality**  
I was genuinely impressed with the coffee quality this machine delivers. The 19-bar pressure pump ensures every sip is rich, aromatic, and satisfying. The included milk frother allowed me to get creative with lattes and cappuccinos, making rainy weekend afternoons with friends much cozier. The reusable filter is another thoughtful touch, saving on waste while making cleanup straightforward. That said, ensuring the coffee grind isn‚Äôt too coarse or fine can make a noticeable difference in flavor; getting it just right was a bit of trial and error initially.

**Energy Efficiency at Its Best**  
Energy efficiency is undoubtedly one of the winning points of this device. The eco-mode kicks in after three minutes of inactivity, and the machine shuts off after nine minutes. This feature appeased my eco-conscious tendencies, and it's a relief knowing I don‚Äôt have to worry about wasting energy if I forget to turn it off during rushed mornings. My electric bill remained stable even with regular use, which was a pleasant bonus.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited to two cup sizes, which might not suit everyone‚Äôs preferences  
- Requires grind size adjustments to achieve consistent brewing quality  
- Milk frother, though effective, is not integrated into the machine  

**Product Alternatives**  
The Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 undoubtedly offers convenience and quality, yet it faces competition from products like the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker. While the competing model offers greater versatility with multiple cup sizes and integrates frothing features, it doesn‚Äôt match Breville's straightforward elegance or compact design. On the other hand, Nespresso Lattissima Touch might appeal to those who regularly enjoy lattes, but its larger footprint takes up more counter space, and it comes with a relatively steeper price point. For its size and functionality, Breville's espresso machine stands out as one of the best compact options.

**Value Proposition**  
Cost-wise, this espresso machine sits comfortably in the range of premium yet affordable options. Taking into account its energy efficiency, build quality, and ability to churn out delicious coffee consistently, it‚Äôs an investment that justifies its price. The added value of the welcome kit, including 16 Nespresso capsules, sweetens the deal for anyone trying this for the first time.

He then arrives at school,

Where everyone calls him a fool.

Where children call him a fag,

Just because of his bright-colored bag.

Don't they know they're just poor?

They can't even fix their battered door.

He simply inherited that bag

From his sister who died while working in Iraq.

At lunch time he gets mugged.

Kids stealing his food & money.

He also gets a beating when being robbed.

An experience of pain & misery.

He gets teased & called names.

It's like their playing games.

But to him it is different,

It makes him feel insignificant.

Ugly & retarded, those are just few.

Dumb & stupid, none of them are new.

He has heard it all,

From summer to fall.

And with that, his pain grows.

And along that, his rage flows.

From his heart to his veins

Corrupting his soul like demented stains.

His experience will deform his being.

Changing him into something that is terrifying.

'Cause if the deeds are monstrous,

It will create a monster.

Unless someone intervenes

& fix his broken seams.

Then he may be saved,

From a dark path which is unconsciously paved.

'Cause a school should be a learning ground.

& knowledge should be its crown.

Not a place of ridicule.

Not a living hell which is ruthless & cruel.

Hey guys! How are y‚Äôall doing? So I‚Äôm sharing this old poem as I‚Äôd want to express myself about the subject of kids being bullied.

I won‚Äôt be talking too much about the story and the reality of bullying and what it feels like to be on the receiving¬†2nd.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and I‚Äôll see you in the next poem!",1,1755182595.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False
1mq2mo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mq2mo6/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule.,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1755182592.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mq2lz1,https://i.redd.it/wkobj818xzif1.jpeg,How to replicate Espresso Vivace's creamy ristretto?,"I recently visited Seattle, and I took the chance to go on a mini coffee tour to try the best coffee shops/roasters around (as is tradition when visiting a new city). My favorite was Espresso Vivace for their Italian-style espresso, which used a fairly dark roast blend to yield a super creamy ristretto-style espresso with caramel and chocolate notes (I believe it's their Dolce Blend).

  
This kind of super creamy, bubbly espresso is a first to me (coming from Italy, it's definitely not common to have such high-quality espresso), and I was wondering whether anyone had any pointers on how to dial in something similar by using an at-home setup. I'm assuming that the variables involve a specific coffee blend, a good machine/grinder, and technique/dialing in. I can get their specific blend, and I can try to dial in something different than the usual 18/36g, but of course, I cannot really get industrial-level machines. 

Any suggestions?",0,1755182548.0,espresso,12,0.5,False

I'm not a huge breakfast person to begin with and don't usually wake up hungry despite a 20km route. Do you carbo load the night before? i tend to nibble and drink between loops but that is just to keep from dragging my feet.

1mq2l1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1mq2l1y/seeking_genuine_advice/,Seeking genuine advice,"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô1‚Äù male, currently 97 kg. Last year I worked out for about 4 months and dropped from 96 kg to 88 kg. I started seeing some muscle definition, but then some shit happened in life  ‚Äî bad eating habits, no workouts ‚Äî and I gained it all back. Actually, I went up to 105 kg (yeah‚Ä¶ not proud of that).

This summer I got back on track. Been consistent for about 2 months now and already dropped ~9 kg. I‚Äôve got a decent understanding of calories, maintenance vs. deficit, progressive overload, and I track my workouts. I‚Äôm running a PPLPP split. I do like 7-8 k steps .. and 30-45 mins cardio every day ..

That said, I‚Äôve got a few questions that Google/ChatGPT can‚Äôt really answer in a personalized way:

‚∏ª

1. Shoulder strength
Unlike last time, I‚Äôm doing really well with progressive overload ‚Äî adding a bit of weight almost every week. My chest is coming along great, but my shoulders are so weak.
I can‚Äôt even do 35 lb dumbbell presses with good form. On push days, I do 2 shoulder exercises: shoulder press machine and dumbbell shoulder press.
‚Üí How can I improve my shoulder strength? Should I be doing more variations?

‚∏ª

2. Bench press struggles
I‚Äôve only tried benching 1‚Äì2 times, but I never feel my chest working like I do with dumbbell presses or machines. Also, I train alone, so no spotter.
When I started this year (week 3), I tried 2√ó45 lb plates and barely did 2 reps before getting stuck ‚Äî some random guy had to help me. Got embarrassed and never benched again.
For reference: I can do  max 55 lb dumbbells on incline press for 8‚Äì9 controlled reps.
‚Üí Why can‚Äôt I bench anywhere close to what I can press with dumbbells? Any tips for learning bench without a spotter?

‚∏ª

3. Vegetarian diet
No meat or eggs for me. Tried tofu, but I can‚Äôt make it taste good. Mostly I eat paneer, soya chunks, and veggies for dinner, plus overnight oats for lunch (which I hate).
Calories: ~2200‚Äì2400/day. I hit like 120 -140 grams of protein everyday without going out of my calorie deficit.. i work mornings .. a coffee a start of my day .. then straight lunch by 12-1 pm . Then gym at 5-7 pm and then dinner at 9 pm .( one big meal ) .. 
‚Üí Any other high-protein vegetarian sources that are actually enjoyable?

‚∏ª

4. Leg day approach
I love leg days ‚Äî do leg presses and hack squats. Tried heavy/low-rep and lighter/high-rep styles. Low weight/high rep seems better for me (legs stay sore for 4 days after).
I don‚Äôt do barbell squats because I don‚Äôt have a spotter and I‚Äôm scared of getting stuck. My max:
	‚Ä¢	Hack squats: 6√ó45 lb plates for 8-9 reps
	‚Ä¢	Leg press: 10√ó45 lb plates for 8 reps
‚Üí Should I try light-weight barbell squats? What about Smith machine squats ‚Äî worth it?

‚∏ª

5. Stretch marks
I‚Äôve noticed some stretch marks on my stomach and a few on my shoulders.
‚Üí Is this just from weight gain/loss, or something else?

‚∏ª

Thanks for reading this long post ‚Ä¶. I think i just need to put in more time in my body but any advice will be helpful ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî I just want to keep pushing myself and avoid the mistakes I made last time. Any advice would be appreciated!",1,1755182489.0,workout,3,1.0,False

## 1. **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

I scored $22 just for three mini test-drives last week. AND you can cash out through PayPal. Check it out now: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

### 2. BetaTesting
You want ‚Äúnormal user‚Äù-jobs, not techie gigs? BetaTesting is it. Apps, websites, even smart home gear‚Äîthey let you try it all. The payout can go up crazy fast if you‚Äôve got sharp feedback.

### 3. uTest
Am I dreaming or is this the OG of testing platforms? Get paid to nitpick apps and sites. I literally paid my coffee bill this month with uTest cash. Massive brand collabs too!

## 4. **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
Yes, I know I said it above, but it‚Äôs THAT good. New apps, games, random quirky tools‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs stacked. I even got a bonus for spotting a bug no one else found! If you missed it: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

### 5. PlaytestCloud
This is pure gold for gamers. You get paid to try BETA zeros from future chart-toppers. Play a level? Drop some thoughts? Cha-ching. (No NDA nightmares, either.)

---

### 6. Test IO
Used by actual tech companies who care. Want to feel like your opinion matters AND get paid? This is it. Easy tests, fast payments. Love!

## 7. **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
I can't recommend it enough‚Äî especially for anyone with zero tech background. Fast sign-up, simple tasks, screams passive income. The link again for the skeptics: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Now I‚Äôm genuinely confused why more people aren‚Äôt using this hack for side cash. With just a phone and a Wi-Fi signal, you can be a ‚Äúfeature tester‚Äù and barely lift a finger.

If you‚Äôve ever groaned at paid survey apps and micro-gigs, trust‚Äî**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and these six others are for real. The hype is justified.

It was time for her to redirect from her low views and dropping subscribers to cue up the typical punching targets.. her haters. The irony of course is her hating on the haters while pretending she is not one herself. Speaking of that around the 1 hour 23 ish mark she drags bio dad back into her rants you know boohoo I have such a bad childhood so that justifies her being an absolute tool today. Anyway she pretty much in my opinion slanders her bio dad saying he abuses children and hates women and his current wife.  Any proof to that? She also adds lgbtq in the mix saying as a Scientologist he hates them as well. Oh the irony since she is a well documented missing Scientologist and all but swear she is not like that. Hmmm ü§î I wonder since she seems to be no one's champion as evidenced by all her self-serving needs and not doing a lick of charity or giving back to any community that we are aware of. So if anyone knows bio dad I'm sure he would be interested to know how his alleged estranged daughter is speaking of him on YouTube. I say alleged because if Reese is saying them I am not sure what is true. If he is a man of means like she says maybe he would be one of the family members to actually stage an intervention on Reese's behavior. It's wild that she can pop off and say all these things about people and not have them come back in real life and say anything to her. She also is claiming to believe in God and in karma which is two different belief systems but either way let's tackle the first if she believes in God yet she wishes her haters find pubes in their food or coffee that doesn't align. Well she toned down the pube talk in this stream but in the past we have heard her wish that on people. If she believes in karma would she not be afraid herself? I mean all this emotional manipulation milking alleged pancreatic diagnosis to get sympathy and super chats meanwhile in the same stream talking about her half arm sleeve tattoo she is still going forward with. The irony complaining how high her health insurance cost then prattling on about expensive things she continues to get or showing off her outfit she is wearing and saying she has them in multiple colors. Good grief. So if she believes in karma does that not give her pause to realize it will come back on her as well? If my understanding of karma is right and she is making up health issues then wouldn't karma come back with a real serious condition?

1mq2eg0,https://i.redd.it/0ooz81eiuzif1.png,[Rum Review #169] Plantation Fiji 2009 Single Cask (2020),"This was one of my first experiences with Fijian rums. I originally thought how much rum can Fiji produce to make it known to the average rum drinker? I had only tried the Ratu 5 Year, and that was a sample.

Though there are many that argue against Plantation/Planteray and their use of dosage, they also have non-dosed products. Thus 2009 Fiji is identified as having 2 grams per liter and is part of their Single Cask collection for 2020. Their website details a lot of information about what's in this bottle, but I'll mention it here anyway. It's a rum made from molasses that's left to ferment for four to five days. It was then distilled in triple column still and pot still at the South Pacific distillery in 2009, where it aged for 8¬Ω  years in ex-bourbon barrels. After that time, the liquid is transported to France, where it aged for two more years in Ferrand Cognac barrels. In the final stage, it undergoes an additional maturation process, resting for six months in 200-liter Kilchoman barrels. Finally, it is bottled at 49.6% ABV.

Made by: South Pacific Distillery / Maison Ferrand  
Name of the rum: Fiji 2009 Single Cask  
Brand: Plantation (now Planteray)  
Origin: Fiji / France  
Age: 8¬Ω  years + 2 years + 6 months  
Price: $65 

**Nose:** The huge variety of aromas immediately makes me think of Jamaican rums. In this case, it's Fijian, but there are almost 120 hours of fermentation. The aromas are of intense but musty wood, banana in various forms, peach, red berries, wet earth, powdered chocolate, and some nutmeg.

**Palate:** The first thing I notice are distinct fruit flavors, almost like a fruit salad. There's banana, strawberry, pineapple, red apple, and raisins. The latter reminds me a lot of that cognac finish (or one of the finishes), but there's also a serious note of oak and iodine, like from that Kilchoman finish. There are additional notes of nuts, salt, caramel, and some smoky notes. 

**Retrohale/Finish:** Smoke, coffee and dark chocolate.

**Rating:** 9 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** Sometimes I read about the different processes and barrels a rum or whiskey goes through, and I'm impressed because I think that sensing the distinct aromas each barrel imparts can't be easy. But this Plantation Fiji 2009 truly brings out the aromas and flavors typical of each barrel it aged in, including the red and black fruit notes of cognac with the salty, iodine notes of Scotch whisky. Fiji 2009 is a rather unique rum. At an average price of $65 when it came out, I found it a golden opportunity to try something vastly different.



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound *mechanical*. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog](https://humoytabaco.com/), including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars.

Prologue ‚Äì His Side

He knew she‚Äôd never leave.
Not really.

She had the kids, the mortgage, no family close by. She worked part-time at the library, barely enough to cover groceries, let alone rent. He‚Äôd made sure of that‚Äîalways convincing her it was ‚Äúbetter for the kids‚Äù if she stayed home, always finding a reason her job didn‚Äôt matter as much as his.

He wasn‚Äôt cruel about it. Not in a way anyone else could see.
That was the trick.

Sure, he‚Äôd slipped. A few affairs here and there. Nothing serious. Just‚Ä¶ needs. He figured any man in his position would do the same.

The thing was, he liked his life exactly as it was. He liked coming home to dinner on the table. Liked that the laundry was folded, the bills paid. Liked that when he went out, she stayed with the kids, no questions asked.

Leaving meant lawyers, custody battles, and worst of all‚Äîchild support. He‚Äôd run the numbers once, late at night when she was asleep. The total had made him wince. He wasn‚Äôt about to hand over half his paycheck when he could just stay put.

She was convenient.
Predictable.
Safe.

If she cried, he ignored it. If she asked questions, he dodged them. And if she ever confronted him outright, he knew exactly what to say to shut it down.

In his mind, they weren‚Äôt broken.
They were functional.

And functional was cheaper than love.

The first time she met him, he was leaning against the jukebox in the corner of the bar, grinning like he owned the night. She was twenty-three, her hair smelling of drugstore shampoo and hope. He bought her a whiskey and told her she had a laugh like sunlight.

Back then, she believed love was a cure-all.
Back then, she believed him.

They became a story.
Late-night drives with the windows down, his hand warm on her thigh. Singing badly to old songs, stealing kisses in empty parking lots. He told her forever wasn‚Äôt long enough, and she tucked the words under her skin like a charm.

She didn‚Äôt notice the first red flag.
Or the second.

The first time he vanished for a weekend, he came back with roses and a smile so practiced it made her forget she‚Äôd been crying over burnt toast and unanswered calls.
The second time, he blamed work. She nodded. Because love‚Äîreal love‚Äîwas built on trust.

What she didn‚Äôt know was that trust is the rope they give you before the drop.

Eleven years later, the woman in the mirror was unrecognizable.
Two kids. Mortgage. Hair tied up in a messy knot because she was too tired to do more. The man she once couldn‚Äôt stop touching now barely brushed past her in the hallway.

She tried to win him back. Bought new dresses, dyed her hair chestnut brown, painted her lips red. But the gap between them wasn‚Äôt closing‚Äîit was widening, and in the middle of it was the silence. Heavy. Suffocating.


---

The truth came in whispers.
A receipt for two glasses of wine at a restaurant she‚Äôd never been to.
A name she didn‚Äôt know flashing across his phone.
Perfume clinging to his shirt‚Äîsweet, expensive, and nothing like her body spray.

She found the earring one afternoon wedged between the passenger seat and the console. A single teardrop pearl. Small, but heavier than a stone.

That night, she stood in the kitchen holding it in her palm.
His phone screen lit up, and for once, he looked at her instead of it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre overthinking.‚Äù

Her voice was thin, like paper about to tear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid. Just‚Ä¶ tell me why.‚Äù

He set the phone down, leaning on the counter like they were discussing bills.
‚ÄúYou want the truth?‚Äù His shrug was lazy, practiced. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not enough. But leaving you? That‚Äôs expensive. Cheaper than child support to stay.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt rage that hit her. Not grief. Just a slow, suffocating cold that started in her chest and spread until she could barely feel her hands.


---

After that, she lived like a shadow. She smiled when other moms waved at school drop-off. She still cooked dinner, still kissed the kids goodnight. But she slept on the very edge of the bed, her back to him, so far away she may as well have been in another house entirely.

She thought often about the girl she used to be. The one who would‚Äôve walked away, head held high. The one who believed love was a safe place. That girl was dead. In her place was someone who was just‚Ä¶ waiting.


---

It happened on a Tuesday.
The rain was heavy, hammering against the kitchen windows, the kind that blurred the world until it looked like a watercolor painting left in the sink.

She sat at the table with a pen and a scrap of paper. Her hands didn‚Äôt shake‚Äîshe was too empty for that.

I can‚Äôt keep breathing in a house that‚Äôs already dead.

She set the note beside her coffee mug. The steam had stopped rising.

When she stepped outside, the rain soaked through her sweater instantly, plastering it to her skin. Her hair clung to her cheeks, her shoes filled with water. She didn‚Äôt hurry. She just kept walking, one street at a time, until the sound of the rain swallowed everything else.


---

By the time he came home, the coffee was cold. The letter was wrinkled, ink bleeding where a drop from the leaky ceiling had fallen. He read it once, twice, then crumpled it into his fist and tossed it in the trash.

The next morning, the children asked where Mommy was.

‚ÄúShe went away for a while,‚Äù he said, pouring milk into their cereal bowls.

He didn‚Äôt mention her again.

Epilogue ‚Äì Years Later

Three years had passed.

The house looked the same. Same beige walls, same worn couch, same chipped mug in the kitchen cabinet. The only thing missing was her, and even that absence had faded into the background like a piece of furniture he‚Äôd given away and barely remembered.

The kids were older now‚Äîteenagers, full of eye rolls and headphones. Sometimes they asked about her, but less and less these days. When they did, he‚Äôd shrug. ‚ÄúShe made her choice.‚Äù That was all.

He‚Äôd started seeing someone new. Younger. Less complicated. She didn‚Äôt ask about the past, and he didn‚Äôt offer. She cooked differently, laughed too loudly, and didn‚Äôt fold the towels the way he liked. But she was company, and that was enough.

Every so often, he‚Äôd find something of hers in the back of a drawer‚Äîan old hair tie, a grocery list in her handwriting. He‚Äôd toss it in the trash without thinking. No hesitation.

There was no guilt. No regret. In his mind, she‚Äôd simply‚Ä¶ removed herself. People did that sometimes. Life went on.

One rainy Tuesday, he was driving home from work when he passed a woman on the sidewalk, hood pulled low, soaked to the skin. For half a second, he thought of her‚Äîthe way she‚Äôd walked out that night in the rain without looking back.

But the light turned green, and he kept driving.

By the time he pulled into the driveway, the thought was gone.

There‚Äôs this one person named Bel a talkative interesting person always invite me to go out and talk about life or have a coffee and the other one is Joy timid and quiet person who always asked me if i want to go out for a lunch or dinner,Yet honestly, every attempt to connect with others feels empty, like a waste of time, because no one has ever made me feel the way you did thats why i also told them i wont pursue and only see them as a companion or a friend and said sorry since im the one who entered into there life. Hayssss how i miss those time we shared together, all those chats and playful moments, its because it meant so much to me. That time is one of my most precious memories, the moment I truly fell in love for the first time. That is why I hold it so close and cherish it deeply.

I asked over there if having 1 or 2 sugarcubes per day is okay, and got told it‚Äôs dangerous and that I should only do a clean fast. (You can check my original post on my profile for context.)  people became pretty defensive

Since my main goal is weight loss, I‚Äôm curious what this community thinks. How do you think i should approach this?  Is it okay or an eating disorder? I dont mind constructive criticism but keep it friendly please
