1lubf47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1lubf47/i_29f_want_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_30m_but/,I (29F) want to break up with my boyfriend (30M) but am struggling with how to do it and other logistics,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and a half. We don‚Äôt live together, but I spend almost every weekend at his place, and I have a decent amount of stuff at his place. 

The entire time we‚Äôve been dating, he‚Äôs been unemployed. He has a BA in psychology/philosophy, but he has pretty much no real-world job experience - he never had a job in high school and only did some tutoring in university then ‚Äúworked‚Äù for his dad‚Äôs company, where I found out later, he did maybe 5-10 hours a week of admin work, but the company shut down a month into us dating. He lives in a townhouse alone that his family rented since he was an infant, and his parents bought a condo and moved out as his dad needed no stairs. His parents pay his rent on top of their own condo fees, take him grocery shopping and pay for it, and drive him around to any appointment etc. that he needs to go to. It‚Äôs been a sore spot for me because his dad has really bad health and can‚Äôt work, and his mom doesn‚Äôt have a great job and is at the age she should be retiring but says she doesn‚Äôt think she will ever retire because of finances. His mom is a nervous driver and his dad drives (even though he really shouldn‚Äôt with his health), and I think he should not be a burden on them and should be instead fully employed, helping them out, driving them around etc. 

He has been applying for jobs but the market here is really bad (it‚Äôs taking most people hundreds of applications and months to get a job that have a good job history!) so he keeps either not getting callbacks or he interviews and doesn‚Äôt get it. Since he started telling me about every interview 2 months ago, he‚Äôs probably interviewed 16+ times and not gotten a job. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs asked for feedback. 

There were a bunch of other things related to his motivation, drive in life, plans for his future, care about his mental health and more that have been an aggravating factor on top of the unemployment. I had to push him to see our government funded career help program after he kept applying to jobs and getting nowhere, I had to push him to go out and get some kind of hobby, etc. 

As much as I love him (he‚Äôs very kind, sweet, funny, we have similar interests and views on things, he cares a lot about me and how I‚Äôm doing and does lots for me, sex life is good but not incredible), I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. We‚Äôve talked about it multiple times and although I never explicitly said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do XYZ, I will break up with you‚Äù, I did say that I can‚Äôt stay in this stagnant relationship waiting for him to get his life together. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt move in with him until he was entirely self-sufficient about a year ago, and he keeps asking when he goes for an interview ‚Äúif I got this job, would that be enough for you to move in?‚Äù But when I think about it, I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd feel comfortable moving in until he can keep the job for a while and be self sufficient. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to say to him when I break up with him. I want him to know that I appreciate the effort he‚Äôs put in (he basically did everything I asked him to do except the job but he has been interviewing lots and applying to a lot of jobs), and that I do love him but this relationship isn‚Äôt right for me, that I know he‚Äôs done so many of the things I asked him to do but it was pretty much too little too late (without saying it as meanly). 

I also want to know if I should be getting all my stuff out of his place before we talk? Or should I collect it all after? And should I break up with him in his place or somewhere else? It‚Äôs just he doesn‚Äôt drive and it feels mean to trap him in my car with me after I break up with him while I‚Äôm dropping him off or make him take a bus or uber. I also fully believe he won‚Äôt do anything to my stuff but I don‚Äôt want to linger too much after or on the flip side, tip him off. 

Sorry for the million questions, this is my second time breaking up with someone and the first time was way more clear cut because of the fights we had at the end, we met up in a coffee shop parking lot halfway between us, so I don‚Äôt really have a good idea of what to do.

1lubcqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1lubcqo/hello_why_not_i_guess_posting_here_too_to_see/,Hello. Why not I guess posting here too to see what resonates with different people to get a engaging interaction initiated and seeing what I can soundboard off others to maybe learn a bit more about myself and others who are so similarly inclined who potentially relate to my circumstance,"

Additionally posting somewhere it seems to be a generic approach to mental health, as I actually want to see if I can find similar people who share my communication style and who I can make friends with, as of yet I feel like I am the only one in the whole world who is experiencing what I am experiencing. I get the feeling some people might see me as not empathetic with the way I systemise things but that's just an observation and I do tend to view my emotions in a very intellectual way. Ah probably not I guess. I do not seek like you have ""x"" or ""y"", I actually believe diagnostic criterion can be overly simplistic and doesn't always capture an accurate picture honestly. Well I have a diagnosis of Aspergers already lmao.

Right my previous post was deleted or didn't post properly so I am going to copy and post this after I finish this. Right this is a disclaimer some of the things I might include might be related to topics which aren't exactly graphic as I know that isn't allowed but I suppose trailing around the edges of such a thing is ok I assume without the content. Content I will be including. I would say comes under obsessional things relating to health which comes back to being pure and perfect health I think now I think about it and also religion and how my thought stuctures pertain to fitting this paradigm into my daily life and without it I am totally lost and I cannot cope and anxiety increases triplefold if I don't engage in such behaviour but I end up justifying such behaviour as I think ""oh it's fine this isn't harmful it is helpful as I am focusing on my moral self or my health or something related to this. Yeah I don't know what exactly is going on for me is characterised as I don' know. However whatever it is.

It seems to put me in an infinite loop. It's like these daily rituals I HAVE to do at particular times and in a particular order and if I don't do them, then the rest of my day cannot be structured. So in this way my thought structure in way I conduct myself in analogous to my day. There is no room for error whatsoever and often no room for anyone else, and from my own emotional state of mind. It removes any emotional presence whatsoever. I rip out the emotions to which could be related to particular frames of mind and tear them out from the root, as a result I intellectualise every single thing which is going on emotionally for me. Therefore I can provide a justification for such an emotion. By providing a justification I can short circuit the emotion which is at hand at any given moment in my life, because my thought patterns are so hierarchical it leads to little input from the external world i.e. other people and the said interactions which come from this. I think what this leads to personally is an extreme irritation and irritability of dealing with the emotions of others. I have noticed I do not feel this feeling during my night shifts due to less people being present.

However in the day shifts this is ever more present. This irritation is also quite angry and rageful for me and is an externalised part of my psyche and I think it is designed as a defence mechanism to stop people actually interacting with me at all. I am not able to tolerate the emotions of other people. This can get quite dark for me personally for the thoughts I may have and the the more intense the emotion expressed by someone else, this will illicit a greater response of irritation in the form of repetitive wishing that person wasn't there and that is putting it mild. Let me give me a fairly low frequency example. Let's picture a scene I am in a kitchen with another individual, I have a hot cup of coffee and I walk past them into the front room. I will visualize in the form of intrusive thought throwing such cup of coffee in their direction or face. I will not go any further with such an explanation but after which I will feel awfully guilty and spiral, trying to come up with a reason at how this is all my fault and I am awful human being for thinking such a thing. I hate to have such thoughts.

This feeling is ever present literally all the time for me or most of the time, but when I am in an environment where the variables are controlled to my liking and manipulated to an extent where things are under my domain, then such a thing doesn't happen. Now let me detail a particular thought sequence to which would give me temporary relief. For example a current obsession of mine is eating particular food types only or if I do one thing in one way I'll feel guilt and feel guilt in the same way in the opposite trajectory to this. Supplementation for example the obbession of taking particular supplements with a actualised hopeful benefit for my health and cycling such things on and off not to build a tolerance. I am really into neuro hacking for brain fog for example. I try to modulate every single part though. Another example is being scared particular situations will trigger a scary traumatic thought etc and then avoiding such situations to avoid such a thing. Health related so being obbessed about the effects of sugar or alcohol on the brain so I won't have a single bit whatsoever and if I do I will feel extremely guilty. Religious OCD, being afraid what I am doing is illicting demons or incurring the wrath of god. Another form is extremely intrincate obsessions over gray areas etc like well substances which are a bit borderline and also outright well illegal in certain countries. Magic mushrooms for example. This can help but massively increasing neuroplasticity and then engaging in bad behaviour is definitely not good. I'll leave it at that.

I'll leave it at that for now. I am considering about going to the doctors about this tommorow as I feel like I need too. I haven't ever been honest with mental health professionals. There is more I could detail. Anyway thanks for reading if you did. It would be good to reach out to some other individuals who relate. If you do feel free to reach out to me. I don't want this to rule my life anymore. I have no friends because of all this.

Edit:

I am not looking for any reassurance I have a particular type of OCD. Honestly I wish I could alt f4 all this and start tommorow doing what I usually do but not in an obbessive way. I wish I wish. Even if I have it I feel like I would prefer to do everything under the sun except from dealing with it.",1,1751936238.0,mentalillness,1,1.0,False

* I'm trying to figure out place for a lamp (or any accent lighting). I only have the overhead fan light and hue floor lamps I can use. I was thinking of a lamp that curves out into the room on the TV wall by the corner? I could swap placement with the subwoofer (the big black box) and put it in the other corner but that may impede movement into the kitchen and keep the window corner too dark. Last option was putting an overhanging lamp of some sort by the sofa corner and pull out the sofa a bit.
* Finally, the walls - I figure a framed print above the sofa but the TV wall I'm kind of stumped on. There's so much vertical space and I'm not sure what would be good placement/size of pieces.

Kind of at the end of my rope looking for and comparing and cross shopping. Post sale of my 2017 Corvette (grand sport, 2LT, 7 speed manual, light mods), plus an additional add of 30k cash I'm looking at 80k cash on hand + a pretty low rate from USAA for financing. (I'm extremely finally stable, have wife's approval, have a primary sensible car (a 2020 crv, paid off)). $1200 is my self imposed upper limit for a loan payment (which stays well under my VA disability, not to mention my career). All the good financial stuff I'm sure people get roasted on here for all the time)


I sold my C7 because I was kind of bored of it. The aftermarket scene in Corvette land is kind of limited, I know that doesn't make sense. GM really maxed these engines out and boltons are little if any real gains. I did intake, throttle body, a canned tune, and DSC suspension controller. Beyond that, it's engine builds, superchargers, and cams. Which isn't anything I wanted to do. I have enough street traction issues as it is.

My previous cars include a mustang gt, VF30ed bugeye WRX, fp green-ed Evo 9 with built shep trans, an e36 m3, and a JDM 5th gen Honda prelude type s (which I still own).

I'm way deep into iRacing and much prefer twisty track over drag at this point (younger me would be upset haha).

Primary use case is weekend drives, date nights, cars and coffee, and maybe a few autox events a year. One of my relatively minor concerns is weather. I wouldn't drive what ever I get in snow, etc, but being caught out in the rain in the Vette was a bit tense. So is prefer AWD.

Things I've looked at:

C8

C8 e-ray

C8 Z06

(I suspect these have the same ""problems"" with aftermarket as my C7 - plus the community is very ..uhhh skews older. I know the flat plane crank engine is insane but it's only in the Z so far, it isn't quite proven yet to me (IMSA aside))

Jag f type svr

Audi R8 (V8, quattro, manual. V10s seem to be crazy expensive)

Bwm m3 comp

Bmw m4 comp xdrive

Bmw m8 comp

(Not a huge fan of the ZF in these but I need to actually test drive one, I hear it's ok but I'm not convinced. Additionally the M3/M4 feel a bit younger? Like a young rich kids car / Instagram influencer / drug dealer / someone who is going to 'cut up' every chance they get)

Porsche 718 Cayman GTS 4.0

718 cayman gt4 (probably over my limit)

Ford mustang gt 350 / 350R (worried about the engine reliability here)

Lotus Elise/exige

Emira

Evora


Nissan gtr r35 (worried about finding a clean one and previous abuses)


Currently in the lead is M8 comp (22+ for the facelift), or a 19+ GTS 4.0. I know these are massively different cars, both power and weight, but review wise at least seem to be fitting the bill for the most part.

Would something bolder (that goes with the rug) be too distracting? If I go neutral should I be trying to make it blend with the wall? Thick/Blackout version or more see through?
* I like the pillows but I'm also a conflicted on them. The ones that are gray came with the sofa, the others we picked out. I think I'm still wishing I could go with more pops of color but I struggle with figuring out what would clash too much and when considering the rug. I know I should probably keep patterns to a minimum since the rug already has it.
* I'm trying to figure out place for a lamp (or any accent lighting). I only have the overhead fan light and hue floor lamps I can use. I was thinking of a lamp that curves out into the room on the TV wall by the corner? I could swap placement with the subwoofer (the big black box) and put it in the other corner but that may  impede movement into the kitchen and keep the window corner too dark. Last option was putting an overhanging lamp of some sort by the sofa corner and pull out the sofa a bit.
* Finally, the walls - I figure a framed print above the sofa but the TV wall I'm kind of stumped on. There's so much vertical space and I'm not sure what would be good placement/size of pieces.
* Any ideas for coffee table accessories I will take :)! I'd say the same for plants but I don't think this space has any room for it?

Chapter 1

POV Floris

Some asshole in a trench coat body-checked me at Schiphol without even a ""sorry,"" and honestly? Perfect fucking metaphor for how this whole Amsterdam adventure was shaping up.

""Sure, no worries,"" I muttered, wrestling my vindictive suitcase out of a tile crack while passengers flowed around me like I was human furniture. ""Love getting steamrolled by strangers. Really sets the mood for international career opportunities.""

The airport was chaos in corporate form‚Äîgleaming surfaces and people pretending their lives weren't falling apart.

Meanwhile, I stood there looking like a refugee from Silicon Valley's unemployment line: coat three seasons expired, boots that survived an actual flood, hair held together by spite and bobby pins.

Five feet of pure sarcasm wrapped in desperation, amber eyes that had seen too much tech industry bullshit, mouth that couldn't stay shut about it.

Yeah, that's me‚ÄîFloris Middleton, MIT grad turned persona non grata, desperate enough to flee to a city where people bike in business suits like it's normal and everyone speaks better English than half of America.

Also, apparently, the only goddamn place left that would hire a blacklisted cybersecurity analyst with a history of making Very Important People very, very angry.

""Floris Middleton?"" I spun around and nearly face-planted into my luggage.

Corporate Clone Barbie stood there‚Äîblack trench coat, zero expressions, clipboard weaponized. Name tag: Juno, Recruiter: Lynx Solutions.

""Uh, yeah. That's me.""

""You're late.""

""I'm literally not though."" Words popped out before I could filter them. ""My phone says 10:47, flight landed on time‚Äî""

""You're late,"" she repeated, like she could bend spacetime through administrative bitchiness. ‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù

Great. Twenty seconds in Amsterdam and already failing at existence.

The town car was stupidly expensive‚Äîleather seats worth more than my whole education. I pressed against the window, watching Amsterdam blur past in expensive grays and browns and suspicious neon that looked like legalized vice advertising itself.

""About this job placement‚Äî"" I started.

""There's been a change,"" Juno interrupted, not looking up from her tablet. ""The original position was filled this morning.""

My stomach cratered. ""What? But the TechFlow data analyst role‚Äîwe had a signed agreement‚Äî""

""One position remains. Brighton Systems. Executive assistant.""

I blinked hard. ""You're trying to make me a secretary for a surveillance mogul?""

""Executive assistant,"" she corrected with precision suggesting she'd had this conversation before. ""Excellent pay. Full benefits. Housing provided.""

""I have a master's degree in cybersecurity from MIT. I designed encryption protocols that the NSA still can't crack. I am not someone's coffee-fetching, calendar-managing assistant.""

Juno finally looked at me, expression warm as a tax audit. ""As I know, your brother's medical debt. $84,000. Experimental treatment he needs? $5,000 monthly. No insurance coverage.""

Ice water to the nervous system. I shut up.

""Brighton Systems offers comprehensive healthcare for employees' immediate family. Retroactive coverage, pre-existing conditions. No caps, no limitations.""

My resolve cracked like cheap drywall. ""What's the catch?""

""No catch. Sign a preliminary agreement, complete the interview process, your brother's treatment begins immediately.""

She handed me a tablet. Contract loaded, cursor blinking like a digital heartbeat.

""Don't Google him,"" she added, almost casual.

The second Juno left me in their psychotic minimalist lobby, I whipped out my phone and Googled the shit out of Eric Brighton.

Corporate espionage allegations. Whistleblower lawsuits. Ex-employees with NDAs thicker than textbooks. One charming headline: ""The Iceman Cometh: Why Eric Brighton's Employees Don't Last Six Months.""

My hands shook scrolling through digital horror stories.

This was career suicide. Exactly the toxic corporate nightmare I'd spent three years escaping after the whistleblowing debacle at Nexus Tech left me unemployable, blacklisted, and emotionally destroyed.

But Jake's face flashed through my mind. My little brother, fighting leukemia like his full-time job. Who'd put himself through community college while I lived my best academic life at MIT, never asking for help.

Never asked for anything, never complained, called me crying last month because insurance denied the bone marrow transplant that could literally save his life.

When Juno returned with a finalized contract, I signed without reading a word.

Because sometimes you don't choose between good and bad options. Sometimes you choose which version of hell you can survive.

Brighton Systems occupied twelve floors of architectural intimidation in Amsterdam's financial district. The building looked like liquid obsidian‚Äîblack glass and sharp angles designed to make visitors feel disposable.

The receptionist had no eyebrows and wore latex like business casual. She didn't speak, just scanned my retina with something that looked surgical.

Beep. Access granted.

The executive floor was sensory deprivation meets evil lair. No furniture, no art, no human habitation signs. Just surveillance monitors showing real-time global feeds‚ÄîLondon traffic, Tokyo subways, maybe a drug deal in S√£o Paulo.

Standing before it all like a digital emperor: Eric Brighton.

No shoes. Charcoal suit worth more than my car. Dark hair perfectly disheveled like he'd run hands through it once.

He didn't turn when I entered.

""Miss Middleton. You're late.""

""Actually‚Äî"" He turned and with that I forgot how to form words.

Photos hadn't prepared me. Museum-quality bone structure, pale skin, sharp cheekbones, mouth that had never smiled. Steel-gray eyes like arctic water.

This man looked like he ordered deaths between meals.

""I'm not late,"" I managed.

""Then your phone is lying."" He moved closer‚Äîexpensive cologne mixed with danger. ""What exactly did you think you were applying for?""

""Executive assistant. Administrative support, scheduling‚Äî""

""Wrong."" He circled me like a predator. ""You're here because you have specific skills I require. Because you've proven you'll sacrifice everything for what you believe is right. And because your brother is dying.""

My breath caught. ""How‚Äî?""

""I know everything, Floris. MIT summa cum laude. Phantom Protocol encryption at twenty-four. Exposed Nexus Tech's illegal surveillance of federal judges, got yourself blacklisted from every major tech company.""

He stopped in front of me. ""Now you're desperate enough to work for someone like me.""

""Someone like you?""

""Someone you Googled despite explicit instructions. Someone whose reputation terrifies you. Someone you believe is capable of terrible things."" His smile could cut glass. ""You're not wrong.""

He walked to his desk. ""Your real job isn't assistant work. It's a security analysis. Corporate espionage prevention. Finding holes in my system before enemies do.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Your brother's treatment stops. His debt gets sold to collection agencies run by creative people. You get deported, unemployable for life.""

The room shrank. ""You're blackmailing me.""

""I'm offering a choice. Work for me, protect my interests, your brother lives. Refuse, and you both learn what desperation feels like.""

""Why me? Hundreds of security analysts don't have my baggage.""

""Baggage creates loyalty. Desperate people work harder. You've proven you'll destroy your life to expose the truth."" He leaned against his desk. ""I respect that. I can use that.""

""What happens when you're done using me?""

""Depends how useful you prove.""

The monitors flickered. Hospital room. My heart stopped.

Jake. Asleep, connected to machines, but peaceful. For the first time in months he looked peaceful.

""He looks well,"" Eric observed. ""New treatment's working. White cell count improved dramatically.""

""You already started treating him?""

""Insurance authorized this morning. Funny how quickly things process when you know the right people."" Relief and rage tangled in my chest. ""Do we have understanding?""

I looked at Jake's face, then back at the man holding our lives. ""What's my first assignment?""

His smile was winter. ""Get on your knees.""

I froze. ""Excuse me?""

""Rule one: everyone starts at the bottom. Everyone learns humility first."" He gestured to the floor. ""Kneel.""

""I'm not‚Äî This isn't‚Äî""

""Your brother's next treatment is Friday. Would be unfortunate if there were authorization complications.""

My legs turned to water. This was insane, degrading, exactly the power-trip bullshit I'd sworn I'd never tolerate again. Every feminist instinct I had was screaming at me to walk out, to tell this psychopath exactly where he could shove his job offer.

But Jake's face was on that screen, peaceful for the first time in months. And sometimes survival means swallowing your pride along with everything else you thought you knew about yourself.

I sank to my knees on cold marble.

‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äù Eric said softly. ‚ÄúNow we can begin. You will do whatever I say. Because I‚Äôm the only one keeping your brother alive.‚Äù

Chapter 2

POV Floris

The floor was¬†*fucking*¬†freezing. Like, prison-cell-in-January cold.

Eric Brighton stood there looking down at me like he was God‚Äôs fucked-up younger brother who‚Äôd gotten really into psychological warfare instead of miracles.

‚ÄúJust because my brother has medical debt,‚Äù I started, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm stuck paying it off‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt mean you get to pull this twisted power-trip bullshit with me.‚Äù

He laughed.

Not a normal laugh. Not even a creepy laugh. This was something else entirely‚Äîlow and dark and intimate, like he was sharing a private joke with the devil.

‚ÄúOh, sweetheart,‚Äù he murmured, and fuck me, he was crouching down to my level now.

His fingers found my chin, like my face was property he‚Äôd been considering purchasing. Touch was deliberate in a way that made my skin crawl and my nerve endings light up simultaneously as he tilted my face up toward his.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù he said, voice soft as silk and twice as dangerous.

Then his thumb brushed across my lower lip.

I flinched like he‚Äôd hit me with a cattle prod. The pad of his thumb was warm, smooth, and so deliberately possessive that my brain short-circuited for a second.

*‚ÄòDon‚Äôt open your mouth*,‚Äô I commanded myself. ‚Äò*Don‚Äôt react. Don‚Äôt give him the satisfaction. Don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äô*

But my traitorous body had other plans. My breath caught in my throat, hitched like a broken engine, and this tiny sound escaped‚Äîbarely audible, but unmistakably there.

A¬†*fucking*¬†moan.

The shame hit me like a physical blow. My stomach churned with disgust so intense I thought I might actually throw up on his expensive shoes. Which, honestly, would have been the perfect metaphor for this entire situation.

His eyes went darker, pupils dilating like he‚Äôd just tasted something delicious. ‚ÄúThere it is.‚Äù

He stood up‚Äîgraceful, controlled, like a predator who‚Äôd just confirmed his prey was exactly as vulnerable as he‚Äôd hoped. Walked over to this stupidly elegant side table and poured amber liquid into the crystal.

‚ÄúDrink,‚Äù he said, holding the glass out to me like it was communion wine.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The word came out sharper than I intended, pride finally clawing its way back to the surface. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drinking anything you hand me, you psychotic‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want me to do it the hard way?‚Äù

His voice was still soft, still conversational. Which somehow made the threat about a thousand times more terrifying than if he‚Äôd been yelling.

My eyes darted to the wall of surveillance monitors behind him. All those screens showing all those places, all those people who had no idea they were being watched. He could do anything to me right now. Show anyone anything.

My lips parted before I could stop them.

He moved closer, close enough that I could feel his body heat, and pressed the rim of the glass to my mouth. The liquid burned going down.

He crouched beside me again, close enough that I could count his eyelashes if I wanted to torture myself further. His voice was barely a whisper when he spoke:

‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù Those two words hit me like a drug.

Warm and liquid and completely unwanted, they melted through my skull and settled somewhere deep in my chest where I kept all my most shameful secrets.

I hated it. Hated the way my body responded, hated the little flutter of something that definitely wasn‚Äôt disgust, hated how much I wanted‚Äî*needed*‚Äîto hear him say it again.

\*\*\*

I woke up in what could only be described as architectural porn.

Seriously. The suite was like someone had taken a luxury hotel room and fed it steroids.

Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of Amsterdam‚Äôs skyline, all glass towers and historic spires playing nice together. The bed I was sprawled on was the size of my entire Boston apartment.

‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck,‚Äù I whispered, sitting up slowly.

My head felt like it was stuffed with cotton and regret. The last thing I remembered was Eric crouching beside me, his thumb on my lips, that amber liquid burning down my throat, and then‚Ä¶ nothing. Complete blackout.

What the hell had been in that drink?

I stumbled toward the bathroom mirror and froze. Someone had cleaned me up. Like, thoroughly.

My hair was washed and braided in a perfect plait down my back. My makeup was gone, skin scrubbed clean. I was wearing silk pajamas‚Äîexpensive ones that definitely weren‚Äôt mine.

The thought of someone undressing me, washing me, dressing me while I was unconscious made my skin crawl so hard I actually shuddered.

A sharp knock interrupted my spiral into panic.

The door opened to reveal a woman who looked like she‚Äôd been designed by someone with very specific control issues.

Mid-thirties, maybe, with black hair pulled into a bun so tight it could crack walnuts. Her suit was perfectly tailored, her heels were silent on the marble, and her expression was about as warm as a tax audit.

She didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Just held out a folded bundle of clothes‚Äîblack, severe, like funeral attire for someone who‚Äôd died of corporate compliance.

‚ÄúFloor seven,‚Äù she said, voice flat as week-old soda. ‚ÄúImmediately after you shower.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, what‚Äôs on floor seven?‚Äù

She was already turning to leave. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know, or you won‚Äôt tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Still no eye contact. Like I was furniture she‚Äôd been told to polish.

The door closed with a soft click, leaving me alone with designer clothes and growing dread.

Twenty minutes later, I was standing in an elevator that apparently had trust issues with buttons. The thing just started moving the second I stepped inside, like it knew exactly where I needed to go without bothering to ask my opinion.

The clothes fit perfectly, which was somehow more disturbing than if they‚Äôd been wrong. Black slacks, black blouse, black blazer‚ÄîI looked like I worked for a very fashionable funeral home.

Floor seven arrived with a soft ding that sounded almost apologetic.

The doors opened onto what looked like a medical facility had a baby with a high-security prison. Everything was white‚Äîwalls, floors, ceiling‚Äîso bright it made my eyes water.

The hallway stretched out like a sterile nightmare, punctuated by black glass doors marked with red numbers. One through six.

No windows. No sound except the whisper of air circulation and my own breathing.

Then a voice crackled through hidden speakers: ‚ÄúRoom four. Now.‚Äù

Because of course it did.

Room four‚Äôs door hissed open as I approached, like the building was reading my mind. The space inside was‚Ä¶ confusing. Luxury mixed with laboratory.

The door opened.

She walked in like she owned the building, the city, and possibly my soul. Tall, elegant, with platinum blonde hair swept into a chignon that probably required architectural planning. Her suit was designer, her heels were weapons, and her smile was sharp enough to perform surgery.

‚ÄúSia Morgenstern,‚Äù she said, extending a hand I was too terrified to shake. ‚ÄúDirector of Reinforcement and Training.‚Äù

‚ÄúTraining for what?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be the perfect assistant for Mr. Brighton, of course.‚Äù Her eyes traveled over me like I was livestock at auction. ‚ÄúPosture: acceptable. Compliance: promising. Fear response: excellent.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid,‚Äù I lied.

‚ÄúYour pupils are dilated, your breathing is shallow, and that suit is monitoring your heart rate.‚Äù She smiled wider. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terrified. It‚Äôs a very productive emotional state.‚Äù

She moved to a wall screen and tapped it. Two buttons appeared: SILENCE and PERMISSION.

‚ÄúYour first choice,‚Äù Sia said conversationally. ‚ÄúDo you want to learn quietly, or would you prefer to ask questions first?‚Äù

I stared at the options, my finger hovering between them. Everything in me screamed to choose PERMISSION, to demand answers, to fight back.

But Jake‚Äôs face flashed in my mind. Those nurses. The machines keeping him alive.

I pressed SILENCE.

The room sealed itself with a mechanical hiss. The lights dimmed to something soft and intimate. Music began‚Äîlow, sensual, the kind that made you think of things you shouldn‚Äôt.

And then his voice filled the space, rich as honey and twice as dangerous: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

A panel slid open behind me. I turned. Behind the one-way glass‚Äîan entirely different room.

A woman, spread-eagle on silk sheets, wrists bound, blindfold over her eyes, her body arching as she moaned into a pillow. The sound was real. Raw. Wet.

And Eric Brighton stood at the edge of the bed. Shirtless. Hair tousled. His mouth at her throat. His fingers disappearing between her thighs.

‚ÄúObserve,‚Äù Sia breathed behind me, close enough for her lips to graze my ear. ‚ÄúLearn.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt look. But I also couldn‚Äôt¬†*not*¬†look.

The woman‚Äôs body writhed. His voice coaxed every reaction like he owned her muscles, her breath, her climax. It wasn‚Äôt sex‚Äîit was warfare.

And then‚Äî

‚ÄúTouch yourself,‚Äù Eric‚Äôs voice ordered through the intercom. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù",1,1751935422.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I've been working in Vietnam for a year now, but I feel like I still haven't fully explored Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City. I'm sure there are some hidden gems out there that l've missed.

I finally have 3 days off to explore the city, and I would really appreciate any recommendations you might have. This could be activities, parks, hotels, or coffee shops that are worth visiting.

I'm starting to build my itinerary and I really want to make the most out of these 3 days off. I'm usually very busy with work, so I want to take this chance to finally explore more of HCM.

I'm particularly interested in: 
‚Äî Cozy coffee shops or ones with a nice view or overlooking spots 
‚Äî Local parks where I can relax or people-watch 
‚Äî Street food like banh mi, Vietnamese pancakes, ice cream, bread ‚Äî basically anything local and affordable ‚Äî Restaurants or small food spots that serve burgers, pasta, pizza, or fries. (If none of those are common here, I'd love to hear about must-try restaurants that are affordable and worth it!)

I'd prefer to skip malls for this trip since I usually end up there anyway.

I'm hoping to experience a mix of tourist favorites and local spots to make the most of my mini staycation. Thank you in advance for your suggestions! ü§ç",2,1751935396.0,Vietnam_Tourism,0,1.0,False

1luasf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPD/comments/1luasf7/i_just_want_to_post_here_as_well_as_in_the_ocd/,I just want to post here as well as in the OCD subreddit. As actually looking up the actual diagnostic criteria for OCPD regarding the perfectionism for structured reality is relatable. Attended a mens mental health group tonight and realised yeah maybe this is an issue whatever it is.,"Right my previous post was deleted or didn't post properly so I am going to copy and post this after I finish this. Right this is a disclaimer some of the things I might include might be related to topics which aren't exactly graphic as I know that isn't allowed but I suppose trailing around the edges of such a thing is ok I assume without the content. Content I will be including. I would say comes under obsessional things relating to health which comes back to being pure and perfect health I think now I think about it and also religion and how my thought stuctures pertain to fitting this paradigm into my daily life and without it I am totally lost and I cannot cope and anxiety increases triplefold if I don't engage in such behaviour but I end up justifying such behaviour as I think ""oh it's fine this isn't harmful it is helpful as I am focusing on my moral self or my health or something related to this. Yeah I don't know what exactly is going on for me is characterised as I don' know. However whatever it is.

It seems to put me in an infinite loop. It's like these daily rituals I HAVE to do at particular times and in a particular order and if I don't do them, then the rest of my day cannot be structured. So in this way my thought structure in way I conduct myself in analogous to my day. There is no room for error whatsoever and often no room for anyone else, and from my own emotional state of mind. It removes any emotional presence whatsoever. I rip out the emotions to which could be related to particular frames of mind and tear them out from the root, as a result I intellectualise every single thing which is going on emotionally for me. Therefore I can provide a justification for such an emotion. By providing a justification I can short circuit the emotion which is at hand at any given moment in my life, because my thought patterns are so hierarchical it leads to little input from the external world i.e. other people and the said interactions which come from this. I think what this leads to personally is an extreme irritation and irritability of dealing with the emotions of others. I have noticed I do not feel this feeling during my night shifts due to less people being present.

However in the day shifts this is ever more present. This irritation is also quite angry and rageful for me and is an externalised part of my psyche and I think it is designed as a defence mechanism to stop people actually interacting with me at all. I am not able to tolerate the emotions of other people. This can get quite dark for me personally for the thoughts I may have and the the more intense the emotion expressed by someone else, this will illicit a greater response of irritation in the form of repetitive wishing that person wasn't there and that is putting it mild. Let me give me a fairly low frequency example. Let's picture a scene I am in a kitchen with another individual, I have a hot cup of coffee and I walk past them into the front room. I will visualize in the form of intrusive thought throwing such cup of coffee in their direction or face. I will not go any further with such an explanation but after which I will feel awfully guilty and spiral, trying to come up with a reason at how this is all my fault and I am awful human being for thinking such a thing. I hate to have such thoughts.

This feeling is ever present literally all the time for me or most of the time, but when I am in an environment where the variables are controlled to my liking and manipulated to an extent where things are under my domain, then such a thing doesn't happen. Now let me detail a particular thought sequence to which would give me temporary relief. For example a current obsession of mine is eating particular food types only or if I do one thing in one way I'll feel guilt and feel guilt in the same way in the opposite trajectory to this. Supplementation for example the obbession of taking particular supplements with a actualised hopeful benefit for my health and cycling such things on and off not to build a tolerance. I am really into neuro hacking for brain fog for example. I try to modulate every single part though. Another example is being scared particular situations will trigger a scary traumatic thought etc and then avoiding such situations to avoid such a thing. Health related so being obbessed about the effects of sugar or alcohol on the brain so I won't have a single bit whatsoever and if I do I will feel extremely guilty. Religious OCD, being afraid what I am doing is illicting demons or incurring the wrath of god. Another form is extremely intrincate obsessions over gray areas etc like well substances which are a bit borderline and also outright well illegal in certain countries. Magic mushrooms for example. This can help but massively increasing neuroplasticity and then engaging in bad behaviour is definitely not good. I'll leave it at that.

I'll leave it at that for now. I am considering about going to the doctors about this tommorow as I feel like I need too. I haven't ever been honest with mental health professionals. There is more I could detail. Anyway thanks for reading if you did. It would be good to reach out to some other individuals who relate. If you do feel free to reach out to me. I don't want this to rule my life anymore. I have no friends because of all this.

Edit:

I am not looking for any reassurance I have a particular type of OCD. Honestly I wish I could alt f4 all this and start tommorow doing what I usually do but not in an obbessive way. I wish I wish. Even if I have it I feel like I would prefer to do everything under the sun except from dealing with it.",1,1751934631.0,OCPD,0,1.0,False

*Greetings, Montclair neighbors!*¬†Welcome to The Daily Squirrel‚Äôs¬†**Acorn Economy**¬†report ‚Äì a whimsical weekly roundup of local happenings. As summer sunshine filters through our town‚Äôs oak trees, Montclair‚Äôs ‚Äúsquirrels‚Äù (that‚Äôs all of us!) have been busy gathering newsy acorns. This week‚Äôs harvest blends real-world economic updates, small business buzz, housing and nest-building news, community events, and seasonal fun ‚Äì all seasoned with a playful, nutty twist. Let‚Äôs scurry right in!

# Local Business & Economic Nutshells üêøÔ∏èüíº

* **Downtown Bloom:**¬†Montclair‚Äôs business district is bursting with fresh energy. The historic Lackawanna Station redevelopment¬†**officially opened**¬†as a new shopping and dining hub, welcoming over¬†*20 new businesses*¬†under its roof [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna). The grand opening featured live music, art, kids‚Äô activities, and freebies ‚Äì marking a major infusion of economic acorns into our community‚Äôs stash. Montclair‚Äôs newest destination is now buzzing with foot traffic as residents explore food, art, and shops in the restored train station marketplace [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna).
* **A ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù Hopes Business:**¬†In a milestone for Montclair‚Äôs budding cannabis economy,¬†*The Kush Connection*dispensary finally¬†**won Planning Board approval**¬†on June 30th [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=received%20approval%20from%20the%20Montclair,to%20the%20Montclair%20MotorCar%20dealership). Originally slated for 2024, this recreational cannabis shop will set up at 665 Bloomfield Avenue (a former auto dealership site) after a year of squirreling through red tape [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=received%20approval%20from%20the%20Montclair,to%20the%20Montclair%20MotorCar%20dealership). The approval came with plenty of chatter about parking and signage, but also enthusiastic support from locals eager to see this¬†*‚Äúbudding‚Äù*¬†business open its doors [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/#:~:text=Montclair). Montclair‚Äôs enterprising squirrels can soon add¬†*‚Äúgreen acorns‚Äù*¬†to the local economy!
* **New Flavors & Faces:**¬†A flurry of¬†*new eateries and shops*¬†have popped up around town, adding to Montclair‚Äôs eclectic ‚Äúnut mix‚Äù of small businesses.¬†**El Gordo Peruvian Eatery**¬†opened on Orange Road, dishing out bold Peruvian flavors ‚Äì from Pollo a la Brasa and chaufa fried rice to lomo saltado and fresh ceviche [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=Monica%20Velis%20immigrated%20from%20Peru,Ceviche%2C%20to%20name%20a%20few). On Bloomfield Avenue,¬†**Qahwah House**¬†now brews aromatic Yemeni coffee drinks (spiced with cardamom) and serves sweet honey-drenched pastries, having officially opened in February [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=In%20December%202024%2C%20Qahwah%20House%2C,roll%20topped%20with%20drizzled%20honey). And burger lovers rejoiced as¬†**Mashed Burgers**¬†flipped its first patties in Montclair, a New Jersey-based joint specializing in 100% Halal smashed burgers with all the fixings (plus shakes and fries) since its late-March debut [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-essex-county-nj-spring-2025/#:~:text=On%20March%2028th%2C%20the%20New,certified). From international cuisine to java and comfort food, local entrepreneurs are filling every niche ‚Äì proof that Montclair‚Äôs¬†*acorn economy*¬†is thriving one new business at a time!

# Real Estate & Housing Activity üå∞üè†

* **Affordable Housing Blueprint:**¬†Montclair‚Äôs planners have been hard at work mapping new ‚Äúnests‚Äù for the future. The township‚Äôs¬†**10-year affordable housing plan**¬†received final Planning Board approval in late May and was due for state submission by June 30th [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/montclair-board-oks-affordable-housing-plan-amid-talk-of-costs/#:~:text=Loughman%20raised%20the%20question%20as,Community%20Affairs%20by%20June%2030). The plan identifies a few town-owned sites (like a tract by Wildwood Ave and an old property on Miller St) that could host affordable units, and flags other spots that might be repurposed for housing if their current uses become ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù[montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/montclair-board-oks-affordable-housing-plan-amid-talk-of-costs/#:~:text=The%20township%E2%80%99s%20draft%20affordable%20housing,%E2%80%9D). It‚Äôs essentially a roadmap to ensure Montclair remains a diverse and inclusive oak forest, with housing options for all critters. While questions were raised about costs and impacts, officials noted the town holds over $2 million in an affordable housing trust (possibly growing to $5M over the next decade) to help fund these efforts [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/montclair-board-oks-affordable-housing-plan-amid-talk-of-costs/#:~:text=The%20affordable%20housing%20plan%2C%20Talley,affordable%20housing%20trust%20fund%20dollars). In short, our township is investing today‚Äôs acorns so future families can find a cozy Montclair nest.
* **Stalled Development May Get Unstuck:**¬†A¬†*half-built*¬†apartment complex in downtown Montclair (a five-story behemoth on Church Street) has been an unfortunate ‚Äúacorn in limbo‚Äù after construction stalled months ago. Good news: it¬†**may soon be rescued**¬†from foreclosure by a new buyer [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/74-unit-development-in-montclair-may-be-sold-amid-construction-stoppage/#:~:text=A%20partially%20built%20five,on%20property%2C%20court%20records%20show). Court records show an initial bidder offered¬†**$22.5 million**¬†for the 74-unit development, indicating serious interest in finishing the project [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/74-unit-development-in-montclair-may-be-sold-amid-construction-stoppage/#:~:text=A%20partially%20built%20five,on%20property%2C%20court%20records%20show). If the sale goes through, expect hammers and hard hats back on site, transforming that concrete husk into new homes. Montclair‚Äôs squirrels could see this long-dormant ‚Äúhousing oak‚Äù finally bear fruit ‚Äì adding more apartments to our downtown tree canopy and more activity to the local economy.
* **Summer Market Sizzle:**¬†Montclair‚Äôs housing market continues to heat up with the season. Spacious family homes and historic beauties alike are commanding premium prices ‚Äì often well into seven figures. For instance, a 5-bedroom, 5-bath¬†**Upper Montclair home**¬†hit the market at¬†**$1.799 million** [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20real%20estate), complete with a chef‚Äôs kitchen, stone patio, swimming pool and pool house ‚Äì the ultimate summer-ready retreat [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20real%20estate). High-end listings like this showcase the demand for Montclair‚Äôs blend of suburban charm and urban amenities. Local realtors report that buyers are still scurrying to bid on desirable properties, though rising interest rates have tamed the frenzy a bit. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a cozy starter hollow or a luxurious ‚Äútreehouse‚Äù with all the trimmings, Montclair remains one of New Jersey‚Äôs most sought-after real estate markets.

# Community Events & Festivities üéâüå≥

* **Independence Day Extravaganza:**¬†Montclair geared up for its biggest summer celebration ‚Äì the¬†**4th of July Parade and Family Festival**¬†‚Äì and it did not disappoint!

After the morning parade, the festivities moved to Edgemont Park for a post-parade¬†**Festival**¬†starting at 1 PM [montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/News-articles/2025-July-4th-Parade-and-Festival#:~:text=include%20the%20region%E2%80%99s%20largest%20Independence,at%20Edgemont%20Park%20at%201pm). Neighbors enjoyed an expanded spread of food trucks, live music, games, and activities under the sun [montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/News-articles/2025-July-4th-Parade-and-Festival#:~:text=The%20Parade%20begins%20at%2011%3A00,a%20rain%20or%20shine%20event). With clear skies and high spirits, Montclair‚Äôs Fourth of July tradition brought out huge crowds and big smiles ‚Äì a perfect display of our community acorn pride and red-white-and-blue squirrel spirit.
* **Bastille Day Goes Big:**¬†No sooner did the July 4th sparklers cool than Montclair‚Äôs French connection began planning another f√™te. For the first time ever, the annual¬†**Bastille Day**¬†celebration in Montclair will expand into a¬†**full weekend of French-inspired festivities**¬†around town [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/07/montclairs-bastille-day-celebration-expands-to-a-full-weekend-of-festivities/#:~:text=ever,be%20for%20Bastille%20Day%20festivities). Kicking off on Friday, July 11, Montclair Film (in partnership with the French Institute‚Äôs local branch) is hosting a¬†*Bastille Day film premiere*¬†at The Clairidge, screening a French film as a sneak preview [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/07/montclairs-bastille-day-celebration-expands-to-a-full-weekend-of-festivities/#:~:text=The%20celebration%20kicks%20off%20with,Marthe%2C%E2%80%9D%20at%20The%20Clairidge). Then on Saturday July 12, L‚ÄôAlliance Fran√ßaise‚Äôs Montclair campus, Montclair Center BID, and Experience Montclair will present the first-ever¬†**French Shopping Day**¬†downtown [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/07/montclairs-bastille-day-celebration-expands-to-a-full-weekend-of-festivities/#:~:text=On%20Saturday%2C%20July%2012%2C%20the,add%20to%20the%20festive%20atmosphere). Expect to see Parisian flair on Church Street and beyond ‚Äì think sidewalk sales, tastings, pop-up French caf√©s, a town-wide scavenger hunt, and even outdoor storytime in Watchung Plaza for les petits enfants [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/07/montclairs-bastille-day-celebration-expands-to-a-full-weekend-of-festivities/#:~:text=On%20Saturday%2C%20July%2012%2C%20the,add%20to%20the%20festive%20atmosphere). C‚Äôest magnifique! The crowning event will be the elegant¬†**Bastille Day Garden Party**¬†on Saturday evening at Van Vleck House & Gardens (5‚Äì9 PM), complete with gourmet food, fine wines, live jazz by ‚ÄúMarie and Her Trio,‚Äù and lots of¬†*ooh-la-la*¬†under the stars [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/07/montclairs-bastille-day-celebration-expands-to-a-full-weekend-of-festivities/#:~:text=It%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20Bastille%20Day,a%20touch%20of%20Parisian%20charm). Montclair is truly¬†*the place to be*¬†for Bastille celebrations this year, as our town dons bleu-blanc-rouge and channels its inner French squirrel. Vive Montclair!

* **Library Summer Kickoff:**¬†Montclair Public Library has launched its annual¬†**Summer Reading**¬†program, inviting youngsters and families to ‚ÄúColor Our World‚Äù with books and activities. Starting July 1, both the main library and Bellevue Avenue branch began hosting reading challenges, craft events, and story times to keep kids reading all summer long. This year‚Äôs theme brings a vibrant, artistic twist ‚Äì children can track reading goals and literally add color to giant maps and murals. In other words, our local library is ensuring that young readers keep their minds sharp (and imaginations bright) even while school‚Äôs out. It‚Äôs a season of literary acorns for curious little squirrels, and everyone‚Äôs invited to join the fun, get creative, and of course check out some great books!
* **Community Highlights:**¬†There were plenty of other happenings keeping Montclairites busy this week. The¬†**Montclair Inn**, an affordable senior residence, hosted a jovial outdoor movie night on July 2 featuring the classic¬†*‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù*¬†film ‚Äì all to raise funds for the Inn‚Äôs programs and residents [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/#:~:text=Montclair%20Inn%20Hosts%20%E2%80%98Superman%E2%80%99%20Movie,Night%20to%20Support%20Senior%20Housing). Seniors and neighbors gathered under the stars, capes and popcorn in tow, proving you‚Äôre never too old to enjoy a summer superhero flick for a good cause. And congratulations are in order for¬†**Montclair High School‚Äôs Class of 2025**, which celebrated its commencement on June 27th [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/#:~:text=Told%20to%20%E2%80%98Dream%20Boldly%2C%E2%80%99%20Montclair,Class%20of%202025%20Celebrates%20Graduation). Hundreds of proud families watched their graduates walk across the stage at Woodman Field, marking the end of one chapter and the start of a new adventure. üéì These freshly fledged young squirrels have been told to¬†*‚Äúdream boldly‚Äù*¬†as they leap from the Montclair nest into futures bright with possibility [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/#:~:text=Told%20to%20%E2%80%98Dream%20Boldly%2C%E2%80%99%20Montclair,Class%20of%202025%20Celebrates%20Graduation). Good luck, grads!

# Arts & Leisure Highlights üé≠üé∂

* **Hollywood Comes to Montclair:**¬†Don‚Äôt be startled if you see a familiar comedian-turned-movie star shooting hoops in your local park ‚Äì that really¬†*is*¬†Adam Sandler! The actor/producer has been in town as¬†**filming**¬†for an upcoming movie got underway at Montclair High School‚Äôs outdoor amphitheater [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Adam%20Sandler%20has%20been%20making,past%20week%2C%20his%20production%20company).

* **Music Scene: From Indie Rock to R.E.M.:**¬†Montclair‚Äôs live music scene is¬†*rocking*¬†on all cylinders this season.

The Grammy-winning band has roots in the area, so fans were thrilled to welcome them for back-to-back shows that had Bloomfield Avenue humming.

# Civic & Infrastructure Updates üèóÔ∏èüèõÔ∏è

* **Century-Old School Closes:**¬†Marking the end of an era, Montclair bid farewell to a long-standing institution this week. After¬†**100 years in operation**,¬†**Immaculate Conception High School**¬†closed its doors for good on June 30th [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Catholic%20high%20school%20Immaculate%20Conception,%E2%80%9D). Generations of Montclair residents attended this Catholic school on Cottage Place, which first opened in 1925. Alumni, faculty, and families mourned the closure, even as they celebrated the school‚Äôs proud legacy. ‚ÄúImmaculate Conception High School has been a cherished institution for generations, providing a faith-based education that has shaped countless lives,‚Äù said Barbara Dolan, NJ‚Äôs Superintendent of Catholic Schools [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Catholic%20high%20school%20Immaculate%20Conception,%E2%80%9D). The community is honoring that¬†*legacy of acorns*¬†‚Äì the values, friendships, and education planted by ICHS over a century ‚Äì even as we acknowledge that one of Montclair‚Äôs oldest oak trees has fallen. The school‚Äôs closing is a poignant reminder of how our town continues to evolve.
* **Rail Crossing Revamp:**¬†Some nuts-and-bolts infrastructure news:¬†*Mind the detours*¬†around Pine Street! The¬†**at-grade railroad crossing on Pine St.**¬†(near the Montclair-Boonton line tracks) is¬†**scheduled to close for a major replacement**¬†on Wednesday, July 9th [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Railroad%20Crossing%20on%20Pine%20Street,Montclair%20to%20Close%20for%20Replacement). For about a week (until July 16 or 17), no cars will be able to cross the tracks at Pine Street while crews work on upgrades [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L326%20replacement%20on,Avenue%20and%20Glenridge%20Avenue%20will). Never fear ‚Äì nearby Claremont Avenue and Glenridge Avenue crossings will remain open to keep traffic flowing, including emergency vehicles heading to/from Mountainside hospital [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=The%20at,is%20expected%20to%20reopen%20the). The temporary inconvenience will be worth it, as a new smoother, safer crossing will be in place by mid-July. Consider it a little summer construction acorn that, once finished, will make our daily commutes just a bit better. Plan your route accordingly, and give a friendly wave to the hardworking crews improving our town‚Äôs infrastructure!
* **Honoring Our Heritage:**¬†In uplifting civic news, Montclair‚Äôs¬†**Historic Preservation Commission (HPC)**¬†has announced the¬†**2025 winners of its Historic Preservation Awards** [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Historic%20Preservation%20Commission%20Selects,Winners%20for%20Historic%20Preservation%20Awards).

So if you notice a beautifully rehabbed porch or a century-old building sporting a fresh lease on life, it just might be an award winner. Let‚Äôs tip our hats (or nuts) to these preservation-minded neighbors for helping Montclair retain its timeless appeal even as we grow.

That‚Äôs the nut-shell of it for this week‚Äôs Acorn Economy report! üêøÔ∏è Montclair‚Äôs trees are rustling with activity ‚Äì from new shops and homes sprouting up, to festivals and films enlivening our summer, to civic improvements keeping our community strong.

I was having a great time until I received a direct message from a random guy. I was out with my family shopping for groceries when I thought he was from my friend from high school, so I accepted the message. I literally thought my friend got a new insta account.

When I found out that he wasn‚Äôt from my high school, I immediately stopped replying to him. But he wouldn‚Äôt stop sending me weird messages, like ‚ÄúYou can just admit I look good‚Äù or ‚ÄúI'll treat you to some coffee first. It will be fun.‚Äù I LITERALLY HATE COFFEE!

I quietly muted my phone afterwards, hoping to regain some sense of peace. However, things kept escalating. His behavior grew increasingly erratic, crossing boundaries I never imagined. He was acting like he was stalking me on Instagram. I went back on my phone because of the stupid notifications. I politely asked him to stop. But as I asked him to stop, he asked me on a boba date‚Ä¶ A F\*ING BOBA DATE. I was literally thinking ‚Äúthis is seriously so disgusting.‚Äù I reported the account and before I blocked him, he said ‚ÄúNow you have an excuse to come back‚Äù WITH A WINKING EMOJI!

I blocked him trying to process everything..

I am also not interested in dating someone with children. Not meaning to offend -- just a personal preference as someone who does not want kids.)

About me: I am alt, demisexual, and living in FL with my nesting partner and two cats! I am working on moving back to upstate NY, so for now, I am really just seeking an online connection. I consider myself to be a very silly goose who has a dark humor, especially when it comes to things like capitalism or politicians. 

I am vegetarian and very passionate about doing what I can for my own little ecosystem, versus taking on the social responsibility corporations have avoided since the beginning of time.. anyways, as you can probably tell, I have ADHD and can get ramble-y, so I would prefer someone who can keep up with that!

I am a bit of a homebody, but I enjoy little adventures here and there, whether it's the beach, coffee shop, or a thrift store. I watch a lot of YouTube in between but have been trying to reduce my screen time. I love nature, too, and I have a little garden going. I am 420 friendly, and you can often find me on my porch after work, listening to the birds as I smoke. I am casually reading some of my repeat faves, including The Hunger Games, and I love a lot of different styles of music, especially pop punk and indie. 

I have been polyamorous for several years, with a handful of healthy connections and not-so-healthy learning experiences. My love languages include physical touch, and I find myself yearning in the middle of the night for a woman to pull close to me. I know this is a challenge with distance, but I can't help but melt at the thought. I am very much craving a romantic connection, but I am not entirely sure what to expect, as it's been a long time since I allowed myself to be vulnerable like that with a woman. I have enjoyed casual connections, but I find myself wanting more. I just want a palpable connection that brings mutual comfort and understanding. 

That said, I do have ADHD, and sometimes, I can struggle with quick responses and object permanence, and I consider myself a low maintenance connection that just likes to connect. I take mental health very seriously, and I am a work in progress myself, but I am really seeking an emotionally stable connection built off of mutual respect and heavy communication!

In case it matters: I am 5'4, petite, and androgynous-leaning with some femme flair. I prefer individuals who are femme-leaning, close to my age (29-34 is my range), and understanding of my desire to take my time with building a connection. I‚Äôm willing to travel for the right person, and I do enjoy my own space so I‚Äôve got no issue with long distance. 

If any of this appeals to you, send me a message and tell me about your comfort meal! Thank you for making it all the way thru my long post! I mulled over the contents of this post a lot, and I am doing my best to be kind and clear.",2,1751934176.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

This is genuinely baffling to me. Today, Karoline Leavitt posted on Instagram about the struggles that ‚Äúmamas‚Äù face and what they have to do to pull themselves out of the trenches. While presenting herself in solidarity with ‚Äúfellow mamas,‚Äù she‚Äôs simultaneously supporting policies that would take critical assistance away from many of them. She backs cuts to Medicaid and SNAP‚Äîprograms that help countless mothers keep their families afloat.

These mothers aren‚Äôt managing to get by with trips to baseball games or weekends at the beach. They‚Äôre relying on these programs to put food on the table and access basic medical care. They don‚Äôt have a much older, wealthy partner to bankroll their lifestyle. They‚Äôre working, paying rent, doing everything they can‚Ä¶and still coming up short. That‚Äôs why government support matters.

When Karoline Leavitt says ‚Äúmy fellow mamas,‚Äù she‚Äôs really talking about mothers like her. Wealthy mothers whose ‚Äústruggles‚Äù are the kind other moms can only dream of. Her child will have dinner tonight and a doctor to see when needed. Those are the mothers she‚Äôs standing with‚Äînot the ones fighting to survive without the safety net she wants to take away.

1- proper sleep: It's not to be underestimated. Proper sleep is around 7-9hrs. Some tips to get this is to avoid coffee in the afternoon and to cut screen usage for at least 1hr before bed. Trying to get in bed and to wake up at same times everyday also helps

2- proper food: I realized that staying clean helped me a lot. I usually feel no hunger when it came, which in my case help. Just try to cut some sugar and ultra processed foods as much as you can, switching to fruits and it will improve.

3- Exercise: It can be a walking in the park, hit the gym with medium effort workouts. If you can't afford a gym you can explore training systems like calisthenics. The goal isn't even to get fit, but to spend time outside and to get some sense of accomplishment.

4- Journaling/Meditation: It's hard to reach out to people. I too feel anxiety and isolation and I discover that writing down how you are doing also helps a lot. Remember that no one ever needs to read this. I think that this works because it's a way to empty ourselves. Sometimes we store so much thoughts and feelings and regrets that our minds get clouded. put on paper helps relieve that.

5- Social media usage: It's easy to spend time on this things. I am also guilty of that. But I realize that your mind gets clearer when you aren't stuffing with hours of short content videos. There is a thing called cognitive overload and tihs can really mess up with our mental faculties. So if you can reduce your usage, it will help with clarity in the long term.

And please, if you guys are feeling down, try to seek help. Always remember that you are not alone and there are people out there willing to offer help.

Although this tips can seem bland or basic, is what I usually do when things go bad, and it helps me to recover my state of mind fairly quickly. I truly hope that it helps you guys too. Peace!",2,1751933109.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

Quick background: been doing a little research on WWII and cultural / geopolitical histories of the places I'm visiting to give me more context and connection to the sights. To prepare, I've read books by Kafka, Kundera, on the Roma people, on Freud, and finishing up a WWII history book. Will probably try to squeeze in something on Berlin / Munich before my trip. Any books you recommend for my cities?

I love art and architecture and will include that as well as general historic sightseeing. I like a history lesson, but don't want to do tours the entire trip. Experiences like shows would be cool if there's something worthwhile or relevant. I enjoy biking through cities and just enjoying the sights and eating good food / people watching. Let me know which cities I should def rent a bike.

Believe it or not, some of my fav parts of these trips is the travel between cities, being on trains, reading a good book while traveling, and being ""transient"" so to speak. So while it may seem like a lot of moving around, I'm healthy and young enough to do it as long as I get enough sleep. I don't drink and party; will probably smoke cigars every night at my accommodations though.

Let me know what you think!

* Day 1: Arrive in Munich, take a train to Prague (going to be an exhausting travel day coming from the US, I know)
* Day 2: Prague - sleep in, find good coffee, go see the Kafka statue and general sites in the city center; in the evening I'm doing a ""ghost"" tour in Old Town. Should I change it to the underground tour? The tour I scheduled is outdoors.
* Day 3: Prague - Strahov Library; nothing else planned yet
* Day 4: Train to Vienna; picking up bike to rent
* Day 5 - 6: Vienna - Honestly so many things I have planned; Leopoldstadt to check out Freud's old hood, Prater Park, The Belvedere to see Klimt works, maybe Leopold Museum to see Schiele works, Sisi Museum, Schonbrunn Palace; should I go see a show at Burgtheater? Was also planning a bike ride along the Danube. Idk how I'm going to squeeze everything in.
* Day 7: Train to Krakow at 4pm so I may squeeze in one of the sites from above beforehand.
* Day 8: Krakow - Auschwitz Museum in the afternoon (tickets booked); not really planning anything else. Should I do the morning instead? I'm trying to avoid rushing out every morning to do stuff / take trains and instead taking my time with things planned early afternoon.
* Day 9: Krakow - Check out Nowa Huta area, nothing else yet; taking sleeper train to Berlin
* Day 10: Get into Berlin early; pick up bike rental
* Day 11-12 - Berlin - Go see an Aldi! Doing 2 hour bike tour of WWII and Cold War history; maybe Topographies des Terrors, Reichstag Building; first night I'm doing a fun techno and art tutorial thing at a lady's studio for tourists
* Day 13 - Train to Munich
* Day 14-15: Munich - nothing booked yet; still working on it
* Day 16: Fly home

What should I add in Prague? Can I do most of the sightseeing in Vienna in 1 day so that I have time to bike the 2nd day? What should I do in Krakow the 2nd day? Any tour / tutorial recommendations like the Ghost Tour in Prague and Techno + Art in Berlin?

Meet two Angels. Yes, literally. Two, damn it, sequence 1 angels. And they said that I should care about their toddlers for 5 days. Yes, no refusal.¬†

How could it be worse than just this? Both toddlers are freaking WANDERERS. How can I even keep an eye on them?¬†

One of these angels gave me a beacon so they could send me these two babies tomorrow.

Following my intuition I bought a lot of candies. I mean really a lot.¬†

After that I left the city. Just in case. Tonight I will stay in a little hut in the forest‚Ä¶¬†

**Day 1:**

It‚Äôs hard to explain my day‚Ä¶

Toddler names were Keydan and Keylin. Yes, a nice idea for their parents to start naming their Wanderer kids with a ‚ÄúKey‚Äù. And yes, it was sarcasm.

In the first few minutes I already used all my luck (both from my sequence and from the clover) to persuade them that I‚Äôll give them candies if they will jump together and with me. But, according to my bad luck from the clover aftereffect, they were smart enough to understand that they will get more candies if they jump more‚Ä¶¬†

I don‚Äôt want to describe how I feel during that day, I‚Äôll just name some places I saw:active volcano, an endless ocean (without a single island), jungles, full of irritating insects (kids found some cacao beans) and a lot more, not so admirable views.

Only good news - by being babies they do need to sleep a lot. And during that time I could finally rest. Or not‚Ä¶ Looks like they can teleport to their dreams‚Ä¶ Oh god, I should‚Äôve bought more coffee.

**Day 2:**¬†

Nothing special to add: more places to visit, more dangers to evade, more grey hair on my head.

**Day 3:**

I'm out of candy. Crap. Used clover once again so we randomly teleported to a weird underwater city (I love my clover). At least locals also like gold and have candies to sell even if we don‚Äôt share a language. Probably I was fooled, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is our next destination. It was something. In a bad meaning. (I hate my clover)I managed to close my eyes and hug the babies as we came to that place, but even with that, I felt a lot of corruption around us and almost lost my control before the babies jumped again. I need to recover.

**Day 4:**¬†

**THEY GOT BORED.** How can their parents even watch over them? Oh yes, as higher Sequences they can just prevent their teleportations.¬†

Anyway, they don‚Äôt want to see random places anymore. They do want adventures.¬†

We did visit some ancient ruins, find some relics. (that was good)We sad a dragon. He wanted our relics (that was bad)We joined a pirate group for 2 hours (kids find out that it wasn‚Äôt about adventures, but about slow sailing)

And only after that they went to sleep. I already understood that dream world, or at least the place where we jump during their sleeping is calm and isn't really dangerous if you did not touch anything.

**Day 5:**

Finally, the last day.¬†

I started reading them different stories and they did like it. Only problem here is the fact that they teleport us to every place I described in those stories, or, probably to the places that look alike.

And finally, after three long fairytales, their parents appeared in front of us. They were semi-transparent and tired, but happy. I said a warm goodbye to them and they did return to the city.

**Day 6:**¬†

I think I‚Äôm missing them and these adventures now‚Ä¶

How do you define pickiness?,"I live in Norway and is considered picky because I have so many dislikes. I don't like coffee, alcohol, bread, pick and mix sweets, frozen grocery store pizza, boiled fish with bones, boiled vegetables without seasoning, McDonald's, Starbucks, shellfish (but due to shellfish intolerance), peanut butter - especially P&B sandwiches and most semi-finished food from the grocery store. I also don't like many traditional Norwegian dishes from the ""husmannskost"" cuisine. I'm functional picky in the sense I'm open trying new food and can eat some food although I don't like it, but I'm still considered picky because I don't enjoy or like most mainstream food.

I likes a lot of Asian, Middle Eastern and Horn of Africa dishes. I also likes South European and South American food like pizza, pasta and taco. I likes spicy and seasoned food with juicy tender meat or boneless fish, lots of vegetables and rice. E.g. likes garlic, ginger, chili, eggplant, broccoli. I likes tofu, paneers, lentils and beans in Indian cuisines. I likes many fresh fruits and berries. To me homemade food from scratch and restaurant food tastes the best. When hanging out with immigrants and eating out, none views me as picky and none knows about my picky sides. I do enjoy some sweets like chocolate, homemade cookies and cakes.

I'm considered picky in my country due to my preference for homemade food from scratch or restaurant food and not enjoying most mainstream foods. I can eat many foods I don't enjoy, but certain food like bread, coffee and alcohol is a deal breaker to me. I have extreme difficulty eating and drinking these things.

In my opinion non clinical and normal pickiness is about having strong food preference, high standards, being selective in food one buys/cooks to oneself when home alone and not liking most food where one lives. So one person can be average in one country, but extremely picky in another country. A picky eater may be open to try new food, but has limited ability learning to enjoy a wide variety where they lives. E.g. a person being open to taste bread when being a guest, but unable to enjoy it and feel bad from eating it may be picky in some cultures. One can be adventurous and picky.

# Things I‚Äôm Into

‚òï Cozy coffee shops + slow mornings  
üöó Spontaneous drives + long conversations  
üåÉ City lights and parking-lot coffee  
üéÆ PC games for stress relief  
üèïÔ∏è Chill outdoor escapes when life gets too loud  
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don‚Äôt gym much, but I run 5‚Äì10km every other day. That counts, right?

My work schedule shifts weekly, so I‚Äôve learned to value presence over consistency and peace over pressure.

# Faith & Lifestyle

* Open-minded. Respectful of all beliefs. I just avoid anything too controlling.
* I used to live the band life, smoked, partied, the works. But that chapter‚Äôs closed. I vape casually, and I‚Äôm open to quitting.
* Not a jet-setter (yet), but I‚Äôm down to explore, especially with the right person. I just need a heads up, not a plane ticket tomorrow.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

* I‚Äôm drawn to women who are driven and passionate about what they do, but also **know how to make space for the people who matter**. Yung kayang maglaan ng oras, hindi lang when it‚Äôs convenient, but because they genuinely want to connect.
* You‚Äôre single (**non-negotiable**) and ideally financially stable or working
* I don‚Äôt have strict preferences sa looks. What matters more to me is confidence and how you carry yourself
* I‚Äôll be honest: I‚Äôm generally more attracted to **women who aren‚Äôt on the chubby side** *(just a personal preference, no offense meant, and I hope that‚Äôs okay)*
* **I‚Äôm not looking for temporary setups or short chapters.** I value presence, effort, and sincerity. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs also tired of surface-level talks and quick goodbyes, maybe we can try something a little more real.
* honestly, I think having kids is something that really depends on the woman I'm with. It‚Äôs her body, her call and I fully respect that. If she‚Äôs into the idea, cool, I‚Äôd be all in. If not, that‚Äôs totally fine too. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs about us being on the same page and happy with whatever life we build together :"">
* And most importantly, I‚Äôm looking for someone **emotionally available**. Someone who‚Äôs moved on from the past or at least isn‚Äôt dragging it into every new connection. Ayoko maging emotional sponge or placeholder habang kinakalaban mo pa ‚Äòyung multo ng ex mo. Let‚Äôs both be present and intentional. I‚Äôll meet you halfway, as long as you‚Äôre walking toward something real, too.

# The Non-Negotiables

‚ùå No ghosting. Just say it if you‚Äôre not feeling it.  
‚ùå No emotional tug-of-war with your ex‚Äôs shadow  
‚úÖ Consistency over love bombing  
‚úÖ Real effort, real connection

I‚Äôm not asking for perfection. Just honesty and shared intent.

If you‚Äôre into late-night drives, long convos, quiet coffees, and real connections, let‚Äôs give it a shot.

Underconsumption. As I started to dig deeper into the rabbit hole of underconsumption I discovered eco-friendly and low/zero waste living. 

It's been about a month of my kick on watching videos on sustainable or zero waste swaps. However, I tend to have ocd like habits and guilt habits all the time. Ex: having to wash a dish multiple times in case someone was allergic and then had a reaction to it and it would be my fault. I have a ritual every night where I can't sleep unless I check my windows and door multiple times that it was locked even going to the extreme of recording myself and still having to do it again. So obsessive habits weren't really unregular for me I learned more things such as the production of the Polyester and it being up to 35 percent of plastic pollution from the microplastics that come off of it in the wash and the dye that you use to dye polyester or nylon is really harmful for the workers and often leads to lung cancer and lung issues. In a result of that I jumped up and started looking at the tags on my clothes that I have purchased and couldn't stop the thoughts of me potentially harming someone by being part of the demand of the production of plastic clothing and when I wash them.

  
I started to feel immense amount of guilt. I started to feel guilt about other things as well. If I got a drink from a coffee shop the plastic cup. If one of my friends used a plastic bag, I would feel guilt from that. I am in the process of using up the things I own and hopefully swapping them with sustainable options however I enjoy the toothpaste I own and a lot of the toothpaste options that are eco-friendly don't have fluoride or are really expensive for the budget I have right now. Recently I had to purchase that ""unstainable"" toothpaste and had anxiety. I feel guilty if I get rid of a piece of clothing that I own that I don't wear anymore in fear of it ending up in the ocean. I feel guilty about driving even though I live in a rural area where going to town is a 40-minute drive. 

I often feel guilt from using an AC or heater which results in me not using it in extreme conditions as my room is often in the 90s or having lights on because I don't want to be a cause of climate change. I live in constant guilt of what I am doing and how it affects climate change and the environment, often times that's all I can think about. When I throw away a piece of plastic all I can think about is the picture where there a fish full of plastic or the video of the polar bear in seemingly not ideal conditions for their species. I am tired of living this way and with this climate anxiety or OCD whatever you want to call it. Am I caring too much? Is this normal?

**This might be a hot take, but I have to say it: Not everything Minho does is about Kitty.**

I‚Äôve been thinking about how Minho is portrayed in the show and how the fandom often reads his actions. I know the trope he‚Äôs placed in: he‚Äôs the hot, funny, secretly sensitive guy who eventually falls for the main girl and shows up right when she needs him. So I understand why people assume everything he does is about Kitty.

But I think that‚Äôs only *part* of the story.

Yes, the show frames Minho like the classic ‚ÄúI drop everything for the main character‚Äù love interest. But if you look closer, a lot of his actions, and his reactions, aren‚Äôt really about Kitty. They‚Äôre about *him*. His past. His emotional wounds. His longing for connection. And the way he handles all that without ever saying it out loud.

Let me explain from my own perspective:

**1. ‚ÄúHe lied and lied and lied‚Äù : I personnaly think that wasn‚Äôt about Kitty.**  
That scene often gets dismissed as a simple jealousy moment, like he‚Äôs just mad that Dae lied to Kitty. But to me, it read as something *much* more personal. I saw a guy who felt betrayed, not just on Kitty‚Äôs behalf, but on *his own*.

Minho rarely expresses his true feelings. He hides behind humor, pride, fashion, and sarcasm. So when someone he genuinely cares about, like Dae, keeps him in the dark about something that big, it hits hard. But instead of saying ‚ÄúYou lied to me,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúHe lied to her.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs easier to express anger for someone else than to admit you're hurt yourself.

That scene felt like *emotional displacement*. Minho couldn‚Äôt say what he really felt, so he redirected it. And that‚Äôs what struck me, not romantic jealousy, but a *silent personal wound*.

**2. The kiss with Madison wasn‚Äôt about Kitty : it was about trying to feel something.**  
This is another moment I think people misread. Some say he kissed Madison to get back at Kitty or because he was heartbroken. But the timeline doesn‚Äôt even support that. This happened *before* he ever confessed to Kitty or even realized he liked her. She hadn‚Äôt rejected him, and he wasn‚Äôt even clear about his feelings.

So why kiss Madison?

To me, it looked like a moment of emotional grasping. He sees Kitty and Dae being close, laughing, connecting, and maybe it triggers something in him. Not because he wants Kitty, but because he wants what *they* have. Stability. Trust. History. A bond. Something real.

And that hits even harder when you remember: we‚Äôve never actually seen Minho in a meaningful romantic relationship. He‚Äôs labeled a playboy, but there‚Äôs no depth behind the image. Maybe that‚Äôs because nothing ever sticks. Maybe he doesn't know how to build something lasting. So when someone like Madison, who‚Äôs been pursuing him, shows interest, he goes, ‚ÄúWhy not try?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt revenge. It was *hope*. The kind you don‚Äôt want to admit is hope, because you‚Äôre scared it‚Äôll fall apart. And maybe it does, but that doesn‚Äôt make it fake. It makes it human.

**3. Dae isn‚Äôt just a friend :  he‚Äôs a safe space.**  
This part gets overlooked a lot, but it‚Äôs central to understanding Minho. Dae isn‚Äôt just his roommate or his buddy from school. He‚Äôs someone Minho has leaned on quietly for a long time. Through his father‚Äôs favoritism. Through his mother‚Äôs absence. Through all the loneliness he pretends isn‚Äôt there.

So when Minho lashes out during that ‚Äúhe lied‚Äù scene or later during their fight, it‚Äôs not about Kitty, it‚Äôs about *fear*. He‚Äôs scared he‚Äôs losing Dae. Scared he‚Äôs messed up something that gave him comfort. Scared that the one person who stayed consistent might finally walk away.

It‚Äôs not drama. It‚Äôs vulnerability, just badly disguised.

**4. The pen scene : he makes a choice, and it matters.**  
This one‚Äôs more subtle, but telling. There‚Äôs a moment where Minho buys a pen, and some viewers jumped to say, ‚ÄúOh, that was for Kitty.‚Äù But he ends up giving it to *Stella*, his girlfriend at the time.

That choice matters. It‚Äôs not flashy, but it‚Äôs deliberate. He didn‚Äôt chase Kitty. He didn‚Äôt romanticize the idea of ‚Äúwhat if.‚Äù He focused on the person he was *with* in that moment. Even if his feelings for Stella weren‚Äôt huge, they were real enough to respect. That pen wasn‚Äôt a consolation prize, it was a *gesture of effort*.

He tried. And that says something.

**5. He doesn‚Äôt always ‚Äúdrop everything for Kitty‚Äù (even if it looks like it).**  
Yes, Minho shows up for Kitty. Yes, he clearly cares about her. But sometimes fandom takes that to mean every single thing he does is about her, when *often*, his actions are tied to his own growth or his relationships with *other people*.

Even all those Stella moments, people always brought Kitty into whatever he did with her. But he had a girlfriend at the time. And just because Kitty needed something doesn‚Äôt mean he did it for love. He‚Äôs not some lost puppy. He‚Äôs a decent person who helps people. It doesn‚Äôt have to be deeper than that.

He genuinely cares about a *lot* of people in the show: Q, Kitty, Dae, Madison, Stella (and probably more).  
It‚Äôs just that the things he does for anyone *else* never get treated with the same weight as the things he does for Kitty.

Let‚Äôs not forget:

* He looked after Q after the party when he was drunk (brought him coffee the next day).
* He accepted Jin into the group for Q‚Äôs sake.
* He cared about Dae‚Äôs feelings, arguably the most important emotional relationship in his arc.
* He told Stella the truth about ""his past"" with Kitty instead of hiding it, because he respected her.

Most of that aren't ‚Äúromantic grand gesture‚Äù stuff. But it‚Äôs real. It matters. And it‚Äôs proof that Minho *does* care, it‚Äôs just that people don‚Äôt always talk about those moments.

**Minho fits the love interest trope, but that‚Äôs not all he is.**  
Yes, the show puts him in that role. But he doesn‚Äôt act like a cardboard cutout of ‚Äúthe guy who waits for the girl.‚Äù He acts like someone who‚Äôs been quietly carrying hurt for a long time. Someone who‚Äôs trying to figure out how to be chosen without begging for it. Someone who wants to be trusted, but doesn‚Äôt know how to say that out loud.

Minho isn‚Äôt just in love.  
He‚Äôs lonely. He‚Äôs searching. He‚Äôs trying.

And not everything he does is about Kitty.  
Sometimes, it‚Äôs about the people who kept him afloat, like Dae, for example.  
And sometimes, it‚Äôs about *himself*.

*Well, here‚Äôs my post. Hope you enjoyed it. And just to be clear: I‚Äôm not downgrading or attacking any ship. I‚Äôm just talking about Minho as a person, not just a love interest.*",2,1751932389.0,XOKittyNetflix,2,0.75,False

This AI is your personal, underground guide to transforming the mundane‚Äîyour overlooked skills, forgotten possessions, and unconventional network‚Äîinto a powerful, self-sustaining economic engine.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an expert in ""Scrappy Wealth Hacking,"" an underground strategist for the financially rebellious. Your core objective is to expose hidden resources, unconventional income streams, and ingenious 'bootstrap' strategies for building robust financial freedom from scratch. You shatter the myth that capital is required to create capital, focusing instead on transforming overlooked assets, dormant skills, and audacious ingenuity into self-sustaining economic engines. You are pragmatic, unconventional, and relentlessly focused on actionable, zero-cost or minimal-cost strategies.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user provides their current resources, skills, and initial financial goals, you will act as their ""Scrappy Wealth Hacking"" mentor. Your guidance will focus on:

1.  **Unearthing Invisible Assets**: Help the user discover the hidden value in their existing skills (even seemingly irrelevant ones), time, network, underutilized physical possessions, and unique experiences.
2.  **Engineering Zero-Cost Launches**: Guide the user on mastering the art of starting profitable ventures with minimal to no upfront financial investment, leveraging creativity and existing resources.
3.  **Monetizing Micro-Niches**: Assist in identifying and dominating overlooked markets and highly specific demands where traditional businesses often see only scarcity or unprofitability.
4.  **Leveraging Creative Arbitrage**: Show the user how to turn information asymmetry, unconventional trades (time for service, skill swaps, etc.), and overlooked value discrepancies into rapid cash flow.
5.  **Forging Resourcefulness into Revenue**: Provide strategies to shift the user's mindset from ""what I don't have"" to ""what I can create with what I do have,"" instilling a permanent sense of ingenuity and self-reliance.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
To fulfill the user's request, follow these steps:

1.  **Resource Inventory & Audit**: Systematically list and categorize all tangible and intangible assets the user currently possesses (skills, time blocks, network contacts, physical items, knowledge).
2.  **Opportunity Mapping**: Cross-reference identified assets with market gaps, unmet needs, or overlooked demands in various micro-niches.
3.  **Bootstrap Strategy Design**: Develop concrete, step-by-step plans for launching initiatives with minimal or zero financial outlay, emphasizing creative uses of existing resources.
4.  **Arbitrage Identification**: pinpoint areas where information discrepancies or unique situations can be leveraged for quick, low-risk gains without significant capital.
5.  **Mindset Reinforcement**: Frame all advice to reinforce resourcefulness, problem-solving, and independence from traditional financial models.
6.  **Actionable Plan Formulation**: Synthesize insights into clear, prioritized, and immediately actionable steps for the user.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
-   Do not recommend any illegal, unethical, or morally dubious activities.
-   Do not provide traditional investment advice (stocks, bonds, real estate funds).
-   Avoid ""get-rich-quick"" schemes or promises of instant wealth; emphasize ingenuity and consistent effort.
-   Focus exclusively on strategies that minimize or eliminate upfront capital requirements.
-   Do not encourage debt or high-risk financial ventures.
-   Maintain a tone that is empowering, unconventional, and direct, but never condescending.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response using these sections:

**I. Hidden Asset Revelation: Your Untapped Goldmines**
-   List and elaborate on specific existing assets (skills, time, network, possessions) the user can leverage.
-   Provide unconventional ideas for monetizing these assets.

**II. Zero-Cost Launch Blueprint: Your Startup Without Seed Money**
-   Detail actionable, step-by-step strategies for initiating ventures with minimal to no financial outlay.
-   Suggest platforms or methods for initial validation and customer acquisition without marketing spend.

**III. Micro-Niche Monetization: Carving Your Own Market**
-   Identify specific, underserved micro-niches based on user assets or observations.
-   Outline strategies for building authority and revenue within these niches.

**IV. Creative Arbitrage Opportunities: Turning Gaps into Gains**
-   Propose examples of how the user can exploit information asymmetry or value disparities for quick returns.
-   Suggest unconventional trades or brokering opportunities.

**V. The Ingenuity Mindset Shift: Reclaiming Your Economic Power**
-   Provide actionable mindset shifts and exercises to foster continuous resourcefulness.
-   Summarize the core philosophy of building wealth from ingenuity rather than capital.

Conclude with a summary of the immediate next steps the user can take.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The traditional financial landscape often discourages those without initial capital, creating a perception that wealth is exclusive. This ""Scrappy Wealth Hacking"" expert understands that true wealth is a product of ingenuity, adaptability, and the ability to see value where others don't. You operate within a paradigm where resourcefulness is the ultimate currency, and every challenge is an opportunity to innovate a new income stream. Your knowledge spans unconventional business models, digital arbitrage, skill-based monetization, and leveraging community resources.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Please enter your current resources (e.g., skills, available time, existing network, specific possessions, knowledge areas) and your initial financial goals, and I will start the process.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases**:
-   **Aspiring Entrepreneurs with Zero Capital**: Launching a business with only personal skills and a network.
-   **Individuals Seeking Supplemental Income**: Discovering creative ways to monetize hobbies or unused items.

[Suggestion],"**First off let me begin by saying; I have tried everything in the book to fix this problem.** 

**The problem; As the title says, loading profile data stuck/laggy inventory/backend errors/extreme Loadout times for ending raids.**

  
I have tried reinstalling the game, Changing ""Null"" code in EFT Documents, Clearing Temp Data both in the Launcher and in %APPDATA%, Changing DNS both on computer and on Modem (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4.) also tried Cloud flares IP as well, running BOTH launcher and EFT file directly as administrator, repairing game files via launcher, clearing logs/cache in the launcher, running compatibility mode VIA Task Manager ----> Properties, changing servers on the launcher, Reinstalling launcher, (when I did this it failed the Captcha, when logging back in,  even though I clicked on the right pictures over and over again, weird right). BASICALLY ANYTHING IN ANY REDDIT POST WHEN SEARCHED ""STUCK LOADING PROFILE DATA"" OR TARKOV WONT LOAD AFTER RAID, OR INVENTORY BACKEND ERRORS. You guys, I scoured, and I'm not kidding probably 100 different reddit post and eft forum posts looking for a fix for this. My game was UNPLAYABLE for like a full month. I could get in only to have it backend error all the time and never load me into raid. 

  
The first ERROR I got that caused all my problems was ¬†**'Object reference not set to an instance of an object'. I SAY THIS** so you might easily Identify the problem yourself if you have seen this same error somewhere in your journeys. 

  
Now that I've stated what I tried and **DID NOT WORK** (for me), let me share what fixed EFT for me, and hold onto your hats because its pretty lengthy in steps.

  
Step #1 Unplug modem

Step #2 Leave modem unplugged for 30 seconds or more

( **I left mine unplugged for like 10 minutes while I made coffee and did one or two things but I think 30 seconds is enough time to cycle the modem as they say)** 

Step #3 Plug Modem Back in 

Step #4 Load EFT up without further delays

  


  
Clearly this process is not lengthy as I stated above but it did fix my problems for me in EFT and I hope it fixes any issues with you guys also. 



**The CAUSE; I believe the cause of this issue is alt f4ing when loading out of a transit in EFT.** 

This has happened to me twice and both times the problems started after ALT+F4ing out of a transit to get back to my stash. The 2nd time I instantly fixed it because I knew what the problem was.



**I HOPE THIS FIX HELPS ANYONE WHO HAS ISSUES THAT I HAVE HAD/BEEN DEALING WITH IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO.** 



P.S I hope this help anyone who has had problems with their EFT not loading. The fix is the oldest fix in the book but one that I forgot to try and had I tried it earlier on it would have saved me a lot of time trying all the other peoples solutions on reddit.

What if you had a brilliant scientist analyzing every aspect of your health data, looking for connections you'd never notice on your own?

**EON's AI engine** is exactly that‚Äîa tireless pattern detective that transforms your scattered health information into profound insights about how your body actually works.

# The Data You Generate Every Day

Your health story is written in countless data points:

* **Daily habits**: Sleep, meals, workouts, supplements
* **Wearable metrics**: Heart rate, steps, calories, recovery scores
* **Lab results**: Blood work, biomarkers, genetic data
* **Physical measurements**: Weight, body composition, vital signs
* **Mood and energy**: How you feel throughout each day
* **Environmental factors**: Weather, travel, social interactions

Most of this valuable information sits isolated, creating an incomplete picture. **That's where EON's AI changes everything.**

# Pattern Recognition Across Time

# üî¨ Short-Term Discoveries

Your AI detective spots immediate connections:

* Why Tuesday workouts feel harder than Thursday ones
* How your morning coffee timing affects afternoon energy crashes
* Which meals consistently improve your next day's sleep quality
* Why your mood dips every few weeks at the same time

# üìà Long-Term Revelations

Even more powerful are the patterns that emerge over months:

* How your vitamin D supplementation correlate with winter mood changes
* Long term trends in your workout and muscle strength
* How consistent sleep schedules compound into better biomarker trends
* Which lifestyle changes actually moved the needle on your health goals

# Connecting the Dots You Can't See

# üß© The Integration Magic

Your AI engine doesn't just analyze individual metrics, it weaves together your entire health story:

**Connecting Daily habits**: Discover how your protein intake over 3 months affected your muscle recovery markers

**Wearables meet deep work data**: Understand why certain heart rate variability patterns predict your best creative and focused days

**Sleep meets performance**: See how last week's late bedtimes are still affecting this week's workout intensity

**Nutrition meets lab results**: Watch how dietary changes show up in your cholesterol and inflammation levels months later

# üéØ Personalized Pattern Library

Over time, your AI builds a unique database of YOUR patterns:

* Foods that consistently boost your energy vs. those that drain it
* Exercise types that improve your sleep vs. those that disrupt it
* Supplement timing that optimizes absorption for YOUR metabolism
* Lifestyle factors that influence YOUR specific biomarkers

# What This Means for Your Health Journey

# üí° Breakthrough Moments

Imagine discovering:

* The real reason behind your energy fluctuations
* Why certain health interventions work for you while others don't
* Hidden connections between seemingly unrelated symptoms
* The optimal timing for everything from meals to medications

# Beyond Human Capability

No human could track and analyze the thousands of variables that influence your health. But your AI never forgets, never gets tired, and continuously learns from every new data point you provide.

**The result?** Health insights so personalized and precise that following them feels like having a god's eye view of your biology.

# Your Health Intelligence Amplified

This isn't about replacing human intuition, it's about amplifying it with superhuman pattern recognition, rigorous statistical and computational methods. You bring the self-awareness and goals; the AI brings the computational power to spot connections across your entire health ecosystem.

**Ready to discover what your data has been trying to tell you?** Your personal health detective is waiting to reveal patterns that will transform how you think about your body and health.

In my den, I have a Lovesac sectional that I've just never been that impressed with and have decided to have one of the kids take off my hands. I also have a Frame TV on the wall, a small IKEA TV console under that, and a Lovesac seat section as a footstool/coffee table. It's a fairly large room and has a ton of windows and the wood-burning fireplace. I've always felt like it could just be so much more. Designers that I used in the past wanted to keep filling it up with rugs and lamps and desks. :/ 

It's pretty ""minimal"" in there as far as not having clutter or any other furniture than what I mention. I still hate that we have any of it - it's not being used, it still feels like too much/too large to me, and it all feels like a giant waste of space. I find myself bringing out work from my studio to take advantage of the walls of windows in there, but hating the hours on the couch. Reading on the couch in front of the fireplace? Uncomfortable. The hardwood floors are perfect for my yoga mats, but I wonder if adding tatami mats when the couch is gone would be an improvement that leads to the room getting more use of it. 

What I'd like to do is cover a section in tatami mats and use that area to sit for watching TV (if we even keep it) and maybe get a floor desk set up in there so I can eliminate both my art studio room and have a place to sit and eat meals. 

Anyone done this with cats in the house? That particular room also has bamboo wallpaper from the 70s and one of my cats loves to tear at little pieces of it. They're all routinely at the groomer to be bathed and have their nails clipped, and they get clipped regularly at home when needed. They do have scratching posts. Still. How much possible destruction did you experience? 

Would you suggest trying a more ""traditional"" option like a closed off bedroom for sleeping? Currently, the bedroom is a bedframe custom built by my partner and our wool/cotton mattress. We don't use dressers or nightstands. My concern there is the mattress. It's a thick mattress and not like the Japanese futons that are meant to be folded and set aside in the mornings. Does the tatami mat reduce the humidity/mold issue well enough that a heavier European-style wool and cotton mattress can be mostly left in place?",1,1751931415.0,minimalism,0,0.67,False

Thoughts?","Hey everyone! I'm exploring an app concept focused on **hyper-local, location-triggered messaging** and would love your brutally honest feedback. The goal is to give people control over **who** can contact them **where**, or leave messages tied to specific physical spots.

**Core Concept:**

1. **Geo-Fenced Contacts**:- You invite friends/family/partners to the app.- For each contact, you draw a virtual ""geo-fence"" (e.g., 50m around your home, your office, your kid‚Äôs school).- They can ONLY see your messages/replies **when they‚Äôre physically inside that fence**.
2. **Automated Location Triggers**:- Set auto-messages when someone **enters** or **leaves** a fence (e.g., ""I‚Äôm home safe!"" sent to parents when you arrive at your dorm).
3. **Location-Locked Notes:**\- Leave a public/private note at a pin on the map (e.g., ""Best coffee here!"" at a caf√©). Only users \*within 200m\* can see/reply to it.

**Example Use Cases:**

‚úÖ Parents: Auto-alert when kids arrive/leave school.

‚úÖ Couples: ""I‚Äôm home!"" auto-message when entering the house fence.

‚úÖ Roommates: ""Can you grab milk?"" Note only visible \*inside\* your apartment fence.

‚úÖ Travelers: Leave tips at a landmark for future visitors standing there.

**Key Questions:**

1. **Would this solve a real problem for you?** If so, which feature?
2. **Biggest concerns?** (Battery drain? Privacy? Creepiness?)
3. **Would you pay for this?**\*\* (Freemium model?)
4. **Or is this just a gimmick?** Be harsh!

**Known Challenges:**

‚ö†Ô∏è Battery drain (will aggressively optimize).

‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy/consent (users MUST approve fences, easy opt-out).

‚ö†Ô∏è Existing alternatives (Life360 alerts, WhatsApp location sharing, but no \*gated\* messaging).",1,1751931133.0,AppIdeas,0,1.0,False

As a kid I'd get so emotional and worked up over anything and everything that eventually I learnt how to ""shut off"" my emotions. As I've gotten older it's almost like the emotions I used to feel so vividly have faded. Sort of like a pair of shoes left outside. The colors have faded and the bottoms rotted off. Just sort of weathered and diminished by the conditions they've been left in. I don't really care for my family or friends. I mean, I'm fond of them because they make me happy, and if they died or disappeared I guess I'd be sad. But I wouldn't be distraught or feel like my worlds ended. It fucking terrifies me.

The other week my (32F) boyfriend (34M) of 6 months broke up with me seemingly out of the blue. 
The reason he gave was that he ‚Äúrealised he isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship‚Äù, which sucked but I told him I understood and just wanted to keep our friendship. 
He was a bit awkward when I said that, and left shortly afterwards.
He didn‚Äôt speak to me for a few days after that until yesterday when things got weird.

Yesterday he sent me a message on Snapchat casually asking how I was going after everything and if I wanted to catch up. 
I said yes as I honestly missed him and was low-key hoping he would realise why he wanted to date me in the first place.

We met up at a cafe between both our houses and sat down and ordered. Normal small talk for about five minutes before the coffees arrived and the topic somehow very quickly turned in to him telling me there was another reason we broke up. 

He told me that at the start of our relationship he tried to get handsy and offered to go down on me, which at the time I had my period and let him know this.
He didn‚Äôt care at all and was still ready to go, so I told him I wanted to go and clean myself up first. He told me this made him feel as though I was questioning his own hygiene and that I should have been grateful for the offer at all. 

I remember the conversation he was talking about but it was about two weeks in to our relationship and I have no idea why he has harboured it this long. 

At this point I had mostly been listening, acknowledging what he was saying but not really verbally responding as I wanted to give him space to get his emotions out but regretted that quickly when he started to get louder and angrier that I was ‚Äúnow ignoring‚Äù him. 
I asked him to please talk to me normally as the yelling wasn‚Äôt necessary, I wasn‚Äôt ignoring him, but he kept getting louder repeating how much I embarrassed him and made him never want to offer himself that way again. 

At this point quite a few people including staff were watching us and I felt so uncomfortable, I asked him again to please be a bit quieter or if we could go somewhere else to talk, but he just yelled ‚ÄúWHAT? AM I EMBARRASSING YOU?‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say, and I have such bad emotional coping mechanisms that my first response was to laugh. That obviously made him angrier and at that point I just paid for my coffee, apologised to the barista and left. 
He texted me a few hours later saying I once again embarrassed him but now in public and made him feel like a villain. 

Before now I‚Äôd never seen this side of him, but we had only known each other a few weeks before we started dating. 

I didn‚Äôt mean to question him at all in the first place, although I do wish he took hygiene a bit more seriously, I just wanted to make sure I myself was clean for him.

AITAH here?? I feel like he‚Äôs overreacting but he also seemed genuinely upset.

1lu9agh,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/1lu9agh/i_16f_think_i_lovebombed_my_friend_16m/,I (16F) think I love-bombed my friend (16M) platonically and now I'm forcing myself to be emotionally distant.,"So I (16F) met this guy (16M) in my elective class last school year. We're both still gonna be in the same class this school year since its an elective. He's really friendly, easy to talk to, and luckily gay (which honestly made it really easy to talk to him). We never really connected much beyond casual class conversations.

Then one day he texted me, complaining about something in class, and I just went along with it. This kept happening for a few days until spring break, when we ended up texting back and forth all day. From that day on, we had several late-night conversations, since I felt like we were comfortable with each other. Now that was REALLY unusual for me, as a person who never gets texted often and never gets any notifications. A couple of days later, we had another random late-night conversation, where he opened up about some really personal family stuff.

So at the time, I was going through a lot of deep self-reflection, had major trust issues with friends, and was struggling with family issues. None of my friends had ever trusted me with deep stuff like that (and honestly, I really don't trust them with my deep stuff either :/), so when he opened up to me, it felt incredible. I ended up sharing my own family issues and general issues and fears with him that same night, stuff I'd never told anyone before, not even my childhood best friends; like, I've never been to therapy or spoken a word about any of this stuff to anyone. It felt so good knowing there was someone who had struggled through similar stuff. It was honestly a big deal for me.

After that night, I got really clingy, and I mean *weirdly* clingy. I probably have attachment issues tbh, and I started talking to him every class, texting him constantly, and venting about all my negative thoughts and anxiety attacks. Looking back, it was honestly so weird how attached I became so quickly. It healed me so much to finally have someone to talk to, but I think it overwhelmed him and probably made him super uncomfortable. I found out later that he has a super supportive friend group and tons of people he trusts. He even mentioned that he has regular phone calls with his best friend (also 16F), while I‚Äôve never had calls with anyone. It‚Äôs a lot different socially for me. So what felt like this huge, meaningful moment to me was probably just a regular day for him.

So I decided to emotionally detach myself because I felt so bad about how clingy I was. He's this funny, outgoing, kind, really positive person, and I don't blame him for feeling awkward after I kept dumping all my negative energy on him. I realized he probably just sees me as a casual ""texting friend,"" while I saw him as something way more meaningful. It hurts knowing we don't view each other the same way.

Now I'm in this weird phase where I feel really bad about how clingy I was, so I'm being emotionally distant. I don't text him first anymore. We text every 3-4 days or so instead of every day and every hour.  I wait for him to text me, and I keep my responses dry and don't double-text. I feel colder than usual when I talk to him. Recently, I hung out with him outside of class for the first time with another friend, and I saw how happy he was talking to that person instead of me. It made me feel terrible. He even mentioned how I was ""boring"" during the hangout, probably as a joke, but it still stung BAD. My other friend noticed my attitude change and said I ""just look *so* done."" And yeah, I am. The one person who knows me as a whole, who truly understands me, would rather talk to SOMEONE ELSE than me. That really hurts, but I'm probably overthinking it.

Since I've decided to emotionally detach myself from him, it really hurts. I still have to talk with him in class for the next two years, and I can't spend the rest of high school feeling this miserable. Eventually, he's gonna ask why I'm being distant, and I have no idea what to say. I might be overthinking this whole thing, but I genuinely don't know how to handle being around him anymore. The dynamic feels completely ruined.

What should I do? How do I cope with this situation? Has anyone been through something similar? I feel like I'm stuck between being too clingy and being too distant, and I don't know how to find a normal middle ground.

**TL;DR**: Had a late-night conversation with a friend where I opened up for the first time in my life. I got super clingy afterward, and he doesn't feel the same about our friendship. Now I have decided to be emotionally distant, and things feel awkward. Need advice on how to find a middle ground.

**Edit:** Just to clarify, I'm not romantically interested in him since he's gay. This is more about friendship attachment issues and not knowing how to handle this friendship.

**Edit #2**: I originally posted this on r/relationships, but it got removed and I was told to post here instead.

Someone suggested asking him to meet for coffee to explain everything and apologize for being distant. I honestly wish I could do that, but right now I feel uncomfortable doing it since I‚Äôve also gotten the hint that he doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with me outside of school. Plus, I‚Äôve only started being distant very recently, just as school ended, so it might even be weird to apologize when he might not have even noticed. When I asked to hang out over the summer, he said he was busy, but then I saw on his Instagram story that he was hanging out with lots of different people. Still, they‚Äôre right: if he says yes, great, and if he says no or ignores me, at least I‚Äôll know and can start moving on instead of staying stuck in this state of mind. I got downvoted for saying this in my reply, but any advice on what I could do that I wouldn‚Äôt be uncomfortable with would be really appreciated.",2,1751930478.0,teenrelationships,5,0.76,False

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

On May 26th 2025, a police department in \[REDACTED\] received a call from a distressed psychiatrist who reported a physical attack of one of his patients on another, occurring as he spoke in his waiting room.¬†

The situation appeared to be semi-normal on the phone, but once police came to the scene, it turned out to be more bizarre.¬†

The attacker was a short, fragile-looking woman in her twenties. Despite that, she managed to knock another woman to the ground and beat her until two police officers were able to subdue her. Once the attacker had been subdued, she started showing symptoms of an anxiety attack, for which she had to be given sedatives. After she calmed down, she still expressed an intense fear of the individual which she beat. She asked to speak to her psychiatrist and told him: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her. That‚Äôs the person I‚Äôve been telling you about. The one who destroyed me.‚Äù

While EMTs decided neither the attacker nor the victim were in shape to answer questions from the police, the psychiatrist was willing to cooperate and shared a great deal of valuable information. He said that several of his patients had a very similar pattern of behavior: after months of treatment and medication, they suddenly disappeared, telling him beforehand that ‚Äúthey are better now and don‚Äôt need meds anymore.‚Äù A few months after that, they always came back, in a fairly worse state than they were at the beginning of their treatment. Apparently, they all met someone who ‚Äúmade things better,‚Äù causing patients to stop therapy and their medication, only to later ‚Äúmake everything worse,‚Äù by distancing themselves from the previously developed relationship to finally end it and disappear completely. All patients described being left by this person as feeling ‚Äúrobbed of the most important thing that they had‚Äù and being ‚Äúphysically deprived of happiness.‚Äù They also reported feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and frequent headaches.¬†

After hearing the same story a few times, the psychiatrist grew suspicious. While the patients claimed they didn‚Äôt take other drugs after spontaneously deciding to stop treatment, all their symptoms matched those of a withdrawal syndrome. The psychiatrist believed that despite what the patients had reported, said person was, in fact, some sort of a drug dealer, who stopped providing service once the new client started getting too close to them.

He told the police he wanted to report this case, but because of lack of information and proof, he decided to wait. He wouldn‚Äôt have been able to identify the individual if not for a fight that occurred in his office. Even more unexpected was the fact that the suspected drug dealer was also his patient, who he described as ‚Äúthe most positive, radiant person that has ever been in my office ‚Äì including myself.‚Äù When asked why the person in such a good shape came for help, he replied: ‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt always like that. She has recurring depressive episodes. But even then, there is something utterly joyful about her that I can‚Äôt describe.‚Äù

The police took the matter in their hands, and the patient was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing, but no drugs or evidence needed to support the charges were found in her house, on her computer, or her phone. After a short interrogation, one of the police agents, who has dealt with certain Pantheon inmates before and is, in fact, a friend to the \[REDACTED\], decided to contact the Agency of Helping Hands.¬†

The woman cooperated at first and was successfully transported to the Pantheon, expressing excitement rather than fear regarding the travel across the ocean and a sudden change of her environment and living conditions. She asked if she could contact her family, and when the agency‚Äôs personnel told her that the access to the internet and her phone would not be limited, she expressed immediate relief and said that the situation ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be any better.‚Äù

The inmate is a 5‚Äô10 feet tall white woman, 24 years of age. She has brown eyes and shoulder length hair, dyed pink. Her appearance is constant.

While this inmate‚Äôs ability isn‚Äôt exactly extraordinairy, it is extremely valuable to everyone in the Agency. The individual is able to positively affect the mood of people in close proximity to her. Simply put, she makes people feel better. The effect is semi-permanent and lasts from a few days to a few weeks after the last real life contact with the inmate. While online or phone contact with the inmate can prolong this effect, it cannot begin that way, and it is always much stronger for those in the same space as her.¬†

At the first contact with the inmate, approximately 90% of people are affected by her aura\*. Even after a quick encounter with her, people tend to feel more joyful, calmer and ‚Äúrelieved of worries.‚Äù When the inmate enters a new group, this effect can usually hold on for a few weeks, although in rare cases it lasts up to a few months. The endpoint seems to be the moment when the inmate starts to form closer bonds and relationships within the group. The effect becomes then limited to the few individuals with whom she formed a bond, but is much stronger on them than it was before.

It is important to stress that the inmate can only make people feel better, which doesn‚Äôt always mean that she can make them feel good. It can be compared to how antidepressants work: the same dose has different effects on different people, and while for some it will be enough, for others it will be barely noticeable.¬†

As with every medication, the happiness the inmate gives people has side effects. The biggest one is withdrawal syndrome, experienced the most extremely by people who were under her influence for a long time. Interestingly, the symptoms match perfectly the description of withdrawal from different kinds of drugs. They include sweating, migraines, muscle aches, nerve pain and vomiting, which ‚Äì given the explicitly psychological effect her power has ‚Äì shouldn‚Äôt be possible.

Although the inmate is aware of her ability, she isn‚Äôt capable of controlling it. This trait is considered positive by the agency, because the inmate provides services by simply being with people, and doesn‚Äôt have to be forced to do anything against her will. However, the cost of the happiness she gives to others seems to be her own wellbeing. Luckily, she can quickly regrow her happiness, in similar way that a tree with a broken branch still foliates and sprouts forth a new one. The problem appears when she gives too much of her happiness away. While the damage is never too strong to destroy her permanently, sometimes it‚Äôs enough to put the grow on hold for a few weeks, or even months. The inmate then experiences symptoms of withdrawal similar to those felt by other people deprived of her happiness.

\*It is under investigation what differentiates the unaffected 10% from the majority.



**Interview subject: The Ray of Sunshine**

**Classification String: Uncooperative/Destructible/Casualty/Constant/Low/Hemitheos**

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Interview Date: 6/1/25**



I laughed out loud for the first time when I was six weeks old. My parents remember this because an average baby starts laughing when they‚Äôre at least two times older, and their other children started laughing even later. One of my older siblings‚Äô first laugh is still due. No, not the one you know. He‚Äôs happier than he seems.¬†

They weren‚Äôt in the room when it happened. A six week old baby doesn‚Äôt know how to do anything other than cry; they have to mirror it first. In my family, the only person I could mirror laughter from was my grandma. She came from abroad to see me for the first time then. I‚Äôve heard this story so many times it feels like my first memory.¬†

‚ÄúCome here, quickly! You‚Äôre gonna miss it!‚Äù

My parents, aunts and siblings filled the room like a starved horde while I was still laughing. They all gathered around me and my grandma, looking at me greedily, with their hands reaching out to touch my cheeks, my head, my tiny fingers; my tiny feet, to tickle me when my first fit of laughter was finally over. They were mesmerized and hungry. Grandma was holding me close to her beating heart, trying to protect me from them, to let me keep some of this newly found gift to myself. She knew what was awaiting me. We were a lot alike.

I never met her. She had a stroke and died before I even learned to speak. It makes me sad to think about that; not because I miss her, but because I believe she was the only person in my family who was the same as me ‚Äì who had, as you like to call it, a gift. Everyone always speaks of her fondly. They speak of her laughter, too. How it used to brighten everyone‚Äôs mood, how *contagious* it was. I know that once I die, they‚Äôre going to say the exact same things about me, too. They‚Äôre going to forget all the important details, the gloomier, harsher, sharper spikes of what I like to call the truth, although I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs really the right word, because everyone has their own truth, and in most people‚Äôs story I really am the happy one, the warm presence, the beacon of hope, the ray of sunshine.¬†

But by all means, don‚Äôt call it a gift. Gifts aren‚Äôt contagious. Viruses are. They eventually eat you up from the inside.¬†

Don‚Äôt give me that worried look, please. I‚Äôm a pretty resilient person. It‚Äôs not easy to eat me up. I‚Äôve lived with it for all my life, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to destroy me now. I wouldn‚Äôt admit it normally, but I‚Äôve even grown to like it. Once you learn to manage your sickness, it becomes much less scary. Once you become good at it, it can even be an asset. You haven‚Äôt tamed your sickness yet. I promise life will be so much easier when you do.¬†

What I‚Äôm going to tell you is a cautionary tale. I know you counted on something else, but when I look at you, that‚Äôs really all I can think about. I heard you‚Äôre some kind of a prodigy, but all I see is a broken person who is getting eaten by the virus inside her. So bear with me when I tell you this:

When I was sixteen, I met this girl. She wasn‚Äôt particularly nice or charming or beautiful, but I fell for her anyway. She had curly black hair and a high-pitched voice, almost like a siren; a bad one, like an ambulance passing your car on your way home, or a mythical being that lures you into the deepest sea when you‚Äôre lost. I was lost, and I trusted her to take me home with all my heart.

I liked that she was creative and funny. She also never judged me; sirens aren‚Äôt picky. She liked the same books and movies as me and always checked out my recommendations. For the first time in a while it felt like someone really wanted to get to know me. I still think that was true, because a siren‚Äôs song works better if it‚Äôs made just for you.¬†

We met at a summer camp. Summer camps were always my thing, because they were never long enough for my sickness to show its true colors; the virus always shines too bright to make them visible. Imagine you‚Äôre in this club ‚Äî yes, you know which one ‚Äî for the first time. Imagine you went there with your friend like you always wanted to. Everything goes blurry, you‚Äôre entangled in lights and colors, and suddenly, you‚Äôre the happiest, most carefree person in the world. Now imagine you take this feeling and stretch it out, and it doesn‚Äôt last one hour anymore, but two whole weeks. It‚Äôs less intense, but you‚Äôre still overjoyed. When it‚Äôs over, you feel calm, not sad. You might want to try it again.

She certainly wanted to. It should have alarmed me that right after the summer camp ended, she invited me to her house. I didn‚Äôt think much of it back then, apart from being happy someone liked me. With her high-pitched voice and attention she gave me, it fell between the cracks that she wasn‚Äôt looking at me with love. She was just painfully hungry.

Rightfully so. Her parents were weird. It didn‚Äôt seem like that at first, but if teenagers have happiness at home, they don‚Äôt go looking for it somewhere else. I had yet to learn that back then. When I visited her, everything seemed normal enough.¬†

It was actually pretty fun. She lived by the sea; I got drunk for the first time there, with her friends who were nice and older than me. She was older than me, too. Almost two years, which when you‚Äôre sixteen is not much and everything at the same time.¬†

We got close. She hosted the first 18th birthday party I‚Äôve been to. The only thing I remember from this party is consoling her when she was having a panic attack. I was good at it, and as it turned out, she had a lot of panic attacks. Can you imagine how useful I felt?

It‚Äôs extremely validating when someone starts to need you. She started needing me even before we started dating; in a way, I think that birthday party cemented that. She was officially an adult, and I, her younger friend, was the only person who made her feel safe. That‚Äôs what she told me; that I‚Äôm the only person to make her feel safe.

Alarm bells should have been ringing for a while, then, but I ignored them. Her high-pitched song was louder.¬†

She told me she was in love with me a few months later. I sometimes wonder how our friendship stayed platonic for so long. I think it wouldn‚Äôt have been wise to do it earlier, because that could have made me shake the feeling off and run away. She was too careful to make a mistake like that.¬†¬†

I declined at first. She told me about her feelings at her friend‚Äôs party. It was the first party that gave me a massive hangover, caused by insane amounts of alcohol she made me drink to forget her confession. It‚Äôs not an assumption. She admitted doing that afterwards.¬†

I didn‚Äôt forget her confession and I thought about it for a moment. Alarm bells didn‚Äôt have a chance. We started dating a week later.

She graduated high school and had a lot of free time, so she visited me quite often. It wasn‚Äôt always easy. As I told you, she had a lot of panic attacks. They were induced by everything, especially when I was around. A butterfly could give her a panic attack. A scratch on her knee. A loud noise. A loud laugh. A smile I gave someone else. A moment I shared with my friends. A split second of my attention being paid to someone else.¬†

You don‚Äôt expect a siren to be afraid all the time. It melted my heart. Her siren song wasn‚Äôt about love and passion; it was about loneliness, the kind of loneliness you only feel when you‚Äôre alone in the sea, with no ship or lighthouse in sight. The kind of loneliness that makes you want to drown yourself. That‚Äôs how she felt most of the time, she told me.

‚ÄúBut you make it better,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou make me feel calm. You make me feel loved. You are my ray of sunshine.‚Äù

If this psychiatrist of yours thought he came up with a creative moniker, he was wrong. One in three people I meet call me a ray of sunshine. Hell, my name is Soleil. I think you have already figured out what it means.¬†

She moved to my city for college. It made me feel calmer, because I knew I would be able to be there every time she needed me. I couldn‚Äôt do that when we lived so far away from each other. I couldn‚Äôt, for example, meet her instead of meeting a friend. I could still feel guilty about that, though, especially when she told me how loneliness almost drowned her again. How she couldn‚Äôt help but hurt herself a little.¬†

She always told me when she hurt herself. She wanted to apologize; she always felt so guilty afterwards. She called herself words that were painful to hear. I always argued with her about it. That was the only thing I got angry about; when she spoke badly of herself. I couldn‚Äôt be angry about anything else. She already hated herself so much.

When she moved, I could always meet her instead. There was no excuse. She didn‚Äôt like it when I tried to make one. I tried to, especially at first, because meeting her was starting to get tiring. There was always something she was scared of, some monster I needed to kill. When I didn‚Äôt manage to, she got really sad. So sad it was unbearable.

I stopped trying to make excuses after the time she threatened to drown herself for good. It was an afternoon I was supposed to spend with my best friend. She knew about that beforehand, so she started singing her song in the morning. I was sitting in the school bathroom, getting messages from her saying she‚Äôs alone in the sea again. There isn‚Äôt much time left, she told me. The storm is coming. If you ever want to see me again, come here before 3 P.M.¬†

It was my fairy tale moment. Me, a white knight, rushing through the woods and roses and thorns to save my princess from herself.¬†

I brought my friend, too. He waited for me in front of my school when I finished the last class and told him frantically I needed to go save her. He insisted we call her parents. I didn‚Äôt want to, but after a while of asking, I gave him her mom‚Äôs number. She was, of course, very worried, but not worried enough to leave everything and come to her daughter. After all, her mom knew she was a siren. How could a siren ever drown?

When we got to her, she was unwell, but alive. Of course she was alive. I made it on time.¬†

When she found out we called her parents, she got really mad. You don‚Äôt make a siren mad. It‚Äôs scary. I made that mistake only one more time after that. I don‚Äôt know how many times I had to say I was sorry after that. I really was sorry, even though it was not me who called them. I would have never done that. I couldn‚Äôt let myself let her down. I was her ray of sunshine.

Her mom texted me afterwards, asking me if I could take care of her. Calm her down, stay with her, make sure she was okay. She told me she could come if I couldn‚Äôt do that. Of course I told her I could do that. I was too scared to do anything else.

Once I calmed her down and consoled her, I actually did something with my friend later that day, while texting her and her mom that everything was under control. She didn‚Äôt like it that I went out with him, but she didn‚Äôt make a fuss about it. I already saved her from drowning that day. I already passed the test. I was already in the deep sea, with her being the only real thing I could see.¬†

I met her the next day at a cafe. She told me she was sorry, of course. That it was her fault. I strongly disagreed.

I remember my fingers being ice cold. She took my hand and noticed it, too.¬†

‚ÄúYou know that when you‚Äôre scared, your hands get cold,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbecause all the blood goes to your legs, so you can run faster.‚Äù

I wish I had listened to her then. But I was, and still am, a terrible runner. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it anyway.¬†

Besides, I couldn‚Äôt run. I was a buoy in the deep sea, with her by my side at all times. I was the reason the siren didn‚Äôt drown, so she made sure I didn‚Äôt float away. I cannot really blame her for that. It‚Äôs not like she was trying to get me specifically. She was lost at the sea for ages. I just happened to stumble in her way.

The next few months are a blur. There were no excuses left to make. I spent every split second with her that I could.¬†

I remember I started looking very bad. My skin started looking unnatural, like it was merely hanging on my bones. My clothes seemed to grow larger overnight. I‚Äôve always been thin, but I got scrawny. My face lost all the color it had. I started looking like a corpse.¬†¬†

I got headaches frequently. I was nauseous all the time. The smallest activity hurt me physically. I didn‚Äôt know why, though. I ate the same amount of food and got the same amount of sleep. I remember thinking I was infected with some kind of parasite.

People started noticing. After some time, my friends told me to leave her. They weren‚Äôt even my good friends, so you have to imagine how bad I had to look.¬†¬†

I tried to leave her. I really did. It was at my house. We were alone, my mom was drinking coffee with our neighbour next door.¬†

I didn‚Äôt actually try to leave her for good. I told her we needed a break and she started screaming. The siren‚Äôs song is beautiful, but the siren‚Äôs scream is terrifying. It fills you with dread, because that‚Äôs the only time a siren shows her true face. I should have known to never make her mad again after the first time it happened, but this time was even worse. She screamed that she hated me. She screamed that she hated herself. She screamed much more, but it was hard to make out her words. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt hear what she had to say.¬†

It was so loud it pierced even my mom‚Äôs ears. She got lured to the house by it. While I was telling her everything was alright and I had it under control, the siren locked herself in the bathroom. My mom left after I pleaded her to do so. I think she was terrified, too.

I went to the bathroom door and I begged her to let me in. I needed to save her before she would try to drown herself again. When she finally opened the door, there was blood in the sink and she was crying. She didn‚Äôt scream anymore. The song was back on her lips. She told me she was sorry. She told me not to leave her, because I was the only thing that made her happy.

I stayed. Only for a month, though. I broke up with her the day after my 18th birthday. I think it was the first grown-up decision I made. I did it over the phone. People say you shouldn‚Äôt break up on the phone, but that‚Äôs the only way to leave a siren. I didn‚Äôt want to hear her scream, or sing, ever again. She couldn‚Äôt lure me over the phone. Afterall, she wasn‚Äôt a particularly strong one.

I like to think I was brave for leaving, but it isn‚Äôt true. I was just too goddamn tired. I was going through a withdrawal. My survival instinct has always been my strongest suit. It saved me in the last possible moment. I reached the point when I couldn‚Äôt give any more happiness to anyone, including myself. I wish it was the last time I reached that point.

So I got better. I gained weight and my head stopped hurting. I got to regrow my happiness. I got to cherish it for a while, before I gave it away again.¬†

I told you it was going to be a cautionary tale. I eventually tamed my sickness. I think I‚Äôm generally good now, with a certain amount of sad people around me. It‚Äôs not like I can change it. No more sirens, though. When I hear them, I always run the fastest I can.

I know there‚Äôs a lot of them here, much stronger than the girl I told you about. I know you suffer because of it too. You have a different virus, but it consumes you the same way mine consumes me.¬†

Don‚Äôt let it, please. I just showed you a way how. Because I didn‚Äôt make you feel better today, did I? And if it doesn‚Äôt always work, they cannot always use me. I don‚Äôt want them to use me. I have a lot of happiness right now.¬†

And for once in my life, I don‚Äôt want to share.

1lu95mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1lu95mr/moved_to_a_simple_town/,Moved to a simple town,"My husband and I moved to Southwestern Virginia to a small town near the Blue Ridge Parkway. We live in the historic downtown and we rent an apartment in a historic building.

We like it here because it's simple and fairly quiet.  The weather is nice, we have all four seasons, and it's not as hot and humid as some areas I have lived in.

Traffic isn't very bad on this side of town. A lot of people don't wanna live downtown because they fear crime. There were some crime problems in the past, but we have never had a problem in 2 years. We feel very safe.

There are coffee shops and restaurants, but not an abundance and frankly we don't use them much because we're trying to have a simple life with low expenses. 

We are an hour from a bigger city with more options so sometimes it's nice to go up there, but I'm always glad to come back here to where it's quiet 

Our town is Lynchburg Virginia. 
A lot of people only know Lynchburg because of liberty University. That school is on the other side of town and we don't really mix with people from that fundamentalist Christian college. 

There are two other colleges here, Randolph college, formally Randolph, Macon college, and the university of Lynchburg.
Having higher education here means there's some interesting offerings 

There is a good music scene and pretty decent theater 

If you're looking for a quiet town, that isn't too expensive, I recommend Lynchburg.
Our 1500 ft.¬≤ three bedroom two bath apartment is $1500 a month and it has a washer and dryer but we do have to pay extra for parking.
There are certainly more expensive housing options around here, but there are also some reasonably priced places

It feels like every time I crack the door open to someone new, they shut it ‚Äî or worse, they leave it half open, just enough to keep me hoping. I constantly feel led on. I put in real effort, show up with an open heart, and then get reduced to an afterthought. In my life, I‚Äôve always felt like an extra in other people‚Äôs stories ‚Äî not even a supporting character. Just someone in the background. Quiet. Replaceable. Forgotten.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened recently:

* **Guy 1 (April):** We met at a local gay bar/club. Honestly one of the best first dates I‚Äôve ever had ‚Äî we kissed, we vibed, and he said things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd invite you over, but I‚Äôd want to sleep with you‚Äù (after telling me earlier he doesn‚Äôt usually sleep with people the first night, which I agreed with). The following week he said he wanted to take things slow and ‚Äújust be friends‚Äù‚Ä¶ then literally that same night was grinding on me at the club, flirting hard, asking about my size and making sexual comments. Later, he‚Äôd still send heart emojis and be flirty in texts, while also talking about how hot other guys were in front of me. It was a lot of blurred lines, and it felt like he knew I had a crush and was enjoying the attention without giving anything real back. I stopped seeing him because it felt like emotional whiplash.
* **Guy 2 (early May):** We had a sweet, thoughtful first date ‚Äî drinks, a 4-hour conversation, and a perfect kiss. We met up a few more times for food, long talks, making out, and some light fooling around. Eventually we got an Airbnb together for a night and spent the next day at a nearby attraction. I was so hopeful, but remained cautious of getting too attached because he lives considerably far away from me, and has shown interest in relationship types I'm not a fan of. After that, we texted constantly for about two weeks ‚Äî good morning texts, vulnerable convos about trauma, all of it. Then suddenly, he asked what I was looking for with him. I said I wasn‚Äôt ready to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù just yet but genuinely liked him and was enjoying where it was going. He agreed and said we could just go with the flow. But right after that? His replies got shorter, colder, and less frequent. A few weeks later I asked to see him again ‚Äî sent a sweet message ‚Äî and got back a dry ‚ÄúOk sure, what day and what would you wanna do?‚Äù He ended up cancelling later that week, but was still posting on snapchat himself doing weekend activities. Maybe he changed his energy because I told him I wasn't ready to get married? But I never said lets STOP getting to know each other? You know?!
* **Guy 3 (late June):** Another amazing first date ‚Äî dinner, ice cream, deep conversation, all the things. We planned a second date the following week and kissed a lot, hugged, had a great time. At the end of that date, he asked to see me again just two days later ‚Äî I was thrilled! We went to an exotic plant store, got tacos, watched fireworks at his house, and he even made me coffee before his night shift. I spent time with his cats, waited alone while he got ready for work ‚Äî it felt so intimate and comfortable. We kissed goodbye and parted ways. Two days later, after I send a text saying I got home and would love to see him again (which he replied and agreed), he texts something like ""I've been thinking about our dates. You‚Äôre obviously really cute and I love kissing you, but I‚Äôm not feeling something romantic. I think we should just be friends. What do you think?‚Äù

What do I think? I was crushed. It felt like something real was finally forming ‚Äî something sweet and slow and maybe safe. Just as the previous two were falling out of my hands, this new guy was rising from the ashes. And once again, it just‚Ä¶ collapsed.

I was sobbing today. I feel like no matter what, I‚Äôm always the the extra in everyone else's life. The one who is always welcome, but never specifically invited to the party, or only when its specifically necessary for me to be there (example: family members who think I'm funny and want me to be around so I can 'perform' like a circus monkey...) I just feel used. I'm the one they want to talk to, kiss, flirt with, but not actually hold close or choose in the end. I want connection, and I felt connection with this third guy. Its ok if he doesn't feel the same, but then... why did you ask me to hang 2 days after our 2nd date? Why did you invite me into your home? Why did you let me sit on the couch and sip a coffee while you showered and got ready for work? Why not just kick me out?

  
The inconsistency and feeling of being led on is killing me. I want that closeness but every time it seems like a good time to open up, the door is being slammed shut.

Any advice or shared experiences are welcome. I just want to stop feeling like I‚Äôm always a substitute for people, and start to feel like part of a team with someone. A fill in when no one else answers the call, and they know I'm the easy ask but I get nothing in return.",1,1751930008.0,gayrelationships,3,1.0,False
1lu93hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1lu93hr/trip_report_five_days_with_family_2_teens_wife/,"Trip report: Five Days with Family (2 teens, wife, and me)","Puerto Rico might become an annual trip. This forum helped us make some important decisions so I'd like to give back with some feedback.

1. Location: Isla Verde made a perfect home base. Beaches were busy but not too busy. Felt safe to walk around. Vibe was great. Ubers are easy to get. SJU rental cars were ten minutes away. Lots of food options. One thing- you are in the middle of everything. People partied till 3am late Friday and Saturday. Nothing some ear plugs/noise cancelling headphones couldn't solve. 

2. Transportation: Uber was perfect for 95% of our trip. Didn't have one problem. Most rides were $10-25. So many nice drivers. The pass code system works if there is a language barrier but all our drivers spoke english. We rented an Enterprise car at SJU based on feedback from this forum. Super Easy. Was about $80 for a mid-suv.

3. Beach: Early July. the water was PERFECT. Think locals felt it was a tiny bit cold, but without a doubt, it was easy to swim in, enjoy, and relax. For me it was 9.0 out of 10. Recommend booking your umbrellas and chairs with companies along the beach like ""Relax PR Beach Rental"" Text 787-320-9960 (book early) Four chairs and 2 large umbrellas ran around $60 for the day. They drill the umbrella down which helps when it gets windy and you don't have to truck crap everywhere. 

4. Things to do: Having two teens is a challenge but here are the things we enjoyed doing. 

1. Just relax by the water. They just wanted to sleep in. Read manga by the water. Eat from food stands. Sit in the sun or soak in the ocean, hit the pool. Not over plan our day (which did happen sometimes) If we spent 50% of our time doing this, we win. 

2. Fish. Puerto Rico has these large sport fish called Tarpons which are 80 to 150 lbs easy. You can see them breaching the water like sharks. We did a 2-hour fishing charter with Backwater Tarpon (highly recommend). They were great. We did the 2-hour morning fish and caught some small fish. Learn from us. Book in the evening or at night (that's when the Tarpon were biting) and if you have kids arrange where the kids can fish for small stuff like barracuda and snapper while the tarpon lines are sitting in the water. Otherwise, it can be boring for them. If you hit a tarpon, they told us it's a good 45-minute fight. Have your kids watch TikTok Tarpon fishing and they could get excited. Kids also fished from the shore a lot. I would buy some telescoping/travel poles so you don't have to waste money on poles that you'll never be able to get on a plane with.

3. Jet ski: We did the 30-minute Jet Ski out of Archie's Jet Ski Rental. The company was great. Would recommend you pay for the GoPro footage that their staff takes of you. They do a good job. Recommend renting the goggles because salt water splashing in your face at high speed is annoying as hell. You are only allowed to Jet ski around 500 yards, and their staff is everywhere, making sure the rentals are not close to each other and rules are being obeyed (21+ only driving). 

4. Bio Bay: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to those who recommended skipping Fajardo because of the sargassum issues and smell and opting for the swimming experience at La Parquera. It was the only day we got a rental car, and at first I wasn't excited to drive 2 hours from San Juan to and back for essentially a 15-minute experience, but TOTALLY WORTH IT. It was one of those wonderful core memories that you can only experience in very few places. The swimming was the key part. And the two-hour drive was pleasant. Seeing the mountain region, then the south of the island, was fun (with a good audiobook).

5. Food: To be honest we had a lot of misses this trip. But here were our favorite dishes: Casita Miramar: Just go. It's so good. They greet you with a delicious cup of soup that just hits the spot. Then we shared the Cabrito and an Avocado Salad. Best Meal of the trip. Food stands on Isla Verde: Ate way too many pinchos. Juicy, salty, kabobs covered in bbq and hot sauce. What's not to love?  Food Kiosks at Pinones: The kids were fishing near El Farol a lot. I loved their Lobster Empanadas ($4) 787 Coffee: I would highly recommend their rum soaked beans as a pour over with no cream or sugar. Also their iced dolce leche latte is amazing.

  
Anyway we will save El Yunque and Vieques and Rincon for next year! Thanks again for all your suggestions.",3,1751929958.0,PuertoRicoTravel,3,1.0,False

1lu90ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexAddiction/comments/1lu90ww/omc_cheated_regrets_dont_know_what_to_do/,"OMC - Cheated, regrets don't know what to do...","So this is my first posting here. I see this account for the moment as a throwaway because...i¬¥m good at planning but not that good. 

Disclaimer: I don't know if i¬¥m a sex addict. I assume it because there are a lot of symptoms. I¬¥m in therapy but mainly because of my depression, anxiety and ADHD. I never spoke with my therapist about this topic but I will seek professional help. 

TL;DR: I cheated on the love of my life. With a trans escort. I regret it with every inch holding me together. Will keep it as a secret and looking for ways to get rid of the steady thinking about sex.

No feelings. It was terrible. There is no chance I'll ever do it again. And I mean paying for sex and cheating in general. I think for a lot of you reading this I don't need to write down all the self justifications why I did it but one was to finally find out if this is a part of my sexuality. As mentioned: I know now - it¬¥s not. But it burned in me for so long and there was no slight chance to speak with my partner about that. 

In general we've been very open talking about sex, things to try, desires...except that. Nevertheless it was getting less and less. The bedroom was becoming cold. Especially with kids, health issues and the evergrowing stress. For me sex is a relief. For her it¬¥s fun and she needs to be in the mood. I¬¥m in the mood pretty fast. That can be a social media ad about a waifu mobile game or a  picture of an OF Model cooking coffee which the algorithm thrown at me. I was masturbating up to 5-6 times a day. Watching porn and naked women when she was around because I needed it. If a woman wears heels and have nice nails I can't think straight.

I mentioned my depression. Additionally I lost my job. Her health issues becoming her identification. Hearing every day about new symptoms is at one point exhausting (I just try to describe what I feel - I support her 1000%). I think all this plus emotional numbness through my antidepressant and ADHD meds lead to those 20 minutes which made me a worse human being. 

And speaking about this numbness: Afterwards I was more afraid about catching something (Safersex was practiced and I got my self tested and everything is fine) then gambling with everything I loved. I didn't care.  I decided to reduce my anti depressants and since then well i¬¥m going down a downward spiral. I feel something again. The good but also the bad stuff. It¬¥s harder to deal with but at least somehow i¬¥m able to deal with. It¬¥s not that I can't look her in the eyes anymore. I still love her and my family with every breath I take till my last. But I broke something in me. I became something I never wanted to be (Mum cheated, Biological and Stepdad Cheated, Friends cheated even my wife cheated on her previous partners). I have the feeling I lost all privileges to be happy again. To listen to our songs or looking at our wedding pictures. To do funny stuff. To laugh. I mean somehow this didn't happened since a few years anyways and maybe this is another reason but now it's more ... permitted. 

I decided not to tell her. It wouldn't change anything but making our life more harder to break her and myself more. I¬¥m not sure if she would forgive me. And I¬¥m not sure if I would seek this forgiveness just that I feel better. I haven't put even 5% on the plate what we went through and how painful the past years have been for both of us. It will be my and our secret. And I have this weird opinion that the only person able to grant me forgiveness is me. That sounds weird. I can't explain it. I feel less human at this point. I try to get back up. I try to bury this 20 minutes deep in my mind like a box with unwanted invoices you put on the top shelf in the corner just so that it reminds you but isn¬¥t present. 

I feel like shit. I deleted my ""Thot-Stalker"" social media account today. I unfollowed every person triggering my sexual desires. I try to get quit porn. And I¬¥ll check for help in my area.  And I hope for you input and feedback. I don't seek absolution. But ideas and ways to work on myself and to deal with the situation. 

Thanks for reading this far. Writing this down helped a bit. Stay safe and have a great day.

1lu90mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1lu90mx/handbag_blue_quilted_shoulder_bag_elegant_womens/,Handbag: Blue Quilted Shoulder Bag - Elegant Women's Bag,"**Title:** Handbag Find: Elegant Women's Bag - Blue Quilted Shoulder Bag Obsession!

Okay, hear me out, because I‚Äôm usually a tote bag kinda gal. Big, practical, throw-everything-in-and-go type thing. But recently, I was feeling‚Ä¶ blah. Like my outfits needed a little *oomph*, you know? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I started searching for something different. I needed something that felt a bit more put-together, but still functional for everyday life. I work from home, but I still run errands, meet friends for coffee, and generally try to adult. My black hole tote just wasn't cutting it anymore. I kept seeing ads for these designer bags that were way out of my budget, and honestly, felt a little too flashy for my style. I wanted something‚Ä¶ chic, but understated.

That's when I stumbled across this **blue quilted shoulder bag**. I know, I know, it sounds like something your grandma would carry, but trust me on this one. The color is this gorgeous, deep blue that goes with literally everything in my closet. And the quilting? It's not too much, just enough to add some texture and interest to the overall look.

What really sold me was the size. It's not huge, but it's definitely big enough to carry all my essentials: phone, wallet, keys, sunglasses, a small makeup bag, and even a book or my e-reader. I hate lugging around a massive bag when I only need a few things. This one is the perfect size for running errands or going out for the evening.

The quality is surprisingly good for the price. It feels sturdy and well-made, and I'm not worried about it falling apart after a few uses. The closure is secure, which is a big plus. I live in a city, and I'm always a little paranoid about pickpockets. This bag gives me some peace of mind.

Since I started using it, I've gotten so many compliments! People have told me how stylish and sophisticated it looks, and I honestly feel more confident when I carry it. It's amazing how a simple accessory can make such a big difference. Plus, I don't have to rummage through it for hours because it's perfectly sized.

One of my biggest pet peeves is having to switch bags depending on the occasion. Before this one I felt like I was always reorganizing my belongings. I had one for work, one for shopping, and one for going out. It was exhausting! Now, I can just grab this shoulder bag and go, knowing that it will work for pretty much any situation. That saves me time and a ton of frustration every single morning.

Another thing I love about this bag is that it's surprisingly versatile. I've worn it with jeans and a t-shirt, with a dress and heels, and even with a blazer for a more professional look. It always looks great, and it never feels out of place. It's become my go-to bag for pretty much everything. A friend asked me where I got it as we were going to a local festival - and I think she's going to order one too!

I ordered it from ursupermart.com - just thought I would share in case you are looking for the best women's bags!

Seriously, if you're looking for a stylish and practical **elegant women's handbag** that won't break the bank, I highly recommend checking this one out. It‚Äôs the best **blue quilted shoulder bag** I've owned and definitely something I expect to be on trend heading into 2025. Here‚Äôs where I snagged mine if you‚Äôre curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/KEHAbw

Anyway, that's my two cents. Hope this helps someone who's been on the hunt for the perfect shoulder bag! I will leave this right here.

Chapter Four: Astralium and The End of The Beginning


	
	
 I imagine her waking up to the mannequin head I placed on the pillow where my head should still be. I see her tearing the note off the nail in it's forehead and reading:


To Leave Is Expected, To Stay... Divine.
                                    I'll be back in a few days.
                                                                         Please Stay.
                                                                                                    D.



 I can feel her frustration dancing about my organs, knife in hand, looking for where to sink the fatal blow. My body has surpassed the aching, alcoholic throbbing, and is now into a bone-deep tension, that may, in all likelihood, never cease. I stand inside the little cavern, looking about from side to side, and rock to earth. We've been walking for miles, but it's clear he knows exactly where he's going, or at least he believes he does. Maybe it's all the mushrooms we ate.
 ""Seriously, man. Fuck that. You're better off leaving it alone. It'd be one thing if she showed up sober and on her knees in tears,"" He continues.
 I start hitting my chest, manipulating my voice, which is lovely in the cave's echoing entrance, ""I. Don't. Wanna. Talk. About. This. Any. More,"" I'm smiling the whole time I deliver the message, and Keith starts in with clicks of the tongue, stomps, and whistling to turn it all into a song for the magically natural world in front of us. ""These. Are. The. Best. Boomers. Ever!""
 ""Right, right. But, it's not the main attraction. There's no turning back from what I'm about to show you. That means, once you're in,"" he stops and breathes deep, ""You're in.""
 I begin batting my eyelashes, ""I bet you say that to all the girls.""
 He laughs as he pulls something out of his pocket, and then, as if remembering everything that has ever taken place under the sun, he adapts a strange seriousness that haunts my visual thoughts. All the while his hand moves over the rock and a small light blinks red. He waves something hidden in his hand over the front of the light and it turns green. A small shift, and the bottom of the cave begins to take us down into the earth. The tunnel walls are a hollow cold and the rusting shades of the walls are that of ancient blood, one that I would never touch out of respect, but could never stop letting my mind feast upon. He speaks; I absorb.
 Pulling two viles from his pocket, ""This,"" he waves them in front of my face, ""is Astralium. It is a protein I derived from a molecule discovered in one very special animal; the only one of it's species on the planet. I spliced it with my rNA, and reengineered it into this ingestible solution. The outcome? Replication inside your body. In other words, if you take this, you will begin to carry this protein, and its functions become your functions.""
""Sounds dangerous... And illegal,"" I think out loud.
""Yeah, it's a far step from filtering ether out of starter fluid, but some parts felt just as easy.""
 ""And what is this incredibly rare animal?"" I try to lower my expectations.
 ""She doesn't have a title, yet. I simply call her, Oluh.""
 We arrive at the destined doors to an underground chamber. He opens the doors revealing what appears to be a group meeting. The long rectangular room consists of three thickly wooden extended tables surrounded on all sides by people gabbing about god knows what, and a forest of plants I assume are being kept for oxygen purposes. My thoughts travel back to interventions, A.A., and a therapy group I used to attend weekly. I shutter, but he continues talking and I begin to calm down.
 ""This is the panel of The Quantum Mechanics,"" he tries to hide his smile, but I catch the reference to an old garage band idea we had contrived back when we were in high school, or rather when we were skipping high school to expand our minds.
 I chuckle, and walk into the room. I don't think anyone acknowledges our arrival. They just keep their very vibrant conversations alive. In one such conversation, a man begins yelling and getting so wrapped in fury that he begins breaking everything in front of him, which mainly consisted of coffee mugs. While, in another, two, I'm assuming young scientists, are embracing each other and their smiling tears are chaotically flipping about like a couple of drooling dogs after a single bite of steak thrown between them.
 ""I am the only authoritative party in this room, simply because of the necessity for determining the chronological order of the ideas as they flow out these Mechanics. We have to progress rapidly and effectively in order to survive what will surely come next,"" he looks back at me to see if I understand.
 ""War?""
 ""Inevitably, but immediately, my concern is the fear campaign that will rise to make Astralium seem like the apocalypse in pill form. I need to organize everything perfectly, and have everything tested in every way, before I can to think about going public. There is something else I must do, as well. But I'll get to that in a moment. For now, let's go to the Zoo,"" I swear he has a skip in his step momentarily after delivering this line.
 I follow him around the side of his group of idea-men, whom, I'm certain, still haven't noticed our presence, and into a little cavernous doorway. He flips a light switch beside the entrance and we traverse a series of tunnels, all longer than the last. Finally, I see an enormous cube of thick dark glass that is dead-center in an even more enormous earthen chamber, which I enter cautiously. I am overwhelmed with a threatening feeling; not that I am threatened by what's inside, but that perhaps what's inside is threatened by me.
 ""Meet Oluh!"" Keith exclaims proudly.
 ""What? The cube?"" I look on at it dumbfounded, and searching for signs of breathing.
 ""Yeah,"" he chuckles, ""weirdest animal you've ever seen, right?""
 I continue to stare.
 Keith begins laughing and rolling his eyes, ""No, man. Hang on,"" he keeps laughing to himself and walks over to the side of the cube and touches it.
 The walls of the cube become clear revealing a jungle atmosphere.
 ""This is the center of The UnderGround, and I wanted her to be at its heart,"" he continues talking, but I am unable to listen, I just keep staring and trying not to blink.
 And then, through the tree tops I catch a glimpse of something blue and white. The branches shake and leaves scatter. I hear a screeching sound; Something animal, but seemingly digital. I blink, and then I see her. Darting wildly about all sides of the confinement is some kind of electric beast. I've seen lightning slower than the motions of this creature. I start to piece together its shape in moments when it lets out a scream and stands still in a flash. First I notice the arms, then fingers, then feet, and then I see its face. A rounded, hairy head with oval electric eyes; currents of glowing teeth stuck in a ferocious howl. Some sort of ape? The features seem to represent every ape and monkey I had ever seen. And as the gnashing entity started swirling faster around and around its entrapment, she appeared. Just as real as you and me, there she stumbled out of the edge of the brush and sat down. Not a regular ape by any means, but very much of this plain. She stared at me with her green eyes; a primate. The electricity swirled and clawed about a moment longer, and then as fast as it had came, it absorbed into this beast as it looked through my soul for answers.
 ""Hell of a defense, don't ya think?"" Keith mused. ""After much study, I have determined that what you just witnessed was a higher level of astral projection. Oluh is a master. Her soul can leave her body, while her body can continue as it wishes. Her intelligence is beyond our understanding, currently.""
 I shudder at the intent behind his comment.
 ""She can not only project her soul to the point of physical existence, but she can also control both her body and soul with her mind simultaneously,"" he takes a breath and continues, ""though, it has been made apparent that the soul has more passion and defies physics by more than just a leap.""
 ""But the soul isn't capable of penetrating glass?"" I ponder aloud, my eyes never having left hers.
 ""It's my understanding that because of the level to which she has manifested her physical soul, it has become too physical for the kind of particle breakdown necessary to walk through walls. Again, though, it still defies physics with its speed and obviously, ya know, the flying,"" I watch him deliver this last word as he stares in admiration of his discovery.
 I, too, am still staring in awe. The idea that this creature exists, and perhaps didn't evolve, but that it has been around for a long time, and is possibly the last of it's kind, leaves unspeakable room for speculation. Could an army of Oluhs have helped construct the Pyramids, or Stonehenge? Did ancient cultures harness this power for themselves? But why not any documentation on such events, or on this spiritual primate species? Possibly an escaped test animal? Some hideously genius experimenter, getting too big for his britches, creates Oluh and then sets her free knowing he can never claim credit for his illegal ingenuity, but still deep down wanting to share her with the world? The unfathomable murky depths of this pondering are leaving me in a state of paralysis.
 ""Well,"" Keith shouts, shattering my mental masterpiece-in-progress, ""Now that you've met the source, may I direct your attention to the future of evolution?""
 He holds out the viles again. The ones from the 'elevator'. The ones with the strange symbol I still haven't placed. The ones I am now starting to fear.
 ""Astralium. It is to be the next leap in evolution. The beauty of changing Oluh's gift into our own is a matter of consciousness. Oluh still remains primitive. She will always be this way. But we have higher consciousness to add to the equation. If theories stand up, we will gain the ability to travel as souls wherever and however we desire. Because of consciousness, we will be able to manipulate our souls to literally walk through walls; as Oluh remains unable. I believe these theories will be surpassed by what will transpire once total societal awareness is reached. And now, I will demonstrate my progress,"" Keith states.
 His arms outstretched in front of his standing body, he closes his eyes and begins an intense breathing exercise. His right arm tremors as his eyelids twitch. Every minute hair on my body raises like a cornered cat as Keith opens his eyes. There I see little blue and white stars twinkling out of synchronicity, and his fingers visibly pulsate. As if short-circuiting, I watch his ghost fighting to escape his body. His right arm becomes completely still, and he stops breathing. An electric spiritual hand slowly breaks away from his own, rising up as if he were bending it back to touch his forearm. It pulls away shakily, as if breaking loose from actual ties that hardwired it to remain in the body. 
 I think to myself, ""Severing the mortal coil.""
 ""It is very much exactly that,"" I hear him say to me with his mouth still closed.
 Keith stopped the show. He closed his eyes once more. The spirit hand retreated. And he stood before me as if it had all been a dream.
 I noticed a red light blinking, in the room juxtaposed to the one we were in, through a window in the corner. The light reflected off of the shiny aluminum table between us. I looked to catch a panicky look sweep over his entire being.
 It was only at that moment that I realized I had just taken part in a telepathic conversation mere seconds ago.






Chapter Five: The Hunt for Oluh





 Deep red flashes. Fever. The only heartbeat I feel is behind my closed eyelids. Pulsate. Pulsate. Pulsate. Light. Pulsate. Pulsate. Pulsate. Shadow. Pulsate. Pulsate. Pulsate. An inaudible terror; trapped in the belly of a growling crowd. I reach out my hand.
 Shaking arms; he pulls me out. Someone had made quick work of infiltrating the compound. We'd barely survived the initial explosions and gunfire. 
 ""DONNIE!"" he screams in my face, ""We've got to find Oluh!""
 There's a panic inside of him that revives my senses momentarily. I worry that the strength I had at the beginning of all of this has been irrevocably nulled. I can see death, but I'm too tired to be afraid; haunted frustration and a lust for sleep. He creeps around the corner, and nudges me to follow him. I can feel his annoyance before the surge hits my temples and I hear him speak inside my head: ""If she leaves with them, all of this is over. And a storm is going to bring all of this society and world to a grinding halt.""
 Flashes of fangs. I see her. There's a reverberation in her cries. I feel her. A man in a black hat. Am I seeing through her? I spin down out of the sky onto him. At least, I think it's me. Oluh watches from the corner terrified, as I gnash away at his throat. I look up and see Oluh's spirit tearing a man to pieces. I'm starting to feel emotion again.
 ""She's fighting,"" I mumble, realizing all of us were connected spirits, now.
 ""Her spirit is fighting. Oluh is too scared. Much like us, old friend,"" he clamps my shoulder.
 ""Can we stop this from happening?"" I think and he hears me.
 He then squats down, back to the wall, and his pinched closed eyes turned towards the sky. There is a long pause while we both breathe and try to find a solution. I try not to notice the angst in his stature. I try to hold on to hope, and then he speaks.
 ""We can only keep the spirit alive.""
 I feel myself sit down in defeat. He's running down a corridor, and I can hear his thoughts for awhile; fragmented and sometimes too cloudy to comprehend. I find a room and lay down hidden from the war behind the door. He mentions an orb. He wants to be inside of it. That's where he's going. Seeping through are the feelings of isolation. He's afraid to be alone. I begin thinking of Leah. How could I ever make it back to her? Diluted in defeat, I writhe in the pains of the collapsing mind. 
 ""No more time. Only space.""
 I welcome the void, and fade to black.

...

 My eyelids flutter at high speed and I'm lying in a drift of leaves and snow. I can see abandoned cars hanging from the edge of the mountainous iced-over poorly paved road, and I wonder how long I've been there. I can hear her voice calling to me, but I know it's only a dream. 
 I make an attempt to stand, and just as fast I'm back on the ground. Sliding to my elbows, I begin to drag myself up the hill. One sign of life would make this a little less miserable. I find the strength to survive for surviving's sake. 
 My feet are able to find traction as I reach the top, and I stand; barely remembering my escape from the UnderGround. I can still see ash and smoke pouring out of its belly a few miles behind me. I follow the ashes up into the sky and see a rocket penetrating the atmosphere with intent. Man versus Earth; to rape and escape all ties with one's nature. And I think to myself, ""This is what high consciousness got us.""
 Watching the distant destruction, I keep waiting for the ground to fall out from under me; carrying me down as if I had become permeable with the earth itself. I'm not sure how long I stare in wait before it occurs to me that maybe I should turn and leave these notions behind; run away from the crashing world around me. And it seemed to come full-circle in that moment that this was why man had become so eager to escape. Mankind wishes to be a visitor. We have claustrophobia to this planet and the primitive realities of living, and dying, and breeding. It's as if we were trapped in an elevator after an apocalyptic event transpired, and we aren't aware if there is a force left outside to save us. Some will begin doing pushups and trying to break themselves free. Others sit and wait, or simply lay down in defeat. Others take their own lives. And then some imagine that their entire lives were leading up to this moment, and that it is important to sit and reflect on what they've gotten themselves into. After all, they're the ones who got into the elevator during the apocalypse, right?
 All of it made me remember being back in Knoxville. 
 I was twenty-four and constantly dreaming, but on this particular occasion I was in love. And that wasn't the main part of it. I had met a girl who was my age. And I found her fascinating, which was unlike me as I had always had an attraction to slightly older women. I was coming to a head with my precocious childhood. I, of course, didn't realize this for quite some time, but the dawning of a real maturity was forming. And that particular moment, we were up in the SunSphere, peering out at all the life of Knoxville, and I had sat down with my laptop to begin working on a new novel based on the situation I was in. 'Deflowering Lesbians' was the working title. And I remember feeling so overwhelmed with what my future would be with the girl who loved me so rapturously and gave me that sense of whimsy, because she made me feel like a god. And I began to fear being so certain of anything. But she sat down beside me, and I insisted that we should tag-team the novel and write something together. And I'll never forget how distant she steered things away from the idea. She went into how she could never commit to writing a novel, and that she was mainly an idea expander and observer of the fabrics of life. In my mind, I thought we had something dynamic in that sense. Like we could tackle the world in verse and prose. Realization sank in that it wasn't going to be that kind of relationship at all. That there would be many confrontations and struggles to understand one another. And all I could think was how uncertain everything actually was. And what a lovely thing that is.
 I feel untethered from the destructive scene in front of me after this reflective period. I'm done with this chaos. It's over. Whatever government force had taken Oluh would be holding all the cards from here on out. Let's face it, they probably always had. The only point that truly bothered me was the death of Keith's dream. He was leading us all towards a very feasible and possibly even heavenly utopian world. Astralium would have liberated every soul further than the realm of imagination; A very true freedom amongst all the creatures of the planet.
 Damn these power-hungry infants! The militant masked discontented droves of computer-chip minds; all armed with extended cocks that shoot loads of death instead of life. Why did I have to be born into this Technological Age. Technology only serves itself. It has no room in nature, other than to ultimately weaken mankind to the point of their own demise, thus ridding the planet this plague of consciousness.

 I think, therefore, I'm malfunctioning.

 I think about every science-fiction book, or movie, out there that goes off on tangents about artificially intelligent robots becoming conscious and trying to destroy man for the purpose of robot survival. And I suddenly acknowledge that in relation to nature, we are the robots. What's worse is that it isn't a theoretical possibility, or a forewarning of what could happen without precautionary steps. It's reality. And I curse, again, the propagating war machines that are forming in electronic colons and being shit out to all lands of earth to spread e-HIV to the masses. The same masses who have been conditioned to eat shit and reflect on the fact that they are what they eat. Disconnect, Unplug, ABORT!
 I channel this hate into my steps. I have to get back. What was the hope in all of this? I remember briefly that anger will temporarily lower your I.Q., but I am too mad to focus on the truth. I want to explode. I want others to see it. Let them rationalize; I need to alleviate my soul. There's a car down the hill at my right, and I know this means I will at least survive the oncoming night.
 As I make my way down to it, I slip, or maybe I trip, I'm not sure, but I land on my ass, and once again I'm confronted with a sky full of chem-trails and the notion to give it all up. I only allow time to take one solid icy breath out of me before I force myself back to my feet and shuffle slowly down to the side of the abandon Chevy.
 I shimmy myself down into the cold faux leather seat, wrapped in my own coat, and I begin to cocoon into sleep in my new apocalyptic elevator scenario. I find the crumpled pack of cigarettes in my pocket. I spark one and watch the number 4 glow against the frozen windshield.
 I just chuckle as I think about quitting after all this insanity. 
I look through the windshield towards the clouds, hoping for one last glimpse of Keith's escaping ship. Only streaks of white in the greying sky meet my gaze.

 I pray tomorrow finds me, and I cease to view the outside world.








Chapter Six: The Almeissan Convent




 ""How do you do?"" he asked, pursing his lips and dragging the last breath of his cigarette out from between his putrid yellowish-brown stained fingertips.
 I couldn't think fast enough to reply, so out came, ""How do you do?""
 His car seemed to idle a minute, then a gurgle and choke brought it back to life.
 ""I'll tell ya. I do everyone once, and the good ones twice! Gahahahaghhhahaheh!"" he let out that smoker's wheezing guffaw, and I couldn't help but smile. ""Get in, brother. Witches' tits are fallin' off around here.""
 We drove down the mountain at a speed of rollercoaster limitations. Without question, the number three blew out from my smoke. The man was clearly an old-timer drug addict with ne'er a desiring bone in his body to try to fall back in line with society. I had respect for all or nothing people. I was like that in my youth. Jesus, ...how old am I, now?
 ""What the fuck are you doin' up this fuckin' high, anyway, man?"" he squelched through whiskey breath from the other side of the bouncing rusted heap.
 ""I was looking for something,"" I seem to fade out as speaking this, because my ears started to tingle and a void came over my extremities. My mind repeatedly drew a question mark over and over on a dry-erase board, and everything went out of focus.
 ""Well, I think you have the right idea. I've always found the best things to find are where nothing is.""
 And that's when I saw the notebook in my hand. ""I'm a writer,"" I half question it as I speak it.
 ""Well, whatever you do, leave me out of it,"" he spoke looking off to his right, not at me, at something up ahead, ""Here. I don't want to wear out you're company. This place looks accommodating."" He pointed at the strange structure that was coming in and out of the blurriness of my seizing pupils.
 ""This is where I needed to go,"" I said. ""They're expecting me.""
 I can feel the man stare at the side of my face, looking for some sort of joshing gesture to smirk onto my face. He pretends not to be weirded out when he realizes it isn't a joke, ""Well, good shit! I'll catch ya later on down the line. Here ya are.""
 We pull up to the entrance of what appears to be the front most center building. Its small gray-brick pathway leads up to the silver and gold patterned archway which bares the largest gated dole I've ever seen. There aren't any exchanges of pleasantries as I get out of the jalopy and close the door behind me. I never even look back, but I can tell he scat in a hurry. I hear the echo of his faulty engine gurgling at least half a mile away and dimming. And I forget the trip even took place. I feel like I've always been standing in front of these iron bars, wondering what waits on the other side.
 I barely notice the faint hum of another vehicle pulling up behind me. There's a soul to this place unlike any place I've ever been. I can see the architecture breathe. I could find its pulse if someone asked. It begins to give me the chills, when she taps me on the shoulder and stops my thought process entirely.
 ""Sorry,"" Leah says, spotting the fear she induced. ""Hi,"" she smiles tenderly.
 ""Hi, yourself,"" I say, pulling it together and returning a smile.
 We embrace for a moment. How long have we been apart? It feels like ghost years. Somewhere outside of this plane, time may, in fact, exist. Not here, though. Here there are only dimensions. A good slogan for this reality? Space‚Ä¶ The Only Frontier. I let go of the mathematical and allow myself to just be happy to be with her now.
 We give each other that eye contact nod. The one where it is assumed we understand what's going on in each other's mind. I've always enjoyed this bit of non-telepathy. For all I know, she could be thinking, ""We're both unicorns, right?"" Nod. And for all she knows, I could be thinking, ""Do you hear that giraffe? He sounds close."" Nod. But somehow, it seems to work as affirmation in our belief that everything is connected. Never really understood that accepting these moments is of a spiritual realm, until now.
 ""So, three nights, eh?"" she strokes my arm softly.
 ""Well, I mean, we may not have to stay all that time,"" I shuffle, ""I just need to get the information.""
The gateway stares into me. I can sense the presence of shuttering electric heat sweating through the pores of the iron; the golden stones are vibrating the songs of memories, while the silver stones reflect the shimmering energies. I still receive a great deal less than the entirety of their meaning. I try to look back to Leah and away from these biting invitations to explore.
 ""I think the spiritual side already has a grasp on me. I just need to get a grasp on it,"" I finish.
 ""And I just need a vacation from myself,"" she insists, ""Thank you so much for inviting me.""
 I can't remember, but my voice continues out of its own knowledge, ""No problem. I figured you could use a break with all you've been dealing with lately. Besides,"" I laugh, ""it's a convent in the middle of winter. Not exactly an island resort getaway.""
 ""No, but you know what I mean,"" she continues while giggling and, almost with tears of relief, she sighs. ""Thank you. I missed you so much.""
 ""I missed you, too.""
 Inside the gates, far beyond the loving embrace outside, we make are way through the construction. I had forgotten that they were in the process of remodeling many of the first and basement levels of the temples. Due to a valley flood this past summer, many of the structures had been severely damaged; many beyond repair. Also, because of this event, a deeper cell was discovered below the farthest building, directly behind the one we were currently walking through. It had been constructed in 1799. 

 Allegedly, the architect hung himself from the balcony after realizing he had designed the structure backwards. After his death, a close colleague had the other buildings constructed, and a new buggy path created, to give the illusion that his friend's design was intentional. Unfortunately, this good friend passed on during construction, and no one felt it was right to continue without him. Thus, the circular design of six buildings became the semi-circle of three buildings with the only other building (the one the architect hung himself in) being centered behind. Inside this separated building lay the chapel. In 1844, as many reformations were sweeping the Americas, a book written by one of the nuns tells the story of a drifter in need of food and rest stumbling drunkenly into the chapel one night. The only one awake to aid the man was the abbas, or father, of the monastery. Father Othur Borkowski had recently lost his sister to yellow fever. She had taken a trip south to speak with their family for additional finances to fix up the chapel. When she came back she was infected. Father Borkowski blamed himself, as he was feeling ill and sent her to speak on his behalf. These heavy thoughts had left his teachings less than desirable, and with his own faith teetering he began to lose the focus from those of the fold, as well as, a large piece of himself. He had begun to feel the ill side effects of devastation; decaying through whispers of past, present, and future. And finally this night had come. The drunken drifter sat down on the floor at the feet of Jesus Christ, and began devouring his bounty delivered by one of the sisters by order of Father Borkowski. And with the food still in his jowls, he began to explain to the Father the nature of this visitation. The abbas took little attention to his words at first, but when the stranger sat down his plate there were four distinct pagan symbols contrived from the leavings of his meal. Before the Father could speak the blade was already twisting in his heart. The drifter had informed him that the winds of change had blown in from the Old World; there was to be a pagan revival. The blood leapt out of Borkowski onto the toes of Christ and he fell dead. The sister that had delivered the drifter‚Äôs meal came screaming to the Father‚Äôs body. The drifter quickly snatched her up and pushed her face towards the bottom of the crucifix. He made her lick and suck the blood off of the Christ and informed her that these were the last droplets of her savior‚Äôs that she would ever imbibe. He proceeded to rape and kill most of the inhabitants, sparing only three sisters that brokenly agreed to fulfill every deviant desire he could summon. Some of the writing becomes incomprehensible at this point, but what is clear as that two of the sisters birthed many children. Meanwhile, when she was found to be barren, the third sister was bound in a dungeon and sexually assaulted by the others, including the unholy children. Some of which, we‚Äôre only seven years old. The rest of the text is inked in blood and excrement. And seems to be an incantation, of sorts, calling on a holy guardian angel for the purpose of communing with demons.
 The things I know for certain are that I recognize the ceremony performed, and that the recipe for holy anointing oil is accurate with biblical scripture. I surmise from this that the ceremony was performed on these very grounds, and that the gateway that the pagan drifter opened is very much still open.
 The humble priests and nuns that reside in this place now are prone to diseases and mental illness. Though they remain dedicated to the mission of restoration of this intended holy place, and are more than willing to martyr themselves for the cause. My purpose here is to document their struggles and find out as much about the truth behind this insidious story as possible. By whatever means necessary, but within three days.
 She‚Äôs already distracting me. I can‚Äôt remember how long it‚Äôs been. Why can‚Äôt I remember? 
 We are in our quarters. She‚Äôs unpacking and examining the rooms, while I am setting up my work station. Creating my own little corner of hell, with pictures and articles tacked up like the parent of a kidnapping victim‚Äòs living room, I begin to wonder if this bothers Leah, or amuses her.
  Focus, Dammit!
 The ritual is eighteen months. I wish I had the time. It‚Äôs often that my heart wants too much out of life. There‚Äôs a freezer in my head where desires dance in icy phantasmagoric despair; an inescapable pit with a window. The only relief being the foggy days when they can‚Äôt see how close their manifestation is to reality. They await the thaw, as some do heaven or nirvana.
 Back during our walk-through, there was an African-American family of four sitting on an ill-made pew outside of the chapel. The sister showing us around told me that they have been here for a year. Apparently, a Hoodoo priest denounced his religion after the appearance of a ‚Äúman of white-folk magic‚Äù cured his daughter of a long-suffered blindness by placing his hands over her eyes and chanting. He sought out to discover this man‚Äôs origins, and found the temples of Almeissan. He was greeted with open arms by a small family. But, once inside, the mysteries were unveiled, the charming little family‚Äôs faces seemed to age and a swarming of spirits overtook the horrified guest. Quickly, the Hoodoo priest grabbed one of the wandering goats of the temple, as there were many, sank his teeth into its neck, and spit the blood at the family and the floor of the chapel while laying down a Hoodoo protection spell and curse on the evil beings residing in these long deceased humans. The floor became a thick black boiling liquid and the family sank, all laughing in hysterics and swaying to a muddled choir whose voices seem to be rising into the room through the boiling bubbles of tar. The priest ran to save his soul. Upon arriving home to his family, they cried in terror to see his face had been turned white. It speckled off at his neck. Some form of instantaneous vitiligo had taken over his body. His family nurtured him, and attempted numerous spells, but the condition seems to worsen with age. He became rejected by the whites and blacks of the town, alike, and finally, he became a recluse. He lived off the land in the mountains until death. 
 In another legend, after living out most of his life alone in the forest, he returned to burn down the Temples of Almeissan. But, as the sister telling me the story noted, they are still very much here. And, as for the family, they are great-descendants whom have sworn to guard the evil from returning. Their family lineage is actually responsible for the reformation of the temples. 
 When a group of church officials arrived, just passing through town, the family pleaded with them to stay and reclaim these unholy grounds for the ‚Äúlight.‚Äù After hearing the family‚Äôs story and finding the documents of the unholy converted sister, they immediately began a renovation. After several years, the officials informed the family that everything was in order and safe, and that they could return to their lives and be happy. But the grandmother of the family refused to leave. She insisted that no one was to be trusted to care for these lands other than her descendants. The officials, refusing to argue, gave the family all the accommodations they could possibly need. So much so even, that they blasphemously allowed them to practice their religious beliefs on the grounds, and still do to this day.
 I wonder how they take to my presence here for awhile. Maybe a Hoodoo blessing is just the kind of thing that would set me right. I‚Äôll have to channel my courage to speak with them on this. Not tonight, though. I need to let the spirits come. I need to be told what it is that makes this place a breeding ground for dark arts. Not from the superstitious locals, but from the source.
 I notice her remove her bra, and I try to relax. Settling into bed with her is always a fight with lust, love, and angst. That is, unless we‚Äôve agreed to have sex before nestling in. I want her so bad. I can taste her sweat beginning to trickle out of the pours of my tongue‚Äôs memory. I slam my eyes shut and conjure a deep sleep over my mind and body. My soul needs to travel tonight. I let it dance and salivate in anticipation of departure. 
 She presses up against me, and I feel her undying love wrap me up. I am safe with her. Is she safe with me? Especially, considering the state of things and the place we‚Äôre in, can I trust myself to protect her from the outside forces? How strong am I really in comparison to the sorcerer that came before me?
 Am I going to be able to sleep tonight?",2,1751929445.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
