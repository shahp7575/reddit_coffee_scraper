>While 'FLU' is shown on the display, the user should perform a flush until 'rdY/Go' is shown on the display. To do this, keep the portafilter clamped and place a tall cup under the portafilter spout.

Users across Amazon use fast visuals to choose between numerous items and make well-informed buying decisions.

¬†The combination of visual aids through Amazon comparison images presents a major advantage to Amazon FBA sellers in the marketplace. Through clear presentation of differences and advantages and leadership attributes your images make customers identify your product as the superior choice instantly.

¬†Correctly implemented Amazon comparison images create immediate attention which leads to both higher credibility in your listings and more conversions along with separate listing positioning.¬†

The time has come to convert undecided shoppers into devoted customers. Your product listings can reach higher heights through well-planned comparison images.

*Explore More:*¬†[*How To Supercharge Amazon CTR for Your Unique Product Listings*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/)

# Make the Design Simple and Neat

It should not be very difficult for you to figure out the easy comparison image. Amazon shoppers make purchasing decisions in a snap, literally, given they make purchasing decisions in seconds after viewing a product listing.

¬†Too much text, flashy graphics and distracting background in your comparison image make it hard for buyers to pick out the important differences between your product and the others.

It is about maintaining only the needed information in a structured manner to create a clean design. For instance, if you are selling a stainless steel water bottle, you have three main points that you could beat compared to: durability, insulation time, and leak proof design.

* Take away long descriptions under each feature and just simply write short, direct text like ‚ÄòKeeps Water Cold for 24 Hours‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòUsing high quality insulation our bottle keeps water cold for the whole day.‚Äô

It also makes the file more readable with a structured layout. Sections should be evenly spaced, and comparison points should be visually different from one another.¬†

The best side by side layout works best in this case as shoppers will be able to quickly differentiate between two products. Place no more than a few elements into a single image at once, so as not to overload the viewer.

* For instance, if you are comparing your water bottle to a plastic alternative, your comparison image should be so clear that there is visual cue on how different they are.¬†
* For instance, after dropping both a dented plastic bottle and your undamaged stainless steel bottle, you could show a real life image of the bottle on your left. Text based comparison of these graphs is much less effective than this kind of visual storytelling.

¬†

Also, try to stay away from colors, shadows, or decorative fonts that decrease the readability. Go for a minimalist design, use the white or light colored background where the product and the key text should easily be focused on.¬†

¬†

# High Quality Image for Professional Look

High quality images are associated with high quality products. It‚Äôs important that your comparison image is not blurry, pixelated or has low resolution product photos because it reflects unprofessionally and your brand as an unreliable one.¬†

Good images to communicate makes a customer feel that they can trust and also feel more credible which will persuade them to choose your product above a competitor‚Äôs product.

Make sure you always use high resolution product photos of your comparison images in order to look professional. Using your own professional product shots instead of stock images is the preferable course.¬†

* Take the screen protectors for a smartphone as an example; their comparison images will include close up, high resolution photos of two phone screens (with and without the protector). There should be a visual difference in clarity, brightness and sharpness to the buyer.

Image quality also depends on lighting. Well-lit images showcase the details of your product more effectively. When photographing your own products, use natural lighting or a lightbox to take the shadows out of your image and have evenly distributed lighting throughout the image.

Image format and resolution is another vital thing in keeping a professional look. Amazon suggests that images have at least 1000 pixels on the longest edge so that the zoom works properly. A comparison image should include all elements that are sharp and legible even when zoomed in.

Lastly, don‚Äôt use heavily edited, unrealistic visuals because this can have customers think they‚Äôre misled. When your product is a kitchen knife, don‚Äôt show a metal cut if your knife is not made for this. False or overly hyped visuals can result in disappointed customers, bad reviews which would hurt your products reputation.

# It‚Äôs Important To Highlight Key Differences You Have That Matter To Buyers

When creating a comparison image it should not be remembered to make comparison on the characteristics influencing the buying decisions. However, some¬†[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-some-training-videos-for-new-amazon-fba-sellers/)¬†often make a mistake of including details that matter little in the buyer‚Äôs choice.¬†

So for instance, if you are talking about the ergonomic office chair, do not say ‚Äòit comes in various colors‚Äô, because it is a matter of personal preference. Instead, highlight differences in:

* Lumbar Support: Is lumbar support adjustable in your competitor‚Äôs chair, which they don‚Äôt do otherwise?
* The chair material quality: Do you have a breathable chair mesh, that you don‚Äôt? Some are made from cheap fabric.
* Weight Capacity: The amount of weight the chair can support often determines its durability, especially when it comes to a longer period of use.

Shoppers don‚Äôt want to just see real benefits, but rather, they expect real benefits that matter to them as they use products in their daily life.¬†

* For instance, if a better lumbar support available in your chair alleviates the back pain, share the comparison image of a user sitting on your chair with the proper posture and compare this to your competitor‚Äôs chair in which the user is not comfortable. Marked improvements in user experience are easy to articulate in comparison to a simple textual depiction on how your product makes a difference.

Also, side by side numbers or statistics help the customers understand the superiority of the product. An effective comparison image for your product, if it were a portable charger, could look like:

* Your charger: 20,000mAh ‚Äì Charges Phone 5x
* Competitor: 10,000mAh ‚Äì Charges Phone 2x

Since these numerical differences are clear, shoppers can easily tell why your product is the better choice.

*Explore More:*[*What Amazon Resources Empower Amazon FBA Brands?*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-amazon-resources-empower-amazon-fba-brands/)

# Contrasting Colors Are Better For Better Readability

Color contrast is critical when designing Amazon comparison images. Choosing the right colors helps to highlight important product features and thereby make it easier to read for the buyers.

Readability is achieved with white text on a black background or with dark text on a light background. Bold, contrasting colors such as red and green can be used in a strategic manner as well. An example is to use:

* Green checkmark for strengths
* Red cross for weaknesses

In doing so, this instantly communicates which product has better values. Comparing your earbuds which have 20 hours battery life with one of your competitors which most probably has 8 hours of battery life in either bold text or green and red highlights will assist shoppers in making a decision in less than a second.

Nevertheless, avoid vivid neon colors and rich backgrounds that will impede readability. Use professional, Amazon approved colors such as:

* White or light gray backgrounds
* Black, blue, or dark gray text for clarity
* Green for positive features, red for disadvantages

The most crucial component of your comparison image should be a well-balanced color scheme that ensures the important points in the image are easily usable without distracting the viewer from your product.

# Use Check Marks and Crosses to Simplify Comparisons

It is quite common for shopping clients to make decisions in a matter of seconds after seeing a product listing. To communicate your product‚Äôs benefits quickly to the client, one very effective way to achieve this is by using green checkmarks (‚úÖ) and red crosses (‚ùå) in a comparison image.¬†

This way of doing product comparisons very simply demonstrates how you are a better provider than your competitors thus making it easier for a customer to decide on something to buy.

* For example, suppose you offer a robot vacuum; a comparison picture may include the main functional differences of self-charge capability, HEPA filter inclusion, and runtime. What do you think about a simple yet effective design like ‚ÄúSelf-Charging:¬†‚úÖ¬†| Competitor:¬†‚ùå‚Äù and ‚ÄúHEPA Filter:¬†‚úÖ¬†| Competitor:¬†‚ùå‚Äù with a straightforward layout? Online buyers usually browse rather than read every word, so such a straightforward visual format is meant to understand at a glance.

To reach the desired outcome, it‚Äôs essential that the written content is larger than or at least equal to the font size of one ‚Äúcapitalized‚Äù typeface, in capital letters. The distinctiveness of being ‚Äúbold‚Äù will be mainly in its physical dimension.

¬†The reason for requiring such a big font is that people usually do their Amazon-related work on their mobile phones. The readability factor thus remains a critical factor.¬†

Firstly, you should care that the difference between your text and symbols and those of your competitors are their smallest and recognizable proportions, don‚Äôt you think?¬†

People will not send this part of the process directly to the product page if it is too small. In addition, enhancing the clarity of differences using clean and uncomplicated designs is the other side of the ‚Äúcomparison‚Äù sword, proceeding to the purchase is very expensive.

¬†

# Keep Text Short and Direct

Shoppers on Amazon are not usually the type of users who do thorough investigations of attributes in lengthy product descriptions among various images. In fact, they tend to look for important straightforward information to quickly confront the fact and buy the product.¬†

Conversely, putting an image with many, long sentences as well as non-related and elaborated points in one area would not probably be the best approach. Preference should then be given to short phrases which would instantly take in the substance of the advertisement.

* For instance, in the case of a smartwatch, an excellent comparison image should highlight crucial differentiators, like battery longevity, water resistance, and the ability to monitor heart rates. A simple and focused method such as ‚ÄúBattery Life: 24H vs. 8H‚Äù or ‚ÄúWaterproof: Yes vs. No‚Äù will allow customers to be able to compare the quality of various products without further explanation.¬†
* Instead of saying that ‚ÄúOur smartwatch lasts 24 hours on a single charge, whereas the competitor‚Äôs only lasts 8 hours‚Äù, using ‚ÄúBattery Life: 24H vs. 8H‚Äù makes the image more powerful.

This approach is particularly advantageous for mobile users as it does not drown them in excessive text. By ensuring that the most pertinent selling points are clearly visible right away, Amazon FBA sellers can improve user engagement and encourage conversion.

# Ensure Accurate and Honest Comparisons

Nevertheless, while pointing out the benefits of a product is important, overestimating its functions or making deceptive claims can have a negative effect on the brand in the long run.¬†

Customers prefer honesty, and if they feel misguided, it can cause bad reviews, returns, or even grievances that might damage the¬†[Amazon FBA seller‚Äôs](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-mws-keys-essential-for-fba-sellers/)¬†integrity. Furthermore, Amazon has strict regulations against misleading statements, and non-compliance can result in suspension of the listing.

* For instance, if a running shoe weighs 200 grams, proclaiming it as the ‚Äúlightest shoe ever‚Äù without any industry-wide data can be a gamble. Instead, it is better to make a comparison image that shows some factual differences such as ‚ÄúWeight: 200g vs. 300g‚Äù, where customers‚Äô opinions on which one is better would be based on real differences seen by them.

¬†Moreover, by providing actual, verifiable disparities, sellers build credibility and maintain their account status with compliance with Amazon policies.

¬†

# Use Side-by-Side Product Shots for Visual Impact

One of the limitations with plain words is that they seldom can communicate all the beneficial features or characteristics of a product. By showing side-by-side photos of the real things, one can note the outstanding differences in a zealous and persuasive way.

¬†That is one of the best techniques that one can use to show a product‚Äôs features like its robustness, size, or any improvements in the quality of the product.

* So for instance, when advertising a water-consuming appliance, it will be quite effective to place an illustration of a water bottle filled through a filter and a competitor‚Äôs one that is cloudy from hard water minerals besides it.¬†
* The customer can see the good performance of the filter the product has by just looking at the pictures. Likewise, a stain removal agent could also be promoted using a picture taken before and one taken after the cleaning process to depict how effective it was on the surface.

For the most impact, it is crucial the pictures of the product to be of high resolution and well-illuminated so that it is very easy to observe the differences. This method helps in enhancing credibility and creating an entertaining experience for the participants, thus building strong connections with potential customers.

¬†

# Incorporate Real-World Use Cases

When customers get a real-world example of a product‚Äôs usage, it makes them connect with it better. You can draw stronger emotional and rational appeals by not just stating features but by also having everyday demonstrations.

* For example, when demonstrating the product of noise-filtering headphones, you could use two people: one who is totally enjoying his music in a busy caf√© and the other who is unable to hear any sound and only the noise of the other customers is visible. This transformation in the product‚Äôs evaluation is a clearer way for them to see how it can benefit them in the actual world.

Incorporating applicable use cases into comparison visuals allows sellers to forge a more substantial relationship with their customers, thereby rendering it simpler for them to picture how the product can make a difference in their existence.

¬†

# Highlight Warranty or Customer Support Differences

Warranties and customer support for products remain two significant parameters that affect the purchasing process, particularly, in the case of electronic or major appliances where the price tag is higher.

¬†In the forefront, comparison images should disclose the ability of the product to be one of those for which have longer warranties or also good customer support especially when the product is of high price.

* A comparison wherein the seller is offering a 2-year warranty as an advantage against the competitor‚Äôs 6-month warranty should be emphasized. A comparison image that proclaims ‚ÄúWarranty: 2 Years¬†‚úÖ¬†| 6 Months¬†‚ùå‚Äù instantly assures customers that they are investing in a safer product. The difference in the support features stated like ‚Äú24/7 Customer Support¬†‚úÖ¬†| No Support¬†‚ùå‚Äù would give an extra layer of trust.

The strategy of this could not only make the product more trustworthy but also help to place it as a better option increasing the rate of conversion.

¬†

# Optimize for Mobile Viewing

A great many Amazon consumers search for and buy products through their mobile phones. Abiding therefore by a mobile-friendly design is the most paramount element of a comparison image.¬†

Comparatively, smaller text, over-crowded designs, and too many details can all make it difficult to discern the images on a smaller screen making them much less effective.

[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-the-new-seller-guide-affect-amazon-fba-sales-in-90-days/)¬†should come up with mobile-friendly comparison images by using bold font types, uncomplicated graphical representation, and not against resizing the words for a smaller screen to accommodate more stuff in a photo.¬†

* For example, by the occasion of selling pet brushes that groom the animals, one can make an infographic with the headings, ‚ÄúYes, Gentle Bristles:¬†‚úÖ¬†| No, Harsh Bristles:¬†‚ùå‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes, Pain-Free Grooming:¬†‚úÖ¬†| No, Causes Discomfort:¬†‚ùå.‚Äù The consideration of increasing clarity on mobile platforms and involvement will in the end increase customer interaction and comprehension.

# Showcase Certifications and Safety Standards

The importance of certifications in the perception of the credibility of a product is appreciated. This is one of the three important factors by which the shoppers mainly judge the quality.

¬†The comparison images should be the ones with a big size for the products that have all the certification such as USDA Organic, FDA Approved, or CE Certified.

* If you are selling organic baby lotion, a comparison image that states ‚ÄúUSDA Certified Organic:¬†‚úÖ¬†| No Certification:¬†‚ùå‚Äù instantly distinguishes it from non-certified alternatives. The majority of safety-conscious consumers prefer certified goods instead of those that are not.

Inclusion of certifications in comparison images enhances the product‚Äôs credibility and establishes potential buyers‚Äô trust in the seller.

¬†

# Demonstrate Durability Through Visuals

When the feature of durability is a significant selling point, it should be presented visually, and not only in textual form. Being exposed to a product that demonstrates its ability to resist severe conditions has a more persuasive impact on a potential client than reading about it.

* For instance, if shockproof phone cases are sold, putting a strong comparison image in the selling process that one phone case survives a drop test while a competitor‚Äôs case like a cracked one under the same conditions. It is marketing through visual proof that suggests the reliability of the product and plays a vital role in the purchase decision.

¬†

# Use Infographic-Style Comparisons for Clarity

Network products are quite different and there is often confusion caused between them.¬†[Amazon Infographics](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/)¬†style comparison comes in handy here. And it helps the tech industry, especially with multiple feature comparisons, to be easily digestible.

* For instance, in the case of a fitness tracker one could create a comparison infographic that would showcase battery life, heart rate monitoring, and GPS tracking sections in an organized table manner. A well-structured layout allows customers to determine the principal distinctions without any ambiguity.

¬†

# Align with Amazon‚Äôs Image Guidelines

Amazon has very stringent rules about¬†[product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/are-your-amazon-product-images-speaking-directly-to-buyers-needs/)¬†and any violation could lead to either a listing of the product being withheld or taken down. Competitors‚Äô brand names or logos must not be included in the images.

¬†The comparison images must also have at least 1000 px resolution and they must not contain unreasonable assertions.

By strictly following Amazon‚Äôs regulations, sellers can use their boldness to produce persuasive, rule-adhering comparisons using images which will thus create product exposure and recommend an increase in sales.

# Displaying Before-and-After Results in Comparison Images

# Showcase Real-World Scenarios for Relatability

Before-and-after images can be made more useful by letting them reflect real-life situations that customers can relate to. If the comparison looks so set up or unrealistic, it can lead to the possible buyers getting disconnected from your promotional material.

¬†Realistic body language will highlight the vital aspects of the customer‚Äôs lifestyle in which the product fits in a way that the user easily simulates, increasing the purchase likelihood.

* For example, a vacuum cleaner brand may display a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù shot of a carpet almost fully covered with pet hair, real dirt, and crumbs which is later by the perfect clean ‚Äúafter‚Äù photo showing the same rug. This not only gives an account of the proficiency of the product but also resonates with the comparison best with the pet owners and family-tied households. Instead of merely declaring boldness as a capability of the vacuum, the practical approach shows the action of this feature.
* Another example is a furniture polish brand that shows an old wooden table with scratches, stains, and dullness in the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù image, followed by a brilliant, polished surface in the ‚Äúafter‚Äù image. This comparison allows clients to project their product usage scenarios and visualize, instead of just being mere assumptions made on generic claims the polarity of which is not real.

More specifically, the consumers of the day are often the same people portrayed in the before-and-after visuals of the campaign. For example, a teeth-whitening product may feature the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù image as the stained teeth of a coffee drinker and the ‚Äúafter‚Äù image as those of the person with noticeably whiter teeth.¬†

This directly addresses the teeth discoloration problem of coffee consumers, making the change more relatable.

To increase credibility, applying real client photos in before-and-after images tends to fortify the aspect of relatability. The product‚Äôs genuineness is increased when shoppers see others like them achieving the goals that similar products promised.

¬†To boost the feeling of credibility and the fact that many others like them are also in the same boat, you may want users to submit actual before-and-after images with brief testimonials of their own.

By making sure that the transformations are talking through common matters and solutions, the before-and-after images become useful and allow for more emotional connections with buyers. In other words, a person is more likely to try a product if they can imagine themselves getting similar results.

¬†

# Guarantee That Differences Are Noticeable at a Glance

This is the way that a before-and-after comparison becomes successful, that is when the difference is perceptible right from the start. If shoppers have trouble telling which one‚Äôs the before and which one‚Äôs the after, the whole image is wasted.

¬†The change should be evident enough that the viewer, even if he just glances at the photo, can catch the improvement.

* For example, a weight-loss supplement can utilize an approach in which the data is shown in the way of a graphic. The initial state before the product is applied is shown to the side of the new dimension after its use with a clear decrease in the size. If the difference is insignificant, then focusing on the specifics of the change, such as an apparent reduction in the waist circumference, can help to realize the transition more obviously. In the absence of a general change, users may not believe in the power of the item they would like to buy.
* Likewise, a car headlight restoration kit would require a photo of a uniformed, yellowed headlight in the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù scenario and a clearly seeing bright headlight in the ‚Äúafter‚Äù one. If the two images are not contrasting enough, then the effect of the enhanced image will be equal to none. Such instances as the angle change, the lighting change, or finally the cropping of the image in a way that it highlights the difference can be smart options to take up.

In such cases, the creators of e-commerce mobile platforms must take extra care to build satisfactory transformations. A shopper uses their mobile device for inquiring and once they find what they are looking for, she or he instantly moves on to browse other items.¬†

The devices differ significantly in size and resolution; therefore to guarantee the overview finishes fruitful one should see the image sizes supplied in the mockups with.

If the users are to trust the product, the changes should be shown visibly as in normal circumstances; For example, a kind of wrinkle remover should clearly reveal the difference between being untouched and treated. It is the only way to ensure that customers are aware of the improvement.

Optimized before-and-after shots give a significant lift in click-through and¬†[conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-tips-to-increase-amazon-conversion-rate-2022/)¬†on Amazon. They would be inclined to try the product if they immediately recognized the difference with no hassle. This fact orders customer beliefs about product effectiveness and their actions of purchase.¬†

* For example, creators can use the above case. Just like normal people, these objects look different when they are in other places due to a lack of recognition. The maturation machines are repeated after such phases. A sample of before and after putting it on very dry skin showed it healing. The product should not be assumed to promote huge miraculous changes in the users that look not at all ordinary.¬†

Rather, it should look like it‚Äôs for women who had not sun-tanned. And such an easy job becomes difficult for them to believe. Because of that, they will not use it. If the user is afraid of being straight then she/he decides to purchase a product that facilitates this task.¬†

The only way to give her safety is to show her ‚ÄúHere I am, a girdle. Therefore, let someone see this ugly chair.‚Äù The message is unclear. And psychological factors are at play.

# Limit Over-Editing or Misleading Enhancements

Manipulating photos by correcting colors or cropping is standard procedure. Continuing with excessive manipulation can lead to disbelief.¬†

When customers feel that before-and-after photos are excessively altered, they immediately get suspicious and reject the product. This is the main reason they would not buy such a product.¬†

For customers, genuine representation is most important, and anything that implies digital alteration can result in doubts about the product‚Äôs reliability.

* To illustrate, the ideal image of a stretch mark removal cream must clearly display the way the stretch marks become lighter than before, rather than removing them completely through Photoshop. Too perfect transformations would make people think that the results are not true but rather artificial and not really achieved by the product. More of a realistic strategy is when stretch marks are less noticeable but are not totally gone and thus are more trustworthy.
* For instance, a teeth-whitening product that brightens the ‚Äúafter‚Äù image to an unnatural level can create the perception of manipulation. Instead, keeping the lighting and exposure levels of both images consistent so it appears real is possible.

Amazon‚Äôs rules are very strict about posting a fake image of a product and over-altering images can cause compliance problems. If customers feel misled, they can report the listing or write a bad review that deteriorates the brand‚Äôs credibility.

Utilizing images taken by actual customers can also help mitigate doubt. If real users post pictures of their results that are not changed, the authenticity ensures potential buyers. Having a disclaimer like ‚ÄúResults vary according to individual usage‚Äù also assists in managing expectations while retaining transparency.

By ensuring the representation of real life through¬†[before and after](https://medium.com/@rochelle.ellul/before-and-after-c2f8119ebf29)¬†images, customers will build trust and see the product‚Äôs claims as the truth. When transformations are represented truthfully, customers tend to be assured and make purchases confidently.

¬†

# Use Split-Screen Images for Direct Comparisons

The split-screen image layout combines before and after images into one easy-to-view format that has more impact.

¬†Instead of asking customers to scroll through two separate images, the split-screen format presents the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù comparative states together, thereby making the comparison immediate and effective because of its visibility.

* For instance, a shoe cleaning product displays one half of the sneaker with dirt and the other part untouched. With this technique, viewers easily recognize the transformation while their focus is not diverted.
* A similar thing can be achieved for the cleaning spray brand by choosing a greasy stove top on the left and a clean, shiny cooking surface on the right. This way of comparison is visually simple, and makes the product‚Äôs cleaning power clear.

Split-screen images have a unique connectivity for mobile shoppers, hence, easy comparison is possible without the need for several clicks or extensive zooming.

¬†Customers are not only more likely to be inclined toward the product when they can see the change instantly but they will also tend to be more convinced by the product‚Äôs effectiveness.

# Use Clear and High-Quality Images for Instant Recognition

The image quality is what either hinders or helps a shopper notice a product‚Äôs transformation process. Vague, pixelated, or poorly lit images do not hold attention, thus making communication of the intended message difficult.¬†

Sharp and clear images help to ensure the buyer‚Äôs attention is captured at its fullest as the contrast of ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù is straightforward enough to see even if we are scrolling through the listing fairly fast.

* Consider, for example, the functionality of an acne treatment serum being sold by a brand in the online marketplace. It should be guaranteed that the images show and are representative of the color, texture, and impurities of the skin before and after treatment.¬†
* In case the customer‚Äôs skin in the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù image was blurry while the ‚Äúafter‚Äù image was sharp, it is likely to cope with their doubts that the transformation is real. Professional photography is indeed important in this regard. An improvement in the results of before-and-after photos is guaranteed by using the right high-resolution camera, light, and a plain background.

Mobile shoppers require images that are much more detailed and perfect for lighting in order to distinguish those small changes. Numerous people shop on their phones on Amazon, so it is easy to miss an unclear before-and-after comparison, which diminishes its effectiveness.¬†

The clarity of product images, in addition to engaging users, is also instrumental in demonstrating a user‚Äôs product trust.¬†

* Having the right light settings helps in showing the subtle difference like hair color or night cream, for example, which ensures the transformation is evident and customers don‚Äôt have to zoom or squint to see the change.

In addition, optimization of the file size guarantees that the images load rapidly without any loss of quality. Prospective buyers might leave the webpage before proceeding with the product, which will ultimately frustrate them when the images are gradually appearing.¬†

Amazon, however, states that images are best presented with a white background, as they are more visible and professional. Following these tips could largely increase the conversion rates since the customers will prefer the products that are visually powerful and show good quality.

It is also vital that¬†[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/whats-an-amazon-fnsku-how-to-create-an-fnsku-for-fba-sellers/)¬†make sure their products are in alignment with the Amazon guidelines as misleading enhancements or over-editing are to be avoided.

¬†If the overly touched photos look suspicious customers will suspect them to be fake and eventually leave negative comments if the product does not match the experience they had.¬†

Rather than an overly edited product, the brand should take genuinely photographed before-and-after pictures and let the viewers be the judge of the effectiveness.

By allowing imagination to be king and that interesting stories that truly shine and draw people to their image are kind of captivating, excited talking to their images too, more are becoming the bestsellers in the world of Amazon.¬†

Good strategy like this should be effective on its own anyway, while its customers are doing the heavy lifting, giving it a stunning smile and spotting it on a shelf. This type of marketing builds trust and also generates engagement leading to sales and favorable customer reviews.

¬†

# Consistent Background and Angle for Authenticity are Crucial

When it comes to playing after the quality of the picture, it is one of the most critical factors. Any change in the background, the light or the angle of the camera, can be misleading and create doubts in the mind of the buyer about the women and eventually product but not by them.¬†

Using an identical background allowed buyers to believe in the change brought about by the product instead of showing them just the different angles of the pictures.

* For instance, the model of a teeth-whitening product, in both ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù images should have the same background, lighting due to conditions, and the subject being in the same position. If the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo has to be shot in low light while the ‚Äúafter‚Äù photo, even in daylight, is very different; customers may think that this change is due to artificial light and not the product itself.¬†

This can lead to distrust and prevent conversions. An environment where one has control over the light conditions would remain the same to produce an image representing the product at its true effect.

* One of the most frequent blunders made by Amazon FBA sellers is employing different angles for the ‚Äúafter‚Äù image. In case the angle of a customer‚Äôs grin in the teeth-whitening kit ‚Äúbefore‚Äù image is very different from that in the ‚Äúafter‚Äù photo, it might look designed to manipulate the transformation purposely. The customer can assess the transformation with the assurance that the angles are equal.
* A skincare brand, presenting a dark spot removal cream, should be the same in positioning the model when showcasing the product. If the model in the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù images turns their face differently, the real effect may not be obvious; thus, the power of a visual comparison may be lost.¬†

Keeping the subject in the same pose makes it look more relevant and the change more believable. Consistency of the before-and-after images can be guaranteed through the use of a tripod and constant lighting equipment.¬†

Professional product photographers usually work in a controlled studio environment in which the lighting is always the same, thereby ensuring that the same conditions are assigned to each image round.¬†

When it comes to capturing images submitted by customers, sellers should include clear instructions on how to take identical background images and angles to ensure authenticity.

Basically, in my first year of uni, which was last year, I stayed in halls. I slowly started to spiral after my first month and became obsessed with losing weight, and nothing else mattered. I cut off all contact with everyone I knew (including my family), and I didn‚Äôt actually make any friends in my first year, so I could lock myself in my uni room to starve. I would make sure that I had no food in my room or the kitchen, apart from zero cal energy drinks and black coffee. 
All of my memories of first year are pretty much centred around the things that I did to lose weight, and things that happened to me because of it. I remember spending most nights unable to sleep due to the stabbing stomach pain from hunger, and acid corroding my empty stomach, which has given me permanent stomach and health issues. I would go up to 72hrs at a time not eating a single calorie and not moving from my bed, trying to see how much longer I could starve for each time. On days when I did eat more than I had planned, I would go to the gym or go and exercise at ungodly hours, or just walk around all day. I ended up having to spend the last 3 months of my first year at home because of all the health issues it caused me that I couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore. I became very underweight, but I liked the way that I looked. But then I gained a lot of the weight back because there was food around me again at home, and I just stayed in my room as I felt so ugly and I was too embarrassed to be seen by anyone. My grades were still good because my first year wasn‚Äôt too hard in terms of content.

This year I‚Äôve been trying to also lose weight but not in the same extreme way, as I need energy to study harder content as my degree is pretty competitive. I also ended up making some friends at the start of this year, so losing weight been a constant small thought in the back of my mind  rather than my main focus. But it‚Äôs ramadan now and I that just gave me an excuse to spiral back and I can feel I just have no energy all the time and that life really has no purpose. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even care so much about the religious side of fasting, I just want to lose weight so badly so that I can finally be pretty but it causes me so much pain and loneliness. I‚Äôm also not really that close to friends I had at the start of the year now, so it‚Äôs easier for me to not eat because I don‚Äôt have to make excuses or pretend. 
The worst part is that while I know I am losing weight, I feel like I still look the same, so it‚Äôs not enough. I really don‚Äôt want to admit all of this to a professional or a gp because I don‚Äôt want to be labelled as anorexic or get told to go to inpatient treatment or something, and that would probably make my family to find out (I‚Äôm not really too close with them so it would be really bad). 

I‚Äôm so jealous of naturally skinny people, I‚Äôm tired of how much this consumes my mind, I just want to know if anyone else out there can maybe relate to me.

# Crossed Bay for Shave But His Beard Caught Up

By MARY C. LEWIS

Mrs. John Rhind of Ephraim brought in these reflections based upon the 1902 diary of Mary C. Lewis, Chicagoan who first came to Ephraim with her family at the turn of the century. The Lewises vacationed at Anderson hotel, later built a home in Ephraim.

\[Mrs. John Rhind is Eleanor Rhind.\]

Ephraim has become one of the most popular and always has been one of the loveliest summer resorts in the Great Lakes region. Some of us old-timers, however, look back with a feeling of nostalgia to the days of long-ago when we first became acquainted with the little fishing village on the shores of Green Bay. How we enjoyed the long boat trip from Chicago. In 1902 when my sister and I first visited Ephraim, we left Chicago on the S.S. Sheboygan at 8 p.m. on a Wednesday. We sailed through Sturgeon Bay canal, down to Green Bay city, up to Escanaba and down to Eph¬≠raim, arriving on Saturday at 2:30 p.m.

We had a fine big room at the Olson house‚Äînow Hill¬≠side. In my journal I find the following description:

‚ÄúAbove us on the bluff is Stonewall Cottage where Mrs. Valentine serves us our meals. It is a pretty little house with a wide porch on two sides, from which there is a fine view over the bay. Mrs. Valen¬≠tine takes only a few roomers but serves excellent meals to from 15 to 20 people.‚Äù

When my father came up later in the summer he en¬≠gaged a room at Stonewall Cottage, but because of the overlapping of the schedules of north and south bound steamers, there was no room for him there the first night. So Mrs. Torgenson, who lived in the present Wilson home, agreed to take him in for one night for the sum of 25c. Then she decided it was a good deal of trouble to bother about sheets, etc., for one night, so Mrs. Valentine agreed to furnish bedding and my father was to pay half price. Thus he paid 13c for his first night‚Äôs lodging in Eph¬≠raim.

There were no hotels in town then‚Äîonly a few places where guests were accommo¬≠dated. No autos raced through the streets. Cows grazed peacefully along the road sides. Sail boats and fishing tugs were anchored at the Anderson dock and at the old wood dock at the south end of the bay. Two of those, early sail boats, lovely and graceful, the Arrow and the Ebenezer, have been photographed or painted by many a young ar¬≠tist. The latter had about finished its days of usefulness that first summer and Capt. Olson and Capt. Hogansen who owned her jointly used to row out alternate mornings to pump her out. Then Susan and I would watch from our window and hum to ourselves, ‚ÄúHere I raise my Ebenezer.‚Äù

\[‚ÄúHere I raise my Ebenezer‚Äù is the beginning of the second verse of ‚ÄúCome Thou Fount of Every Blessing‚Äù: [https://namethathymn.com/christian-hymns/come-thou-fount-lyrics.html](https://namethathymn.com/christian-hymns/come-thou-fount-lyrics.html) \]

The stage came in every day from Sturgeon Bay with mail and freight and perhaps a passenger or two. If we wanted to go for a ride we hired horses and a surrey. Another entry in my journal is:

‚ÄúMr. Anderson drove us to Baileys Harbor across the peninsula and nine miles from here. The drive took about three hours and we greatly enjoyed it. Mr. Anderson himself is a very interesting and agreeable young man. He and his six sisters and two brothers make one of the most influential families in the town. They own the dock and warehouse and the store at the head of the dock.‚Äù

By the next summer Mrs. Valentine had built an addi¬≠tion to her cottage with a large dining room on the first floor, six bedrooms on the second and three on the third. These attic bedrooms were the habitation of half a dozen of us young women for several summers. The rooms were large with dormer windows and a magnificent view. The journal says: ‚ÄúThe rooms are unplastered but sealed up with cute little closets under the eaves for shoes and nails put up to hang our clothes on.‚Äù

The fact that there were no bathrooms and no electric lights never bothered us at all. There was a pitcher and washbowl in every room and a little kerosene lamp. Hot water could be obtained in the morning by placing a little pail of water on two big nails laid across the top of the lamp chimney. And besides we had the whole of Green Bay to bathe in.

Our pastimes were simple but exciting. On pleasant eve¬≠nings the bay would be dotted with row boats filled with folks enjoying the moonlight or playing with the echo under the bluff or singing, with two or three boats fastened together. Twice a week in the parlors of the Olson home ice cream with soda crackers was served to the public.

That summer of 1903 saw the first tennis court set up in Ephraim. A group of us sought out a pasture half a mile back of Stonewall Cot¬≠tage level enough to use. Then we persuaded Mrs. Valentine, who was always cooperative in planning sports, to ask the owners, two old ladies who lived in the first lane, to let us use the land. At first the ladies refused because ‚Äúgames were wicked,‚Äù but the offer of a dollar on the spot and an¬≠other at the end of the season converted them. Then we hunted up some lime and an old broom and marked out a single court where many live¬≠ly games were played.

The most thrilling of sports was sailing. We would sail to the island and walk all around it as there were no buildings on it then, or to Shanty Bay and walk across to the Light House. Sometimes Capt. Hoganson would take out 10 or 15 in his pound boat and be¬≠sides managing the sails would sing Norwegian songs in his native tongue. Or a party would sail to Little Sister Bay in the afternoon and others would come by hay¬≠rack, bringing provisions with them. Bacon and eggs and coffee would be cooked over bon fires and marshmallows toasted and then all would ride home singing all the way.

Every able-bodied person went on hikes. Often a party would walk to Fish Creek on the highway and come back by the eight mile trail through the woods which are now in the State Park. Or a group would walk along the upper road to a point just north of Knudson Hotel and there strike into the woods and follow the ‚ÄúIndian trail‚Äù along the shore to Little Sister Bay.

When Goodrich steamers came in on a (more or less) regular schedule, it was a fa¬≠vorite stunt to take the steam¬≠er to Fish Creek or Sister Bay and walk back or vice versa. The young lads of Ephraim used to climb up to the top deck of the S.S. Carolina as she came into the dock and dive from there into the bay. The captain finally forbade this stunt as too dangerous. So one day at Fish Creek, three young ladies in long skirts and picture hats boarded the Carolina, paid their fare and mounted to the top deck. As the steamer came into the dock at Ephraim, much to the consternation of passengers and those watching from the dock, the three young ladies rose from their chairs, jump¬≠ed onto the railing and dived. The two Hardin boys and Bob¬≠by Morrison shook off their mothers‚Äô skirts and hats and had a good swim.

North of the dock among the balsams and white birches along the shore, several cot¬≠tages were built, mostly by professional people, so that the group was called ‚ÄúProfessors‚Äô Row.‚Äù The people in the row were most congenial and had many good times together. Usually on Sunday evenings there was a community supper, every family bringing its contribution. On rainy days, and there are some in Ephraim, the ladies would gather in one of the cottages with sewing or knitting and one of the group would read aloud. Later on men would come in and there would be a ‚Äúkaffee klatch.‚Äù

When the Foldas were building their cottage on the island they used to come over in their launch and gather all the folk along the row and take them over to the island where bon fires wore built and freshly caught fish and bacon, etc., were cooked for a picnic supper. The completed house was a center for most delightful hospitality. The great living room, 30 by 40 ft. was the scene of many a gay party.

Picnics were a most popular form of sport. One place to which all enjoyed going was the Marshall Farm. Two or three carriage loads would drive to the farm, take their baskets out to the rocks along North Bay and prepare their dinner in the ‚Äúplayhouse.‚Äù Another favorite trip was to Europe Bay. We would drive out in Mr. Anderson‚Äôs three seated surrey and have dinner on the lovely sand beach. Then we would walk along the shore and through pine woods to that beautiful little sheet of water, Europe Lake.

For several years the Hart line of small steamers used to send their boats up and down Green Bay and they stopped at Ephraim with some regularity. Then it was that we found it a convenient way to come from Chicago, to take the train to Menominee, stay over night at a pleasant hotel there and then cross the bay the next morning on a Hart boat.

One summer my father, who hated to shave himself, decided to take a boat across the bay to Menominee to visit a barber, returning by the late afternoon steamer. It seemed a good plan, but the captain of the return boat took a notion to go up to Escanaba before coming to Ephraim, so that when my father finally got back he was ready for another shave.

The little Moravian church was attended by most of the summer people, as in those early days services in the Lutheran church were conducted in the Norwegian language. All loved the little church and many helped in the services, preaching, giving lectures, playing the small organ or singing. I remember one double quartet that rendered good service most of one summer.

Those were good old days. The folks who lived in the village had time to visit with the summer visitors and we all knew each other and to¬≠gether enjoyed the lovely scenery, the songs of the birds, and fragrance of the firs and pines.

1jfn7a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tom_Walker/comments/1jfn7a9/the_puppet_masters_bible_by_tom_walker_a_deep/,"""The Puppet Master's Bible"" by Tom Walker: A Deep Dive Review","**When Amazon Algorithms Know You Too Well**  
  
I'll be honest... I wasn't planning to buy another self-help book. My bookshelf is already crying uncle under the weight of half-read tomes promising to revolutionize my life in 21 days or less. But there I was, scrolling through Amazon at 11 PM (classic mistake) when ""The Puppet Master's Bible"" popped up in my recommendations. The algorithm knows me too well, and that title... well, it was either going to be brilliantly insightful or spectacularly creepy.  
  
Spoiler alert: it's both.  
  
The shipping was impressively fast, though FedEx decided to play their favorite game of ""Is This Your Package or Your Neighbor's?"" and left it at the wrong address. A quick email to the seller resulted in a replacement copy arriving within 48 hours, complete with a handwritten note apologizing for the inconvenience. Points for customer service right out of the gate.  
  
When the book finally arrived, I was immediately struck by the boldness of its presentation. The title alone carries a certain provocative weight. Add the subtitle ""Pull the hidden strings of the mind to win hearts and open wallets,"" and you've got something that feels almost forbidden. It's like the book equivalent of that friend who always has slightly questionable but undeniably effective advice.  
  
**What You're Getting Into: Overview of the Book**  
  
Let's get this out of the way early: this isn't a gentle, feel-good guide to better communication. Walker has created something far more candid and, at times, unsettling. This is a comprehensive manual on the mechanics of persuasion, influence, and what some might call manipulation. The book doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of these skills, but it also doesn't revel in them either.  
  
Structured across eight detailed chapters, Walker takes readers through everything from the fundamentals of how our brains process information to specific linguistic patterns that can bypass critical thinking. The book covers:  
  
1. The hidden strings of influence that shape everyday decisions  
2. How our brains process information and make (or don't make) rational choices  
3. The power of deep listening and empathy in persuasion  
4. Core human desires that drive all behavior  
5. How villains and narratives shape our perception  
6. The linguistic patterns that can rewire thinking  
7. Building trust and emotional connections  
8. (And several other chapters I haven't fully explored yet)  
  
What makes this book different from other persuasion texts is its unflinching honesty. Tom Walker repeatedly points out the ethical implications of these techniques, essentially saying: ""Here's how this works. Here's how it can be misused. Now you decide."" It's refreshingly straightforward, if occasionally uncomfortable.  
  
**The First Three Chapters: Where Things Get Real**  
  
**Chapter 1: The Power You Didn't Know You Had**  
  
The book opens with a sobering premise: you're not in control of your decisions. Walker kicks things off by systematically dismantling the idea of free will and autonomous choice, arguing that most of our decisions are manipulated by external forces we don't even notice.  
  
His example of standing in the cereal aisle, feeling like you're making a rational choice while being unconsciously guided by marketing tactics, hit uncomfortably close to home. I literally stopped reading to check my kitchen cabinets, and yep‚Äîthere was the sugary cereal with the cartoon mascot that I'd ""chosen"" last week at the grocery store.  
  
What really struck me was Walker's explanation of the two routes of persuasion (central and peripheral). The central route involves careful, logical consideration, while the peripheral route relies on emotional cues and shortcuts. Guess which one marketers, politicians, and basically everyone trying to influence you depends on? Yep, the lazy peripheral route, because it's faster and we humans are, well, kind of lazy when it comes to thinking.  
  
There's a bit in this chapter about how even your choice of latte is predetermined by factors you're not aware of that made me side-eye my morning coffee ritual. Am I really choosing oat milk because I prefer it, or because it was strategically placed and marketed to make me feel virtuous? These aren't comfortable questions, but they're exactly why the book is valuable.  
  
**Chapter 2: The Hidden Strings of the Mind**  
  
If Chapter 1 made me question my cereal choices, Chapter 2 had me rethinking basically every opinion I've ever held. Walker dives deep into how our brains process information, and it's not flattering.  
  
The section on neural synchronization was fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. Apparently, when we share experiences like watching the same video or listening to the same speech, our brains literally sync up, aligning our emotional responses without our awareness. This explains why crowds behave as a unit and why viral content spreads so effectively.  
  
I found myself thinking about a concert I attended last month where thousands of us moved and responded as one entity. At the time, it felt magical. Now it seems more like a case study in mass neural manipulation.  
  
The part about stories bypassing our critical thinking faculties was particularly enlightening. Walker explains how narratives activate our default mode network, essentially shutting down our analytical brain in favor of emotional immersion. This is why we remember stories better than facts and why storytelling is such a powerful persuasion tool.  
  
After reading this chapter, I caught myself analyzing a political ad during a commercial break. The ad contained zero policy details but told an emotional story about the candidate's humble beginnings. Classic narrative manipulation‚Äîand I would have completely missed it before reading this book.  
  
 **Chapter 3: The Neural Rewiring**  
  
This chapter shifts from explaining how we're manipulated to teaching us how to become the manipulators, though Walker frames it more as ""becoming persuasive through empathy.""  
  
The core concept here is revolutionary: the most persuasive people aren't the best talkers, they're the best listeners. Walker introduces a 21-day neural rewiring challenge designed to make empathetic listening an unconscious habit rather than a conscious effort.  
  
I'm only on day 7 of this challenge, but I'm already noticing differences in my conversations. Yesterday, while talking with my neighbor about her landscaping issues (thrilling, I know), I caught myself about to interrupt with my own similar story. Instead, I stayed silent, asked a follow-up question, and watched her entire demeanor change as she felt truly heard.  
  
The science behind this approach is solid. Walker explains how neuroplasticity‚Äîthe brain's ability to form new neural pathways‚Äîcan be harnessed to make empathy and deep listening automatic. By practicing specific exercises daily, you're literally rewiring your brain to prioritize understanding others over being understood yourself.  
  
What I appreciate about this chapter is that it doesn't just tell you to ""be a better listener"" like most self-help books. It provides a specific, science-backed protocol for making that change permanent on a neurological level.  
  
**The Neural Rewiring Protocol: Actually Life-Changing?**  
  
The 21-day neural rewiring protocol deserves special attention because it's both the most practical and potentially the most transformative element of the book.  
  
Walker breaks down the process into three phases:  
  
1. Days 1-7: Building the foundation (observing your current listening habits and practicing brief periods of complete focus on others)  
2. Days 8-14: Deepening empathy through structured exercises (including ""empathy interviews"" where you focus entirely on understanding someone's emotional state)  
3. Days 15-21: Mastering the empathy switch (applying these skills in increasingly challenging situations)  
  
I'm currently in phase one, and it's been eye-opening how often I mentally prepare my response while someone else is still talking. The exercise of maintaining complete focus on another person for even five minutes without thinking about myself is surprisingly difficult. My brain keeps wanting to relate everything back to my own experiences or formulate advice.  
  
The day 4 exercise had me conduct a conversation where I wasn't allowed to talk about myself at all for five minutes. I tried this with a friend over coffee, and about three minutes in, she actually asked if I was feeling okay because I hadn't once said ""That reminds me of when I..."" Talk about a reality check.  
  
Walker claims that mastering this protocol leads to an almost supernatural ability to connect with others and influence their decisions. While I'm not there yet, I can already see how powerful genuine listening can be. When you truly focus on someone, they can feel it. They open up more, trust you more, and‚Äîyes‚Äîbecome more receptive to your ideas.  
  
**Spotting Manipulation in the Wild**  
  
One unexpected benefit of reading this book has been developing a sort of ""manipulation radar"" for everyday situations. Once you understand the mechanics of persuasion, you start seeing them everywhere.  
  
Last week, I was shopping for a new laptop and caught the salesperson using several techniques straight out of Walker's playbook. He created artificial scarcity (""This model is selling out fast""), used social proof (""It's our most popular choice with creative professionals like yourself""), and employed the contrast principle by showing me an outrageously expensive model first to make the one he actually wanted to sell seem reasonable.  
  
Pre-book, I might have fallen for it. Post-book, I recognized each technique and made a more rational decision based on my actual needs rather than the emotional levers he was pulling.  
  
Even more surprising was catching these techniques in my own behavior. During a disagreement with my roommate about household chores, I found myself unconsciously framing the situation as ""us versus the mess"" rather than ""me versus you""‚Äîa classic villainization technique that Walker discusses in Chapter 5. The difference is that now I'm aware of what I'm doing, which allows me to choose whether that framing is helpful or manipulative.  
  
**The Most Uncomfortable Chapter: The Villain Construct**  
  
While I'm still working through the book, I have to mention Chapter 5: ""The Villain Construct."" This chapter argues that every persuasive narrative needs a villain, and that without opposition, there can be no meaningful growth or change.  
  
Walker writes, ""Heroes are frauds. That's the uncomfortable truth. Strip away their villains, and what are they?"" He goes on to explain that we need enemies‚Äîreal or constructed‚Äîto motivate action and create identity.  
  
This chapter made me profoundly uncomfortable, particularly the section on ""Making Your Enemy Work for You,"" which explains how to strategically frame problems, people, or concepts as villains to drive desired behavior.  
  
What's challenging isn't that Tom Walker is wrong‚Äîhe's disturbingly right. Politicians, marketers, and even parents use villain construction all the time. Think about how many product advertisements begin by establishing a problem (the villain) that their product will vanquish.  
  
I caught myself using this technique when trying to get my son to take his medicine last night. I literally framed the pill as the hero that would defeat the villain of his itchy skin. It worked perfectly, which left me feeling both impressed and slightly manipulated by my own new knowledge.  
  
**Real-World Applications**  
  
Speaking of my sob, he's become my unwitting test subject for many of the book's techniques. Walker's section on framing has completely changed how I handle our daily walks.  
  
At work, the neural rewiring exercises have already improved my client relationships. During a recent video call, I focused entirely on understanding my client's concerns rather than defending my work. The result? Instead of the usual back-and-forth negotiation, they felt so understood that they approved the project with minimal revisions.  
  
I've also started applying the ""linguistic lockpick"" techniques from Chapter 7 in my emails. Small changes like replacing ""but"" with ""and"" and using presuppositional language (""When you approve this proposal..."" rather than ""If you approve this proposal..."") have noticeably improved my response rates.  
  
**What's Missing and What Could Be Better**  
  
No book is perfect, and ""The Puppet Master's Bible"" has a few weak spots worth mentioning.  
  
First, while Tom Walker frequently acknowledges ethical concerns, he sometimes glosses over them too quickly. Some sections feel like they're teaching techniques that could be seriously misused without providing enough guardrails. There's a fine line between persuasion and manipulation, and the book occasionally teeters too far toward the latter.  
  
Second, certain chapters get very technical and dense with neuroscience terminology. While I appreciate the scientific foundation, there were moments where I had to re-read passages several times to grasp the concepts. A glossary of terms would have been helpful.  
  
Third, some of the techniques feel like they require a level of emotional intelligence that many readers might not possess. The neural rewiring protocol assumes you can accurately read emotional cues, but for many people (especially those who are neurodivergent), this isn't automatic.   
  
**Who Should (and Shouldn't) Read This Book**  
  
The Puppet Master's Bible isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a light, inspirational read with quick tips for better communication, this isn't it. This book requires commitment and a willingness to confront some uncomfortable truths about human psychology.  
  
You should read this book if:  
\- You're interested in the mechanics of persuasion and influence  
\- You work in marketing, sales, leadership, or any field requiring persuasive communication  
\- You want to understand why you make the decisions you do  
\- You're willing to examine ethical questions without easy answers  
\- You've read other books on persuasion and found them too superficial  
  
You should probably skip this book if:  
\- You're uncomfortable with the idea of psychological influence  
\- You prefer practical tips over theoretical frameworks  
\- You're looking for a quick read with immediate applications  
\- You're sensitive to discussions of psychological manipulation  
  
**The Coffee Shop Test**  
  
The true test of any book's value is whether you'd recommend it to a friend over coffee. Would I recommend The Puppet Master's Bible? Yes, but with caveats.  
  
I've already suggested it to my friend who works in marketing and my sister who's struggling with workplace negotiations. For them, understanding these psychological mechanics could be genuinely beneficial.  
  
However, I deliberately didn't recommend it to my friend who recently expressed concern about being too easily influenced by others. For him, I think knowledge of these techniques might increase anxiety rather than empowerment.  
  
**Final Thoughts: Powerful Knowledge Requires Responsibility**  
  
After spending several weeks with The Puppet Master's Bible, I'm left with mixed feelings‚Äîimpressed by its insights but cautious about its power.  
  
Walker has created something remarkable here: a comprehensive guide to the psychology of persuasion that doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of human influence. The book delivers on its promise to reveal the hidden strings that control decision-making, and it provides practical tools for pulling those strings yourself.  
  
What elevates this book above manipulative pick-up artist guides or cynical marketing handbooks is Walker's consistent reminder that with great power comes great responsibility. He repeatedly emphasizes that these techniques can be used to help people make better decisions, not just to exploit them for personal gain.  
  
I give [The Puppet Master's Bible](https://tomwalker.com/products/puppet-masters-bible) 4.5 out of 5 stars. It's not perfect, but it's one of the most insightful and practical books on persuasion I've ever read. Just be prepared to question everything you thought you knew about your own decisions and to face some uncomfortable truths about how easily influenced we all are.  
  
As Walker writes in the preface, ""Real persuasion is about changing lives, not simply minds."" The question for readers is: what kind of changes will you create with this knowledge?  
  
Oh, and if you're wondering‚Äîyes, I did use some of Tom Walker's own persuasion techniques in writing this review. Consider it applied learning. Did you notice them? If not... well, that's kind of the point.",1,1742471936.0,Tom_Walker,0,1.0,False

For lunch, I stopped at a gas station make-a-sub-at-a-kiosk place. Enjoying the day, I popped my Reality Bites CD into my car stereo a bit louder than I should while having a coffee and smoke. 

Three people our age commented on what a classic Lisa Lobe‚Äôs ‚ÄúStay‚Äù was as they walked by; a group of college age kids started dancing to ‚ÄúMy Sharona‚Äù as the gassed their cars; I got hands raised, waving in the breeze by another group of friends while ‚ÄúTempted Played‚Äù; and several others smiled and commented as I played ‚ÄúBaby, I Love Your Way.‚Äù

Part of the beauty of all this was, the soundtrack is not available by streaming - you have to still listen to the soundtrack on CD. While today we have our phones with instant filtering aps to make videos, nothing beats a hand held camcorder with no filter features to capture real life.

This was a phoneless moment - just a group of strangers dancing in a gas station parking lot on the first nice day of spring. This is my reality.

Thought it might be worth posting what we ended up with on our road trip, and any thoughts, in case it's of use to anyone else!

Ended up grabbing lunch at a cafe right near our dive.|

I've snorkelled before but it's super accessible and easy. The guides are fun and yes the water is a bit cold, but honestly you get used to it after a couple minutes. We had a super sunny day for it. Great visibilty!|
|Generally explore/find dinner.|We ended up having more daylight to explore with than expected. So instead of camping here we continued onward - again stopping a little along the way.|
|Camp - Thingvellir National Park Campground.|Sunset at Gulfoss|
||Dinner and parked up for the night at Skjol camping. Very cold night, partially due to a frost and snow blowing in overnight, as well as the fact  I was unwell - plus some user error on our van.|

General thoughts: We had more time to stop and explore than we originally planned for, which was expected. Meant we could go a bit further and get to Gulfoss for sunset which I'd recommend. We forgot to feed the horses there though - next time!

|:-|:-|
|09:00am: Journey to Vik, stopping at sights along the way. Below are ALL the sights we've listed, but aware we maybe won't make it all.

||Stopped at Laugarvatn Fontana Geothermal Baths for a coffee along the way and tried the Rye bread (so good!)|
||Stopped at Secret Lagoon as we passed. Also great.|
||Kvernufoss|
|Dinner/evening in Vik.|Originally we planned to camp in Vik, but were told that the campground was closed for the season. Thanks Reddit! We pivoted to wanting to camp at Skogafoss, but by the time we were there we were wet from all the falls, and I was honestly still quite ill. We decided to last minute pivot to staying the night in a hotel to have a warm shower and recover.|
||Black Crust Pizza for dinner. Absolutely delicious. Absolutely expensive. Honestly I'm not sure it's worth the price but it was warm and delicious so I'm not mad about it.|
|Camping in Vik Campground.|Sayed in Hotel vik i myrdal - Super nice hotel, and we got a last minute walk-in at a reduced rate. Honestly I was so ill it was VERY worth it, even if we were sad to leave the camper for the night.|

Honestly the caves were all very busy with other groups, but we got lucky and had a smaller group which was way nicer - I think the tour behind us was 20+ people and seemed like obnoxious chaos.

|Camp at Skaftafell Campground again.|At this point I was drifting back into feeling quite ill, so we made the decision not to camp at Skaftafell again, and to press on to Vik to reduce the amount of driving we needed to do the next day. This was where Iceland showed off it's characteristic weather. Incredibly foggy, stressful drive in the dark. But safe and ultimately fine.|

||Went on our Northern Lights bus tour with Viator. Our guide tried his best and we drove for maybe 5 hours total - but the night was against us. We saw glimpses, which was better than nothing. Honestly this was a bit of a low point just because of some very entitled tourists on the tour who were appalled there was no guarantee they'd see the lights, and complained the entire time... But hey, we saw a glimpse, had some hot chocolate and pastries in the quiet countryside. Our guide was nice too - really felt like he did his best. Others were able to rebook for other tours for free on later nights in their trip, but as this was our last night, we took it as an almost-win and happily went to sleep back in our hotels.|

They have some construction right now so it's not as picturesque as it could be, but we had no complaints.

Other general thoughts:

* I've only driven our tiny Toyota Yaris since learning to drive a few years ago. Adapting to the big camper van wasn't too bad, but definitely made easier by going for an automatic. Less to think about and you can focus on the new rules of the road and managing the size of the vehicle. Only had one little screw up - annoyingly literally right before we returned the van - with a Tesla that cut me off from my blind spot. No actual drama, just a near miss that was too easily done. Country driving was WAY easier than city driving, and definitely watch some videos on driving around Iceland for advice, or even just driving vans if you're not used to it. It was very helpful - especially as the scenery was so dang beautiful and distracting!
* Yes. Download Parka. Everything that has paid parking uses it. I'm not strictly certain we categorised our vehicle correctly when paying every time, but we had no tickets or issues so... maybe that doesn't entirely matter? Not saying to do it incorrectly on purpose, but it strikes me that as long as the computer sees ""This Registration number paid"" then that is probably enough to stop any automatic red flags.
* We got VERY lucky with the weather. We had one snowy frosty night, and a couple very foggy hours one evening, but otherwise it was beautiful sunshine. Everywhere we went people said how lucky we were, and I believe them. I DID NOT expect to get sunburnt in Iceland.
* We overpacked. Maybe because we got lucky with the weather, but we basically just used the same rotation of thermals and hiking trousers most days without issue. In fact, the one day I wore my second pair of hiking trousers, I had to go back to my first pair because I immediately ripped them by trying to climb some rocks!
* How many languages do all these tour guides speak? Our Glacier guide was juggling 6 languages at one point. As someone struggling along in learning just a second language, this all struck me as very impressive.
* As much as the hotel night did feel like a cop out for the Van-life experience, I am glad we did it. I needed the recovery time to get over my illness enough to enjoy everything else as much as I did. Look after yourselves!
* Similarly, we did some meals in our van but ate out more than we expected to. I'm not sad about it, though. The food was good and local - and yes the country is expensive so at that point we were in the ""in for a penny in for a pound"" sort of mindset. Whatever seemed most enjoyable.

Basically though - what a beautiful country! Definitely going to be back to explore the north sometime in the future... When our wallets recover!

Hope that gives a useful taste of what could be useful for your trip. We could've squeezed more in, tbh, but being unwell at the time meant we wanted to strike a balance and enjoy everything we did, rather than push too hard. It worked out for the best!",5,1742471389.0,VisitingIceland,2,1.0,False

I did a lot of troubleshooting up to and including completely removing Gemini and going back to the standard assistant (which I know is about to no longer be an option...)

However I realized this morning that it isn't an error in location or anything else. It's giving me the temperatures in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. 

Well, I generally am not opposed to getting information delivered in science units, I was born and raised in the US in the '80s. So until my brain fully boots up after a cup of coffee I need my information and freedom units. 

I verified that my default units is Fahrenheit in my settings for both weather and the phone system. However, the assistant is still giving me Celsius whenever I ask for the weather.

How do I (27M) manage this?","We‚Äôve been dating for 2 years now and living together for 1 year. She moved into my place as her lease ended and we both agreed that it was the next step as then we hoped for engagement and marriage.  
  
I am an introvert, and she is quite extroverted. I am afraid of conflict, and she is not. My ideal way to handle conflict would be to sit down and talk as if we were in a therapy session, where one individual gets to share how they feel and the other listens, vice versa and we don‚Äôt interrupt each other, we discuss how we can both improve or we can agree to disagree, embrace with a hug or kiss and move on. If it‚Äôs a serious issue. I don‚Äôt mind a night on the couch and we can chat about it once things have cooled down. This is my ideal but our conflict management is far from it.  
  
I can‚Äôt share how I truly feel in my relationship because it always leads to an argument. If I have any constructive feedback about my partner, she totally loses it. When she shares how she feels, I acknowledge her, ask questions and see how I can improve so we can move forward. Whereas we never fully address issues I may have.  
  
We just started couples counseling in hope of improving but we are yet to go in depth with the counsellor. This will happen next week.  
  
Example would be: She didn‚Äôt appreciate how I come home from work somedays. Last time I came home silent, I greeted her and then proceed to say ‚ÄúI need to use the bathroom‚Äù which in our relationship means It will be a while/ I need to poop. I proceeded to pack away the few items I brought home from the grocery store and went to the bathroom. After I used the bathroom, I came out to check-in with her, ask her how her day was and give her a kiss. She pushed me away and said that she doesn‚Äôt want to kiss me. I gave her some space and went to the bedroom to continue the rest of my work. Later she came to say that she would appreciate a kiss more detailed communication when I step in the house after work. I replied saying she‚Äôs being unreasonable, and she lost it. She raised her voice, sweared at me, call me a ‚Äúdickhead‚Äù. Because she felt me calling her unreasonable was rude and disrespectful.

Another Example: We got into a huge fight in January, money was a bit tight as I had to help family, she asked me about our anniversary gift and I laughed it off. I was stressed and I realized my response was inappropriate. The next day she raised this, and I apologized for my response. I still had dinner planned at a nice place. We ended up getting into a huge fight and I slept at my parents, I texted her letting her know that I wasn‚Äôt coming home and that I would sleep at my parents. The next day, I came home, and we didn‚Äôt talk at all. I went out with my best friend that night as this was arranged and communicated early in the week prior to our fight. I told her I‚Äôll see her later and she didn‚Äôt respond. When I came home at 2am to find she locked me out my own apartment, she didn‚Äôt answer my calls or texts and I had to go to my parents to sleep there again. The next day she says I didn‚Äôt communicate that I was coming home so she locked up. Till this day she hasn‚Äôt apologized for this. Saying it was ‚Äúmy fault‚Äù. The next day I wrote her a note saying I was going up country to take some time off work and to let us cool down as I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I postponed our anniversary dinner.  
  
Another Example: We were discussing our first therapy session, and we brought up things we both shared wanting to know more. So, we ended up in a fun and playful way ‚Äúrating out of 10‚Äù ¬†how we are doing with core relationship pillars, example: intimacy, emotional and physical safety, etc. She asked me what I would rate her regarding ‚ÄúEmotional acknowledgment‚Äù (I brought this up in therapy) and I said ‚Äú6/10‚Äù. She was shocked and hurt by this. I said that this is something we need to discuss in therapy and it‚Äôs not the place and time to discuss it. I said we are both not perfect and there‚Äôs definitely room for improvement from areas where I lack, and I know communication is one of them. If we both strive to improve everything will be fine. She proceeded to the bedroom and said ‚ÄúI ruined her day‚Äù. A few minutes later when I returned from collecting the laundry she said: ‚ÄúI say the most mean and hurtful sh\*t‚Äù She proceed to swear, raise her voice and threaten the relationship, saying ‚Äúmaybe I should find a man who appreciates me‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe you should find a woman who makes you feel acknowledged‚Äù. She demanded that I leave the house so she can have space, so I ate my lunch, packed my things and went to work from a coffee shop. As soon as I closed the door she put the latch on, effectively locking me out the apartment I pay for.¬† When I returned at 17:15 that evening I was still locked out, I called her and she declined my call. I sent her a text asking if she could please open and she said I must come back home at 18:00. I asked her kindly again saying I would really like to cook dinner and prepare for work tomorrow. She said she doesn‚Äôt have to explain herself and I can do that at 18:00.  
  
We are in a disagreements she goes cold turkey silent and basically ‚ÄúStops being my partner‚Äù. Theres no communication, no text, no updates on her safety when she travels, no more emojies if she does text, no please, no thank you, basically nothing. She can‚Äôt even wash my plate if I made dinner or make sure there‚Äôs food, when I still try and remain the same despite us trying to navigate this. When she‚Äôs finally ready to chat she basically blames me for everything and I end up apologizing.  
  
It breaks my heart when she disrespects, insults me and threatens the relationship. I‚Äôve never done any of the above. I‚Äôm not perfect, and I know that I can improve in certain areas, but I have never sworn at her, insulted her or threatened the relationship and those are things I will never do. I‚Äôve asked her to stop but she continues to.  
  
Things are getting worse and now I‚Äôm getting kicked out of my own apartment because she needs space.  
  
We agreed to live together and she does contribute to the home, but I pay the rent and cover all major expenses.  
¬†  
Long story short, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, As a man should I just accept this is part of being with a woman, this is my 3^(rd) ¬†serious relationship and it just doesn‚Äôt feel right anymore. I can‚Äôt take the threats and insults, she said if ‚ÄúI call her unreasonable again or disrespect her I‚Äôll see a very ugly side of her‚Äù. Who says that to someone they love?  
  
I‚Äôm terrified of her during conflict, if we cant navigate basic issues, how will we manage marriage and kids?  
  
I work full-time and she is a freelancer, she‚Äôs home for 70% of the week. We used to divide house duties equally, cooking and cleaning but work got so busy, and I was tired of my weekend being consumed with life admin and cleaning so I got someone to clean the house once a week to take some pressure off me.  
  
This is the only major issue our relationship has but It also consuming It. Things go well for a few days a week at most and we‚Äôre back in the same place.  
  
Can counselling fix this? I don‚Äôt know if I can make it to be honest and I‚Äôm ready to call it off. We are continuing with couples therapy next week.

Any advice on how to mange this will be appreciated?

It's boring, time-consuming, etc. Usually I survived on coffee, cigarettes/vape and some snacks untill 4pm, feel weak, and then decide to eat (usually unhealthy fast-food or processed pre-made foods) 

I've been trying to force myself to get in the habit of eating more regularly and whole foods. 

Anyway, even something with a low glycemic index like oatmeal absolutely kills me (no it's not instant oats).

I crash insanely. Depression, Anxiety, Lethargy, Brainfog, Irritability, Teary eyed, 0 motivation, etc. I'll get cold af too. Though I feel more sensitive to cold in general these days. 

Today, I had some orange juice in the morning, now I've been laying down exhausted for hours. 

Only carb I tolerate, especially as breakfast, is whole fruit.

Some of the symptoms seems to be doing better when I chew and take my time eating and eat smaller portions ? I think ? Doesn't help in the morning, but does help in the day. 

It's so exhausting. It fucks with my life so bad. 

I'm just trying to feel and be better.

I'm exploring options across various price points, from budget-friendly picks under $50 to higher-end models in the $100-$200 range. Some machines that have caught my eye so far include:

‚Ä¢ **Technivorm Moccamaster** ‚Äì Known for its precision and durability, this one seems to have a loyal following among coffee enthusiasts.

‚Ä¢ **Bonavita Connoisseur** ‚Äì I've read that it's compact yet highly effective, offering great temperature control.

Also, my current bf has shoved me, broken things in the house, thrown coffee in my face, threw my anti-anxiety meds on the ground and laughing at me while I was on my hands and knees licking it up.

The furniture in a luxury hotel should not only be visually stunning but also offer exceptional comfort, durability, and functionality. Selecting the right pieces requires careful consideration of materials, design, and practicality to create an inviting and sophisticated atmosphere.

In this blog, we will explore how to choose high-end furniture for luxury hotels, ensuring that every piece contributes to a refined and elegant guest experience. We will also discuss how to find the best **hotel furniture suppliers** and why selecting high-quality **hotel chairs** is essential for comfort and style.

# Understanding the Importance of High-End Furniture in Luxury Hotels

The furniture in a luxury hotel reflects the brand‚Äôs identity and creates the first impression for guests. Elegant and well-crafted pieces enhance the overall ambiance, making visitors feel pampered and valued. High-end furniture not only improves the aesthetics of the hotel but also contributes to the comfort and relaxation of guests, encouraging them to return.

Luxury hotels must also consider the longevity of their furniture. Investing in durable, premium-quality furniture ensures that the hotel maintains its high standards without frequent replacements. Carefully selected furniture can elevate the dining, lounging, and sleeping experiences, making a lasting impact on guests.

# Factors to Consider When Choosing High-End Furniture

# Style and Aesthetic Appeal

Luxury hotels are known for their unique designs and sophisticated interiors. The furniture should align with the hotel's overall theme, whether it is classic, modern, art deco, or contemporary. A well-planned selection of furniture can enhance the beauty of the interiors while creating a harmonious and luxurious atmosphere.

High-end furniture should have elegant designs, intricate detailing, and premium finishes. The choice of colors, patterns, and materials should blend seamlessly with the hotel's decor to create a refined and welcoming environment.

# Quality and Durability

Since hotel furniture is used by multiple guests every day, durability is a key factor. High-end furniture should be made from premium materials that can withstand heavy usage while maintaining their luxurious appearance. Solid wood, high-grade metals, marble, and top-quality upholstery are some of the preferred choices for luxury hotels.

Investing in durable furniture reduces long-term maintenance costs and keeps the hotel looking elegant for years. Many **hotel furniture suppliers** offer custom-made pieces with reinforced frames, high-quality fabrics, and protective finishes to ensure longevity.

# Comfort and Functionality

Luxury hotels prioritize guest comfort, making ergonomics an important factor in furniture selection. Every piece, from sofas to **hotel chairs**, should provide maximum relaxation without compromising on style. Plush cushions, supportive seating, and adjustable features contribute to an enhanced guest experience.

Functionality is equally important. Hotel furniture should be designed to serve its purpose efficiently. For instance, beds should have high-quality mattresses, chairs should offer ergonomic support, and tables should provide enough space for dining or working.

# Customization Options

Many luxury hotels prefer customized furniture to maintain a distinct and exclusive look. Customization allows hoteliers to select materials, colors, designs, and finishes that align with the hotel's branding and interior concept. Many **hotel furniture suppliers** provide bespoke solutions, allowing hotels to create unique and personalized furniture pieces.

Custom furniture also ensures that the hotel‚Äôs space is optimized effectively. Whether it‚Äôs a grand lobby, a fine-dining restaurant, or a private suite, tailor-made furniture enhances the overall design and maximizes comfort.

# Selection of Materials

The choice of materials plays a significant role in determining the quality and elegance of luxury hotel furniture. Each material brings a unique touch to the hotel‚Äôs ambiance.

* **Solid Wood**: Timeless and durable, wood furniture adds warmth and sophistication to any space. Oak, mahogany, teak, and walnut are commonly used in high-end furniture.
* **Marble and Stone**: Marble tables, countertops, and decorative elements exude luxury and grandeur. These materials are often used in lobbies, bathrooms, and dining areas.
* **High-Quality Upholstery**: Leather, velvet, and premium fabrics enhance the comfort and appearance of seating furniture. These materials are often used in **hotel chairs**, sofas, and headboards.
* **Metal Accents**: Brass, gold-plated, and stainless steel finishes add a modern touch to furniture pieces, making them look more refined and stylish.

Choosing the right materials ensures that the furniture remains in excellent condition while complementing the luxurious feel of the hotel.

# Essential Furniture Pieces for Luxury Hotels

# Hotel Lobby Furniture

The hotel lobby is the first area guests see when they enter the property, making it essential to create a lasting impression. High-end furniture for the lobby includes plush sofas, stylish lounge chairs, and elegant coffee tables. The furniture should be arranged to create a welcoming and comfortable space where guests can relax or wait.

# Hotel Room Furniture

Guest rooms should be designed for relaxation and sophistication. A well-furnished room typically includes a high-quality bed, bedside tables, a writing desk, an armchair, and a wardrobe. **Hotel chairs** and sofas should have comfortable cushioning and stylish designs that add charm to the room. Premium-quality curtains, rugs, and lighting fixtures further enhance the luxurious ambiance.

# Dining and Restaurant Furniture

A luxury hotel‚Äôs restaurant and bar areas require high-end dining tables, **hotel chairs**, and bar stools that match the overall theme. Wooden or marble dining tables paired with upholstered chairs create an elegant setting for fine dining. The furniture should be sturdy, easy to clean, and comfortable enough to encourage guests to enjoy their meals leisurely.

# Outdoor and Poolside Furniture

Many luxury hotels feature outdoor lounges, terraces, and poolside relaxation areas. Outdoor furniture should be designed to withstand weather conditions while maintaining its luxurious appeal. High-quality loungers, daybeds, and outdoor dining sets made from teak, wicker, or metal with weather-resistant cushions are ideal choices.

# Conference and Banquet Hall Furniture

Business meetings, conferences, and banquets require premium-quality tables and chairs that provide both comfort and professionalism. High-back **hotel chairs**, extendable tables, and elegant podiums create a refined setting for corporate and social events.

# How to Find the Best Hotel Furniture Suppliers

Choosing the right **hotel furniture suppliers** is essential to ensure quality, style, and durability. Luxury hotels should collaborate with trusted suppliers who specialize in high-end hospitality furniture. Here are a few factors to consider when selecting a supplier:

1. **Reputation and Experience**: Look for suppliers with a proven track record in providing furniture to luxury hotels.
2. **Material and Craftsmanship**: Ensure that the supplier uses high-quality materials and superior craftsmanship in their products.
3. **Customization Services**: A reliable supplier should offer customization options to meet the hotel‚Äôs unique design requirements.
4. **Delivery and Installation**: Check whether the supplier provides timely delivery and professional installation services.
5. **Warranty and After-Sales Support**: Opt for suppliers who offer warranties and maintenance support for their furniture.

Many **hotel furniture suppliers** offer a range of luxury furniture collections that cater to different styles and preferences. Conducting thorough research and comparing options can help hotels find the best supplier for their needs.

# Maintaining High-End Hotel Furniture

Proper maintenance is essential to preserve the beauty and durability of high-end furniture. Regular cleaning, polishing, and protective treatments ensure that the furniture remains in excellent condition. Upholstered furniture should be vacuumed and professionally cleaned to prevent dust accumulation. Wooden and metal surfaces should be treated with protective coatings to maintain their shine and prevent damage.

Luxury hotels should also inspect their furniture regularly to identify any signs of wear and tear. Replacing worn-out cushions, refinishing wooden surfaces, and repairing minor damages help maintain the hotel's upscale appearance.

# Conclusion

Choosing high-end furniture for luxury hotels requires careful attention to style, quality, comfort, and durability. Every piece should contribute to the hotel‚Äôs elegant ambiance while providing maximum comfort for guests. By selecting the right [hotel chairs](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-chairs/), dining tables, lounge furniture, and outdoor pieces, hotels can create a sophisticated and welcoming environment.

Working with reputable **hotel furniture suppliers** ensures access to premium-quality furniture that meets the highest hospitality standards.

We‚Äôve been together for a while, and our relationship is strong, but there‚Äôs this guy (27M) who‚Äôs been causing some tension. For context, all three of us are gay men.

Before I was officially with my partner, this other guy tried dating me. He was really intense‚Äîtravelling back to my city weekly to set up dates without asking if I was free, sending me constant pictures of himself, and asking for many in return. I found him a bit much but thought he was harmless. I was upfront with him about not being able to meet his emotional needs, and he backed off. We stayed friendly, meeting occasionally for coffee.

When my partner and I first started seeing each other but weren‚Äôt yet official, this guy asked me for my partner‚Äôs number (to ‚Äúwish him a happy birthday‚Äù) but then sent him a message that quickly turned sexual, even suggesting they hook up. My partner, taking advantage of us not being official, asked if I‚Äôd be okay with it. I was super uncomfortable but felt pressured to say yes because I didn‚Äôt want to lose him. That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and told him the next day that if this was what he wanted, we should end things.

My partner later came back, saying he wanted to commit to a relationship with me and move past the ambiguity. Since then, things have been amazing‚Äîhe‚Äôs attentive, we make decisions together, and we‚Äôve grown stronger as a couple.

The issue is this other guy didn‚Äôt disappear. He moved to our city, apologised for crossing a boundary, and asked to stay friends. I agreed, but his behaviour hasn‚Äôt been great. He‚Äôs been overly flirty with me in front of my partner and makes inappropriate references to our past sexual encounters in group settings. He frequently messages my partner, inviting him to spend time alone. While on holiday together, this guy (and someone he was seeing) joined us and took photos of our activities. Since then, his only contact with me has been sending unflattering photos of myself, asking if he can post them on social media (I always decline).

He‚Äôs the kind of person who likes to be the centre of attention, ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù with every gay man in the city. Two friends have even told me, unprompted, that they think there‚Äôs something off about him and described him as sociopathic.

Recently, I set a boundary with my partner that while he can stay friends with this guy, I‚Äôm not comfortable with them meeting at either of their homes. My partner agreed but asked why it‚Äôs necessary if I trust him. I explained it‚Äôs not about trust in him‚Äîit‚Äôs about the other guy‚Äôs intentions, which I don‚Äôt trust at all. My partner eventually agreed but wasn‚Äôt thrilled about it.

Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky: I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this guy is calculated, and part of me wants him to find out about the boundary, just to validate my concerns. I also feel like it would prove to my partner that I can predict his moves‚Äîbecause I strongly suspect any suggestion to meet at home would come from this guy, not my partner.

AITA for setting this boundary? Am I overthinking this, or is this a reasonable way to protect my relationship?",5,1742469589.0,AITAH,5,0.78,False

Good morning, friends! Hope you‚Äôre enjoying your coffee because today‚Äôs Bitcoin price action has been nothing short of intense. Let‚Äôs break it down.

üìâ What Just Happened?
	‚Ä¢	A sudden drop in BTC price was triggered by a market sell-off of ~900 BTC.

	‚Ä¢	The order book reacted instantly, with major buy support at $85,000 absorbing the sell-off.

	‚Ä¢	Currently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it‚Äôs constantly refreshing ‚Äì likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.

üìä Key Order Book Zones & Market Trend

üîπ Support at $85,000 ‚Äì strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 ‚Äì $86,000.

üîπ Sell wall at $86,000 ‚Äì this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.

üîπ Liquidity target at $89,000 ‚Äì yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.

üìà Trend & Market Outlook

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.
	‚Ä¢	The price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.
	‚Ä¢	Sharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.

üöÄ Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!

üî∏ BTC is still bullish.

üî∏ Watch $85K support and $86K resistance ‚Äì a break above could push us towards $89K.

üî∏ Trade smart, stay patient, and let liquidity guide the way.

Yes, yes, it sounds like a rom-com clich√©. But at the start of last fall, I stopped by a new coffee shop near my office. I was exhausted from an early meeting and barely functioning when I stepped up to order. The barista greeted me with a bright smile and a joke about my half-asleep state. I grumbled something incoherent, and she laughed before recommending a caramel latte.

The next day, I went back. And the next. We started chatting‚Äîsmall talk at first, then longer conversations when the line wasn‚Äôt too crazy. She remembered my order before I even said it and started slipping little notes on my cup: a funny doodle, a quote, even a terrible pun.

One evening, I ran into her at a bookstore. We were both surprised but ended up talking for hours, wandering through the aisles. Before we left, she shyly asked, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ do you ever drink coffee outside of work hours?‚Äù I said yes way too fast.

Now, months later, we‚Äôre together. Mornings feel different when your coffee is made by someone you love.

1jfmg1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1jfmg1u/wix_vs_webflow/,Wix vs Webflow,"So you're thinking about building a website, huh? Let me tell you, choosing the right platform can make or break your entire experience. I've been in your shoes, staring at the screen wondering whether to go with **Wix** or **Webflow**. Trust me, it ain't an easy decision!

After spending countless hours tinkering with both platforms (and yes, occasionally pulling my hair out), I've put together this comprehensive comparison that'll hopefully save you some time and frustration.

Let's face it - both Wix and Webflow can build you a stunning website, but they're as different as chalk and cheese when it comes to how you'll get there. So grab a cup of coffee and let's dive into the nitty-gritty of these popular website builders.

# The Quick Verdict

Short on time? Here's the TL;DR version:

* **Choose Wix** if you want something easy to use with tons of templates and marketing tools. Perfect if you're a beginner, small business owner, or need to launch quickly.
* **Choose Webflow** if you're design-focused and want complete control over every pixel. Ideal for designers, agencies, and those building brand-forward websites who don't mind a learning curve.

Now let's get into the details...

# Getting to Know the Contenders

# What's Wix All About?

Wix has been around since 2006 and has built quite a reputation as the go-to website builder for beginners. With nearly 8 million websites under its belt, it's definitely doing something right!

What makes Wix stand out is its **drag-and-drop simplicity**. You can literally grab elements and place them anywhere on your page. Plus, with over 900 templates to choose from, you've got plenty of starting points.

Wix also offers:

* An AI website builder that creates sites for you
* Built-in marketing and SEO tools
* Robust eCommerce capabilities
* A massive app marketplace

# What's Webflow's Deal?

Webflow is the newer kid on the block, launching in 2013. It positions itself as a professional design tool that lets you create custom websites without coding.

Unlike Wix's freeform approach, Webflow is built on a ""box model"" that mirrors how actual web development works. This makes it incredibly powerful but also more complex to master.

Webflow's strong points include:

* Pixel-perfect design control
* Professional-grade animations
* Clean, exportable code
* A powerful CMS for dynamic content
* Genuine responsive design capabilities

# Ease of Use: The Learning Curve Showdown

Let's be real - this is probably the biggest difference between these two platforms.

# Using Wix: Weekend Website Warrior

I still remember my first time using Wix - I had a basic website up in literally hours. The interface is intuitive with clearly labeled elements and a straightforward sidebar.

Want to change text? Just click on it. Need to add an image? Drag it where you want it. Even my mom could figure it out (and she still prints her emails).

Wix also includes:

* Help buttons throughout the editor
* Built-in tutorials and guides
* An AI assistant that can generate content
* Pre-designed section layouts you can drop in

The tradeoff? You have less control over things like margins and paddings. But for most beginners, the simplicity is worth it.

# Using Webflow: The Design Powerhouse

My first encounter with Webflow was... humbling. I consider myself tech-savvy, but I felt like I was learning a new language. The interface resembles professional design tools like Adobe products, with multiple panels showing different properties and settings.

The box model takes time to understand, and you'll encounter terms like ""absolute positioning,"" ""z-index,"" and ""flex container"" that might send you running to Google.

BUT - and this is a big but - once you get past the initial confusion, the power is absolutely worth it. You can control literally every aspect of your design with precision that Wix simply can't match.

Webflow University (their learning platform) is exceptional, and the community is super helpful. Give yourself a few weeks, and you'll be creating designs that stand out from the template crowd.

# Design Capabilities: Templates and Customization

# Wix Templates: Plenty to Choose From

Wix boasts over 900 templates covering practically every industry you can think of. Whether you're a pet groomer, a jazz musician, or selling handcrafted soaps, there's probably a template tailored to your needs.

These templates are mobile-friendly and look professionally designed right out of the box. You can customize them extensively using the drag-and-drop editor.

One major downside? Once you pick a template, you're committed. Changing templates means starting over from scratch, so choose wisely!

# Webflow Templates: Quality Over Quantity

Webflow offers fewer built-in templates than Wix, but there's an extensive marketplace with over 2,000 templates created by the community. While some are free, many premium templates cost between $30-$100.

What sets Webflow templates apart is their design quality and flexibility. They're built with responsive design principles from the ground up, and you can modify literally every aspect of them.

Plus, Webflow gives you access to raw HTML elements and empty layout components, which means you're never limited by what the template offers.

# Features That Matter

# Wix Features: The All-In-One Package

Wix really shines when it comes to built-in features and integrations. It's basically trying to be your entire digital business hub.

Some standout features include:

* **Wix ADI** (Artificial Design Intelligence) that builds websites based on your answers to some questions
* **App Market** with 300+ apps to extend your site
* **Built-in blogging** platform
* **Marketing tools** including email campaigns, social media posting, and a CRM
* **SEO Wizard** that guides you through optimization
* **Video hosting** for creating and managing video content

Wix also provides specialized tools for specific industries - appointment booking for service businesses, menus for restaurants, portfolios for creatives, and more.

# Webflow Features: Design-First Thinking

Webflow takes a different approach, focusing first on giving you complete design control and then adding functionality through a powerful CMS and integrations.

Key features include:

* **Interactions** tool for creating complex animations and effects
* **Designer** tool that functions like a visual code editor
* **CMS Collections** for creating dynamic content types
* **Editor mode** that lets clients update content without breaking design
* **Clean code export** options
* **Page branching** for team collaboration

For more specific needs, Webflow integrates with services like Zapier to connect with thousands of apps.

# eCommerce Capabilities: Selling Online

If you're planning to sell products online, this section is crucial.

# Wix eCommerce: Ready for Business

Wix has spent years building out its eCommerce platform, and it shows. Their store capabilities are quite comprehensive:

* Sell up to 50,000 products (physical, digital, or subscription)
* Multiple payment gateways
* Abandoned cart recovery
* Product reviews
* Discount codes and gift cards
* Multi-currency support
* POS (Point of Sale) integration
* Dropshipping support via Modalyst
* Tax calculation
* Advanced shipping options

For most small to medium online stores, Wix provides everything you need, though you'll want at least the Core plan ($29/month) to access these features.

# Webflow eCommerce: The New Kid on the Block

Webflow's eCommerce features are newer and more limited compared to Wix:

* Sell up to 15,000 products (on the Advanced plan)
* Custom checkout design
* Basic inventory management
* Limited product variations (only 3 per product)
* Standard payment processing
* No built-in abandoned cart recovery

One notable downside is that Webflow's Standard eCommerce plan ($29/mo) charges an additional 2% transaction fee on top of payment processor fees. You need to upgrade to the Plus plan ($74/mo) to avoid this.

If you're serious about eCommerce, Wix currently offers more bang for your buck. That said, Webflow's store designs can look absolutely stunning.

# Marketing and SEO: Getting Found Online

Building a website is one thing - getting people to visit it is another challenge entirely.

# Wix Marketing Tools: The Swiss Army Knife

Wix has quietly built one of the most comprehensive marketing suites among website builders:

* **Email marketing** with templates and automation workflows
* **Social media management** directly from your dashboard
* **SEO Wizard** with step-by-step optimization guidance
* **Semrush integration** for keyword research
* **Built-in CRM** for managing contacts
* **Form builder** with multi-step options
* **AI-powered site chat** for visitor engagement

What impresses me most about Wix's approach is how they've integrated everything. Your form submissions automatically feed your CRM, which connects to your email marketing, which ties into your store data. It's a proper ecosystem.

# Webflow SEO and Marketing: More DIY

Webflow provides solid SEO fundamentals but fewer integrated marketing tools:

* Control over all meta tags, descriptions, and URLs
* Clean code that loads quickly (good for SEO)
* Proper semantic HTML structure
* Automatic sitemap generation
* Form functionality with limited submissions

For additional marketing capabilities, you'll need to integrate third-party tools. This isn't necessarily bad - many professionals prefer specialized tools anyway - but it's less seamless than Wix's all-in-one approach.

# Pricing: What's It Gonna Cost You?

Let's talk dollars and cents - always an important factor.

# Wix Pricing: Straightforward with Some Gotchas

Wix offers a free plan with limitations (Wix branding, no custom domain) and several paid tiers:

* **Light:** $17/month - Basic website features, 2GB storage
* **Core:** $29/month - Includes eCommerce (50K products), 50GB storage
* **Business:** $36/month - Adds advanced eCommerce features, 100GB storage
* **Business Elite:** $159/month - Enterprise features, unlimited storage

Remember that the Light plan doesn't include eCommerce, and you'll need at least the Core plan for a proper online store.

# Webflow Pricing: Complex But Flexible

Webflow's pricing is split between site plans and account plans, which can be confusing. Site plans include:

* **Basic:** $14/month - No CMS, 50GB bandwidth
* **CMS:** $23/month - 2,000 CMS items, 200GB bandwidth
* **Business:** $39/month - 10,000 CMS items, 400GB bandwidth

For eCommerce, additional plans include:

* **Standard eCommerce:** $29/month - 500 products, 2% fee
* **Plus eCommerce:** $74/month - 5,000 products, no fee
* **Advanced eCommerce:** $212/month - 15,000 products, no fee

In general, Wix offers better value, especially for eCommerce sites. However, if design flexibility is your priority, Webflow's investment might be worthwhile.

# Who Each Platform Is Best For

After spending considerable time with both platforms, here's my take on who should use each:

# Wix Is Perfect For:

* **Complete beginners** who need a simple solution
* **Small business owners** who don't have time to learn complex systems
* **Anyone who needs to launch quickly** without a steep learning curve
* **Online stores** with comprehensive needs but modest budgets
* **Businesses that want all-in-one marketing tools**
* **Content creators** who need simple blogging capabilities

# Webflow Shines For:

* **Web designers** who want complete creative control
* **Agencies** building sites for clients
* **Design-focused brands** that need standout websites
* **Teams** needing collaborative workflow features
* **Developers** who want visual design with clean code output
* **Anyone building complex, interactive experiences**

# My Personal Experience

I've built multiple sites on both platforms, and I have a confession: I keep going back and forth between them depending on the project.

For my friend's bakery website? Wix was a no-brainer. We had it up in a weekend with online ordering, beautiful food galleries, and an Instagram feed. She can update it herself without calling me for help.

For my own design portfolio? I chose Webflow. The animations and interactions I created simply wouldn't be possible in Wix, and the site stands out because it doesn't look templated.

That's really the crux of it - these tools serve different purposes and different skill levels.

# The Final Verdict

If you've made it this far, you probably have a good sense of which platform might be right for you. But let me sum it up one more time:

**Choose Wix if:**

* You value ease of use and quick setup
* You need comprehensive marketing tools
* You want a robust online store without complexity
* You don't have design experience
* You're on a tighter budget

**Choose Webflow if:**

* Design quality and uniqueness are top priorities
* You're willing to invest time in learning
* You need advanced animations and interactions
* You want clean, exportable code
* You're building sites professionally

Remember, there's no ""perfect"" platform - only the right one for your specific needs and skills. Both Wix and Webflow offer free plans or trials, so why not spend a few hours experimenting with each?

Whatever you choose, I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments. And if you've used both platforms, which one did you prefer and why?

	‚Ä¢	Currently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it‚Äôs constantly refreshing ‚Äì likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.

üìä Key Order Book Zones & Market Trend

üîπ Support at $85,000 ‚Äì strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 ‚Äì $86,000.

üîπ Sell wall at $86,000 ‚Äì this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.

üîπ Liquidity target at $89,000 ‚Äì yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.

üìà Trend & Market Outlook

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.
	‚Ä¢	The price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.
	‚Ä¢	Sharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.

üöÄ Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!

üî∏ BTC is still bullish.

I have a 9-5 work rhythm. Sometimes I take supplements, not daily. My nutrition intake can be better (i might have to add more fiber).

Sometimes whenever I'm tired I get this ache (like those you get after you walk for sooooooo long) in my armpit and/or left chest. It comes and goes. Sometimes the ""ache after a long walk"" feeling also comes thruout my left arm. I get tired easily as well.

I get occasional panic attacks, comes in the form of heart palpitations, sense of impending doom, and lightheadedness. Doesn't last long. I take bisoprolol and candesartan (2.5mg and 8mg) for 5 months approximately before i stopped gradually. I had at least 2 ECGs, 1 heart ultrasound, and weekly BP measurements for the last 6 months and everything was always fine. Thyroid is also fine (1.1).

I have history of high blood pressure from dad's side. My dad died of heart attack. My sister died of cervical cancer and embolism. I have a high anxiety on health and death due to the grief, and constantly going on therapy for that.

My question is, should I be worried from the ache feeling? I'm just so afraid of dying. I don't take drugs, coffee, stimulants, tea, only stay up late for not long, rarely exercise but walk a lot to work. Weigh 45kg, height 151cm.

* long thread*


Mula grade one hanggang grade 8 kaklase ko si Ate P. Pumupunta sya sa bahay namin, super welcome and nagrerequest pa sila kay Mama ng mga dish sa next food trip sa bahay. So eto si Mama, wish granted kasi hindi naman ako lagi nagpapa punta ng kaklase sa bahay since introverted ako andI have like 5-6 close friends nung Highschool. Para na kaming  magkakapatid. Pero si Ate P nagtransfer ng school. She went cold sa mga GCs namin until eventually isa na lang ang kinakausap nya sa friend group namin. Idk what went wrong but we don't consider her out of our group. Baka kasi we are getting older kaya wala ng time. 

Kaya nung nag apply sya sa BPO na pinagtatrabahuhan ko and nakita ko sya sa training room, hinintay ko sya lumabas since nagaabang ko mag 4 am para makapunta sa terminal pauwi ng province. Nakaupo ako sa pantry malapit sa  training room nila, then I approached her

"" Ate P! OMG nagkita talaga tayo dito, it's been years""  Super saya ko that time kasi finally, a familiar face.

Tapos biglang sabi nya ""Sino kaba? Eh di naman kita kilala. Please lang!""
Akala ko one of our bardaguan jokes lang, just like before.
""Ate P naman! Grabe sya oh, Di mo ako matatandaan eh Napunta ka sa bahay namin dati?""  Patawa ko pa sinabi
She rolled her eyes at me at tinalikuran ako.
Hinabol ko pa sya sabi ko ""Ako ito si M-, di mo ako na ako kilala?"" 
""wala ako kilalang M-, impossibleng kilala kita""

She walked a way and I returned back to my seat.

tapos nakita ko yung mga wavemates nya nakatingin sakin habang nagkakape ako sa table then constanly tumatawa, then tumitingin ulit.

Hindi ako mindreader pero I find it disrespectful. Pero inisip ko na lang na baka na-overwhelm sa pag greet ko.

Nagkataon, pinagtemporary SME ako sa Seasonal Account kasi naka Mat-Leave yung SME na ilalagay sa new recruit. Nagulat sya nung pumasok ako sa Prod. Nagtataka din ako bat di sya nagtatanong sakin, sa katabi nya sya nagtatanong at nagpapautos.
Kaya I smiled and said ""Ate P,  tha's fine, It hurts that I don't know why you're mad at me and our friends. but I'll help you. Let's be professional""

I could tell, na nagalit sya lalo at hindi nagtanong until the end of shift. 

4 shifts later, I was called out by our TL sa meeting. Kasi na-scan yung call nya. Sabi nya refund is 1-3 days pero sa training naman, Alam naman nila na 3-5 Business days yun. So yun yung ni-remind ko since nagpatanong sya sa katabi nya. Tapos nung ini-coaching na, yun daw ang turo ko.

Kaya kinakanchawan ako ng mga OM na ""Pano ka magse-step up nan, hanggang ngayon mali ka pa rin magbigay ng info. Naiwan mo ata ang isip mo sa nesting period""
Hurtful talaga toh, dahil parang nake-question yung credibility ko as an agent and sme.

This went on for two more weeks at hindi na nakakatuwa. May time na nawarningan na ako ng OM kasi raw ""pumipili"" ako ng tutulungan. Tapos nagcomplain ako kay TL na tinutulungan ko naman si Ate P, kaso sya itong hindi nagtatanong tsaka ayaw sakin dumikit pag lumalapit ako, akala mo may nakakahawang sakit ako.

Mabuti na lang talaga seasonal account yun. Back to agent na ako at nakahinga ng maluwag. Di ko na sya nakita not until yesterday paguwi ko ng province. Bumibili  ako ng Coffee sa 7 eleven at sya pala yung staff. Mula nung dumating ako hanggang pagbabayad sa counter. Naka smile sya.
 
""Uy M,  Kumusta na kayo ng tropa."" 
Nagulat ako, talagang kinamusta  ako at ang barkada? Simula naman noong nasa CC pa kami eh nag iinarte syang di nya ako kilala. Tapos biglang tanong
""Nasa Call Center ka pa din ba, siguro ang laki na sinasahod mo ngayon ano?"" 
""Ay sorry Miss, Hindi kita kilala""
""Grabe, alam mo bigatin na siguro to sa call center. Kawork ko yan dati sa Manila""  sabi pa nya sa kasama nyang staff.
""I have a really good memory, so it's impossible na kilala kita. Check mo utak mo baka nauuntog ka""

Then I walked away, Tinawanan sya nung isang staff sa pagkakarinig ko ""Hala ka, ang feeling mo, baka ibang tao yan teh"" tapos sabi nya ""Barkada ko yan eh, mula elementary hanggang highscool""

I felt uncomfortable to talk about my salary in public mababa man o malaki, but that's not the issue. What I really  hate is the fact  na wala man lang ako narinig na explanation bat ganon ang ginawa nya sakin nung nasa CC pa kami. Kung mangdo-dogshow sya hindi yun yung place! Hindi ko deserve ma-call out dahil every time na failed sya sa QA ako ang tinuturo at yun daw ang sabi ko pero hindi naman sya nagtatanong. Alam ko sa kanya ang impact non sa pero After this incident din kasi,  I was not recommended as a Product Trainer sa sumunod na 10 months, I always applied pag may open na position then the pandemic hits. Feeling ko gawa nitong incident na toh. Everytime kasi na magse-self initiate ako ng application as product trainer, ang laging sagot sakin ""Baka naman maging selective ka nanaman sa tuturuan"" then some people named me as ""Ms Selective"" or ""Ateng Mapili"". Alam naman natin sa BPO na gumagapang ang chismis.

I know it was a joke pero nakakainis talaga. Kasi pangarap ko maging product trainer para makapag apply with the same position sa mga  BPO abroad.

It's funny bigla mo akong naalala Ate P, imagine 3 months tayo magkasama, naalala mo ako as co-worker. Pero yung 8 years natin magkasama limot mo na? Tapos ipinapahamak mo pa ako  constantly nung nasa call center pa tayo. Now, you're acting bigla na tropa tayo? Oh how it hurts kung itanggi ka ng childhood friend  na halos kapatid mona for 8 years tapos umaarte pa na akala mo ako yung may ginawang masama? Ikaw ang unang hindi nagreach out kasi may new friends ka na. We're not even jealous. Hinayaan ka namin kasi nga we're getting older. Alam namin na makaka-meet tayo lahat ng iba't ibang set of friends along the way. Pero bakit biglang hindi kilala? then a few years later, kilala mo na ako? Na vetsin ka ba?

For about a month or two before giving birth, I had awful sleep in the night, mostly because baby was kicking my preferred sleeping side. The prolonged exhaustion was unbearable by the time I went into labor. I was falling asleep between contractions in the birthing pool, and frantically choking for air when I was rudely awakened by the next wave of pain, and barked at to push the damn baby's head out by my very impatient midwife. Overall, though, my labor was a beautiful experience and was everything I dreamed from the moment I found out I was pregnant, albeit physically traumatic with a long recovery afterwards.

For the first couple months of his life, I slept somewhat well. Baby's circadian rhythm kicked in rather quickly and he just knew when bedtime was about 4-6 weeks pp. As of the last 3-4 weeks I am not tired at all when we lay down for bed but I manage to trick myself to sleep at first. When I wake up for our first feed of the night I am up for 2-4 hours, usually until he wakes for his second feed. I am becoming cranky and irritable during the day.

I'm really not sure how to troubleshoot going forward. I don't want to take melatonin because I don't want to be so knocked out that I can't hear my baby stirring. Maybe it's worth mentioning our household just had back-to-back colds for three weeks in a row recently, and that has been the only disturbance in our regular routine. My appetite has also decreased very drastically since the sleep thing became an issue. My partner and I have been sexually active a few times in recent weeks as well. 

My daily routine otherwise consists of waking up with baby around 10am, feeding, reading to him, and playing for a couple of hours. I try to eat breakfast and make coffee by 12, then I will get him down for a nap around 1 and while he sleeps I will do chores or draw or crochet. My partner gets home from university at 3, and we always go for an easy hike for usually an hour or two. When we get home around 5:30, my partner has the baby in a carrier while I cook or clean, and he does dishes & then we eat dinner. When I have the time, I will game on my PC for an hour or so before bed, or the three of us listen to records, and then we do our night routine and all go to sleep at the same time.

1jfma82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusLegal/comments/1jfma82/what_is_it_like_having_a_public_trustee_enduring/,What is it like having a Public Trustee Enduring Power of Attorney (ACT),"Hey Guys,

My name is U/Bolticus13, I am a 27 y/o M living in ACT who unfortunately suffers from multiple mental disabilitys (including. Bipolar 1, ASD (HSN), ADHD and I am intellectually challanged).

I currently receive an income from the DSP and receive assistance through NDIS on a daily basis. 

So far up untill now (whether right or wrong) i have had full control of my finances and medical situations (which has included dozens of hospital admissions, descriptions, therapies and more), which while i appreciate the autonomy, has lead me to the point where I am in thousands of dollars of debt (due to poor financial literacy and mental health causing me to sign up for credit) which I can't pay off, what money I do have I waste due to poor impulse control, I have no savings, and despite alot of therapy and financial counselling, I am struggling to develop the necessary skills to get me out of this situation.

Anyway, recently my Ocupational therapist and Psychiatrist both independently recommended that I look into getting an enduring power of attorney, to not only help me sort out my financial  situation, but also to manage them going forward, ensuring that I can finally have some savings, ensuring I can't manically or unintentionally get into poor financial contracts (like credit cards) and also as a way to help in situations where I am not in a right state of mind to make informed decisions about my health.

Now, i know my parents could do this in theory, however they are not the most understanding of my mental situation and refuse to help me out in an unofficial capacity, yet alone an official one, so after discussing with my psychologist, it is agreed that if I do go ahead with getting a enduring POA, it would be through a public trustee.


Anyway, to the question at hand. 

After my brief summary regarding my situation, would you guys reccomend an enduring POA for me going forward.

And if yes

What is life like with one?

Do I need to contact them every time I want to make a purchase?

Can I still make small independent financial decisions (like occasionally buying myself a new videogame)?

Do I still get some money so that I can do things like buy my daily coffee with my support workers or would that not be possible anymore?

Do they have the ability to sell off my already owned assests to pay off debt (such as my playstation or lego models)?

In regards to medical things, do I still get some say in medical decisions, or do I surrender all my medical autonomy?

Also, I have previously had ECT as a treatment for my Bipolar 1, and despite its controversial past, It has genuinely saved my life and if the situation calls for it again, I wouldn't hesitate to get it. However I read online that Enduring POAs aren't allowed to sign off on ECT, does that mean if I get one I can't get the treatment despite its successful use in the past?

Do enduring power of attorneys attend all your doctors appointments or would I be in charge of relaying the information to them?

As it's a public trustee, is the service paid for by the government or do I pay for it, and if me, how do I pay for it, when my financial situation is already shit and only using the pension?

If it doesn't work out, would i be allowed to back out or change providers or am I stuck?

And finally

Is it worth it?



Anyway, I know this was a long one and I really do appreciate all your advice and I hope you all have a lovely weekend.

7. When diluted with water, it's drinkable but I got no ""sweet"" taste that I was expecting with cold brew.

I am 26 and from Czech Republic. My hobbies include journaling, lost media, reading, traveling, crafts and doodles, fountain pens, drinking copious amount of coffee, learning about philosophy, history, literature and generally being a nerd. 

I watch anime (surreal ones like Serial Experiment Lain or Sonny Boy, but I enjoy fantasy, sci fi and comedy too), cartoons, books (literally everything) I game (JRPG, adventure, horror, casual)  and like fandoms & fanfiction. I study librarianship and work at a bookstore!

My letters might not always be 100% positive, but I've been changing my life a lot lately, so if you're in the same boat and wanna cheer each other on & talk about our progress I'd be very happy. 

I love children and I used to work in middle school and at a daycare. So if you have a kid and you want me to send them some letters too I would love to! 

My handwriting is a mess and I am in general very chaotic (blame the ADHD haha), so don't expect the most beautiful letters, but I can offer some doodles, stickers or postcards & photos. 

I'd love to learn more about other cultures and hear your story. I don‚Äôt mind small talk - but we can also discuss your wins, fears, fails, life philosophy or stresses, anything! I'll cherish every single one of your letters anyway.

1jflwk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1jflwk4/psychosis_maybe_seizure_what_now/,Psychosis maybe? Seizure? What now??,"My son's diagnosis doesn't have a level attached but reading other ppl's posts here it sounds like maybe he's between a 1 and 2 if that helps anything. He also has ADHD, combined type.

He's 13 now.  He recently ""graduated"" from the therapy he was doing and honestly seems to have come so far from when he was diagnosed (about a year ago). He's put in the work and I've been so proud of him and starting to feel like maybe everything's going to be ok and I will be able to focus more on the business my business partner and I are working on starting. 

He's been so much more conscious both of his interactions with others and also his own needs. He started his own Dungeons and Dragons game and got people to play weekly. Hardly any meltdowns anymore (at least not like they had been). I can have conversations with him now about things other than his special interests and his range of interests in growing. He's more willing to try new things. Maybe the most heart-warming to me of all is when I pick him up from school I see him happily chatting with other kids who genuinely seem engaged with him.

And then...

Last week we got a call from the school that he said something was ""trying to get him"" and that he was genuinely terrified. When I got there he had calmed down a lot and was sitting with the principal and talking with her. He was able to describe the ""thing"" as being a tree-like creature. Apparently in class he was already irritated by some kids' perfumes and then an adult had been talking about ""widow makers"" (we live in a place with lots of redwood trees and sometimes in high winds limbs will break off and smash a car or go through someone's roof. We call these widow makers). Shortly after that he got this dread about something trying to get him and he knew logically it wasn't real but he couldn't convince himself of that.  He said he felt like he was going to die. 

Concerningly, my older child (also AUDHD, the ADHD is more pronounced and the autism less so) has described having 3 seperate events like this in the past year. She told me she had never told her brother about these episodes. 

With my son we talked about anxiety and panic attacks and how to deal with them and the importance of getting enough sleep but I was still absorbing all of this...

And then two days ago he had what I think was a tonic seizure at school. He said a kid behind him made a sudden lpud noise (he described it as a jump scare) and then quickly aftervsomething else overstimulating happened, i dont remember what.  He said his felt his joints lock up and he fell and couldn't move. He said he was twitching a little because he was trying to get his body to move but it felt like he was paralyzed. His teacher told me he was lying on his side not moving and not responsive with a glassy stare for something like 20 minutes. (It was a bad day for it...it's a small school and the nurse, mental health person and 1 of their two aides were all not on campus for different reasons. They also had a hard time getting ahold of my husband and myself). 

We sent him for a half day yesterday and are sending him for the whole day today.

But now what?? I was so not prepared for this. I literally have no idea wjat i need to do. 
 His psychologist is dealing with some family emergency of her own. My husband seems to think it best that we just act like nothing happened (my son usually does the dishes and the evening of the seizure my husband was like ""ok do the dishes,  I'm going to the store"". My son immediately started getting a migraine and I gave him ibuprofen and told him to lie down.  Give the kid a break, sheesh.) I don't want to increase my son's anxiety by hyperfocusing on these events but I'm also really scared. Maybe he'll never have another seizure again, but what if he does? Can we not leave him alone at home anymore? Should I still let him walk himself to the coffee shop? 

I'm so so exhausted. And...well, lots of feelings. It's 3am though and this post is crazy long so I'll leave it here.

# Black Friday 2025 Sale Dates (Expected)

BJ‚Äôs usually publishes its Black Friday ad about a week before the sale begins. Last year, the 60-page ad dropped on November 13.

As always, you'll find the full ad san at [blackerfriday.com/bjs/](https://www.blackerfriday.com/bjs/) the moment it's released. 

Checking out the ad early is a good way to plan your purchases‚ÄîBJ‚Äôs doorbusters tend to sell out fast.

Let's face it, some of us want to meet in person to have an actual face-to-face convo. Get to know people in-person, get out and get to know them.

Texting personalities can be different from in-person. And this is coming from a damn introvert.

While I understand texting is part of the process, I am not willing to text for more than 4 weeks max.... I think up to 1 month of texting before meeting is plenty of time to conclude if we want to meet.

Usually I like to meet on the 2nd or 3rd week and even meet on the first week if conversation is going really well and it's flowing.

I just don't understand the need of endless texting....... I also understand people have lives and they're busy or whatever their agenda is.

I am the person that is upfront, I will tell them that I am looking for dates. If they're looking for something else, I respectfully tell them I am not looking for that and end the convo and wish them good-luck in their search.

But this is where I really get annoyed. Let's say we're on the same page, convo is great and I ask if they're free for dinner or coffee or whatever, they say yes. Sweet, hurdle 1 is passed. I asked if Friday night is good? They say no..... ok cool. They will either say no or ""I'll let you know"". And BTW ""i'll let you know"" never happens.

So I follow up, let's say the next week and ask ""when are you free for X event"", they will either say ""i'll let you know"" or ""I don't know"".

Guys, understand if they are interested they make you a priority. Guys, also understand there is a difference between ""I am busy that day"" vs ""I am busy that day, but we can do the next day?"".

My personal rule is: if they reject my invitation twice in a row and if they don't suggest a day they're free, I actually tell them I am no longer interested and move on.

Come on guys, don't say yes to meeting up and don't,....... so many fucking people are all talk.",3,1742466320.0,askgaybros,7,0.81,False
