1klewtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ascaso/comments/1klewtp/new_everything_best_starting_setup_of_ascaso/,New everything. Best starting setup of Ascaso Steel Duo PID Plus?,"My coffee equipment started to come in. I want to brew classic Italian style espressos so i did a lot of research and this is what i got to start with. What i'm asking is, what would be the starting setup of the machine? I wrote everything down and i'll keep you posted how's it going. 

Equipment:

\- Ascaso Steel Duo PID Plus ( i got it on sale for 1.500 eur, i think it was a very good price)  
  Bottomless portafilter was included.  
\- Grinder Niche Zero  
\- I plan to use Espresso parts ridgeless baskets (14g and 21g). I'll fill them around 14g to 15g the small one,       and 18g bigger one if needed). I've read many good things about these baskets for Medium/dark roast   Italian style espressos.   
\- Scale that is way too big (i don't know what i was thinking)  
\- Some Normcore products (V4.1 tamper, WDT,..)  
\- Puqpress mini is also coming (shoulder injuries and improved consistency)  
\- I have two different freshly roasted beans incoming. One is Torrefazione Mocaflor Gold blend (80% Arabica, 20% Robusta). The other is Saka GranBar.   
\- i plan to distribute beans into single dosing jars, freeze them and use them directly from the freezer.

Now questions:

How to setup Ascaso properly from the start?

My plan:

PID set to 90C (medium/dark roast) and offset set to 7C (i've read and viewed many videos and looks like this must be done)?

Preinfusion 0 - 0? Looks like most use preinfusion on light roasts, but not so much on medium roasts. Is that ok or should i use some preinfusion?

I have no idea how to use Ascaso volumetric system do i'll probably just let it run and stop by time/scale.

I plan to dose 14g or 15g coffee into 14g size basket (EspressoParts 14 basket is big) and try 1:2 or 1:3 ratio in 30s. 

Anything i should change or is this in the ballpark?",1,1747117039.0,Ascaso,0,1.0,False
1klew8s,https://i.redd.it/sgriz6grrh0f1.jpeg,How often should you update your portfolio,"‚ÄúPortfolio Updates: The Gym Membership of the Creative World‚Äù
Or: How I Avoided Updating My Portfolio So Long It Became a Historical Artifact


---

‚ÄúIs your portfolio still rocking that 2017 glow?‚Äù

You know that moment when someone asks for your portfolio and you panic like they just requested your birth certificate and a blood sample?
Yeah. Same.

Updating your portfolio is like going to the gym ‚Äî we all know we should do it, but somehow laundry, existential dread, and a suspiciously long nap take priority.

 The Portfolio That Time Forgot
I once opened my portfolio and saw work from a client I swear went out of business before TikTok existed.
Their logo still had bevel and emboss. And Comic Sans. COMIC. SANS.

Suddenly I realized ‚Äî my portfolio wasn‚Äôt outdated.
It was a time capsule.
Curated by Past Me who thought gradients were a personality trait.


---

 When Should You Update It?
Let‚Äôs settle this.

You should update your portfolio:

When you finish a project you‚Äôre proud of

When you learn a new skill that makes you feel like a creative superhero

When your current portfolio makes you say, ‚ÄúWait, I did this?‚Äù in a bad way

Or‚Ä¶ every 3‚Äì6 months, whichever comes first. Like an oil change. But for your career.


And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî if you can update your Instagram stories while brushing your teeth, you can update a Behance project before your coffee kicks in.


---

The Fear of Letting Go
Sometimes we hold on to old projects like that hoodie from college ‚Äî worn out, but sentimental.
Newsflash: Your client doesn‚Äôt care that you once animated a logo for a frozen yogurt shop in 2014.

Let it go.
Unless the yogurt danced.
Then maybe keep that one.

Finale: A Portfolio is a Living Thing (Like a Tamagotchi)
Your portfolio isn‚Äôt a trophy shelf ‚Äî it‚Äôs a living creature.
You have to feed it, nurture it, and occasionally delete stuff that aged worse than a 2007 YouTube intro.

So the next time someone asks for your portfolio, don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ let me just send you a Dropbox link from the Obama administration.‚Äù

Say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the link ‚Äî just updated it last week.‚Äù

They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre organized.
They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre proactive.
They‚Äôll think you shower regularly.
(It‚Äôs a vibe.)


---

TL;DR: Update your portfolio like it‚Äôs a dating app bio. Show your best self, not your 2015 side-hustle energy.

And remember: If it‚Äôs been more than 6 months since your last portfolio update‚Ä¶ this is your sign.

Idk why I resisted this for so long but man does it help immediately keep everything cleaner. 

moved from the wet PNW climate to a very dry region, and I switched from moisturizers specifically made for the face to a heavy duty shea-butter/coconut oil based formula (made by a local artisan, it's meant for the body but the only thing that relieves the dry, ""tight"" skin feeling.) I also switched from mascara and extensions (which always looked off on my face anyways) to getting my lashes tinted every month or so, it's only 30 bucks and saves a ton of time in the morning and no more mascara streaks. I can just curl them if they need a boost

My friend told me she has a designated drawer in the end table in her entrance way for any tax-deductible receipts she picks up while she's out. As soon as she gets home, the receipts go straight in the drawer so she knows exactly where they all are come tax time (I need to implement this yesterday)

I've recently switched from making coffee daily to making a big pitcher of iced green tea every few days and having a glass in the mornings instead, I feel way less jittery, its that much faster, and it's very refreshing. Or sometimes I'll throw matcha powder straight into my breakfast smoothie.

I keep work clothes at work - I have pets and I can't lint roll enough to stay pet hair free (where I work has and uses a washing machine.)

I get loads of compliments on my ""air freshener"" and how good my space always smells but it's the orange-mango lysol (I have to disinfect between clients)

Not sure if this is a thing with gardeners, but I accidentally left my green tea pitcher out overnight and what was left went a bit weird, so I used it to water my seedlings and holy smokes they practically exploded overnight - since then I do it once a week with the end of the pitcher and my plants always look better for it.

I just can't get over her. When I'm talking to other girls they just are nothing like her and never capture my heart like jenna has. They aren't as fun to talk to, they aren't as funny as Jenna, not as pretty as Jenna, etc. I seem to be shooting myself in the foot as no matter what they just don't seem to measure up to Jenna.

The business man‚Äôs goons get offed one at a time until the young man finally confronts the business man. 

I thought the business man was Rade Serbedzija but his imdb and wiki don‚Äôt have scouting similar. Maybe someone who looks like him?? 

Another scene I remember is when he soaks cigarettes to extract the nicotine, puts it in to someone‚Äôs coffee and they have a heart attack. But I fear I might be mixing that up with another movie.

Chapter 1  
  
""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little‚Äîjust keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya‚Äîa small-town girl from a modest family‚Äîgot into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly‚Äîattending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops‚Äîpractically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant‚Äîall to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background‚Äîthere's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media‚Äîan account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience‚Äîbut now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord‚Äîjust for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect‚Äîsweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally‚Äîeven right after surgery‚Äîhe'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet‚Äîwhip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks‚Äîwe can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him‚Äîdidn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted‚Äîgone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred‚Äîswapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at‚Äîif they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month‚Äî""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too‚Äîshe'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it‚Äîhe just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala‚Äîclearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""

How should I deal with this??","This whole situation started off badly. We were pretty close as family, my brother moved away in February so it's just us 3 now.

We ate dinner together almost everyday and just did a lot together until one day my mom started spending the night elsewhere and stopped eating dinner with us entirely. She wouldn't tell me (27F) or my sister (21F) her ""friend's"" name or where he lived, which we thought was weird? She told us we didn't need to know and now we see her MAYBE a couple hours a week. At first we missed her but honestly we're apathetic about it now.

This was until she started bringing him over to spend the night. My mom knows me and my sister have issues with men in our personal space (my dad was an alcoholic who messed us up) so she knew we wouldn't be comfortable with this but she brought him over anyway. So, me and my sister would go out for coffee or just go in my room so they could pass by and go to her room. Mind you, she's been with him for only 1 month AND we still didn't know his name.

We did this every time she brought him over until we had huge argument. The argument started because I told her it was super uncomfortable/inappropriate for her to have loud sex with him a room away from us and why couldn't they do that at his house (this was a whole other thing) During the argument she finally told me his name (which honestly I didn't care anymore) and said she was embarrassed that we didn't go out to meet him. At this point they've been together for almost 3 months. I don't understand why she wants us to meet him so badly. I know me and my sister are being petty but this whole thing started off so weird and she refused to tell us anything. We don't see a point in meeting him and honestly don't really wanna meet him. I'm not even confident she'll be with him an entire year so I don't see the point? We were super close as a family but she seems to have pushed that aside for a man she met on an app.

I know I'm being stubborn. I'm just worried if I comply and meet him, she'll try to further insert this man in our lives. I work from home, we all contribute to the household and honestly, the last thing I want or need is a 45 year old man who drinks to be in our house. (I don't think he's a full blown alcoholic but any alcohol makes me nervous tbh) I feel like she feels she has to be in a relationship and us refusing to meet him is a rejection of sorts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Discovering the Delight of Mexican Ice Cream Popsicles

 Mexican ice cream popsicles, known as *paletas de crema*, offer a refreshing twist on traditional frozen treats. These creamy popsicles are beloved across Mexico for their rich texture and vibrant flavors. Unlike the typical fruit-flavored paletas, paletas de crema combine milk, cream, sugar, and spices to create a smooth, velvety dessert that melts in your mouth. Making them at home allows you to customize flavors and enjoy an authentic taste that transports you directly to Mexico‚Äôs sunny streets.

### Essential Ingredients for Paletas de Crema

 To make genuine Mexican ice cream popsicles, you‚Äôll need a few key ingredients. The blend of dairy with warm spices and sweeteners sets these popsicles apart. Gather the following:

- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- A pinch of salt
 
 Feel free to experiment by adding ingredients like sweetened condensed milk for extra sweetness or fruit purees for a fruity twist on the creamy base. These add-ins help create unique variations of the traditional recipe.

### Step-by-Step Process for Making Mexican Ice Cream Popsicles

 The process is simple, requiring only mixing, chilling, and freezing. Here‚Äôs how to create your delicious paletas de crema from scratch:

1. **Combine Dairy and Sugar:** In a medium saucepan, whisk together whole milk, heavy cream, and granulated sugar. Heat gently over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves completely but do not let the mixture boil.
2. **Add Spices and Flavoring:** Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. These spices give the popsicles their classic warm flavor.
3. **Cool the Mixture:** Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight. This step ensures the flavors meld beautifully.
4. **Pour into Popsicle Molds:** Carefully pour the chilled creamy mixture into popsicle molds, leaving just a small space at the top to allow expansion during freezing.
5. **Freeze:** Insert sticks and freeze the molds for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, until the paletas are fully set.
6. **Serve and Enjoy:** To release the paletas, briefly run warm water over the mold‚Äôs outside and gently pull on the sticks. Enjoy these rich popsicles on a warm day for an authentic Mexican experience.
 
### Flavor Variations and Tips to Elevate Paletas de Crema

 While the basic recipe is wonderfully flavorful, you can easily customize paletas with various ingredients:

- **Fruit Additions:** Mix in pureed mango, strawberry, or pineapple to the creamy base to create tropical fruit-infused paletas.
- **Chocolate Swirls:** Add melted Mexican chocolate or cocoa powder for a mocha or chocolate cinnamon flavor.
- **Nutty Touch:** Sprinkle finely chopped toasted nuts like pecans or almonds inside the molds before adding the creamy mix.
- **Sweetness Adjustment:** Substitute some sugar with honey or agave syrup for a different sweetness profile.
 
 To keep your paletas perfectly creamy, avoid using low-fat milk as it may freeze harder and less creamy. Whole milk and heavy cream provide the authentic texture Mexican ice cream popsicles are famous for.

### Why Homemade Paletas de Crema Are Worth It

 Making Mexican ice cream popsicles at home not only lets you control the ingredients, avoiding preservatives and artificial flavors, but it also connects you with a traditional treat cherished across generations. DIY paletas are perfect for parties, family gatherings, or just cooling off on a hot day.

 Plus, the process is straightforward enough to enjoy making with kids, where they can participate in mixing ingredients and choosing flavors. Sharing paletas de crema you‚Äôve made yourself adds a special touch of love and authenticity to this delightful frozen dessert.

 With this simple recipe and handy tips, you can recreate the rich, creamy goodness of authentic Mexican ice cream popsicles anytime at home. Grab your favorite ingredients, follow the steps, and enjoy a delicious taste of Mexico‚Äôs sweet tradition.

</div>Exploring Popular Flavors and Variations of Paletas de Crema in Mexican Culture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Traditional Flavors of Paletas de Crema

Paletas de crema, or Mexican ice cream popsicles, are celebrated for their creamy texture and rich flavors. These delightful treats often blend traditional Mexican ingredients with creamy bases, creating a refreshing way to enjoy dessert. Some of the most popular flavors rooted deeply in Mexican culture include:

- **Strawberry with Cream:** A classic paleta made from fresh strawberries mixed into a sweet milk-based cream, delivering a bright and luscious taste.
- **Mexican Vanilla:** Using rich vanilla extract sourced from Mexico, this flavor highlights the smooth and aromatic qualities of authentic vanilla.
- **Coconut:** Creamy paletas infused with shredded coconut or coconut milk, providing a tropical flavor loved across regions.
- **Almond (Almendra):** This flavor incorporates ground almonds or almond essence, offering a nutty sweetness that complements the creamy base.
- **Avocado Cream:** A unique and beloved flavor made by blending ripe avocado with cream and sugar, known for its silky texture and subtle taste.
 
### Innovative Twists and Seasonal Variations

While traditional recipes remain popular, creativity in paleta making is thriving. Different regions and local artisans experiment with ingredients that reflect seasonal availability or current trends, making paletas de crema versatile and exciting. Some notable variations include:

- **Horchata Paleta:** Inspired by the classic Mexican rice drink, this paleta combines cinnamon, rice milk, and sugar, delivering a creamy, spicy delight.
- **Chocolate with Chili:** A bold variation that pairs rich chocolate cream with a spicy hint of chili powder, embodying the complexity of Mexican flavors.
- **Mango with Taj√≠n:** Sweet mango blended with cream and lightly dusted with Taj√≠n seasoning offers a perfect balance between sweet and tangy with a touch of heat.
- **Caf√© con Leche (Coffee with Milk):** This flavor uses brewed coffee mixed with a creamy base, giving the paleta a comforting and energizing profile.
- **Pumpkin Spice Paleta:** Especially popular during autumn, this paleta blends pumpkin puree with cinnamon and nutmeg, creating a smooth seasonal treat.
 
### Regional Influences on Paletas de Crema

The diversity of Mexico‚Äôs landscapes and climates directly influences paleta flavors and preparation methods. Coastal regions often incorporate tropical fruits like pineapple and coconut, while central areas may favor ingredients like nuts, vanilla, and dairy-rich bases. Indigenous culinary practices also inspire the use of natural sweeteners such as piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar) and honey, which add depth to paletas de crema.

In Oaxaca, for example, you might find paletas made with locally sourced cacao and spices, echoing the region's reputation for exceptional chocolate products. Meanwhile, in Baja California, citrus flavors mixed into creamy popsicles offer a bright contrast suitable for warmer coastal climates.

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Paletas de crema provide more than just a tasty refreshment. They offer a glimpse into Mexican heritage, showcasing family recipes passed down through generations. The use of local and natural ingredients often makes these paletas a healthier alternative to commercial ice creams loaded with artificial flavors.

Many Mexican families enjoy paletas as part of celebrations, street fairs, and daily treats. Their accessibility and simplicity make them beloved across all age groups. In some communities, crafting paletas is an art form and a source of livelihood, emphasizing the cultural importance of these frozen desserts.

### How to Experience Authentic Paletas

If you want to truly savor paletas de crema, seek out local markets or artisanal vendors when visiting Mexico. The fresh ingredients and handmade quality distinguish authentic paletas from mass-produced popsicles. Additionally, trying various flavors provides insight into the regional tastes and cultural diversity within Mexico.

For those at home, making paletas de crema with fresh fruits, dairy, and spices replicates the rich flavor and texture. Experimenting with different combinations allows you to enjoy a homemade interpretation of these classic Mexican popsicles.

### Popular Pairings and Serving Tips

Paletas de crema can be enjoyed alone or paired with other traditional Mexican treats to enhance your experience. Consider these ideas:

- Enjoy a paleta alongside a warm churro for a delightful contrast of temperatures and textures.
- Pair fruit-based paletas with a sprinkle of chili powder or lime zest for an authentic Mexican flavor kick.
- Serve creamy paletas as a refreshing dessert after a spicy meal to soothe the palate.
- Use paletas as a topping for Mexican hot chocolate or coffee for a creative twist.
 
These variations show how paletas de crema fit seamlessly into Mexican culinary traditions, reflecting a balanced blend of simplicity and ingenuity.

https://voca.ro/1iu6qgFdKIJC

I woke up early this morning to the sound of rain tapping gently against the window. The sky was a soft gray, and the streets were quiet, still damp from the night before. I made a cup of coffee and stood by the window, watching as the world slowly came to life. A few people passed by, umbrellas in hand, their footsteps quick and light. There‚Äôs something peaceful about mornings like this ‚Äî calm, unhurried, almost thoughtful.

I took a deep breath, letting the warmth of the mug soak into my hands. Sometimes, these small, ordinary moments are the ones that stay with us the longest. They remind us to pause, to notice what‚Äôs around us, and to appreciate the quiet before the day begins.



2nd Passage:

https://voca.ro/1oPtHce69xL3

The path curved gently through the trees, lined with golden leaves that rustled underfoot. The air smelled of pine and damp earth, and a light breeze carried the distant sound of birdsong. I walked slowly, not in a hurry to reach anywhere in particular. Every few steps, I paused to take in the colors ‚Äî the deep reds, soft yellows, and fading greens of early autumn.

A squirrel darted across the trail, vanishing into the underbrush, and somewhere nearby, water trickled over smooth stones. It was one of those moments that felt untouched by time ‚Äî as if the world had briefly decided to exhale. There was no noise from the city, no phones ringing, no plans to rush toward. Just trees, light, and silence ‚Äî and me, somewhere in the middle of it all.",1,1747113314.0,JudgeMyAccent,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

The desire of a 30-year-old man was blunt and unfiltered.

Avery Sawyer felt as though her body had fallen apart. Consumed by overwhelming lust, she was unable to breathe properly.

""Starting tomorrow, don't schedule anything for me for a week. I'll be on vacation. Book two tickets to Mavrelle,"" Marcus said as he stood by the bed, getting dressed.

Avery moved numbly, a trace of joy flashing in her eyes. ""Marcus, you're taking me on vacation?""

Marcus Lowell paused and frowned slightly as he looked at Avery. ""I'm going with Madison.""

The smile on Avery's face froze, and she lowered her head awkwardly. ""Okay, Mr. Lowell...""

Seeing Avery's pale face, Marcus spoke again. ""Avery, you're an orphan, and you're young. I could never marry you.""

Avery looked up at Marcus and smiled bitterly. ""I never hoped you would marry me. Since Ms. Harper is divorced and back in the country, should we end our relationship?""

Marcus' expression darkened. He rubbed Avery's head with forced patience and placed a card on the nightstand, coaxing her gently, ""Here. You can buy whatever you want.""

""Mr. Lowell, I don't want to be a mistress."" Avery looked at Marcus stubbornly. It was only a matter of time before he married Madison Harper.

""It's too early to talk about that now. We'll discuss it when I actually get married. Stop throwing a tantrum. Whether we end this or not isn't up to you."" Marcus was evidently growing impatient.

After saying that, he glanced at Avery and left.

Even after the door closed, Avery's ears were ringing. She couldn't hear anything.

Avery was an orphan. When she entered university as a freshman, she was bullied by a rich woman‚ÄîMindy Lowell‚Äîbecause of her good looks. Avery was beaten deaf in one ear, had her pinky toe broken, and was nearly blinded by cigarette burns.

Someone filmed the incident and posted it online, causing a huge stir at the time.

The school had to call in the parents, and Marcus was the one who showed up for Mindy.

Marcus was Mindy's older brother.

Perhaps for the reputation of Lowell Group, or maybe out of pity, Marcus extended a helping hand to Avery, whose body was covered in injuries.

The first thing he said to her was, ""Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone bully you again.""

It was pathetic and disgraceful.

Avery fell in love with Marcus because, during the time she craved love the most, Marcus fulfilled all her fantasies about men and gave her a sense of security.

She had always thought Marcus was her salvation, but now it seemed that Marcus didn't love her. Be that as it may, he also refused to let her go.

‚Ä¶

At Lowell Group, Marcus was preparing for a meeting and to hand over his work.

Madison was waiting for him in the office.

They were about to fly to Mavrelle and spend the next seven days there together.

Avery placed a cup of coffee in front of Madison, her heart aching as if it had been sliced with a knife. ""Ms. Harper, here's your coffee.""

Madison glanced at Avery and smiled gently.

Madison came from a good family and was Marcus' childhood sweetheart. She was a perfect match for him.

Madison was an intellectual woman with an outstanding presence. She was a true socialite.

Though she was only sitting there, her confidence hurt Avery's eyes.

Avery knew she had lost‚Äîthat she had never stood a chance.

Love stories for the ages wouldn't happen between people from different worlds.

Marcus would only use Avery to pass the time when he was bored.

After placing the coffee mug down, Avery almost fled the office in embarrassment.

She had no confidence. Whether it was her being an orphan, her poverty, or her physically abused and disabled body, every pore of her exuded inferiority.

""Mr. Lowell and Ms. Harper are going on a honeymoon? I heard they've confirmed their relationship and will go public once they return. Both families have agreed to their marriage.""

In the break room, people were discussing Marcus and Madison's upcoming wedding.

While Avery was refilling hot water, the water scalded the back of her hand.

The cup dropped to the floor, and it took Avery a moment to react. She panicked and rinsed her hand under cold water.

Marcus and Madison were getting married.

That meant it was over between her and Marcus. Her internship at Lowell Group was also ending early.

""Avery, Mr. Lowell asked you to drive him and Ms. Harper to the airport at 11:00 am,"" informed a colleague.

Avery smiled bitterly, finding Marcus cruel.

She knew Marcus did it on purpose. He had a driver but insisted on her driving them just to make her realize her place and stop fantasizing about things that weren't real.

Honestly, Marcus and Mindy were both bullies. They just had different ways of going about it.

One would bully her physically, while the other emotionally, especially when her heart was already broken.

Taking out her phone, Avery hesitated for a long time before deciding to dial a number she had once blocked.

""Hello, Mr. Langston. You once said that if I married you, you'd help me further my studies in Ispon. Does your offer still stand?"" Avery asked, voice trembling.

Maybe marriage was her only way to escape Heisenville, to escape Marcus.

On the other end, the man's low voice came through. ""Think it through. Come to Bullmar Main Manor at 7:00 pm on the 13th. We'll discuss the details.""

The 13th was eight days away.

Chapter 2

Avery had just ended the call when Madison said, ""Excuse me.""

Avery turned around nervously, looking at Madison, who was now in the break room.

She was so gentle and graceful.

Madison, just standing there and smiling, gave Avery a sense of pressure.

""M-Ms. Harper, do you need something?""

""I just remembered that I haven't bought some stuff for the trip. Could you help me get them?"" Madison took out a handwritten list and handed it to Avery.

Her handwriting was as delicate and gentle as she was.

When Avery saw the word ""condoms"" on the paper, she spaced out and felt her heart break into pieces.

""Thank you, and please keep it a secret,"" Madison whispered, winking at Avery.

Avery nodded helplessly and fled the break room almost in panic.

The first time she was with Marcus, she had just turned 19. It was her birthday that day, and Marcus bought her flowers and a cake.

Growing up as an orphan, Avery had never had a birthday cake. A small cake and a bouquet of flowers were enough to capture her heart completely. She willingly gave him everything thereafter.

With a bitter smile on her face, Avery couldn't help feeling as though she were a joke.

That was why it was always better for women to have money of their own. Otherwise, all it would take was a small cake for a man to deceive them.

In the four years she'd been with Marcus, Avery had never bought condoms herself because Marcus didn't like them. He always made her take pills instead.

But he now couldn't bear to make Madison take pills. How could he when they were bad for the body?

‚Ä¶

On the way to the airport, Avery remained silent the entire time.

Perhaps noticing Avery's downcast mood, Marcus reminded her on purpose, ""Drive faster. We're in a hurry.""

""Yes, Mr. Lowell."" Avery nodded. Once the light turned green, she switched on the signal before turning left.

Just as the car in front passed the intersection, a little boy suddenly dashed through a red light. Avery swerved to avoid him and crashed straight into the flowerbed in the middle of the road.

At the moment of impact, Marcus held Madison tightly in his arms. ""Madison!""

Fortunately, Avery didn't drive too fast. Only the driver's side was severely damaged.

The airbag deployed during the collision. Avery was pinned tightly in her seat by the crushed frame. Her left leg was trapped at the point of impact, the pain nearly making her lose consciousness.

""Marcus, help me‚Ä¶"" The overwhelming fear made Avery's voice tremble.

Avery was claustrophobic, and she couldn't move.

Back in her freshman year, Mindy had once locked her in a square wooden equipment box. No matter how hard she cried or pounded on it, no one came to save her.

That suffocating, immobilizing pressure made her wish she were dead.

If the janitor on duty the next day hadn't noticed the urine stain she left on the floor, she probably would've died in there that night.

Seeing Marcus about to get out of the car, Avery panicked and no longer cared whether Madison was present. ""Marcus! Don't leave me.""

""The rescue team and traffic police will handle it.""

Marcus got out of the car while shielding Madison. He then made a call to emergency services, looking annoyed.

""Your assistant is still inside."" Madison looked at Marcus suspiciously. An assistant calling the boss by his first name was unheard of.

Marcus pulled Madison into his arms and glanced at Avery‚Äîwho was trapped inside the car‚Äîindifferently.

""There's no time, and it's not a serious crash. Let's take a cab to the airport. Rescue services will take care of her.""

Madison nodded, giving Avery a meaningful look. But she said nothing as she walked away with Marcus.

Avery struggled while pounding on the window. But Marcus never looked back.

Avery knew that Marcus was afraid Madison would misunderstand.

As she watched Marcus walk away, she finally lost control and broke down in sobs. ""Marcus, help me! You said you wouldn't leave me. You liar. Marcus, you're a liar! You said you'd protect me!""

Avery was falling apart. Her depression and manic episodes caused her to struggle uncontrollably in the cramped space.

Though she wasn't badly injured at first, her repeated self-harming behavior made it worse.

""Let me out! Let me out!"" Avery shouted, pounding on the window.

The trauma from freshman year left her unable to think calmly. Soon, the acrid smell of smoke from the engine began to fill the car.

""That car's on fire!""

""Is anyone still inside? I saw the people from the car walk away.""

The passersby started shouting.

Trapped in the car, Avery began counting in despair, ""One, two, three, four...""

The night Mindy locked her in the wooden box, Avery counted all the way to 6,788.

She was wondering what number she would get to this time before she died.",1,1747112989.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

* Kawaguchi said in an interview: ‚ÄúIn my story, I didn‚Äôt intend to write about regret, but wanted to write about how we accept it and go forward.‚Äù How does that come through in the book? 
* One of the central ideas of the book is the concept of ‚Äúduty to others.‚Äù What are your personal views on duty to others? How do you see this concept in BTS‚Äôs lyrics, message, and actions?
* This book and ‚ÄúThe Midnight Library‚Äù, which we read last year, both tackle the subject of regrets and fixing the past via magical realism. What do these books have in common, how are they unique, and how do you feel about each one‚Äôs approach? 
* This book was originally a play and has since been adapted to the screen. If you were making a TV series about it, what songs (BTS & otherwise) would you add to its OST?

## **Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**


In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a caf√© that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee‚Äîthe chance to travel back in time. Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the caf√© in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn‚Äôt so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most importantly, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold.

1kldtdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kldtdt/silent_tension_with_my_neighbor_for_months_no/,"Silent tension with my neighbor for months ‚Äì no contact now, but her behavior keeps triggering questions. Am I overthinking it?","
Hey everyone,
I (29M) have been in a strange, silent dynamic with my neighbor (30F) since March. It started with a handwritten letter I left in her mailbox ‚Äì respectful, personal, signed with my first name. It wasn‚Äôt a love confession, more of a thoughtful, quiet approach based on a real-life situation. The message was roughly:

> ‚ÄúOur cars are always parked next to each other ‚Äì maybe it‚Äôs time we get to know each other better than they do. Coffee?‚Äù
P.S.: ‚ÄúI promise the cars will stay best friends either way.‚Äù



The letter was a bit more refined than that, kind and calm.
The next day, she was visibly red-faced, nervous and flustered ‚Äì struggling to close her trunk. That was my first clear sign: She read it. And it hit something.

A few days later ‚Äì on International Women‚Äôs Day ‚Äì I sent her a bouquet via taxi delivery, again with my first name clearly written on the note, along with a Cars movie greeting card (Lightning & Sally) as a light metaphor for timing, connection, fate.

Still no response. No look. No comment.

Shortly after, I approached her on the parking lot and introduced myself:

> ‚ÄúHey, we haven‚Äôt really had the chance ‚Äì I‚Äôm ... .‚Äù
She smiled and introduced herself back.
Then I added, playfully:
‚ÄúOn Friday when I walked past your car ‚Äì I felt kinda magnetically pulled by your dreamcatcher.‚Äù



That was a subtle reference to a moment where she had been sitting in her car, visibly avoiding eye contact, staring down. I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass her ‚Äì just reflect the feeling.
She laughed genuinely. Then she said:

> ‚ÄúSorry, I have to head to work.‚Äù



I asked:

> ‚ÄúDo you prefer texting or calling?‚Äù
She replied:
‚ÄúNot really feeling it right now‚Ä¶‚Äù



I respected that. No follow-up, no messages, no more direct moves.


---

What happened after that:

Sometimes I‚Äôd be outside in the mornings when she was leaving. Not daily, just once after a week, then another after two weeks, etc.
She even greeted me first a few times ‚Äì not every time, but enough that it didn‚Äôt feel accidental anymore.
And this was after I had already gone completely quiet.

Once I saw her in the city, driving. I waved ‚Äì and she waved back.

Later, I made a light-hearted move:

> ‚ÄúIs your Instagram a closed society, or do you still have room for one more?‚Äù
She replied:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really use Insta that much‚Ä¶‚Äù




After that:

She ignored me twice ‚Äì very clearly.

Her Instagram is private ‚Äì but she removed some followers and followed a new page right after that.



---

What‚Äôs really confusing me:

She never once mentioned the letter or the flowers.
Not even a ‚ÄúThat was a lot‚Äù or ‚ÄúBold move‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not looking for a thank-you ‚Äì just some form of human acknowledgment.
These weren‚Äôt anonymous gestures. My name was on both.

I‚Äôve now noticed three separate times:
I drive away late in the evening (~10 PM), and within 30 seconds, her lights go off.
Once, I even saw her shadow behind the window.
But then she‚Äôs still awake at 12:30 AM. It doesn‚Äôt seem like bedtime ‚Äì it seems emotional reaction.

Also, her bathroom stays lit for a very long time late at night lately.
I‚Äôm not spying ‚Äì it‚Äôs just visible from my window. It stood out after everything.



---

So here‚Äôs my honest question ‚Äì especially to those with a bit of a psychological view:

Why would someone say nothing at all about a personal, respectful gesture ‚Äì
and then still show subtle reactions weeks or months later?

Is it emotional insecurity? Polite rejection? Inner conflict?

Should I ever try speaking to her again ‚Äì or accept that this is something that will never be resolved?


I never pressured her. I showed interest, yes ‚Äì but always calmly, without expectations.
But it feels like two people emotionally circling each other, unable to break through the silence.

Thanks for reading. Would really appreciate your honest thoughts.

For a backstory, I‚Äôm 21 f. My whole life I‚Äôve had soda/junk food/any food that was just usually cheap and fast. So not really anything too good for the body. On average I was drinking 2-3 cokes a day and from 2019-2024 I was drinking a coffee and sometimes an energy drink every day. In order for me to sleep, I‚Äôd have to drink something extremely caffeinated. Last year around may, I had gone to bed after eating some tomato soup which I had always done. I was always eating pizza or pasta or anything with red sauce/tomatoes. 

I had fallen asleep for about 3-4 hours before I woke up and felt very very off. Next thing you know, not even 3 seconds later, it felt like I was having a panic attack. I couldn‚Äôt stand up, my arms were weak and it felt like someone was reaching in and grabbing my chest and squeezing. I half army crawled to my mom‚Äôs room where I had to wake her by screaming outside of her door. She rushed me to the ER where I couldn‚Äôt walk unless I was extremely hunched over. They hooked me up to 2 IV‚Äòs, gave me some meds and said I had GERD. 

I went home and researched about it and ate all the foods that were recommended. I was scared to eat too much so I lost a lot of weight. Fast forward until now, I‚Äôve been to the ER 6 or 7 times since then with the same unbearable pain. It‚Äôs honestly made me extremely suicidal and if I eat even a little over than maybe 8 bites of food at a time, it hurts. I drink nothing but water, avoid dairy as much as I can, and avoid tomato as a whole. 

The last time I was in the ER the doctor had told me I had been there so much they don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth taking me in anymore. I‚Äôm hoping to get some answers or advice. GERD is ruining my every day to day life. I just want to be normal again. 

EDIT: I should also mention that I suffer from extreme panic attacks and PTSD. I don‚Äôt know if it could be related, but just some extra info. ",12,1747110744.0,GERD,6,1.0,False
