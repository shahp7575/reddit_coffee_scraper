My 6-year molars came in severely malformed due to having seizures as a baby, and my 12-year molars had some issues as well. I had to get my upper 6-year molars removed due to the problems, while I have crowns on the bottom two. 

I brush my teeth twice a day with nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste, and then use flouride mouthwash afterward. I floss every night (with string floss) and use my water flosser afterward every other night. 

Despite all this, my back molars all have a very rough surface and some staining, I have had issues with cavities (I just had to have silver diamine applied to my top right molars for remineralization), and I have a lot of sensitivity. 

I don‚Äôt ever drink soda, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol very frequently (and when I do I brush my teeth right after), I occasionally drink coffee and tea (I have a matcha latte 1-2X a week), I don‚Äôt ever really eat citrus, I don‚Äôt use any nicotine products, and I don‚Äôt take any medications that would cause it. I also eat mostly whole foods. I do love fruit a lot and eat a lot of berries, but not excessively.

Before that I lived near downtown about a year and liked it but was dating someone out of Austin so couldn't fully explore all the cool spots while I was still there. I moved to domain here originally cz couple of my friends lived here. They have moved out of Austin and I have grown out of this area. I have been exploring other areas in austin and I am really interested in the East Austin, riverside, south lamar areas.

Outside of work I am into yoga, meditation, reading, traveling, dancing and coffee shops so vicinity to one or more of these activities is great.  Looking for a social and diverse community to keep the weekends happening and make some some new friends in this beautiful city.

Budget wise I am pretty flexible but want to keep it under 2K.

1ilqeoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/overlanding/comments/1ilqeoh/unseen_paths_the_journey_begins/,Unseen paths: The journey begins,"The horsebox door slammed shut. Just like that, Nico and Neila were gone.
I didn‚Äôt step outside. Didn‚Äôt watch them leave.
What would have been the point?

It wasn‚Äôt anger that sat with me‚Äîit was clarity. The hag had played her game well. She had forced my hand with the horses, and now she was circling Jeb and Charlie.

That was the line.

Losing the horses had been hard, but I could justify it. They‚Äôd be fine where they were going. Jeb and Charlie, though? That was different. They weren‚Äôt just animals I cared for‚Äîthey were family and, her intentions were far more deadly.

The decision wasn‚Äôt made out of pride or stubbornness. It was survival. I had lived this way for 18 years, refining what the military first taught me. Now, I‚Äôd use every skill I had to disappear.

The first goal was simple: 100 kilometres to the Lithuanian border, through forest and country tracks. I gave myself three days‚Äî40km on the first, then 30 per day after that.

It was winter. That was both an advantage and a risk.

The first stretch was easy enough. Hard-packed snow made for solid footing, and the cold wasn‚Äôt biting yet. Jeb trotted ahead, alert but relaxed. Charlie, legs too short to keep pace for long, took his usual place draped over my shoulders like a living scarf.

I moved fast, keeping the rhythm I‚Äôd drilled into myself over years of walking. Breaks were short‚Äîjust enough to sip from the thermos, to let the dogs rest without cooling down too much.

But by nightfall, the world shifted.

A thaw rolled in overnight. The change was sudden, the way winter sometimes plays tricks. Snow turned to slush, ice to sucking mud. Everything wet, everything seeping. My boots, my gloves, my pack. The kind of wet that doesn‚Äôt just chill you‚Äîit steals heat from the inside out.

By morning, the world was a swamp. I pushed on, but every step was a battle. Waterlogged ground clung to my boots. Trees dripped constantly, sending icy trickles down my collar. The damp had weight‚Äîit slowed movement, sapped energy.

And then, just as suddenly, winter came back.

The temperature plunged. Water turned solid mid-step. The slush that had soaked everything now locked into place, freezing stiff fabric, turning boots into ice blocks. My gloves cracked as I flexed my fingers.

It was dangerous in a different way now. Slippery, brittle. Any fall could end in a twisted ankle, or worse, hypothermia if I stayed down too long. I kept moving, pacing myself, focusing on balance.

That was when I found the house.

A crumbling shell, long abandoned. No roof, but four walls still standing. Enough of a break from the wind to set up a fire, dry out what I could.

It should have been a quiet night. It wasn‚Äôt.

The dogs came at dusk.

Five of them, lean and moving as a pack. Not wild, but not tame either‚Äîvillage dogs that had learned to fend for themselves. Their movements were measured, confident. They weren‚Äôt charging, but they weren‚Äôt afraid.

Jeb stiffened, a growl rumbling low in his throat. Charlie pressed against my leg, small but aware.

The pack spread out, cutting off escape. They weren‚Äôt attacking‚Äînot yet. They were testing. Weighing their odds.

I squared up. Took a step forward. My voice cut through the frozen air, sharp and unwavering.

‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

For a moment, they hesitated. Five pairs of eyes locked onto mine. A silent decision was made.

And then, just like that, they turned and melted into the night.

Jeb let out a breathy huff. Charlie leaned harder against my leg. I exhaled too, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension.

We stayed in that ruin for the night. Not out of fear‚Äîjust practicality. A fire, some warmth, a moment to recalibrate.

By morning, we were moving again. The border was still ahead, the road still long. But we weren‚Äôt stopping. Not now.

Not ever.


By the third day, my body felt like it had been used for football practice. My left hip ached, stiff from the cold and the miles. My phone was dead, leaving me to rely on scribbled notes for navigation.

I came across a lumberjack camp‚Äîthree caravans, heavy-duty machinery, and the hum of generators. As I approached, the stress of the earlier dog confrontation must have still been sitting with Jeb because he suddenly turned on Charlie. No cause. No warning. Maybe exhaustion, maybe lingering tension. But once attacked, Charlie fought back. He was smaller, but he wasn‚Äôt going down without a fight.

I lunged between them, kicking Charlie away while I grabbed Jeb and tethered him to a tree. Charlie was still snarling, not ready to let it go, but I had to separate them.

I needed to charge my phone. In broken Russian, I asked one of the lumberjacks, and he motioned toward the back of his van. As the battery climbed back to life, I knelt beside Charlie and checked the damage. His little body trembled, his breathing shallow, his eyes darting between me and Jeb. His neck was raw where Jeb had latched onto him. The punctures weren‚Äôt deep, but the bruising already ran deep under his fur. I worked quickly, my fingers numb as I cleaned and patched him up. Jeb sat, ears flicking, watching.

The boss of the lumberjacks handed me a pack of MREs and some frikadellen for the dogs. He also gave me five litres of red diesel in an old antifreeze container, pointing out a good spot where I could camp safely away from their machinery.

That night, I built my fire nestled in the V of a fallen tree, stuffing the space that was to be my bed between the branches with twigs and dead leaves still clinging to their stems. It was a good shelter, just big enough for Jeb and me. Charlie would sleep on my chest, wrapped in my heavy leather coat, and Jeb would stay tethered‚Äîjust in case.

The fire burned steady, throwing flickering light against the damp night. I cooked the MRE and ate while Jeb and Charlie shared the last of their dog biscuits, softened with water from the Kelly kettle. Jeb kept his distance, quiet now, as if he knew he‚Äôd taken things too far. Charlie barely moved, exhaustion and pain leaving him limp against me.

The machines worked through the night, their rumble threading through my sleep, but I barely stirred. Jeb stayed where he was, and Charlie never left my side.

By morning, the fire had burned down to embers. I packed up, shifted Charlie onto my shoulders, and released Jeb. He stuck close, subdued now.

My navigation had been right. A left turn. One final road. 

I'd dropped off what was left of the diesel and started the walk.

The border was ahead.

The Final Stretch

The road stretched ahead, a promise of asphalt and civilisation not far beyond. As I walked, I passed a health spa, its pristine buildings standing in stark contrast to the wilderness I had been navigating. The idea of fresh water‚Äîor even the unlikely offer of a coffee‚Äîcrossed my mind, but the locked gates and silence told me I wasn‚Äôt welcome.

Pressing on, I turned down a track and was met by another pack of dogs. This time, they were different‚Äîfarm dogs, not strays. They barked noisily from a distance, holding their ground near a barn, but they didn‚Äôt advance. They weren‚Äôt a threat, just a warning.

And then, at last, it was there‚Äîthe Lithuanian border. Not fifty metres beyond it, the sweet sight of asphalt roads.

I walked along the tarmac, exhaustion setting in, but the knowledge that I was finally out of Latvia gave me a second wind. Only thirty kilometres to civilisation. And hopefully, somewhere to stay.

Barely five kilometres down the road, I spotted a small factory unit. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was a place to rest, to take a breath and let the reality sink in‚Äîwe had made it.

At the far end of the sheds, a lorry sat idling, the engine‚Äôs steady hum breaking the silence. I approached the driver, Charlie still draped over my shoulders, and asked in broken Russian, ‚ÄúHeading to town? Any chance of a lift?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúRiga,‚Äù he replied. The last place I wanted to be.

Disappointed, I turned back toward Jeb and my gear. But then, the driver called me back, gesturing toward another man. A brief exchange in Lithuanian, a nod in my direction.

‚ÄúThis guy,‚Äù the driver said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll take you to town.‚Äù

I previously posted about dental implants and got answers regarding why they are not recommended and to keep my natural teeth for as long as possible. That's all crystal clear to me now.

Here are some details about my teeth from my old post with some edits: I've had well over a dozen fillings (lost track), 3 root canals, and 4 crowns. It was recommended that I keep my natural teeth for as long as possible despite doing around $20k worth of damage already. My teeth got this way due to not seeing the dentist throughout undergrad and overrelying on my parents to still schedule appointments on my behalf. I drank a ton of acidic drinks and energy drinks, which I've abstained from for 5 years and now take caffeine tablets instead (which I'm cutting down now as well). I also have the prescription toothpaste with the highest amount of flouride. I also have a nightguard that I officially need to replace and pick up once it is done next week since I wore it out after 3 years and accidentally bent a part of the left side. The good news is that, even though my self care in the past half year wasn't good, I didn't have any cavities or urgent work needed other than a new nightguard.

I'm posting now because, even though my teeth are coffee stained to the extreme, I have no interest in cosmetic work since no one really notices my teeth and are often surprised about my dental issues when I open up about them to friends.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been in dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. 

I am a complete virgin and I‚Äôve been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. 

I do not watch online adult content and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.


So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. 

I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes my skin is quite pale and I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and tv. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all 

I have no tattoos no piercings either looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. 

I like natural looking women that have no heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Oh I also love avocados! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort! 

Also I am very family orientated family is very important to me! 

I‚Äôm also open to being friends with someone too so please don‚Äôt be put off if you feel being friends would be better for you! ",1,1739137466.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

The past few months I have plateud and ended up gaining 10lb. 

I really struggle with feeling hungry, I try and curb it by drinking water or 0 calorie fizzy drinks but I always end up snacking and going over my calories by about 200. And then lately I think we'll I've gone over by 200 so what does another 300 matter? Thus I've gained weight.

Every day lately is 'the last pigout day' and tomorrow I 'get back on track for real'. Usually I last until day 3 by allowing myself a day of eating as much as I want, and then I go 2 days before caving. It's not working and I don't know how to fix it. I love food so much.

During the day is easy, I'm usually not hungry until midday so I allow myself around 600 calories for lunch which in reality leaves about 900 - 1000 for dinner which really should be enough. But I keep snacking in between and eventually end up with 400 calories for dinner, which for me isn't enough,and I end up going over my calories.

I really try to eat whole, filling lunches. Things like greek yogurt with banana, strawberry, honey, some granola and sometimes a spoonful of peanut butter. A bag of crisps (not great I know) a coffee with almond milk. And I've been learning new recipes for dinner, things like garlic chicken Orzo (about 700 calories a serving), or Chinese style steak, that sort of thing.

I have a problem ordering fast food too, it doesn't matter if I delete the apps because I'll just re download them. I know I can do it, I know I can lose weight through calories counting because I've done it before, it just seems this time round is so much harder (maybe because last time I did it, about 5 years ago, I was younger and childless ... Now I work long hours and have a toddler and I'm always tired and it's so easy to say I've had a hard day with my toddler, I need to order pizza).

So how do you distract yourself from snacking, how do you talk yourself out of reaching for that second bag of crisps, or ordering takeout?? Last year I finally fit in to some old Levis that haven't fit me in years ... And this year they're starting to tighten and I'm so mad at myself.",7,1739137379.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

Side stepping the deeper issues of ""who is this 'I' in the first place?"" And, ""what is 'reality'?""

My view can roughly be boiled down to two observations. 1. That on the smallest scales (point particles in physics, or even the spaces between particles), 'meaning' has no... well, meaning. A particle acts the way it does because that's what it does. Ascribing 'purpose' or 'meaning' to such behavior is (to use the word colloquially) absurd, as such definition would be outside the 'reality' of the particle itself. (I use physics definitions because I'm a physicist, but insert your favorite metaphor of what ""the universe on the smallest scale"" would mean in your philosophy.)

And 2. That the universe as a whole similarly has no ""meaning"" or ""purpose"", as that would assume there is something external to said universe (I would replace ""universe"" as is traditionally understood with the concept of the ""Omniverse"" which I define as ""EveryThing and NoThing"") by which to compare.

""Meaning"" and/or ""purpose"" only makes sense when dealing with something in between the largest and smallest constructions. That's not to say anything about what that purpose is or isn't, or whether that experience is positive or negative, but only that it's existence only makes sense ""in the middle"".

I'm aware that there are ""school busses"" but still want to live in a general vicinity as an option. 

I am most familiar with NIST as we have visited the campus before. I am familiar with the options in the Asok and Benchakitti park areas (<30 min walk to campus), but where else is a good spot that we could reasonably get to the school by train? 

I am not at all familiar with Bangna or Nichada Thani. Never been at all. 

I'm looking for areas that are close to public transit, with some parks/walking paths nearby, and not super residential (with restaurants, bars, coffee shops, stores <10 minute walk away). No strict budget. I'd like to be able to get to most places in Bangkok without spending too much time in traffic, so I'm heavily leaning toward NIST for its location. Is it relatively family friendly there, or is the proximity to Nana a bit much? 

Should I rule out either Patana or ISB just due to the above? Bang Na seems ok, but getting out of the ISB area is well over two hours to Chinatown by public transport (as an example). You have to drive if you live near there?

May 2024 I started experiencing a gnawing intense pain in my mid upper abdomen. I felt like everything I ate wouldn‚Äôt digest quickly and I would throw up occasionally. One day at work I got the intense pain again and I couldn‚Äôt even stand up straight. I was convinced I had an ulcer because of taking medicine on an empty stomach (I had a cold a week before and was taking DayQuil pills on an empty stomach). I went to urgent care that day and expressed my concerns. The dr agreed it sounded like an ulcer and referred me to a gastrointestinal dr. Get an appointment pretty quickly after that and again I explain my issues. Dr decides he wants me to get an ultrasound of my organs to rule out stones and he would like to do an endoscopy to check for an ulcer or whatever else. In the meantime he prescribes me ppis. I go to my ultrasound appointment pretty soon after that and he tells me they found no stones or any issues. Great! However I‚Äôm still having pain. It wakes me up at night at this point and I feel it more on my right upper abdomen and back. I feel extremely bloated, nauseous, chills for 4-6 hours. I started drinking a lot of oat milk because it would feel like it was soothing my pain, started eating a lot of yogurt and eating smaller meals. I had been losing weight before my pain pretty steadily with portion control and healthier food choices so I wasn‚Äôt really eating much fried food at this point anyways. However the pain would still come when I would lay down. Middle of the night I was up in excruciating pain. I didn‚Äôt go to the ER because I was already working with a GI dr so I figured what was wrong with me wasn‚Äôt something er could help me with. They would most likely just treat my pain and refer me back to my dr. I now wait on my endoscopy which was scheduled for July. July comes around and I have my endoscopy. They find out I have a haital hernia but no signs of an ulcer or anything else. The hernia is very small so the dr doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the reason for my pain. I‚Äôm relieved but at the same time annoyed that I still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me at this point and the pain was becoming more frequent. My GI drs office said they would call me to follow up on the next steps but they didn‚Äôt. I also did not follow up and just dealt with the pain until around October. I was experiencing an attack at least once a week at this point and it would last 6-12 hours now. I reached out to my PCP and she was stunned that my GI dr never followed up after my endoscopy so she referred me to a new one. Sadly this new GI dr didn‚Äôt have any openings until end of march 2025. I made the appointment but from October until end of January I was legit feeling like I was dying. During the holidays I was having attacks once or twice a week. I was missing work at this point from how exhausted and weak I was. I lost 20 pounds around this time. My gf would beg me to go to the ER but I would still refuse because I was in so much pain when it would happen I didn‚Äôt even want to move let alone be in an ER waiting. So flash forward a bit to the third week of January. I have 4 attacks in 6 days. I threw up everything I ate during those days and the pain was worse than ever. A sharp pain upper right abs below my ribs and my back hurt so bad. Nothing I did would take it away. I was crying in unbearable pain and I finally decided to go to the ER on Jan 22nd. I explained my symptoms and they think it might be my hernia but would do an ultrasound just in case and what do you freaking know!! I had gallstones!! The ultrasound tech was surprised that I had no idea. She said it‚Äôs crazy that they missed it in my first ultrasound because I had a lot of them!! So of course my pain subsided and I was sent home told to follow up with my dr so I can schedule with a surgeon. I get an appointment for Friday the 31st and that morning I get blood work done because my wbc count was a bit high during my er visit the week before. My Dr also sends an urgent referral for surgery and I go home. That night and the following 4 days I have the most horrible attacks again which cause me to throw up everything. I message my dr and she recommends I visit the ER again because they can offer me emergency surgery if needed so Monday Feb 3rd I go again. This time my blood work shows I have an extremely high wbc count, AST and ALT levels high as well as other things. They admit me and decide I need the surgery but first they want to check if there are any stones stuck in my biliary ducts so I have a ct scan done. Turns out I do have some stones stuck so I had to have another endoscopy procedure done to remove the stones and the following day I had surgery to remove my gallbladder. Now I am 3 days post op and I feel great! The pain is very manageable. The worst part is the gas and right shoulder pain but again it isn‚Äôt too bad. So far I‚Äôve eaten oatmeal, a banana, an a√ßa√≠ bowl, a spicy chicken soup, French fries, Coke Zero and I‚Äôve had a bit of an iced coffee and have had no negative reaction. I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôll finally be able to go back to my normal life! If I were to give any advice it would be that if you are in pain that long and throw up you should 100% visit the emergency room. If I wouldn‚Äôt have been so stubborn I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been in pain for as long as I was! Also I would say always get a second opinion if you‚Äôre not getting answers about your health because clearly the first ultrasound tech did not know what they were doing and missed my gallstones originally!!

So I got my first job as a waitress months ago thanks to a friend, who I'm gonna call Jenny. In that job I tried my best to learn due to my none experience, and I thought everything was ok but then the Chef, Sofia and her daughter, Isabella started to have very odd attitude. In the first place we were cordial to each other, but one time I had to work with Isabella in another salon, there the first day went good, the next day she had an issue with me because I did something wrong according to her: I was used to take the plates from the tables after the person finishes and prepare it for the next meal, but according to Isabella I have to wait until she appears and just tell her, because I have to wait until the meals are done and then take every plate at once quickly to then prepare for the next meals while they are getting cold. It sounds easy if it is for 2 or 4 people, but with a table of 13 or 20 it isn't that easy plus the plates are heavy, like with 7 plates I already struggle. 

So with that I committed that mistake like 2 times, in the second time she got really angry and after that day her attitude towards me got  harsh, so did with her mother too. The thing is that during a month and a half both of them started to isolated me, give me the hard work like moving the chairs, tables, clean the saloonswhilet they take a coffee and talk about life. At first I followed my friend's advice and just work and suck it up, but you could tell they didn't like me, cause any time I appeared suddenly they got quiet or their looks of disgust were everything to know that they didn't like me. I mean I get it, not everyone had to like me and it's normal, but the way they were giving me the hard work while they were just spending time taking a coffe or sitting just made me feel uneasy, and I thought that maybe I was the one overreacting. Also I had to add that during all those situations Jenny just saw it in silence, with a smile and acting like nothing happened. And I thought that it was because she didn't want to get in trouble so I understood it because she needed that job... Still it hurt me that she just smiled during those situations.

Well, everything blew up during Christmas, that day I was supposed to work with Isabella in a saloon while Jenny had to work upstairs, well we had like 4 tables, 2 bigs and 2 mediums, well, the first problem came when during the service Isabella suddenly disappeared, she had this thing to go upstairs with her mother, of course I didn't know until Jenny came downstairs, then I knew I had to work with her, in all off sudden I had to serve few drinks and when Jenny appeared and gave me Another instructions I told her I couldn't because I had to serve those drinks, she suddenly told me that I was screaming at her and that I didn't have to act like that because that's why I was having problems with everyone, at that moment I was confused because I didn't scream at her or talked loud, we had a fight there with her telling me that I had problems with Isabella because of my attitude and my answers. This come from 2 weeks ago I started to answer things in some situations, like when Isabella told me to redo the tables that I did it wrong and I asked her what I did wrong and how to do it because I don't know (apparently that was a bad answer), other situation was when I was working upstairs with my boss and the tables downstairs were too loud so my boss sent me to ask Isabella if she could talk with the tables and asked them to be more quiet, when I went to tell them that she answered me that I should do it (she was sitting with Jenny whit her phone calmly) so I answered ""well, he(my boss) asked you to do it so... "" and apparently that was so disrespectful and arrogant for my part, according to Jenny, that she couldn't believe how arrogant I was.

Well, during all the shift I had to endure both of them giving me different orders, both of them disappearing and leaving me alone with almost 32 people when I still struggled to know what kind of cutlery I had to prepare or what kind of wine serve, at some point Isabella got rude towards me in front of the clients in 2 occasions during the shift, first when she told me to serve a wine, and when I was opening it she came and took it from me harshly, while talking to me in a mad tone saying that I shouldnt be serving the wine when she clearly told me to do it. Another time was when I was preparing some cutlery and I asked a woman what was her meal so I could put the correct cutlery for her, Isabella came and tolde to not talk to the client like that again, I got confused because I didn't know what I did wrong this time. At the end of the shift my boss came to talk to me about what happened, apparently Jenny had complained about me saying that I was being rude, conflictive and more stuff, when he asked I tried to be calm and tell him what happened, after that he just told me to learn to deal with people like that, and I just nodded because it was true, if I was gonna work there I had to learn how to endure that but when I got out of work and met my mother (she came to pick me up) I started to cry when she asked me about the work, I just felt impotent, like I was useless and couldn't be enough to endure that harsh environment. She decided to take me to her house and stay there with her, the next day I wrote to my boss saying that I couldn't work anymore due to the situation and how it affected me mentally, that I didn't want to make things difficult for him when I couldnt work with 2 people due to our issues. He called me and we talked about it, at some point my mother talked to him because she wanted to be sure that I was gonna be ok if I was gonna keep working there (she is very protective due to me being her only family). well I didn't work for him anymore because the day I was supposed to go I got pneumonia, I spent the day before in the ER and couldn't go the next day to work, when I told him that he just answered me that he has been working too many years, like meaning that I was lying or making an excuse to not go to work for the problems in had with the other waitresses. He didn't talk to me after that and I accepted it, the thing is that after that I still had to deal with Jenny because we were roommates, when I went back to the apartment she wanted to talked to me about what happened and when I told her she just told me that it was my fault for my attitude, that I was conflictive and it was my fault for not following her advice to suck it up and kiss Isabella's ass. At that moment I knew that even after telling her how I felt, how they treated me, even after repeating it, she just believed that it was my fault, so I just stopped and didn't want to talk about it anymore. During that month things got tense but I was busy with exams so I ignored it, but today she wanted to talk again about it and she said that I betrayed her, saying that after all she has done for me I stabbed her in the back. Apparently according to her I talk bad about her to my boss when I wrote the message, something that i think is false because I read it multiples time and never said something bad about her, plus she thinks that how I ended leaving the job was pathetic, because my mother got involved (she just talked with my boss once and that was just to give her opinion for the situation due to her experience in that area of work), in Jenny's eyes I was an arrogant, childish and immature person who had to grow up because this will happen again and this attitude will make me loose friends (let's be honest, between us she hardly has any friends because she always talks bad about everyone) I know I was wrong how I handle this, but I wanted to know some outside perspective because maybe I'm missing something.

So I want to quit vaping altogether and therefore switched my juice to 0 nicotine, my train of thought being: I'd get rid of the nicotine addiction first and then when ready, drop the vape altogether. No nic addiction, no problemo, right? And for that transition period I'd have the advantage of being able to continue my habitual vaping process.

So I started 25 days ago with vaping 0nic juice and of course I immediately got all the nice side effects of being an addict in withdrawal: Sadness, demotivation, anger, the complete emotional instability benefits, yay!

Cut to today and I feel only slight and temporal improvements in my mood. I still vape a lot and when I don't, I still have this immense feeling of cravings. Like my mouth is providing endless saliva and I either need to vape or eat a lot of sweets or find other replacement drugs like coffee. But this is permanent, and I was hoping that after nearly a month without nicotine, I should be more relieved by now?!

Now I'm questioning if my way of stopping is really promising. Anybody of you did it the same way I'm trying now?

My plan is to keep vaping for another 2-4 weeks or so and then try to drop the vape for good. I mean, the nicotine addiction isn't the problem then any more, right?

Wow, are you Pisces too? and she said yes. We continued talking later. And we met at a bar on the same day.  And chitchat about this and that and I‚Äôve learnt that We were born on the same day and even in the same year. I was very surprised with this interesting information. On the first date, she told me about the pain she had experienced through her life, that she was an adopted child, and she had lost her father years ago. She told me that she had met her biological mother 4 years ago. I told her about losing my mother and my forced and intense relationship with my father. We chatted for a while longer and then I said, ""Let's have a drink and go to the farthest table in the bar."" We continued chatting at the table in the corner. After a certain amount of alcohol and chatting, I kissed her and she kissed me back. She drank beer and I drank cocktails. cocktails and beers followed one another. Then we went to her house and made love. We felt incredible. We made love again later. The next day, I still hadn't gotten her number. On the one hand, it was like that we had known each other for a very long time. It was as if we had never met yesterday and had known each other for years. We continued chatting after morning coffee. After a while, I asked for her number before leaving and got it. We talked constantly the following days, but I had gone on a date with someone else. I was in a period where I wanted to go on dates all the time. After meeting her, I went on the first date with someone else and returned home alone after a certain level of booze while thinking what the heck I‚Äôm doing with this woman. Then I understood I felt like I had found the person I was looking for because I realized that I didn't want to go on dates with anyone anymore. I wrote to her the same day and went her. We had beers and made love again. We felt incredible while making love. She told me that she had never felt anything like this in her life before. I told her so. She was quivering over and over again while cumming. 
Time went by and we saw each other every day. One day while making love, she said to me, promise me that you will never make love with anyone else? Then, before I could even answer, she said that even if you did, you wouldn't feel like this. Later, i smiled and said, I promise I won‚Äôt. Time went and at one day, while talking about first dates and etc she told me she raped by her boyfriend when she was 16. And she said that he was also a child of rape. Her biological mother, whom he met 4 years ago, was raped by his brother-in-law when he was 16, and her biological mother's father left her at the police station, and then a family without children took her in and raised her. His rapist father (who is also his brother-in-law) was a drug dealer and a bad guy, and then he was shot and killed. While he was telling me his secrets, I was telling him my own secrets, telling him that my relationship with my father was bad, that my father was psychologically abusing me and that he raised me aggressively. We drank from time to time and had sex all the time because of my high libido. I was liking about her almost anything incredibly attractive. Her smell, hair, voice, everything was incredible. And she also was someone who had gotten married and divorced, his father had lost lung cancer years ago and before dying he wanted to see her married. Shortly after her marriage, her father passed away, and he decided to end his marriage. Before his marriage ended, he met a hairdresser and they became lovers, and then her marriage ended, of course, she lost most of her belongings and her car along with divorce. 
Our relationship was going very well until we went on vacation to a city together. I had drunk too much alcohol on the last day of the vacation. I behaved in a way that she did not want while making love, and when we woke up next day we were not on good. I did not remember exactly what happened yesterday. According to her, I had spoken harshly while making love, she had asked me to play with myself and I had told her that I would not play with myself only you play, according to her. She had told me that the rape trauma had been triggered. She had not broken up with me in this first incident occurred that day.
 we returned from the vacation after 2 weeks we had drunk again at her friend's birthday party, then she came to my house and we had started making love afterwards, badly a similar scenario had happened. Since I could not ejaculate, I had taken off the condom without asking her. I had tried to come but I could not. I barely remember the time period again. While I was expecting her to break up with me, she had told me that if it was someone else, she would end the relationship but because it was me, she wanted to continue and try, and she said I would try. After these things, I started to drink less alcohol. buy her gifts such as necklaces includes Pisces symbol and our born dates behind it etc she got sick and I took really good care of her etc 
  I felt like It was like a train coming in a tunnel despite her efforts, she could never be the same and one day she said she was and felt really bad recently. I went to her the same day immediately but she said she couldn't do it and tried very hard. She said you tried so hard too. After talking and reminiscing past We cried mutually. I told her that no one could love her as much as I did and she said you feel the same way and now you know this feeling. Then I told her that I loved her very much and kissed her. I left her house and came to my own house completely destroyed. 
A week later or so I texted her and said to her that I will change myself if I can change myself I can change the relation and got her back even more loved then before but she said it‚Äôs not up to me she said it‚Äôs completely about her. A couple days later my father got really bad and I had to see him while he was living all by himself and helpless. I called her and said to her it‚Äôs not about up to her it was all that is. I was stressing out and I had to see my father because he was helpless. And went to the father‚Äôs city. When I got there and after realizing the truth of the father. I couldn‚Äôt know what to do and called her again about the situation about what can I do and I said I need her voice to be strong etc. she was a little bit frozen not emotional and emphatic this time. After talking her which i see it‚Äôs like every broken man‚Äôs end we end the conversation. 
3-4 laters i‚Äôve got a message from her please stop looking my friend‚Äôs instagram story ( which her best male friend and the account is not private ) after that i said sorry i wasnt thinking straight and i was looking for you not your friend bla bla and i said let‚Äôs don‚Äôt screw out good old days  i don‚Äôt want that and i know you left my life i don‚Äôt do anything to upset you or effect you etc and i added this is all i asked and understand me for last time.

Context: Nakilala ko si girl sa ome tv and I didn't expect our vibe would match. We exchanged facebook deets and started talking with each other every night. I don't know but ang gaan na agad ng feeling ko sa kanya. It's like we've known each other for a long time.

Sa sobrang gusto namin kausap ang isa't-isa, we even do sleep call. Actually, nauuna siya lagi matulog dahil may work ako, so I enjoyed being in a call with her kahit tulog siya kasi bigla bigla siyang magsasalita na akala ko tulog na siya. That motivates me sa work and nakakawala ng antok.

Until one day, I asked her out, kahit coffee or kain lang sa labas kase I told her na gusto ko siya makita kahit malayo pa siya. Anyways, I'm from Marikina and she's from Bicutan. May motor naman so no problem sa byahe, as long as mapuntahan ko lang siya.

Pumayag naman siya and we had a coffee date. Ang highlight pa nung day na yun is she kissed me sa cheeks and para kong naka drugs sa sobrang gaan ng katawan ko haha. To make the story short, hinatid ko na siya pauwi.

Days have passed, sweet pa rin namin sa isa't-isa. Update dito, update doon. Until one night, nag-crave ako sa Jollibee. Inupdate ko siya na pupunta lang ako ng Jollibee and umokay naman siya. Pag-uwi ko sa bahay from Jollibee, naka block na ko.

I have no other ways to contact her since we didn't exchange numbers. Ayoko naman puntahan sa kanila and baka sabihin ang creepy ko. It's just that, why would she block me all of a sudden? Ang saya saya pa namin that night, pinanood niya pa laro ko sa Valorant.

It looks like **4 of the 8 largest swap dealers** have piled onto their silver shorts **like gamblers doubling down at a blackjack table with borrowed money**‚Äîas if they just discovered a **Spanish treasure galleon off the coast of India** filled with **billions of ounces of silver labeled ""Property of JPM, HSBC & Friends""** and figured, ‚ÄúEh, we got this.‚Äù

Meanwhile, **Ed Steer (SilverSeek)** has thrown up the caution flag, calling this one of the most extreme bearish setups ever‚Äîmeaning bullion banks are now **waist-deep in paper short positions, hoping no one notices the quicksand.**

But here‚Äôs the thing: **I think this is actually ultra-super bullish.**

# The Trap They‚Äôve Set‚Ä¶ for Themselves

At some point, those short positions **must be bought back.** And if the bullion banks can‚Äôt manage to tiptoe out of their own mess, they have two choices:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep shoveling more margin into the fire**, like a guy trying to put out a grease fire with a bucket of gasoline.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Let the trade go nuclear** and watch silver **rip their faces off** in a short squeeze that makes past price spikes look like warm-ups.

And here‚Äôs the real problem‚Äî**the longs on the other side aren‚Äôt interested in playing nice.**

They **want actual metal**, not some politely worded IOU. If they refuse to take a cash bribe to walk away, the squeeze on an already strained physical market **intensifies like a traffic jam before a hurricane evacuation and with Refineries backed up with Gold for 8 weeks, good luck getting those silver mercury's smelted into 75 lb silver bars.**

# Does the Market Take a Breather, or Are We Past That Point?

This isn‚Äôt just about a **silver deficit** anymore‚Äîthis is about **a market under stress, showing all the signs of an impending rupture.**

üîπ **Lease rates have exploded past 10%**‚Äîa clear sign that silver is getting harder to borrow than a good pen at the office.  
üîπ **LBMA and SLV are being drained at an alarming pace**, like a Vegas buffet after a weightlifting convention.  
üîπ **Refineries are backed up for months**, melting down **small bars and coins like they're turning scrap metal into swords for an army**.  
üîπ **Massive delivery requests are stacking up**, signaling that **big money wants metal, not Monopoly money.**

And here‚Äôs the part that should raise eyebrows‚Äî**this all happened nearly overnight.** Almost like someone, somewhere, got a memo that hasn‚Äôt hit the front page yet.

So, will silver take a moment to catch its breath, or is this stampede about to **turn into a full-blown rodeo?** Either way, the fuse has been lit, the popcorn is hot, and this show is about to get very, very interesting. üçøüî•

But here's the thing...

Nottingham has pretty high trans visibility. I saw maybe five other trans girls (non passing) while out today. I didn't *notice* any trans men, but I'm sure I *saw* some - just my radar isn't as attuned.

So how was the experience including shops, lunch, coffee shop, bathroom breaks etc?

I would say 0% negative, 50% neutral and 50% positive... at least two people were *super* positive and really engaged with me on my clothes choices etc.

VISIBILITY WORKS.

When the public realises we're not a threat, and we're normal, decent, kind, likeable human beings, they interact with us in a way that reflects that.

When we go about our day as if being trans is perfectly normal, others start to believe it's normal too.

Let's get more visibility in more cities worldwide. I know some will take longer to crack than others, but let's at least get the reachable ones NOW.

We can do this!

I have quite a bit of time in BF5 but figured BF1 was dead. I was wrong. It really is the more cinematic of the three but I'm not a huge fan of WW1 weapons and aesthetic. 5 is fun, but I really do prefer modern weapons and settings. Bought 4 on a whim since it's less than a cup of coffee. 

I'm having a blast. I was surprised by how many servers were out there and well populated. It's not as pretty as the other two, but it's not bad. Plus, I purchased the full DLC so no issues with having a non-premium game, which is an issue with BF1. 

Bottom line, if you are considering 4, 1 or 5, they're all great and still active. If you like modern warfare, go for 4.  Well worth the $3.",2,1739135257.0,Battlefield,0,0.75,False

>There is really no reason‚Äînot personally, not professionally, and certainly not purposefully for Hermione to keep running into Draco Malfoy. And yet, his sporadic appearances in her life have become almost predictable, however annoying.

>But when Draco finds himself in trouble and Auror Granger must intentionally seek him out‚Äî*does she truly have to?*‚Äîthere might be more than just one mystery afoot.

>AKA, an unserious Dramione coffee shop interview, that does not go at all as planned... For either party, really.

I was part of a big and influential family. 
Marami kaming conflict at disagreement sa family namin,
Isa dun sa hindi ko gusto yung pag aarange nila ng magiging partner mo, especially pag yung isa link rin sa business ng family, yes nag eexist pa din po yung ganito.

Last year may nakavibe akong babae na nakilala ko lng din sa socmed. We started as friends, then meetup sa coffee shops, nakavibe ko nadin sya sa mga food hunt every weekends at travel ko at unti unti po ako nahulog sa babaeng to. And now i see her as my future.

She found out po yung ganitong setup sa family namin, dahil na din hindi ko sya magawang mapakilala üòì.  Now ako naman before going to japan last month. Kinausap ko na din yung father ko at pamilya nung babae na tigil na yung setup at ayoko na din kasi iba na yung gusto ko. But for the second time nagkalamat naman kami ng father ko, hindi lang basta lamat kundi away. 
Tinanggalan nya ako ng role sa isang business namin, Ok lang din nman kasi may trabaho ako online as VA at  partnership. pero as of now ayaw nya akong makausap o makita if nasa bahay sya. So ako naman palipat lipat, may sa bahay, bahay ng pinsan ko at Manila. Ok lg naman sa ibang member ng family pero yung sa side lg talaga ng father ko.

Big deal po to sa babaeng gusto ko. Kasi as of now galit father ko sakin for sure pati sa taong gusto ko at She's emotionally, ,physically and mentally abused sa family ng first partner niya.

She quoted "" if ever I get to be with someone on this lifetime. I would want his family to love me and care for me. To accept the way I am. ""  Yes, single mom po sya. 

Add ko na din po to.   I lied to her about my  so called Step sister and complicated identity.  Sinabi kong lagi kami magkasama sa manila and even sa japan kahit na tita ko yung kasama ko at 1st of january pa cla nandun. Yung step sister ko kasi produkto ng father ko at asawa ng cousin nya, tinago po to ng aunty namin at magkabilang pamilya pero wala nman nangyaring DNA testings  noon to prove na mag kadugo tlaga. napagdesisyunan lg na isupport sya at ako naman may part na nagsusupport din especially sa Education nya. 
Besides that Marami pa pong questionable sa family namin. Meron pa akong another step sister. And namention din nla na halos hindi kami magkakapareho ng mukha lahat. Kaya kahit pic namin magkakapatid wala kami.

Nakakastress ang pamilya na meron ako, All i want for now is a peace of mind. Pero yung peace of mind na nasa babaeng gusto ko,  ko lang nakita. Mukhang mawawala pa.

I've been sidelined pretty much by health issues and being a caregiver. I went for the first time since the renovations and I don't hate them..but I don't love it. I don't really buy much in the actually aisles but now those have been shoved from the center to the right of the store. A new popcorn area is to the right when you walk in. It's cute. The chocolate/candy is now in an area behind the aisles not visible when you first walk in. Now there is an actual shop for the gift shop. I didn't notice where the bathrooms were that used to be there. The frozen area is also over there. I don't know if it's the coloring or the lighting but it's kind of glum over there. 

I always get a coffee when I go into Adam's. Now the coffee and cheese is in where some of the aisles were. It's a little weird and chaotic to me. Plus, it's right near the cash registers. The coffee area is bigger which I guess can be a plus. I love the smell of popcorn but it like permeates this whole area..across the whole produce department. 

I was thankful that the meat, seafood, bakery, deli, etc is the same. It doesn't feel like a homey store right now. Anyone else feel this way?

It  just looks like construction where the aisles near the seafood/butcher were. I read that they are getting pasta/donuts. I don't go to Adam's to get fresh made pasta. I asked if they would be getting pizza and one of the workers told me yes.

1ilp08c,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1ilp08c/i_am_going_to_print_newspapers_and_heres_why_you/,"I am going to print newspapers, and here‚Äôs why you should too‚Ä¶","Like a lot of you, I get my news from social media, news apps, and websites. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs free (mostly), and it‚Äôs always updating. But lately, I‚Äôve started to feel like that‚Äôs exactly the problem.

The constant flood of information is overwhelming. Clickbait headlines, algorithms pushing rage-bait, and news that feels less about informing and more about getting engagement. I‚Äôve caught myself doomscrolling for hours, consuming news that leaves me feeling anxious, drained, and somehow less informed.

Then, I picked up an actual newspaper. You know, those things made of paper that our parents used to read at the breakfast table? And something clicked.

When you read a newspaper, you get a curated selection of news‚Äîwithout pop-ups, autoplay videos, or a comments section full of people yelling at each other. There‚Äôs something about reading an article in print that feels different. More thoughtful. More deliberate. You‚Äôre not just scanning headlines; you‚Äôre absorbing information.

And honestly, I should be happy to expose that time alone to the greater world, to let myself sit with a newspaper and a coffee instead of endlessly refreshing my feed. Maybe it‚Äôs time to start withdrawing from this feeling of missing out and appreciate the quiet moments instead.

Because let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthe news industry isn‚Äôt just informing us; it‚Äôs fighting for our attention. Entire teams are hired just to keep us engaged, to keep us scrolling, clicking, and coming back. But what if this is an unhealthy amount of news? What if, instead of being more informed, we‚Äôre just more distracted? I think we have to start by reducing the amount of information we consume to improve the quality of the information we actually take in. We should fight back against ad agencies and reclaim our attention and peace of mind.

So, I‚Äôm going to try something different. I want to take in all my information‚Äînews, entertainment, everything‚Äîthrough print. A world where stories are crafted with real thought, focused on local, immediate, and affectable issues. A world where the only ads I see are from businesses in my own community, not some algorithm trying to keep me hooked.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt actually done it yet. Right now, I‚Äôm still stuck in my usual routine, checking news apps the moment I wake up, scrolling through headlines that make me feel like I‚Äôm always behind on something. The idea of switching to print makes sense, but will I actually do it? I guess I‚Äôll find out soon enough.

And then it hit me‚Äîif you‚Äôre reading this on Reddit, you probably don‚Äôt have a newspaper reading habit either. What has society done to our attention? It has failed to protect us from this constant need to fill the void. Instead of real, meaningful engagement, we get spoon-fed slop‚Äîendless, low-effort YouTube videos, clickbait articles, and mindless scrolling. We just replace one stream of noise with another, thinking it's different, thinking it's better.

What have we become?

[EDIT1]
First off, I just want to thank everyone who took the time to read through this. I‚Äôm grateful for your time. I‚Äôm not demanding it in any sense, but if you‚Äôve made it this far, it means something in what I‚Äôve said caught your attention. You‚Äôve taken the time to go through this, and I‚Äôm happy that you found something intriguing enough to keep reading. I provided you with a story that you chose to engage with, and in turn, you‚Äôve given me your time. That‚Äôs quality for you. Not short, shallow, dumb statements. I need long, engaging conversations that leave me satisfied at the end of it. That‚Äôs where the real value lies.

Also, just a heads up: I‚Äôm going to continue the thoughts in this post as an essay. It‚Äôs a realization I just had, and I want to share my opinions and reflections. This is just me, putting my thoughts out there for online perusers who may or may not agree.

The more I think about this, the angrier I get. Every single thing‚Äîpolitics, entertainment, even education‚Äîhas slowly adapted to us, to what we mindlessly consume. We created this industry. We shaped this system with our engagement, and now it shapes us in return. But if we built it, we can take control back. I truly believe that.

I just want to know whether I‚Äôll be alive tomorrow. That‚Äôs it. A 24-hour news summary should be more than enough for that. If something truly important happens, I want my government to show me by actually making changes, helping my community, improving things locally‚Äînot by filling my feed with staged outrage and pointless lobbying over nonsense.

Entertainment? Let them fight to earn our attention instead of having it handed to them by an algorithm. Make them raise the bar instead of feeding us low-effort content just because the system rewards quantity over quality.

And advertisers? Ideally, they shouldn‚Äôt even exist. They are a rot in society, manipulating us into dependency, making us rely on an algorithm to tell us what we want instead of us deciding for ourselves. They built this internet to be a FOMO machine, an endless cycle of artificial urgency and instant gratification.

We should have put a stop to the internet the moment advertisers kicked in‚Äîwhen they started making us believe this was a place of importance, a place we needed to be. In reality, the internet was never meant for us. It was a tool for information, for sharing knowledge, for improving life in practical ways. But we caved. And they hijacked it, rewiring our monkey brains with weird dopamine signals, training us to see engagement as value, to see scrolling as progress, to see online presence as existence.

The way I see it, the internet should be a repository of history‚Äîa place where you go if you want to learn from the past, not a place that‚Äôs constantly trying to shape the present. I don‚Äôt want the internet dictating what history should be; I want change to happen slowly, at a human pace, not dictated by viral trends and reactionary headlines.

Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîif we all start looking inward instead of outward, things will change. As a country, as a society, even as individuals. Maybe it starts by shifting focus to what‚Äôs actually around us instead of drowning in a constant flood of global noise.",4,1739134697.0,GenZ,4,0.83,False
1ilp000,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilp000,Review of Chen Sheng Hao (ÈôàÂçáÂè∑),"Raw Puerh from CSH North America (Canada), focusing on 4 out of 7 samples from their 2022 collection:

General Observations:
- Distinctive characteristic: ""Bitter charm"" (not pure bitterness) with varying sweet aftertaste
- Recommendation for beginners: Start with milder varieties like Naka
- Brewing tips: Use less tea (5g), lower temperature (85-90¬∞C), gaiwan recommended, quick steeps

Individual Tea Reviews:

1.  EmperorÔºàÈú∏ÁéãÈùíÈ•º):
- Tight leaf structure
- Bright golden liquor
- Aggressive bitter notes with sweetness appearing in 3rd steep
- Subtle orchid notes in later steeps

2. Naka (ÈÇ£Âç°):
- Subtle aroma, clear bright liquor
- Highest sweetness among the four
- Quick and lasting sweet aftertaste
- Smooth mouthfeel, good endurance

3. Ban Po Zhai (ÂçäÂù°ÂØ®):
- Notable woody aroma
- Clear progression from astringency to sweetness
- Complex steep-by-steep evolution
- Rich orange-yellow liquor in middle steeps

4. Chen Sheng No.1 (ÈôàÂçá‰∏ÄÂè∑):

- Gentle bitter notes with subtle sweet aftertaste
- Good aging potential

Conclusion:
These teas are recommended for experienced tea drinkers and collectors in North America. Their characteristic bitter notes indicate high polyphenol content, suggesting good aging potential. Ideal for those who appreciate subtle complexities and aren't afraid of some bitterness, similar to dark chocolate or black coffee enthusiasts.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

As someone who enjoys experimenting with different coffee brewing methods, I was intrigued by the promises of this blade grinder. From the start, its compact and sleek Onyx Black design caught my eye. It doesn‚Äôt take up much counter space, which is a blessing in my smaller kitchen. The grinder feels sturdy, weighing just 2.6 pounds, and it gives off an impression of durability that‚Äôs backed by KitchenAid‚Äôs reputation.

The grinding mechanism is straightforward. This model comes with a stainless steel blade rather than a burr mechanism, which is expected at this price point. While burr grinders are known for their precision and consistency, I found the KitchenAid blade grinder to be surprisingly capable for my needs. It grinds beans evenly enough for drip coffee and French press, though achieving a true espresso grind can be a challenge. The one-touch control is simple: press down on the clear top cover to grind and release to stop. This minimalist design makes it very intuitive to use, even for someone who isn‚Äôt tech-savvy.

[Find the best price for KitchenAid BCG111OB on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/kitchenaid-bcg111ob-coffee-grinder-review-b003wiz5pc/)

The grinding bowl, which has a 4-ounce capacity, is removable and marked with measurements for 4, 8, 10, and 12 cups. I found this feature helpful when preparing coffee for guests. Cleaning the bowl is simple since it‚Äôs detachable and dishwasher-friendly. However, I did notice that ground coffee tends to cling to the stainless steel surface, which requires a bit of extra effort to clean thoroughly. On the noise front, this grinder is quieter than expected for a blade model, which is a relief for early-morning use.

**Pros**

1. **Compact and stylish design**: Fits easily on countertops and looks great in Onyx Black.
2. **Ease of use**: One-touch control and visible grind consistency through the clear lid.
3. **Detachable grinding bowl**: Makes transferring coffee grounds to the coffee maker and cleaning a breeze.
4. **Durable build**: Feels robust and reliable for regular use.
5. **Affordable**: Offers excellent value for a blade grinder.

**Cons**

1. **Limited grind precision**: Struggles with consistent fine grinds for espresso.
2. **Static issues**: Grounds sometimes stick to the bowl, making cleanup less straightforward.
3. **No multiple grind settings**: Lacks the adjustability of burr grinders.
4. **Plastic lid pins**: Could be prone to wear and tear over time.
5. **Short power cord**: At 2.5 inches, it limits placement flexibility.

When compared to competitors, the KitchenAid BCG111OB holds its own in the blade grinder category. Competing models like the Cuisinart DCG-20N and Krups F203 are similarly priced but lack the removable bowl feature, which is a standout for the KitchenAid grinder. On the other hand, burr grinders like the Baratza Encore offer superior grind consistency but come at a much higher price point. If you‚Äôre primarily a drip coffee or French press drinker, the KitchenAid is perfectly sufficient and easier to maintain.

Analyzing its cost and value, this coffee grinder delivers more than what you‚Äôd expect for its price range. The stainless steel blade, durable motor, and user-friendly design make it a reliable choice for everyday coffee needs. However, if you‚Äôre someone who demands precise, uniform grinds for espresso, investing in a burr grinder might be worth considering.

Features like the safety mechanism, which prevents the grinder from starting without the bowl securely in place, add a layer of reassurance. The 160-watt motor is powerful enough to handle small batches of spices as well, though I primarily used it for coffee. The included one-year hassle-free replacement warranty is a nice touch, although some international buyers might face challenges accessing it, as noted in certain reviews.

In 2020 lockdowns i swapped over to a keto diet and i  went from about 210lbs to 171, i had gained weight for some of the lockdown at first as i usually hover around the 190-200 (I have a highly physical job as a carpet fitter so lots of lifting,hunched over and core movements that dont help with digestion or keeping acid down, so im quite muscular, not just 200lbs of office worker). During the keto diet i had lost all gerd symptoms,my back stopped hurting and aching, i had  tonnes of energy!

 Sadly going back to work meant 4.30am starts in freezing cold mornings, its so hard to not make that coffee, i have no access to any form of cooking or heating food while at work nor the time for it so my diet lapsed back slowly into eating crap.

Ive had many years of working out what causes my heartburn, some things are actually stuff thats meant to help with it. 

Warm/hot drinks
Weetabix
Anything spicy of strong flavoured
Sausage repeats on me.
All chocolates
All sodas 
Oranges
Alcohol.
Onion
Garlic,potatoes,seasoned foods and processed meats make me fart alot. 
Porridge
Soups
Any form of tomato(liquid or solid)


On keto My diet consisted of a lot of chicken and pork belly with steamed vegetables, eggs or omelettes for breakfast. Lunches i was taking more eggs in a thermoflask with cheese and mushrooms. 

The diet is hard to stick to because of so many ingredients being gerd causing  sometimes it feels like i cant eat anything and enjoy it, i dont want to be on omeprazole all my life and quite frankly it makes me depressed thinking about all of it, which is often why i end up trying to forget about it. I had an endoscopy feb 2024 ( with 0 medicine as nobody can ever find my veins so that was fun) i had light scarring and a 1cm hernia but nothing super serious yet. 

Is it just bland food for me the rest of my life?

I‚Äôm not an electrician and am honestly not sure if I‚Äôm posting this in the right subreddit but I have a few questions and concerns. 
So in the summer my heat got stock on with the ac so both blew at the same time raising my bill to almost $400 a month up from $80-$90 on average. My god awful landlord finally sent HVAC over and they saw the unit had caught fire and that‚Äôs what caused the heat to be stuck on. 

Fast forward to a few days ago I was smelling fish. Smelling straight salmon and it actually smelled pretty good. I‚Äôm third floor in an apartment so smelling peoples food is common. The next morning I went to make coffee and caught and even stronger smell of fish and at first I‚Äôm like it‚Äôs a lil early to be cookin fish but you do you 

The fish smell was stronger and in a different location. Did some research found out electrical fires smell fishy so with my HVAC unit already having caught I‚Äôm looking g all over the place and I found the culprit. A power strip was charring inside on of the outlets as you can see in the picture. I took a whiff and yep it smelled like fish. It‚Äôs been unplugged since and no fish smells anymore. 

All this to ask the question should I be worried about this? Is this a fault of the power outlet or the power strip? My landlord company isn‚Äôt the best with not cutting corners and just being absolute garbage so I would not be surprised if we haven‚Äôt been inspected in years over the deadline.

- For utensils I like folding titanium, stainless or hard anodized aluminum spoons or sporks. Spoons seem to be the safest bet with security. Anyone have TSA stories on utensils? I have folding plastic versions from MSRbur they feel so weak.

I'm a 24 y/o female heading to PR in Late April. I solo travel frequently and have been hoping to cross PR off my list. I'll be flying from Chicago to SJU. Hoping to solicit some opinions of itinerary. Is it too much? What should I leave off and return to do? What should I absolutely do?

Below is my itinerary and I just wanted to see/know how feasible it is. I'll be on the island for about 9 days and 8 nights. I plan on doing multiple cities (2 days per city). I won't be providing exact dates for my safety but here's a general idea:

Day 1: Land in SJU mid-afternoon --> Rum Tasting (meh) --> Nightlife  
Day 2: El Yunque tour from San Juan then Luqillo Beach then sightseeing if I have the time  
Day 3: Travel to Ponce bright and early --> Coffee Hacienda / Coffee Farm Tour --> Museums  
Day 4: Still in Ponce --> Toro Verde and La Guancha  
Day 5: Ponce to Rincon.... honestly was thinking of doing Rincon for 1 day as there didn't seem to be much to do  
Day 6 or 7 (maybe 7): head to Vieques --> explore, relax, etc... --> Bio Bay tour  
Day 8: another day/night in Vieques  
Day 9: Last day in San Juan. Some more sightseeing before my mid afternoon flight home. I plan on being at the airport at least 2 hrs early so I most likely have until 12 noon or 1 pm to explore

My concerns mostly have to do with beach towns like Vieques and Rincon. I'm not a surfer so Rincon doesn't appeal much to me. I was thinking of swapping out Rincon for Aguadilla or doing 1 night on each or just ditching the West overall.

Let me know if I'm too ambitious. I tend to overextend myself when I travel.

Edit: I did some rearranging and logistically, it makes more sense to do San Juan -->Rincon --> Ponce --> Vieques --> San Juan  so just switch Ponce and Rincon in terms of order",1,1739134000.0,PuertoRicoTravel,2,1.0,False

I've had a 3 cup for about a month now, and I'm loving it so far. Just have two questions: 

First, any tips for cleaning? I have these sort of small black stains in the top chamber that won't scrub out with soap. Its completely flush, I don't even know if it's ""dirty"" or just sort of oxidized. Is this typical, and is there anyway to clean it? Similarly, the bottom chamber seems to get some slight grounds that fall through and burn on to the bottom. Anyway to prevent this? Those burned on bits are very difficult to get off. 

Second question, the pot works fine and produces good coffee, but while it's heating theres always small leakage that drips down the sides and onto the stove before it heats enough to start brewing. I know it's not supposed to do that, anyone know why it would be and how to stop it?

I'm just getting started on my espresso journey and my ONLY priority is to make lattes. I'll never be drinking straight shots, so:
A. Is supermarket coffee good enough?
B. Is there anything wrong with a ratio of 16gm in/50gm out over 35 sec? I know it's too fast for a shot, but I didn't want to waste it whilst dialing in and after adding the steamed milk it was quite delicious.

1iloccx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1iloccx/annoyed_with_my_friend/,Annoyed with my friend,"

So I have a friend. Let's call her Nicole. Nicole is such a good person but there are things that REALLY get under my skin about her. For one she doesn't EVER wash her hands when she goes to the bathroom but somehow ALWAYS wants to touch things I have. It irritates me so much. I had a bottle of juice last week and she was sitting next to me.. We were at an event and I purposely MOVED it away from her so she wouldn't touch it. What did she do? She just HAD to move it so someone wouldn't step on it BUT no one could step on it where I put it. When I bought coffee on a few occasions and I'm in line paying SHE always wants to put her hands on it. I'm thinking WTF... you don't wash your hands and you want to out your hands where my MOUTH goes on the coffee? It's to the point where everything I have she just HAS to touch it. 

I invited her to an event that my friend does. We will call her Kimmy. Kimmy always has celebrity guests and some of them are my friends. Nicole does not KNOW any of these people personally nor has she listened to ANY of their music before. I was so excited to write an article for the newspaper my friend (let's call him George) owns. However, Nicole did not stay the entire event. I did! So I KNOW who performed and all the important people who spoke on stage that day. Nicole leaves and writes the article but only talks about very little in the event because she only stayed briefly. It really annoyed me that she did this. I have to be fair though. She didn't know I wanted to write it but I'm the one who invited her and I feel like she took the opportunity away to make my friends shine (being as though Nicole doesn't even know them to even write about them). To explain this better let's say your friend comes to an event about art but knows nothing about art but YOU do. Your friend comes but only stays a short time. Then writes an article about the event and can't even write about the famous artists when she knows nothing about art! 

Another thing is, anytime we travel, when my husband speaks to me Nicole HAS to know what he said to me and invites herself in the conversation. He'll say something to me for example, like ""You know what I meant to tell you when I was at the store yesterday. You know the lady that was in the blue dress..."" She will interrupt and say, ""What is it... what happened?"" She has conversations with her husband the ENTIRE ride so I don't understand why she needs to be in every single one of our chats we have. On top of this they travel with their dog which isn't an issue but my husband is tall and we both need room. The dog is tiny but has the most room in the backseat. I'm a dog lover... but she says the dog likes the backseat not the front. The entire 4 hour drive she's turning around (if not in out conversation) and says, ""Is he sleeping? Is he okay?"" It just got to be really annoying. We had to be in the backseat like sardines when they could have moved the dog over just a little bit... or even had it in the front seat with them. She WANTS us to go to this event with her. So it's not like we are intruding. The event (different from Kimmy's event is a mutual friends event). So we all go together.

For context, our fights are so emotionally taxing for me to the point now that I am nervous about marriage which makes me really sad. Both of us struggle with mental health issues and my partner is autistic so we are no stranger to complex issues and tough obstacles. Yes‚Äîwe are both in therapy, both together and separately. 

Arguing with my fianc√© is like arguing with an emotional wall. He gets in these loops, that are common for people with autism, but the problem is that he often throws up his defenses so fast and turns a fight completely around on me, even bringing up past mistakes and avoiding responsibility for his actions and honestly just exhibiting emotional immaturity altogether. It can take a day or more for us to get through one fight because I am so overwhelmed with how he spirals and treats me that my freeze response is activated and I feel hopeless. It can be very emotionally draining. I have a chronic illness, a history of trauma and abuse, and abandonment issues. Fighting is so scary to my brain so I try to do so calmly but he is a heated and angry person when arguing. 

I struggle to post this bc relationships and people are so complex that it‚Äôs hard to really understand the dynamic and bigger picture. But lately i have been worried about our relationship in a way that‚Äôs scaring me, and don‚Äôt want to rush to get married. I said yes to the engagement because i meant it‚Äîi really did know what it meant to accept his engagement and I really did want to commit to forever. I know relationships are hard and difficult and you can‚Äôt just slip out of them when it‚Äôs hard and I don‚Äôt want to just give up. 

But this feels like it‚Äôs getting to a point where I might not have a choice‚Ä¶ for me. We have worked and worked at our relationship and I am not someone who screams and shouts and it destroys my insides. (Now it has even taken a toll on our intimacy and desire for another). 

This last fight was something different‚ÄîI feel completely drained. I asked a question and caught him in a white lie. When I said ‚Äúwait‚Äîwhy are you lying?‚Äù With what I intended to have a bit of humor behind it, a switch flipped in him, and ‚Äúi derailed our entire night‚Äù by catching him lying. I wasn‚Äôt even concerned about what he was lying about, just that he did it directly to my face and that‚Äôs not cool. I wanted to state that he didn‚Äôt need to lie about anything and especially what he was lying about. But it clearly triggered him in a way I was not prepared for, meaning we were having such a great evening, and I just asked a question that was valid, that really triggered him in a way he couldn‚Äôt communicate healthily. Once that happens, there‚Äôs no going back. Maybe some shame began to overcome him‚Äîthen he can get into an angry loop, acts like a defensive animal in a cage, even when I am not at all angry.

These types of arguments are consistent and I feel like parts of me are dying after each one. They make no sense and I know it‚Äôs hard for him too. But I barely see any progress from his end, even when I know he is trying. Because regardless of how many times we make up and I‚Äôm genuinely like ‚Äúthese blowouts really need to stop we have to communicate calmly‚Äù ‚Äî I can tell it‚Äôs so hard for him. i feel like I am on ice most of the time. It breaks my heart because I know he struggles, but the emotional instability scares me and I really need stability in a partner.

So we went to sleep angry, aka i didn‚Äôt sleep. This morning, he begrudgingly apologized to me with anger and resentment in his tone while passing me making coffee to head out the door to the back porch. It wasn‚Äôt an apology at all‚Ä¶ so about 30mins later, he‚Äôs now back in the kitchen where I am enjoying my
coffee and just thinking‚Äîhe seems calm, so I say, ‚Äúhey‚Äîthat didn‚Äôt really feel like an apology. should we talk?‚Äù I decided I was not going to engage, that I would just listen to him and see if he‚Äôd actually just‚Ä¶.apologize. he then proceeded to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù to me for 20 minutes (yes I kept an eye on the clock) ‚Äî he was in a loop, angry, barely making eye contact, sometimes saying the classic ‚Äúsorry, but you‚Ä¶‚Äù and blaming me most of the time, even bringing up the last time I told a white lie in the first year we were dating. I was definitely in a freeze state at this point and it really hurt me. He finally said ‚Äúok I am done‚Äù and I calmly asked‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthat was an apology?‚Äù and then he told me to stop speaking to him. I just had no words and waited for him to leave the kitchen aggressively like he usually does. 

So I was very defeated, and I wanted to ride my peloton and shower. I took my ring off and left it on the kitchen table. A few hours later, I came back and it‚Äôs gone. I didn‚Äôt necessarily mean to leave it there as a suggestion of a breakup, but honestly‚Ä¶ maybe I did subconsciously. Seems like he took it that way because it‚Äôs gone. Anyway. I am not planning to ask him for it. I know he has it and that‚Äôs probably what he wants. Feels manipulative. I just really don‚Äôt have the energy to fight anymore.

I am not sure if I want advice or just to rant, but I am open to conversation if anyone read all this and relates at all.",9,1739132952.0,relationship_advice,31,0.8,False

My Impressions So Far:

Aven: Loved the views, and it seemed to have better amenities and common spaces. I also thought the immediate area had more coffee shops, bars, and general activity‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just based on one visit.

What I‚Äôd Love to Know:

	‚Ä¢	Location & Safety: Which one is in a better area in terms of walkability, nightlife, and general safety?

	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: How easy is it to get around from each place (groceries, public transport, freeway access, etc.)?

	‚Ä¢	Building Management: How is the maintenance, security, and responsiveness of management in each building?

	‚Ä¢	Anything Else I Should Consider? If there are dealbreakers or things I might not have thought about, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

I generally believe most if not all of the reflections songs probably were first conceptualized in the S+M era and maybe they were reworked/recorded later on for other albums, but ultimately weren‚Äôt included. I will be using the list of the eras of each song by u/gabriel12355f

Woke (Mercury Act 1) - This is a pretty nice song, but I feel it might‚Äôve been cut as it‚Äôs kinda unique

The Ghost Intervention (S+M) - This song basically repeats itself which is most likely why it was cut as they didn‚Äôt know how to expand on the song

Monica (Mercury) - This song has grown on me, but it‚Äôs a pretty experimental song so that‚Äôs probably why it was cut

Black (S+M) - There are some awkwardly delivered lines and it kinda fits with S+M, but also has a different vibe than all the other songs

Strange Ways (Mercury) - Similar lyrics thematically to Follow You and feels empty at points, but that could just be because it‚Äôs a demo

I Get Carried Away (S+M) - Doesn‚Äôt really fit instrumentally with Smoke + Mirrors as it has a very electronic sound similar to Uptight or Curse

A-OK (Mercury Act 1) - Personally I don‚Äôt really vibe with this song, but it does feel like something they would release in this era, other than that idk why it was cut other than maybe they didn‚Äôt like it

Playin‚Äô Me (Mercury?) - I feel like this could‚Äôve been made in any era, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like Imagine Dragons and the lyrics imo aren‚Äôt that interesting either

My Car (Evolve or Mercury) - I think it‚Äôs probably more likely Evolve or maybe S+M era and not Mercury. I guess the only reason I can hear on why it would be cut is the Chorus is kinda meh. 

Cowboy (Mercury Act 1) - My best guess is that the lyrics don‚Äôt fit in with Mercury Act 1

Mayday (2009) - It fits in somewhat with that era and also not, but feels a bit awkward

The Journey (Mercury Act 1) - Very similar to Beautiful Day imo (though I like it more)

Bad Boys (Mercury Act 1) - I don‚Äôt think it really fits in lyrically with other Mercury Act 1 songs

Blablabla (Evolve) - Self explanatory why it never got out of the demo stage

Cest La Vie (Evolve) - I have no idea why this was cut. It‚Äôs pretty catchy and fits in with Evolve. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in a different language? But idk why that would cut it

Coffee (Mercury Act 1) - Maybe the lyrics are a bit dark? (hearing it for the first time i was very shocked by ‚ÄúI killed myself again last night‚Äù lmao)

I‚Äôm Over It (Evolve) - I like it, but it doesn‚Äôt fit in with the songs in this era

I‚Äôve Just Begun (S+M) - I really like this song, but it has a similar problem in repetition to The Ghost Intervention, though not as bad as that song has it as the 2nd verse is different. 

Primadonna (Evolve) - Again another song I don‚Äôt really know any obvious reason why it was cut. I think it fits in with Evolve, but maybe they didn‚Äôt

Star (Mercury) - I like this song and it does fit in with Ma2 for me, but maybe they didn‚Äôt really want to add it because the verses are a little dark

Stars (2010) - The song everyone‚Äôs been looking for. It‚Äôs a nice song, but it‚Äôs a little rough imo. I don‚Äôt really have anything else to say about it though I want to. 

Work For It (Mercury Act 1) - I think someone said this before, but it feels kinda generic (even for imagine dragons)

I was traveling to Jordan for a job mission and took a bus. My ticket had an assigned seat, and next to me was a guy, around 28 years old, with a fit, gym-built body. At some point, he opened the window, but the weather was freezing, and the wind hit my face directly. I asked him to close it, which he did, but two minutes later, he opened it again.

He spoke in a harsh tone and said he had nausea, asking if I could switch seats. I refused because I thought he was just trying to assert dominance since I‚Äôm a woman. Every time he opened the window, I closed it again. Meanwhile, when I spoke to him, he kept smelling his black coffee, which made me think he was avoiding engaging with me. Eventually, he left the window shut.

A while later, he became so pale and started vomiting through the window. I felt guilty and apologized, which he accepted, but I still feel bad.

Another tourist seeking Instagram-worthy shots of beach clubs and sunrise yoga sessions? Not quite. A visit to a friend in Singapore had given me the perfect excuse to explore this phenomenon that had everyone so captivated, though I approached it with more than a hint of skepticism.

My first glimpse of Bali came through Hollywood‚Äôs superficial lens ‚Äî ‚ÄúEat, Pray, Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúTicket to Paradise‚Äù hardly offered nuanced cultural introductions. My Instagram feed wasn‚Äôt much help either, serving up an endless stream of lush landscapes and beautiful beaches, all seemingly tarnished by aggressive development and tourism. Yet somehow, this very contradiction intrigued me.

If Bali was so ‚Äúruined,‚Äù I wanted to witness it firsthand.

# Breaking Through the Tourist Veneer

We chose Ubud as our first-week base, having heard it struck a balance between accessibility and authenticity ‚Äî developed enough to navigate easily but still retaining pockets of that quintessential Balinese charm.

Our first proper day began with a hotel taxi ride into central Ubud.  
My na√Øve brain had conjured images of a quaint, car-free village.

**Reality check:** I found myself dodging scooters on narrow sidewalks, passing an endless parade of identical-looking caf√©s ‚Äî all sporting that ubiquitous ‚Äúorganic-boho-chic‚Äù aesthetic.

But then, amidst this tourist tapestry, glimpses of authentic Balinese life began emerging: locals crafting elaborate daily offerings, wafts of incense curling skyward, traditional family compounds with their distinctive architecture, temple gates standing proud, and fruit-laden altars dotting the streetscape.

I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî several days in, frustration was creeping in. The appeal remained elusive, and those cultural glimpses felt more like footnotes than chapters.

Then came our breakthrough: unable (and slightly unwilling) to brave the traffic on a scooter, we discovered a local running bicycle tours around Kintamani‚Äôs countryside. And there, my friends, is where the real story begins ‚Äî where I finally understood why Bali, despite being swept up in the tide of mass tourism, still holds its visitors spellbound.

Our breakthrough came in the form of Adhi, an impossibly energetic Balinese who spoke with the kind of infectious optimism that would normally make my cynical self cringe ‚Äî but somehow didn‚Äôt. Instead of the usual tourist traps, he introduced us to a Bali I hadn‚Äôt seen anywhere : a world where spiders become honored temple residents (yes, really ‚Äî one family temple houses nearly 1,000 of them after giving up on eviction attempts), and where daily life moves to the rhythm of ceremonies.

# The Spiritual Layout : Where Cosmic Order Meets Daily Life

You probably came across some mad luxurious villas that are getting built in Bali, just like [this one that came in the shape of a Airplane on a cliff, overlooking the ocean](https://medium.com/bali-luxury-travel/private-jet-villa-experience-balis-ultimate-luxury-retreat-in-uluwatu-e18ddf06139a).

Well, forget them for a minute. Let me take you through **a** ***real*** **Balinese home** ‚Äî and trust me, it‚Äôs going to flip everything you think you know about architecture on its head.

Thanks to our guide Adhi (the same bundle of optimistic energy I mentioned earlier), we got to peek behind one of those intriguing walled compounds that line Ubud‚Äôs streets.

You know the ones if you went there : low walls with those gorgeous roofed gateways that probably populate half of Pinterest‚Äôs ‚ÄúBali Architecture‚Äù boards.

But here‚Äôs the plot twist ‚Äî that picture-perfect entrance doesn‚Äôt lead to a house, at least not in the way we Westerners think of one. Instead, you step into an open yard composed of what looks like a carefully choregraphed dance of multiple buildings, some fully enclosed, others just vibing with a roof and a few support poles.

Now, if you‚Äôre anything like me, your first thought might be, ‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôs the actual house?‚Äù But that‚Äôs where things get interesting. Every single building in this compound is exactly where it needs to be, following a spiritual GPS that would make your iPhone‚Äôs navigation system look basic.

Let me break down this cosmic real estate planning for you. In Balinese Hinduism (and yes, the ‚ÄúBalinese‚Äù part is crucial here), everything revolves around Mount Agung, the island‚Äôs highest peak.

It‚Äôs basically the OG penthouse suite for the gods, creating a sacred direction called ‚Äúkaja‚Äù ‚Äî which, plot twist, isn‚Äôt actually a fixed compass point. It‚Äôs more like a spiritual ‚Äúup‚Äù button, always pointing toward the mountain as it can be seen as north or south given where you are located in the island, while its opposite, ‚Äúkelod,‚Äù points down toward the sea, away from the holy mountain. Add in ‚Äúkangin‚Äù (east, where the sun rises), the second-most sacred direction and ‚Äúkauh‚Äù (west), and you‚Äôve got yourself a spiritual coordinate system that would make geometry enthusiasts weep with joy.

[A representation of Bali and how the compass works with the island‚Äôs specificities. Found in a research paper written by N.Aryani and Gunawan Tanuwidjaja](https://preview.redd.it/pnz6c4kw96ie1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3f21de9884e895eab84bfd2563cf246c8ab028)

Here‚Äôs where it gets really wild: every building in a traditional Balinese compound is positioned according to this divine blueprint.

* The family temple? It gets the cosmic penthouse spot at the kaja-kangin junction. Even though it might be more or less fancy, depending on how rich is the family. And Adhi made us look at the neighbour‚Äôs temple, who was a rich business man selling coffee, and the temple over there was covered in bamboo decorations, palm tree roof and golden decorations. The one we were in ? It was pretty stone-y if you want my humble opinion.
* The kitchen hangs out in kelod because apparently, that‚Äôs where the fire goddess likes to cook (and who are we to argue with a deity‚Äôs preferred kitchen placement?) but also because that‚Äôs the ‚Äòdirtier‚Äô quarter of the compound, housing the woods, oils, smoke, and soot; hence its polar opposite region from the temple in the north, seen as the ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô realm where holy mountains can be found.
* The elderly family members get the kaja-side buildings as they have the highest status, while the youngsters bunk down in the kauh zone.
* There‚Äôs even a dedicated space for ceremonies ‚Äî births, weddings, tooth-filings (yes, that‚Äôs a thing, and we‚Äôll get to it some other day) ‚Äî in the kangin area.

A glimpse into the balinese compound we visited with Adhi : the ceremony space is on the right and the youngsters zone on the left.

* And before you ask ‚Äî yes, there‚Äôs a designated spot for garbage, and it‚Äôs exactly where you‚Äôd expect: as far from the sacred corner as possible (kelod-kauh, if you‚Äôre taking notes). And actually, it also served, in the family compound that we went to, to host roosters. Dang, there were dozens and dozens of caged up roosters, and some of them were pretty majestic. The dad of the family had his business set up to sell roosters, either for cock fight, blood liberation for ceremonies or simply for eating.

# The Architecture of Integration & Integrity

But here‚Äôs the mind-bending part: this isn‚Äôt just some ancient feng shui on steroids. The Balinese believe we‚Äôre all walking, talking miniature versions of the universe. Just as the cosmos has its upper world (gods), middle world (humans), and underworld, we‚Äôve got our heads, bodies, and feet. And just like that one wobbly leg on your IKEA furniture can throw everything off balance, they believe misaligning these cosmic forces in your living space can leave you feeling spiritually off-kilter.

This three-part harmony plays out everywhere:

* from the grand cycle of birth (kitchen/Brahma‚Äôs domain), life (ceremony space), and death (family temple)
* right down to the structure of each building, with its roof (head), pillars (body), and foundation (feet)
* and the way they are positioned in the compound also reflects that : The balinese complex symbolically resembles the human body, where the head is represented by the family temple (*sanggah*), with the kitchen (*paon*) and ‚Äòrice storage building‚Äô (*lumbung*) acting as the limbs, even the garbage pit possesses the role of a backside orifice.

The real eye-opener isn‚Äôt just how different this is from our Western ‚Äúform follows function‚Äù approach (though I‚Äôm definitely guilty of that binary thinking even as I write this) where architecture design should reflect the intended function of the building.

What‚Äôs truly fascinating is how this system embraces the space between extremes. While we often get caught up in dualities ‚Äî work/life balance, anyone? ‚Äî the Balinese architectural tradition literally **builds room for the middle ground.** Their three-force system creates space for dynamic balance at every level, from cosmic architecture right down to where you store your brooms.

It‚Äôs not about choosing between sacred and profane, or even finding some perfect midpoint. Instead, it‚Äôs about recognizing that these forces ‚Äî high and low, clean and unclean, sacred and mundane ‚Äî are all essential players in the cosmic dance of daily life. Your kitchen isn‚Äôt just a place to try (and in my case, fail at) making nasi goreng; it‚Äôs where creation itself manifests through the fire goddess. Your garbage area isn‚Äôt just an eyesore to hide; it‚Äôs a necessary acknowledgment of life‚Äôs full cycle.

# A Mirror to Our Modern Fragmentation

Standing in these compounds, I couldn‚Äôt help but reflect current and most prominent tendency to approach life. **We segment our existence into distinct compartments** :

* our corporate lives in sterile office buildings
* our social lives in carefully curated spaces
* our spiritual lives (if we maintain them) in designated houses of worship
* our fitness routines in anonymous gyms.

Each aspect of our lives occupies its own physical and mental space, rarely intersecting. We‚Äôre essentially living as human patchworks, constantly switching between different modes of being.

The result ? A perpetual sense of fragmentation, always trying to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù different aspects of life that were perhaps never meant to be separated in the first place.

What makes the Balinese approach so revolutionary isn‚Äôt its worthy aesthetics, but its fundamental recognition that a home isn‚Äôt just a shelter or a status symbol. It‚Äôs a living, breathing microcosm of the universe itself, where every corner has its purpose, every direction its meaning, and every aspect of life ‚Äî from the divine to the mundane ‚Äî has its proper place in the grand scheme of things.

This integration isn‚Äôt just philosophical; it‚Äôs practical. Morning offerings aren‚Äôt interruptions to the day‚Äôs schedule ‚Äî they are the schedule. Spiritual practice isn‚Äôt something to squeeze in between work and leisure; it‚Äôs the framework within which all activities take place.

Perhaps this is their greatest lesson for our fragmented modern lives: true integration isn‚Äôt about perfect balance between separate spheres, but about recognizing that these spheres were never truly separate to begin with. In a world increasingly pulled apart by the centrifugal forces of modernization, this might be exactly the wisdom we need to piece ourselves back together.",1,1739132587.0,bali,1,1.0,False

For example, when I get halfway through a Starbucks latte or finish a can or two of Monster, I feel a nice, random surge of excitement. I thought caffeine just helps you feel awake and ready for the day, not like other things that make you feel buzzed, like weed or alcohol. I wonder if other people feel this euphoric feeling from caffeine too. I've read about people getting addicted to energy drinks and coffee, and I‚Äôm curious why they get so hooked if it's not like being addicted to cigarettes or alcohol. Maybe it's because caffeine is a stimulant, which is similar to nicotine. I know caffeine is supposed to give you some kind of buzz, but is it just a boost of energy or does it also feel euphoric for you guys also?

So, In this case, newpipe would be a feed aggregator.


The catch I see with this way is
1. you can't hop onto next videos like in newpipe and track your watches. 
2. if you want to watch things in a playlist you have to go with newpipe or have to manually open every video in playlist on browser. 
3. Have to mark videos watched for every video, if you want to track that is. 
4. The browser page will have suggested videos which newpipe can disable or at the very least least hide.

1ilnygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ilnygc/the_anniversary/,The Anniversary,"In what seems to be a rather tragic turn of events
for a couple residing in P.T. Rajan Road, it has been reported by a certain Mr. Mohan that his 
wife went missing on the 5th of July, after the couple celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary with some of their friends at a party in their bungalow.

The thirty odd people who attended the party were
asked to go through some basic police questioning, and not only did the police not find a suspect, they also  confirmed that everyone's story was more or less the same - Mrs. Sumitra was her usual jolly self, cracking jokes, attending to the guests, and even joined them in the Bunny Hop train.

The guests left the house at around 11:30 PM, and Mr. Mohan saw them off, while Mrs. Sumitra cleaned the somewhat messy lawn, and when he came back, he offered to help her, but she told him that he should go rest and sent him away inside.

It was only after almost an hour when the husband
realized that the wife was still outside and found it odd, because it was just a few paper plates and cups that needed to be put away and that shouldn't have taken that long. After frantically looking for her, he called everyone who was there in the party, and everyone who wasn't, but when everyone answered in the negative, he wondered if she had been abducted, so he stayed stuck to his phone, but when that didn't help, he finally took it to the police. 

The police are still investigating the case and are yet to find out any suspects and possible missing links.

Mohan put down the Sunday morning paper on the couch and sipped coffee from the huge green mug that Sumitra had gifted him on their anniversary.
He then slowly lifted the couch seat, just enough
to take a long look at the very dead eyes of his beloved wife. He would need to move her somewhere else, but today, he wanted to let her rest inside the couch.

I would love to hear people‚Äôs tips and tricks for keeping track of things throughout all the memory issues. I am absolutely stressing myself out trying to manage trackers and calendars and lists. I‚Äôve got them for grocery shopping, drs. appts, farm chores, animal feedings, etc. I‚Äôm about to start an excel sheet to keep track of them all. 

I‚Äôve got two calendar programs to keep track of bills, drs. appts, farm planting schedules, and errands. Another calendar to track our snake feedings. I keep a magnetic notepad on the fridge with a list of the freezer contents. I keep notes on my phone for the different grocery stores I frequent with shopping lists. 

But at this point I get so many reminders and notifications on my phone they start blending together, and the alerts that can be put off for a bit get mixed up with the ones that need to be dealt with now. 

I also am worried that if I do not have a visual reminder somewhere, I will forget to check on a list. I‚Äôve started a To Do list in a big notepad I am keeping on my coffee table in the hopes that if I see it daily I will remember to check it for tasks I was hoping to do within the next couple of days, energy permitting. 

What ways have you guys found to keep track of your life? Any great apps, trackers, or planners that have helped you keep from getting overwhelmed trying to keep track of what you are forgetting? Any resources for dealing with this that I may not be aware of? I would love to hear from anyone who is or has dealt with this, what has helped, what hasn‚Äôt, and any suggestions anyone might have. Thank you guys so much!
