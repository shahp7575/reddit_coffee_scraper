*July 17, 2025 — MLS Season Pass*

**The Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the books are *screaming* for Seattle Sounders FC. Their implied probability of victory? A robust 65–68%, depending on which bookie you ask (FanDuel says 1.48, which translates to \~67.6%—math geeks, grab your calculators). The Colorado Rapids, meanwhile, are priced at 5.75 to 6.2, implying a 15.9% chance—a statistical long shot akin to betting your dog will solve a Rubik’s Cube mid-game. The draw? A tidy 21.7%—perfect for fans who enjoy agonizing over tiebreakers.

Seattle’s dominance isn’t just numbers; it’s a well-oiled machine. Jordan Morris, the Sounders’ caffeinated squirrel of a forward, recently hit his 100th career goal contribution. Since returning from the Club World Cup, they’ve gone unbeaten, playing football like they’re on a quest for the Holy Grail (but with more crosses into the box). The Rapids, though, snapped a three-game skid with a 3-0 thrashing of Vancouver, earning high-fives from Coach Chris Armas and a temporary spot in the “relevant” column.

**The News: Morris Back, Rapids Raring**  
Seattle’s secret sauce? Jordan Morris, who’s as reliable as a coffee shop in Seattle. His return has turned the Sounders’ attack into a caffeinated squirrel on a power drill—relentless, chaotic, and occasionally knocking goals into the top corner. Defensively, they’ve been tighter than a goalie’s grip on a penalty save.

The Rapids? They’re coming off a 3-0 win that had the energy of a surprise birthday party—everyone’s dancing, no one’s sad. Rafael Navarro, Calvin Harris, and Andreas Maxsø all found the net, and Armas gushed about their “energ

But now my cortisol is borderline normal. For context, I used to only need to go 3-4x a day. 5-7 max if I went drinking (like 2+ bottles of soju mix with other alcohol or 3/4 hard liquor mixed with other drinks).

Initially thought the frequent urination might be a UTI, but only 1/4 doctors said it was, and 3 rounds of antibiotics did not help. It improved but I’m still going like 10+ times a day. For context I don’t drink a lot now. Maybe one cup of matcha and 400 ml water. I cut coffee out bc I read it’s an irritant. However, when I was living on my own abroad , I could drink like 2 cups of coffee, sometimes 3 or a cup of tea + half cup apple juice, half bottle of water, 1 bottle of Diet Coke, vitamin c at night and yet only need to go toilet <5x a day if alcohol is not involved. I even did an ultrasound which showed nothings wrong.

However, my insulin growth like factor is at 311, above  the normal range. My doc didn’t check this at my most recent check up Is my increased urination normal due to normal cortisol now (I read low cortisol can result in decreased urination too which might have been why I didn’t have to use the toilet so much? (I’m sure 15 times isn’t tho) or is it a sign of diabetes. I will be asking my doc in a few months but would just like to ask in the mean time.

Height : 160, weight 47-48kg depending (not sure why reddit required this)

Posted this sometime back and a lil update, I went to a different GP, who did thyroid renal profile hb1AC(?). So all my tests came back negative blood glucose was at 5.2%, so diabetes probability is low. My only concern is my sodium bicarbonate dropped to 15, which is below the normal range, and coupled with my frequent urination it seems to point towards kidney function declining (?), but my eFGR is normal at 109. but it has dropped from 118 and 122 previously.

When you consciously manifest something successfully—like someone buying you a coffee—it creates a powerful momentum. For example, after manifesting that first coffee, getting the second and third becomes effortless. With each success, your belief strengthens, and you might find yourself receiving free coffees without needing affirmations or visualizations. Eventually, you might even stop thinking about it altogether.

Let me share an example from my experience. In the beginning, when I was manifesting my specific person (SP), I believed that if I saw yellow Dr. Martens（my sp wear those constantly）, it meant my sp was thinking of me. I kept spotting those boots—sometimes even multiple pairs in a single day—over the course of a year, despite our on-and-off relationship. I saw those yellow boots as a symbol of his feelings for me.

However, this year, I decided to let go of that belief. While I continue to manifest a heathy committed relationship with my SP, I recognized that I still had some resistance to work through. Once I stopped focusing on the yellow boots, I ceased to see them altogether. I realized I could manifest them anytime, but it didn’t hold significance for me anymore.

I shifted my belief to him always reaching out to me and desiring me. This changed my reality from him never initiating contact to him always coming to find me. My next goal was for him to express his feelings, leading to moments where he constantly says things like, ""I like you,"" ""I love you,"" and ""I can’t live without you.""

Manifestation is a fascinating journey, and I’m excited to see where it leads next!",2,1752645723.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

1m14vdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m14vdk/stuffed_animals/,Stuffed Animals,"When Jasper died it was hard on both of us. I’ll be the first to admit that I spent a good week crying, even at work when I would find myself in a dark corner of a room on my own, or the last one out of a conference, I would feel that soon-to-be familiar warmth on my cheeks. It reminded me of the way he used to lay against our faces when he was tired, slowly fading until he was fast asleep. This wasn’t even that much wetter. But the tears held a completely different feeling. Although they were hot against my face, I felt none of the comfort I would feel on a rainy night with Jasper, feeding off of one another for warmth as thunder rolled outside the windows and harsh winds rattled the house. 

We both loved him a lot, and we were both devastated to see him go, but I have to say that she took it differently. At first I understood, she didn’t want to take his body right away. I only really understood because he had passed outside. If he was indoors, I don’t think I would have been able to stomach it, but outside he stayed in the equilibrium of autumn for one day. Two days. Whenever I passed the back window I would glance outside and see him, lying lifeless under his favorite orange tree. That orange tree had been in the back yard since we moved in, and the moment the realtor opened up the back door on our first visit to the place, Jasper sprinted out and sat under the tree, almost like he was lying now, but the palpable life in him at that time, the energy that emanated from him, make those moments incomparable. 

On the third day, I was up early, getting ready for work. It was five o’clock in the morning and dew had settled on the back grass, the trees, the oranges, and Jasper. The automatic lights behind the house lit the backyard like a stage, one where on many nights you could find our special pup putting on grand performances, running around while we sat inside behind the open door or out on the deck. He would run around the yard, jumping as high as he could for oranges. He would always be close, close enough to laugh, close enough to greet him with the biggest hug when he came panting up to us, tired out, finally to lie under the shade of the branches and fall asleep before we called him back in for bed. Almost like a child, almost like a friend. In the morning, on this day, things couldn’t be more different. 

I sat and watched his body do absolutely nothing. It had collected so much dew. I thought Jasper would have enjoyed rising up and shaking all of that water off of him. It was at this thought that I realized that he *should* be up, he should be gone, somewhere where the three of us — her, him, and myself — could move on. 

I went upstairs to my room, pausing halfway up the stairs to glance out the back window again. I could barely see his paws under the top of the doorway, and I choked back a sob — more tears — as I averted my face to the carpeted staircase under my bare feet. I was cold, and I didn’t know why I wasn’t wearing any slippers or socks. I guess the thought had eluded my mind in the gray mist of the autumn morning, the silence never enough space for wandering thoughts. 

She lay on the bed still as I walked in. I observed her from the doorway, breathing in slowly through my nose. I noticed the house had begun to smell different, a burning, woodsy smell. My nose scrunched at the intrusion, and I moved over quietly to the bed, seeing my slippers on the floor by my nightstand where I always left them. I sat on the side of the mattress and slowly put them on, after which I sat quietly for maybe five minutes, just staring at the floor, my feet, around the room, looking at Jasper’s barely-used bed in the corner. He always slept with us and would excitedly stomp down the stairs with me, nearly tripping me on the way down on several occasions, but I barely ever woke up and experienced the morning alone. This lonely feeling — something I hadn’t experienced since the early mornings at my parents’ house, waking up for school before the house was up, sitting quietly downstairs, maybe listening to music, but never making enough noise to fill the silence — I hadn’t felt it in years. Even in my youth those moments had a darkness to them, the dull uselessness of the early morning. I never like to be up before the sun alone.

After sitting and contemplating this, looking out the window to see the moon setting behind the dense clouds and fog, I finally spoke. “Andrea.”

I heard a shifting beside me. “Hmm?” a half-awake voice answered.

“Andrea, I —“

I sat again for a moment, longer that I should have. It seemed that I had forgotten what I was going to say. For a moment it escaped me, almost floating out the window, into the mist, through the orange tree’s branches, and down to the ground where Jasper lay. Then I finally grasped it.

“Andrea, I — I think it’s time to…to take Jasper…away.”

My words lingered in the silence, their staggered exit echoing oddly in my head and around the room, absorbing into nothing. However, her word was clearer, more awake, when she replied, “Why?”

It didn’t hang in the silence like my words. It stood, resolute and alive.

I tried to look it in the face. “It’s just… It doesn’t feel right…having him out there for days. I feel like he’s suffering. *I’m* suffering…seeing him like this.”

“So you’d rather see him driven off? Or drive him off yourself?” I still hadn’t turned to look at her, and I could tell she was still turned away from me. “That wouldn’t hurt you more?”

“I don’t know. I just know that it hurts to look out there. I thought it would be a comfort, but I keep thinking about what was — how *he* was — and I can’t help but —“

“That’s what it’s supposed to feel like.” Another standing intruder materialized in my room. “You think it’s not supposed to hurt? We loved him.”

“Love hurts…” I muttered, more a question than a resolution. She must not have heard me. Silence filled the room and when I turned around, I just saw her lying there, no words or phrases surrounding her like soldiers ready for war. She finally turned to me, and her face was dark and tired.

“Just go stand him up.”

“What?”

“If he’s up, it won’t feel like that anymore. Think about it, Jasper slept at the end of the day, and he woke up with you. He ran around all day behind you or me until we finally settled, then he rested. He should be up with you right now, shouldn’t he?”

“He *would* be. But Andrea, he’s dead.”

We stared into each other’s eyes for a while.

“Go stand him up.”

— — —

A few hours later, the day had warmed up. With a mug of coffee in my hand, I looked out the back window at the orange tree in the yard, and I saw my dog looking back at me. At first I really hadn’t known what to do; his body was limp, the skin under his fur loose and damp, but once I found a few sticks that could support his weight I was able to post a few around his body and put him into a sitting position. I tucked his hind legs under a mound of wet skin and fur that had loosened in the dew of the last three days, and I was even able to shorten a piece of wood from the shed to be just the right length to hold his head up, sticking out of the ground just before his front legs and from a forward-facing view blocking most of the rest of his body. In this sense, you could almost ignore the fact that he was dead and focus on his face, eyes re-opened and shining dully in the late-morning sun. With the sticks supporting his various dead sections, he almost looked like he had extra legs, maybe that he was sitting inside of a large campfire, or playing at a ridiculous strategy of hide-and-go seek.

As I had worked, the world had been moving around me. Construction workers began work in the yard next to me, ambulances drove by, and from over my gate I could hear people walking down the street, starting their days. Despite the cold, I worked sweating in the back yard, and finally as I stepped away I actually felt a kind of pride. Even though I knew he was gone, he at least looked more like the Jasper I had known. I grabbed an orange from the tree and set it beside him. 

She walked down the stairs, finally having woken up. She came to me and kissed me, staring into my eyes for a moment before drawing back into the kitchen. She looked outside. “He’s been out there for a while.” I looked over at her and she was smiling. “Has he been out there all night?”

I was confused. “I… No? He’s been out there for…well he’s just been out there a while.”

“Well you ought to bring him in, it’s almost lunchtime!” Pouring a cup of coffee. Sniffing forcefully. “And light a fire, would you?”

She walked from the kitchen, passed me and went to the living room with her coffee. “Did you see they’re having a harvest festival this year at the high school? We should go!”

My brow furrowed as she walked away from me. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them my hands were wet. Jasper was on the couch, and a fire was roaring in the fireplace.

— — —

Over the next few days, things continued to change. Jasper began to become a part of our lives again. It was different, obviously he couldn’t *do* anything, but it felt good to not see him outside anymore, not lying in days worth of morning dew, defeated and retired under the one thing he loved as as much as his family, his orange tree, his home. 

But while I felt comfort at times, I also felt unease. There were moments when I would be talking with her, look for a moment at Jasper, and I would see him change. His face would begin to melt and clumps of wool would start to fall from his open mouth. There were large splinters sticking out of his skin and his eyes were filled with bugs. His legs under him were broken. When I spoke to her about it she laughed, and said I must be getting into the Halloween spirit, then she would go over and kiss Jasper on top of his rotting head. My eyes would close, and when they would open again, things would be back to normal.

I hadn’t been to work the whole time. On the first day when I had woken up early, I had decided to call out and spend the day at home. The way she’d been acting that morning and seeing Jasper outside, it was all too much. But now I was just home, I hadn’t called out in a few days, and I wondered if my job was at all worried about me. Still, we seemed to live in a dream where the outside world had stopped, giving us space to explore this new-found time with each other. 

“Come sit!” Andrea’s voice from the kitchen snapped me out of my thoughts. Most moments of solitude I forgot, and if I remembered anything it was only the moments before being pulled back into reality. At the other side of the room, through the opening in the kitchen wall looking into our living room, I saw Andrea. I heard the crackling of the fire in front of me, smelled burning wood, felt the left side of my face warmer than the right as I turned to look at her. 

“What’s that?”

“Dinner is ready. I made meatloaf and soup.”

When I walked into the kitchen, the smell of the fire faded into the smell of hot food on the table. I sat down, suddenly unsure of what to do with my hands as I waited, how to pose myself. I eventually rested my head on my hands with my elbows on the table, staring blankly. Jasper sat across the room propped against the island in the middle of the room. He looked the strangest I’d ever seen him, leaning lifelessly. How long had it been now? Time had stood still and meshed together. 

I looked down at the food, slowly beginning to eat. I closed my eyes and heard Andrea’s chair slide on the floor across the table from me. 

“How do you like it?” I heard her say before opening my eyes.

“It’s amazing. Thanks for making it all on your own, I could have helped you out!”

“I tried to ask but you were asleep on the couch!” Andrea laughed. “I even had to get Jasper in here all on my own. I got so worked up cooking, he didn’t even get dinner!”

I frowned. “I’m sorry…”

“No, it’s okay! Things have been changing a lot around here, and I know it’s been a lot. That’s why I thought I would treat you to something!”

“Well, thank you. I’m not sure I deserve it.”

“I’m not sure either!”

I looked up. She was smiling, looking right back at me. After a few seconds, she turned to her food and began to eat. 

We sat in silence as we ate, trance-like. When the meal was over, we stared at the leftover food on our plates.

“I’m too full to finish the rest,” Andrea said, laughing and clutching her stomach. “I put a lot into this.”

“I really appreciate it, honey. I haven’t felt this good after a meal in ages.”

She sat for a moment, not responding to me. Then she proceeded to get up with her plate and walk over to Jasper. Like before, as if in a flash, I saw him, skin loose and damp from sitting outside, the skin on his face rotting. I smelled his unwashed fur, amplifying the stench of death, his wide-open mouth empty and gaping. 

*It’s over,* his dead eyes seemed to say, but as Andrea passed him, like a magic trick, he returned to normal, just a dog sitting against the island. Maybe a little tired, but not dead, not full of rot and wool, dry and wet at the same time.

“I think I’ll feed Jasper,” I said, remembering that in the rush to make dinner, Andrea hadn’t been able to get to him. No wonder he looked so tired! I took my plate of leftover meatloaf and put it in front of him. “Go ahead, bud,” I smiled at him. “All yours!”

Andrea was at the sink, water running, washing her plate. But suddenly, I heard the soft sweep of her feet on the floor as she turned around; I heard the clink of dishes and silverware cease. The sink kept running. When she walked over, I noticed she had tears in her eyes. She squatted down to the floor, eye-level with Jasper’s limp body. She slowly moved her hand from her side and to the leftover plate on the floor. She grabbed a chunk of meatloaf in her still-wet fingers and lifted it to his open mouth. His heartbreaking lack of reaction made my throat clench. I watched as Andrea took the piece of meat and placed it on Jasper’s hanging tongue, and, grabbing his jaw carefully with her other hand, she began to manually chew our dead dog’s food for him. Her cupped hand moved up and down as the food broke down under Jasper’s slack and rotten jaw. I watched in a mixture of horror and awe at Andrea’s face, which tightened and shook as she held back sobs. The meatloaf in his mouth slowly broke down under his teeth, some of which broke off in the process, small wet taps indicating their scattering on the floor. After she had chewed for him for about thirty seconds, her right hand still holding his toothless jaw, her left reached into his throat and shoved the meatloaf down. She looked at me as she let go of him and his whole body went slack again. 

We looked at each other for a moment before I followed suit. We each took turns repeating the ritual Andrea had laid out. I wasn’t sure what she was getting out of it, but I felt like for the first time in a while, I was doing something pure. These were the kinds of things I reminded myself of when I would wake up alone in the morning, by myself with my thoughts, unsure of how to move on with the day. When alone, I found I lost a lot of my resolve. When I could be with Andrea, just to see her and hear her, it brought meaning to my life, a meaning I couldn’t create with myself after all these years. 

But now, we were together. I could feel it.",1,1752645527.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m14uhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m14uhf/stuffed_animals/,Stuffed Animals,"When Jasper died it was hard on both of us. I’ll be the first to admit that I spent a good week crying, even at work when I would find myself in a dark corner of a room on my own, or the last one out of a conference, I would feel that soon-to-be familiar warmth on my cheeks. It reminded me of the way he used to lay against our faces when he was tired, slowly fading until he was fast asleep. This wasn’t even that much wetter. But the tears held a completely different feeling. Although they were hot against my face, I felt none of the comfort I would feel on a rainy night with Jasper, feeding off of one another for warmth as thunder rolled outside the windows and harsh winds rattled the house. 

We both loved him a lot, and we were both devastated to see him go, but I have to say that she took it differently. At first I understood, she didn’t want to take his body right away. I only really understood because he had passed outside. If he was indoors, I don’t think I would have been able to stomach it, but outside he stayed in the equilibrium of autumn for one day. Two days. Whenever I passed the back window I would glance outside and see him, lying lifeless under his favorite orange tree. That orange tree had been in the back yard since we moved in, and the moment the realtor opened up the back door on our first visit to the place, Jasper sprinted out and sat under the tree, almost like he was lying now, but the palpable life in him at that time, the energy that emanated from him, make those moments incomparable. 

On the third day, I was up early, getting ready for work. It was five o’clock in the morning and dew had settled on the back grass, the trees, the oranges, and Jasper. The automatic lights behind the house lit the backyard like a stage, one where on many nights you could find our special pup putting on grand performances, running around while we sat inside behind the open door or out on the deck. He would run around the yard, jumping as high as he could for oranges. He would always be close, close enough to laugh, close enough to greet him with the biggest hug when he came panting up to us, tired out, finally to lie under the shade of the branches and fall asleep before we called him back in for bed. Almost like a child, almost like a friend. In the morning, on this day, things couldn’t be more different. 

I sat and watched his body do absolutely nothing. It had collected so much dew. I thought Jasper would have enjoyed rising up and shaking all of that water off of him. It was at this thought that I realized that he *should* be up, he should be gone, somewhere where the three of us — her, him, and myself — could move on. 

I went upstairs to my room, pausing halfway up the stairs to glance out the back window again. I could barely see his paws under the top of the doorway, and I choked back a sob — more tears — as I averted my face to the carpeted staircase under my bare feet. I was cold, and I didn’t know why I wasn’t wearing any slippers or socks. I guess the thought had eluded my mind in the gray mist of the autumn morning, the silence never enough space for wandering thoughts. 

She lay on the bed still as I walked in. I observed her from the doorway, breathing in slowly through my nose. I noticed the house had begun to smell different, a burning, woodsy smell. My nose scrunched at the intrusion, and I moved over quietly to the bed, seeing my slippers on the floor by my nightstand where I always left them. I sat on the side of the mattress and slowly put them on, after which I sat quietly for maybe five minutes, just staring at the floor, my feet, around the room, looking at Jasper’s barely-used bed in the corner. He always slept with us and would excitedly stomp down the stairs with me, nearly tripping me on the way down on several occasions, but I barely ever woke up and experienced the morning alone. This lonely feeling — something I hadn’t experienced since the early mornings at my parents’ house, waking up for school before the house was up, sitting quietly downstairs, maybe listening to music, but never making enough noise to fill the silence — I hadn’t felt it in years. Even in my youth those moments had a darkness to them, the dull uselessness of the early morning. I never like to be up before the sun alone.

After sitting and contemplating this, looking out the window to see the moon setting behind the dense clouds and fog, I finally spoke. “Andrea.”

I heard a shifting beside me. “Hmm?” a half-awake voice answered.

“Andrea, I —“

I sat again for a moment, longer that I should have. It seemed that I had forgotten what I was going to say. For a moment it escaped me, almost floating out the window, into the mist, through the orange tree’s branches, and down to the ground where Jasper lay. Then I finally grasped it.

“Andrea, I — I think it’s time to…to take Jasper…away.”

My words lingered in the silence, their staggered exit echoing oddly in my head and around the room, absorbing into nothing. However, her word was clearer, more awake, when she replied, “Why?”

It didn’t hang in the silence like my words. It stood, resolute and alive.

I tried to look it in the face. “It’s just… It doesn’t feel right…having him out there for days. I feel like he’s suffering. *I’m* suffering…seeing him like this.”

“So you’d rather see him driven off? Or drive him off yourself?” I still hadn’t turned to look at her, and I could tell she was still turned away from me. “That wouldn’t hurt you more?”

“I don’t know. I just know that it hurts to look out there. I thought it would be a comfort, but I keep thinking about what was — how *he* was — and I can’t help but —“

“That’s what it’s supposed to feel like.” Another standing intruder materialized in my room. “You think it’s not supposed to hurt? We loved him.”

“Love hurts…” I muttered, more a question than a resolution. She must not have heard me. Silence filled the room and when I turned around, I just saw her lying there, no words or phrases surrounding her like soldiers ready for war. She finally turned to me, and her face was dark and tired.

“Just go stand him up.”

“What?”

“If he’s up, it won’t feel like that anymore. Think about it, Jasper slept at the end of the day, and he woke up with you. He ran around all day behind you or me until we finally settled, then he rested. He should be up with you right now, shouldn’t he?”

“He *would* be. But Andrea, he’s dead.”

We stared into each other’s eyes for a while.

“Go stand him up.”

It had the perfect mix of laid-back island energy with just enough to do. We stayed in a cozy Airbnb and rented a cheap car from a local shop, which made it easy to explore the island at our own pace.

**Nature and Vibe**

[Evening on the water](https://preview.redd.it/8ia8g3nxd6df1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d23a9993f9424dae947501c712da6b948577e8c)

The landscapes were gorgeous: lush forests, tropical flowers, and that unreal turquoise water. Locals warned us about habu snakes (they're venomous), but we didn't run into any. Still something to keep in mind if you're hiking off trail.

We snorkeled at a few beaches, but the Blue Cave was the most memorable. We skipped the guided tour and just brought our own gear. Totally doable on your own if you're a confident swimmer, and free.

**Favorite Side Trips**

* **Taketomi Island** – Just a 20-minute ferry from Ishigaki. We rented bikes, cruised around the whole island, browsed pottery shops, and had some amazing soba. One of our favorite days.

* **Iriomote Island** – More wild and rugged. We kayaked through the mangroves and did some light exploring by car. One day wasn’t enough. We’re planning to go back and stay overnight next time.

* **Kabira Farms** – Small botanical garden with fresh juice and a peaceful walking path. Calm and quiet.

* **Banana Park** – Short hike with great ocean views and no crowds. Worth a quick stop if you’re nearby.



**Favorite Eats**

We were surprised by how good the local food scene was. Almost every meal came from a small, casual spot run by kind and passionate people.

* **Nobare Café** – Mango with ice cream was perfect.

* **茶房うふた (Sabou Ufuta)** – A peaceful soba restaurant tucked into nature.

* **Maru Beef** – High-end Ishigaki wagyu. Expensive but unforgettable.

* **Nuts Town Café** – Strange name, but the peanut coffee was excellent. Total hidden gem.
* **スムージー屋さん (Smoothie Van)** – Tiny roadside stand with banana milk smoothies. We went nearly every day.

**Final Thoughts**

Ishigaki is relaxed and quiet without ever being boring. You can snorkel in the morning, visit a garden or beach in the afternoon, and eat handmade soba in the evening. With a couple of day trips mixed in, it felt like the kind of vacation that recharges you without any pressure to over-plan.

If you love nature, good food, and an authentic island feel, I’d highly recommend it. We’ll definitely be back — and next time, Iriomote is getting more than a single day.

One last tip: our favorite restaurant of the whole trip was **Umaru**. It's a tiny place with a cozy vibe. Just one person was doing all the cooking and serving when we visited. The dumplings were especially amazing. It's only open on certain weekdays, so check ahead and try to book. Absolutely worth it.

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to? I realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

1m14sy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Reasonable_Wolf5671/comments/1m14sy0/why_most_people_waste_their_ai_prompts_and_how_to/,Why Most People Waste Their AI Prompts (and How to Fix It),"I still remember the first time I tried generating art with MidJourney. I typed in something like “[futuristic city](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/)” and hit Enter.

The result? A bland, uninspired cityscape with no real wow factor.

https://preview.redd.it/mzn8u7t6e6df1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b5c7ea97e11dcb79d70e9e30881f6da4aeee5f6

At first I thought, Maybe the AI isn’t as good as people say. But then I realized the problem wasn’t the tool — it was [my prompt](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/).

Have you ever felt that way? Like you’re not getting your money’s worth from AI art generators?

If so, you’re not alone. Most people don’t know how to talk to AI effectively.

Today, let’s break down why that happens — and how you can fix it immediately.

# 1️⃣ Vague Prompts = Generic Results

AI doesn’t “guess” what you want. It responds to what you ask.

If you write:

>“beautiful landscape”

It has no idea if you want:

* Autumn or winter?
* Mountains or ocean?
* Realistic or painterly?
* Bright daylight or moody twilight?

[Specificity is everything](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/).

When I switched from vague prompts to detailed, layered descriptions, my art quality transformed overnight.

# 2️⃣ Missing Style and Camera Details

One thing 99% of beginners skip? [Style cues](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/).

Think about how photographers describe a shot:

* “Wide-angle lens, dramatic lighting, cinematic color grading.”
* “Macro shot, soft focus, pastel color palette.”

AI understands these cues too!

Instead of:

>“cup of coffee”

Try:

>“steaming cup of artisan coffee on rustic wooden table, soft morning light, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field, moody color grade.”

That’s when you see professional-level results.

# 3️⃣ Ignoring Composition and Emotion

I see a lot of people forget why they want an image.

Ask yourself:  
 ✅ What feeling do you want to evoke?  
 ✅ What story should the image tell?  
 ✅ Where is the viewer’s eye supposed to go?

Prompt engineering isn’t just describing objects — it’s directing a scene.

# 4️⃣ Repeating the Same Prompts as Everyone Else

Here’s a secret most won’t tell you:

AI models are trained on tons of internet images. That means everyone using generic prompts is going to get [similar outputs](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/).

If you want unique, sellable art — be deliberate. Add twists. Reference obscure styles. Mix unexpected themes.

That’s how you get images no one else has.

# 5️⃣ Not Using Prompt Packs and Templates

If all this sounds hard, don’t worry. You don’t have to figure it out alone.

Prompt engineers spend hours refining the best phrasing, structure, and variables to get professional results.

That’s why [prompt packs](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/) exist.

They’re not just for beginners — they’re for anyone who wants to save time, avoid guesswork, and get consistently excellent outputs.

# 🎯 My Own Experience

I used to waste hours tweaking the same idea.

Then I tried a properly built prompt pack and instantly got the style, lighting, composition, and vibe I wanted.

It wasn’t about being “lazy” — it was about being smart with my time and getting [marketable results](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/) faster.

# ✅ Ready to Stop Wasting Your Prompts?

If you want to:

* Make better art
* Build a portfolio that stands out
* Sell AI designs on Fiverr or Etsy
* Impress clients with unique concepts

It all starts with [better prompts](https://worldofai75.blogspot.com/).

I’ve curated affordable, premium-quality prompt packs designed to work on popular AI tools like MidJourney, DALL·E, and Leonardo.

They’re made to save you time and help you create pro-quality art without trial and error.

The run down drug store at the corner. The Italian restaurant that has been run by the same family for who knows how long, yet was a staple in the community. It even looked the same, ten years later. Was that a good thing? The comfort that was often found in things that were familiar. Or, was it a bad omen that the things that drove her from town still existed and returning was a mistake.
Victoria’s phone vibrated in her pocket, though a glance at her watch told her that it was her mother. Of course it was.

The offer had been made to pick her up from the airport, but there was nothing appealing about being trapped in a moving vehicle with her mom for a 40 minute drive. A drive that led to a destination that wasn’t even the family home. That had been a stream of contentious texts and calls when she had stated she was renting an apartment instead of “coming home”. A confrontation only exacerbated by a ten year streak of virtual radio silence.
A streak Victoria was more than happy to continue if circumstances hadn’t forced her to return home. Or rather, really didn’t give her much of a choice. 

Her eyes squinted shut as echoes filled her mind. Noises crashing over her with the intention to drown. 

“Miss, we’ve arrived,” the driver called out, pulling her from the temporary nightmare. 
It was just going through the motions as she opened the door and slid out of the car. The driver handed her the suitcase that was in the trunk before she absently tipped the man on her phone. It was just so surreal to be back. Yet, as she looked up at the apartment, a feeling of dread set in. If she walked in now, she would have officially returned to the town she swore she never would. 

Slowly, Victoria’s gaze drifted towards the coffee shop a block down. That was, perhaps, the one thing she did miss. The Last Bean was the best shop for coffee and other cafe goods, and it was a hill she was willing to die on. If she went there, it would just be visiting. No committing to staying.

Resolved, she found herself walking down the block to the shop, a bell ringing as the door opened. The familiar scent of coffee was dominant in the air, but so was the general welcoming atmosphere. 

“Welcome in!” A voice called, lost to the recess of her mind. She scanned the menu herself, yet, before she could order, there voice called out.

It was familiar, and yet, she couldn’t place it at the same time. Then again, more insistent, “Tori?” The familiar voice called as she snapped her head towards the deep, resonant voice, “Is that you?”-
 
—— Hello there! If you’re read this far, I’m glad this has caught your interest! I’m a 26, female, looking for a long-term, literate, more realistic roleplay. I’d like a nice balance between plot and smut here. I’d love to hear your ideas for this story so we can create something that we both enjoy! However, I like the idea of giving up control when the woman is otherwise very independent in her own life. I’d also like to incorporate romance and digging into our characters. Especially as there was certainly reasons why my character left and is now back, and yours likely would have gone through changes in the past ten years. But I’d love to hear your thoughts such as who your character is. Someone who had a crush on my character in high school? And old romance? Was your character the reason Tori left? Since I want to keep this collaborative in nature to build a premise, I left some of those reasons vague so we can fill them in. But I do have my own thoughts, at least as it pertains to my character. I hope to hear from you! Discord will be preferred to roleplay, but we can discuss here first before switching over.

• “Get on apps.”
• “Just put yourself out there.”
• “Be confident.”

But none of this actually tells you HOW to start dating

Here’s why you feel stuck:

 1. Modern dating is confusing
We’re bombarded with advice that contradicts itself. Apps say “be authentic” but social media rewards good looks and materialism. Friends say “just be yourself” but you’re not even sure what that looks like on a date. And the younger generation nowadays view dating as either for hookups or attention seeking (atleast that's what the apps feel like) (lots of scammers on apps too)

 2. You’ve received bad dating advice
Most advice is generic:
• “Go to bars.”
• “Try speed dating.”
• “Just swipe more.”
These ignore the root issue: dating is a social skill, not a lottery. If your social confidence and conversation skills are low, no method will work.
 3. Lack of exposure
You think dating is separate from life. But it’s not. You only get better at dating by interacting with people daily in non-romantic contexts first. Otherwise, you’ll treat every conversation as a high-stakes event.

4. Thinking apps are the best way
Apps are easy but shallow. your ability to notice attraction signals, approach, flirt, connect, build tension, and lead is never actually trained, those are important skills to have while dating


 Secret Sauce Fix: (Something you prolly haven’t tried yet)
Start with “No Stakes Approaches.”
• For 5 days, talk to 5 strangers per day with no intention of flirting or asking out.
Example: “Hey, do you know a good coffee shop nearby?” or “That’s a cool bag, where did you get it?”
• The only goal is to build social fluidity.
• After 5 days, you’ll notice conversations flow easier. Then, start adding teases or playful comments. (but be very careful with this 😭)
Example: After they answer, “Nice, I’ll check it out. You’ve officially become my coffee guide for today.”

Why this works:
• Removes pressure. You’re not trying to date, you’re training your social calibration.
• Builds reference experiences & confidence. Your brain starts associating social interaction with fun, not anxiety.
• Makes real-life dating feel natural. You’re already in the flow.

 Remember: Dating doesn’t start with dates. It starts with becoming socially fluid so approaching or talking to someone attractive isn’t a mountain to climb – it’s just another moment in your day.

1m14jjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1m14jjq/new_table_origins_max_20_line_from_game_theory/,New table - Origins Max 2.0 line from Game Theory Tables,"Hey folks! 

I just got an Origins 2.0 Max gaming table and wanted to share some info as I saw nothing from 3rd parties about the new line that boasted a number of improvements. It would have been really nice to have a more recent review before dropping that kind of money, so I thought I'd offer that information for anyone looking for the same info.

This is day 1 - I received it and set it up today, so it hasn't been played on yet. 

Shipping-
They informed me when they shipped, the shipping policy is online, the dropoff was scheduled before the table even got to my local hub. I'm in the same state, so shipping was pretty fast. I ordered on June 23rd, and got it July 15th, so the overall turnaround to get it was pretty good.

Delivery -
Read the instructions. It's pretty easy, but they have very specific steps to follow to ensure if any damage is done to the table in shipping, it doesn't put either of you in a bind. The packaging was really thorough, and they sent a picture when it was shipped so I could validate the pallet looked the same and compared condition.

Getting it in the house -
I expected a lot of problems and prepared a lot. It was only going to be my partner, strong 6' something, and myself, a less strong 5' and change. I overprepared. It was actually really easy, and much lighter than I was worried it would be. Not light by any means, but lighter. We took the pallet apart outside so we didn't have to bring the table in with the inset or pallet weight added.

Set up - 
Super straightforward, but you do need 2 people. Helps with getting the table right side up, but the screws to attach the legs go inside the top of the legs, so you need to access the top. You can't just set it top down and pop the legs on, which allows for a cleaner look, but does mean you need someone holding the leg/table while the other bolts it on (unless you're very talented). Again, we had no issue flipping it upright without leaning on the legs.

Table Color/Stain-
My understanding is that the stain has been upgraded, and looking at it versus the old tables with reviews, it seems very true
It's quite nice to look at, looks like wood not plastic. I got the American Walnut stain, which is a nice dark brown. 

Toppers - 
The toppers are not light, but I don't find them too unwieldy. The channels and magnets are pretty good. Some reviews mention/showed that they used to have a sliding issue, which seems fully resolved. The channels between toppers are u shaped but have no foam or anything. If you spill, it will go through mostly to the channel vs the playing surface below, but I could see wood rot risk if not cleaned up completely. If you had a nice dinner, a spill happened, you could probably get away with waiting until after to take it apart to clean the channel and the mat below, but I would be wary of forgetting, or liquids likely to stain (like wine or coffee) that could get on the mats.

Accessories -
I a graphic template play surface (I went with Warhammer - I like the nerdiness and the simplicity). It's nicer than I expected, very well padded and with more color to it than I anticipated for a more simple design.

Otherwise, the only accessory I got was the power strip. It comes with 2 on alternate corners. The cording is all housed in the railing, which is hollow so you have a lot of freedom in how to run the cords through (though, for any notable distance, you may need an extension). They are built in and pretty seamless. I haven't used them yet, but they look fancy. 2 people in my group use laptops regularly for our characters, one of which is myself, so it definitely seems unnecessary, but cool.

We have been married for 15 years,"I’ve been married for 15 years. My wife, absolutely stunning, the kind of beauty that turns heads without trying, was my first and only, and I was hers. We both come from small towns and deeply religious families. Our marriage has been solid, no scandals, no separations, just a quiet, stable life built on mutual trust… or so I thought.

Last weekend, something shifted.

She went out for a girls’ night, like she’s done before. Normally, she’s home by 10 or 11 at the latest. But that night… she didn’t walk through the door until after 3 a.m.

I pretended to be asleep as she crept into our bedroom. She moved carefully, as if trying not to wake me. But I was watching…quietly, from under the covers. When she undressed, something hit me like a punch to the gut: she wasn’t wearing any panties.

I know for a fact she had them on when she left.

I said nothing the next morning. She didn’t either. Just coffee, small talk, pretending like everything was fine.

That night, I tried to be intimate with her. I missed her, needed to feel close again. But she pulled away, said she was “sore.” I asked what happened. Her answer? “We had a little too much to drink, and I fell on my butt. That’s all.”

I didn’t argue. I didn’t press. But my mind hasn’t stopped racing since.

I want to believe her…I really do. We have a long history, and I’ve never had a reason to doubt her. But this… this just doesn’t sit right. The late return. The missing underwear. The vague excuse.

Has anyone gone through something like this? Am I overthinking…or am I waking up to something I don’t want to see?",4,1752644203.0,cheatingexposed,22,1.0,False

I needed a roommate fast, and he messaged me five minutes after I posted in the local housing group.

No profile picture.
No mutual friends.
But he said all the right things. Said he had a stable remote job, no pets, quiet, clean, respectful. I FaceTimed him once. He seemed normal. A little awkward, maybe, but I didn’t care. I needed rent.

He moved in on Friday. By Saturday night, I wanted him out. The first red flag was the way he unpacked.

He brought four boxes. That’s it. No bed, no decorations, not even a backpack. The boxes were taped tight and he carried them one at a time, always holding them away from his body, like they might bite.

I offered to help. He didn’t answer—just smiled, then took the last box into his room and shut the door. I didn’t see him the rest of the day.

Around midnight, I heard him whispering in there. Couldn’t make out the words. It sounded like a prayer, or maybe… a list? He didn’t stop until 3 a.m.

The next morning, I went to make coffee. The kitchen was spotless. My cereal box was in the fridge. My coffee beans had been alphabetized. And there was a note on the counter, in blocky, perfect handwriting:

I replaced your sponge. The old one had too many eyes. I stood there staring at it for a full minute. Then I opened the cupboard. New sponge. Bright yellow.

And on the floor beneath the sink… the old one. Soaked. Covered in black mold I swear wasn’t there the day before. The middle was ripped open. Like it had teeth.

That night, I locked my bedroom door. Around 2:11 a.m., I heard footsteps outside it. Slow. Barefoot. Careful. Then a knock. Not loud. Not aggressive. Just two soft taps.

I didn’t move. Another knock. Three this time. Slightly faster. “Andrew?” I asked. No reply. I checked the peephole. No one there. When I opened the door, the hallway was empty.

But another note was taped to the wall: Don’t answer until the third knock. She gets impatient. I didn’t sleep after that. I confronted him the next day.

He was sitting in the living room, facing the blank TV screen. When I asked what the notes were about, he blinked slowly and said, “You heard her, didn’t you?” “Heard who?” “She doesn’t like being seen too soon. It ruins her.” Then he turned back to the blank TV. Smiling.

I backed into my room and locked the door. That night, I heard him whispering again. Not to himself this time. I could hear the difference. He was answering someone. Listening. Nodding between each line.

I pressed my ear to the wall. His voice came through clearer. “She wants to know your name,” he said. “She wants to wear it.” I stopped sleeping in the apartment after that.

I stayed at a friend’s for a night. No calls, no messages from Andrew. But I got a voicemail. No number. Just “Unknown.” Thirty seconds of breathing. Then whispering. Then, right before it ended—my own voice, saying: “Let me back in.”

I hadn’t said that. I came home the next day, planning to kick him out. Tell him to pack up his four boxes and leave. But the boxes were gone.

All that was left in his room was a circle of salt around the bed. Symbols drawn in the carpet. Charcoal, I think. Or blood. And one last note.

Don’t break the circle. She likes you. She might not stop at your name. I called the police.

They found the room empty. No Andrew. No salt. No symbols. Just an empty room with bare walls and cold air. They asked if I’d been drinking.

That night, the knocking came again. 2:14 a.m. Three soft knocks. I didn’t move. Then I heard a voice, right outside the door. High-pitched. Childlike. Trying too hard to sound friendly.

“I have your name.” It scratched at the wood. “I want to give it back.” I didn’t answer. At 3 a.m. on the dot, it stopped.

The next morning, the hallway wall was covered in fingerprints. Tiny. Like a child’s.
Burned into the paint.

There was another note, slipped under my door. She’s inside now. Don’t let her out. She wears new faces. You won’t recognize them until they smile.

I haven’t seen Andrew since. I don’t think I ever really met him. But I hear the knocking every night. Always at the same time. And always one knock closer.

I’m so tired of being tired.

For years I woke up feeling like my brain had been unplugged overnight. The fog, the dizzy moments, the way words slipped right out of my head… I told myself it was burnout, or depression, or bad habits I could fix if I just tried harder. I made to-do lists, drank more coffee, forced smiles at work, and quietly wondered why everyone else seemed to cope.

Last month a CT scan finally showed severe chronic sinus inflammation. The doctor thinks it has been pressing on my brain for who knows how long, messing with memory, balance, and energy. Suddenly every “lazy” day, every missed deadline, every forgotten sentence has a physical reason. I cried in the parking lot because I felt relief and grief at the same time. Relief that it is real. Grief for the years I spent hating myself.

Tomorrow I have a fifteen-minute call with my doctor to ask for medical leave. HR is supportive, but if this one call goes badly, I stay stuck in half-life mode. I’m so scared I will sound “fine” on the phone and they will say no. I don’t know how many more days my body can run on fumes.

If you have ever finally gotten answers after years of unexplained fatigue, how did you convince doctors and bosses to take it seriously? I could use a little hope.

I remember being in middle school down in South Carolina and the teacher asked us if we knew what an oasis was and I raised my hand and when she called me, I told her it was a “food court.” 🤣
I will never forget the look on her face when that was my answer! 😂

I’m now back in my hometown after many years away and I still vividly remember our malls just as they were back in those days. Any of yall have any photos or footage of them or know where I can find some?

I just went through it all and it was quite a ride, so let me tell you my experience. 

I was terrified of the sedation—both because I am convinced I won’t wake up and because I’m a recovering addict—which is why I put it off. 

Then I was more terrified by what they found, so if sedation is scaring you, I coached myself through it by saying it’s easier than radiation. Dark, but effective.

Turns out, the sedation (propofol) was not a big deal at all. At first, it felt really intense like a weird burst of softly burning pressure. But then, I was awake 20 minutes later… texting, walking around. It was definitely a nap like they say. I had a dream, too. But it wasn’t unpleasant of scary beyond my anxiety.

The prep: I read the instructions a few times and followed them carefully. The suprep was the worst of anything. And getting up early to take it, but it was like going to the airport for an early flight. 

3 days before, I stopped taking Advil. I mostly ate yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu, mashed potatoes, and green jello. Anything pale and soft (like me).

Day before: Just liquids, black coffee, vitamin water, lots of water. I took that day before off work as well as the scope day only because I didn’t want to stress-eat at my horrifically stressful job.

Glad I prepped so well because they found 3 polyps!  Two were 5mm and one was 10mm.

IT WAS THEN THAT I LOST MY MIND.

I was convinced I had colon cancer because it’s what my grandmother died from. Propofol can have delayed psychiatric impact, plus PMS, so I have been struggling.

Just got my pathology results (4 days later even though they said 3 weeks), and everything is negative!

WOOOOOO!!! 

So glad I went through this though because 2 of them were the pre-cancerous type, tubulovillous adenoma.

I hope this helps!

-I’m a coffee drinker (2 cups a day) I eat well and exercise and play a lot of sports. 
-I drink socially but interestingly on nights where I’ve had a lot to drink, I’ve slept the whole night without needing to use the toilet but when I do get up I really need to go.
-saw a GP about my symptoms but they didn’t think nothing of it.

EDIT: I’m 10 days caffeine free but still seeing symptoms. Gonna continue for at least 30 to see if it makes a difference.

Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.\*\*\*Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""""Because...""Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""Chapter 4After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... """"There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.So, no, she could never compete with Janet.Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.And Emma would never be their wife again.Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.""What's this?""Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira.” “I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?"" Tristan paused, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life."" No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said. I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.' So all the love he showed me… was only a lie. What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap. Fine. If that’s the truth—I'd give them all exactly what they wanted. I’m done playing the fool.

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table.

Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still blazing with that primal hunger from full moon.

""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""

""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""

Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.

My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""

He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his co//ck, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.

I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me.

After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.

He kissed me lazily, then gave my butt a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""

I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""

He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.

I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.

Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.

At the dinner table, Tristan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""

Tristan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""

No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.

I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'

So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.

What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.

I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.

The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt

“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”

""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""

Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""

""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""

Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”

“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""

That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.

Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.

Just this morning, Ronan had fu//cked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.

Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.

I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.

All those buried memories came flooding back.

Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.

Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's illegitimate daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.

So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.

That's how my mother drowned.

When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""

I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.

I sued her for murder.

But the next day, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”

He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:

“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”

“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”

“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”

Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.

“NOW.”

A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”

The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.

I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.

“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.

Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

That single sentence sent me plummeting into the abyss.

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.

Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.

They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.

The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.

But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.

My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

That's when Ronan began his relentless pursuit.

Such careful attention, such devoted protection.

I saw him as my salvation and accepted his claim.

After our mating ceremony, the court found Mira innocent.

So I tried to let go, I wanted his pup. I just... wanted us to feel like a real family.”

I never imagined that my salvation was just proof of his love for Mira all along.

Ronan appeared beside me, holding an umbrella over my head.

The moment he saw me, his furrowed brow relaxed slightly, concern flashing in his eyes.

""You disappeared without a word. I was worried sick.""

""And it's getting colder every day. I'm buried in pack business with year-end territory disputes—if you get sick, how am I supposed to take care of you?""

I wasn't surprised he'd found me. He'd installed a tracking app on my phone.

He said he was afraid my depression would make me do something dangerous. He wanted to protect me.

I'd believed him.

But now I knew better. He was probably just making sure I wouldn't go after Mira.

I blinked, my tears already dried up, staring at the snowflakes falling from the sky.

""Old wolves say the Moon Goddess listens closer during the first snow. That's why I came out here.""

First wish: to sever my mate bond with Ronan cleanly.

Second wish: never having to see him again after I left the pack.

Third wish: for mom not to hate me.

Not to hate me for falling in love with the man who protected her killer. For wanting to have his pup.

Ronan draped his jacket over my shoulders, playfully tapping my nose. ""Then you should dress warmer. Look at your hands—they're freezing.""

""What did you pray for?""

I watched him put on his caring act, feeling nothing.

""About us. And about mom.""

Ronan's face went rigid. He studied me carefully.

""Mira is your half-sister, after all. Blood is thicker than water. She was devastated when your mom died too. You're each other's only family. It's been three years now, maybe...""

I knew what he was getting at. ""I know. I won't cause trouble anymore.""

I'd already sued her. Mira wasn't convicted.

I didn't appeal then.

Even if I withdrew the family's forgiveness letter now, it wouldn't change anything.

Ronan relaxed, relief flickering across his face. His mood clearly improved.

""Baby, I'm so glad you can let this go.""

""New year, new start. It'll just be us two now, and we're going to be so happy.""

I just listened in silence.

Ronan took me home.

Rowan was already gone, and Ronan said he had pack business to handle.

I sat there numbly, emotions crashing over me. Until, finally, I took out the bond-breaking deal—and signed my name.

I signed the papers without hesitation and headed straight to his office.

But I found the door half-open, and no one inside.

It was my first time entering Ronan's office—neat, clean.

A photo of Mira sat on his desk.

And scattered drafts at the desk's edge were covered with her name, written over and over.

Every stroke filled with boyish devotion.

I thought I could accept this calmly.

But I couldn't. My heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist, suffocating pain.

On the desk sat an elegant gift box containing a stunning sapphire necklace.

Priceless. Irreplaceable.

I loved sapphires—their cool, proud beauty.

But Ronan always gave me gold jewelry.

He'd say: ""Jewelry should hold its value above all else. Besides, you're beautiful—you look regal in anything.""

I'd believed his sweet words.

Now, holding the sapphire necklace from the box, I saw how beautiful it was. The center sapphire was the size of a quail egg, surrounded by delicate diamonds that sparkled with every movement.

On the back, engraved: ""MH.""

MH. Mira Hale.

My breath caught. I laughed through my tears, finally understanding, then fled his self-made prison of love.

Enough. It was really enough.

I needed to get far away.

I contacted the rogue network, arranged for them to fake my death.

Now I just had to wait for the pack council to retrieve the settlement papers Ronan had hidden for three years.

Ronan didn't come home that night.

The next day, he returned with a smile: ""Lyra, tomorrow is your sister's birthday and New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate together.""

""I already invited Mira to join us for dinner, using your name. You two have been distant too long—it's time to heal this rift. For me, please?""

I looked at Ronan.

He coaxed me gently, his dark eyes full of apparent sincerity and devotion.

Suddenly I remembered that darkest year when he'd looked at me the same way, taking the blade from my hands, saving me from suicide.

""Fine. I'll go.""

He wanted this, so I'd give it to him.

Consider it repayment for all those times he'd saved me during my worst episodes.

New Year's Eve.

Ronan had reserved the entire restaurant.

Mira arrived in a pristine white dress.

Ronan immediately dropped my hand and walked to her.

""Mira, happy birthday. This is my gift to you.""

I recognized the familiar gift box.

The familiar sapphire necklace.

Of course it was for her.

Seeming to remember I was there, Ronan added stiffly: ""Your sister and I picked it out together.""

Mira raised an eyebrow. ""Thank you. I love it.""

After Ronan left for the kitchen to place our order, she immediately dropped her smile and walked toward me.

""Luna Cross still remembers her poor little sister—how sweet!""

""But you do realize your Alpha is just my second choice, right?""

I glanced at her and sat down.

""That all you came here to say?""

Mira looked pissed that I wasn't breaking down, then her smile turned vicious.

""Of course not. You gave me a gift, so I've got one for you too.""

She pulled out a green jade bracelet and threw it on the table like garbage.

The moment I saw what it was, my blood ran cold.

This was the bracelet from my mother's urn.

How did Mira get her hands on it?

I lunged forward and grabbed her arm. ""How did you get that bracelet? Tell me!""

Mira smiled viciously. ""I dug up that bit//ch's ashes, obviously. See how thoughtful I am? I even saved the bracelet for you.""

""Lyra, if your mom hadn't refused to reject my father's bond, my mother never would've wasted away from heartbreak. It's all that bithc's fault—she deserved every second of drowning!""

""But even dead, she doesn't deserve a proper burial. So I scattered her ashes in the pack's waste dump where garbage belongs!""

Rage exploded through me. My vision went red as I wrapped both hands around her throat.

""Mira, you did murder my mother on purpose. I'll kill you!""

Mira struggled, laughing maniacally. ""Got proof I killed anyone? Your ex-mate loves me, your current Alpha loves me. They all think I'm innocent and sweet. They all protect me. What can you do about it?""

Her words only fueled my fury, but years of illness had weakened me. I couldn't choke her, and she shoved me away hard.

""Sister, why do you hate me so much? I know I was wrong—please stop hitting me.""

""Mira, are you okay?"" Ronan rushed over, having heard the commotion. He glared at me with pure anger and slapped me across the face without hesitation, his eyes full of disappointment.

""Lyra, she's your sister and you tried to choke her to death! Have you lost your mind?""

Mira shook her head pitifully.

""Ronan, don't blame my sister. It's all my fault—I'm the one who hurt our mother.""

Ignoring the bu//rning pain in my cheek, I stared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“How did she open my mother's coffin?! You… you sent her, didn’t you?! Only you and I knew where mom's grave was.”

""What are you talking about?"" Ronan looked incredulous. ""Mira just went to pay her respects. How can you think such evil thoughts about your own sister?""

He'd promised to hide his feelings for Mira around me.

But the moment there was any conflict, he showed his true colors.

Yet he still didn't realize it.

I looked at him with trembling hands and suddenly laughed.

""Ronan, since you're so determined to protect her, then keep protecting her. Don't ever change, even if I die tonight.""

""Because I'm afraid you'll regret it for the rest of your life.""

Ronan suddenly looked panicked. He released Mira and tried to calm me down.

""Don't say things like that to scare me—it makes me worry. I'm not protecting her, you just looked terrifying back there. You really wanted to kill her, you know that? Your mother was her savior—she was just paying respects. There's no way she'd desecrate your mother's grave. Stop being so paranoid. It hurts both of you.""

""I'm sorry I hit you. I was impulsive. Go home and rest, take your medication. I'll take Mira to the hospital to get checked out.""

""Once she's fine, I'll come straight home to you, okay?""

With that, he left with Mira.

Mira looked back at me, her lips curved in a mocking smile.

I stared at her, unable to take another step, my hands shaking uncontrollably, unable to breathe.

Overwhelming emotions crashed over me. I collapsed to the floor, completely broken.

I knew this was a panic attack.

My phone rang multiple times, but I didn't have the strength to answer.

After what felt like hours, I finally picked up.

""Miss Hale, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. The settlement documents you requested have been retrieved and sent to your residence. Please check for them.""

""Thank you."" I forced down my suffocating emotions, dragged my broken body up, and left the restaurant.

I deleted all of Ronan's contact information and threw away my old phone.

From now on, there was nothing between us.

On the way home from the hospital after dropping Mira off, Ronan's phone suddenly rang.

He answered, only to hear shocking news.

""Alpha Cross, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. We just recovered the body of a she-wolf near the coast. Found with her were a letter of forgiveness dated three years ago, and a suicide note.”

""The settlement was written by you for Mira Hale. We've also confirmed the suicide note was written by your Luna, Lyra Hale. We need you to come identify the body—""",1,1752642888.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

[Update - Part 3],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0ec6v/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0edic/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

I shook my head slightly, blinking a few times, gathering my composure to respond to her.

“Well, honey… tell her that I said she is very welcome,” I responded, barely holding back tears.

I stood up and walked into the next room, just far enough so that Emma couldn’t see or hear me. I pushed my back against the wall and fell to the floor. The emotions overcame me as I began to cry. I did my best to be quiet as the tears flowed down my cheeks and onto my shirt.

Now that I knew the truth about what I had found, it broke me. It’s all too much for me to handle. That man could’ve been me… and the girl in the wall could’ve been Emma. I sat and cried for what felt like an hour when I was interrupted by a deep voice above me.

“Ahem… John?” they asked.

I quickly scrambled to my feet, wiping my face with my sleeve.

“Yes… Sorry, I was just…”

“It’s ok… I get it.” Detective Lawson replied. “We are finishing up here for the night. We are going to put you and your daughter up in a hotel for a few days so we can sort this out.”

He turned to look at where Emma sat in the kitchen and then turned back to me.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

I nodded back in agreement, even though I knew Emma was fully aware of the situation.

I shook the detective’s hand as he and the investigation team made their way out of the house.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

I came back into the house and started getting things together. I told Emma we were going on a trip, which got her really excited. I packed all of her essentials along with everything I thought we would need for a few days. I grabbed some clothes along with my laptop and threw them in my suitcase. I loaded my old Toyota sedan and secured Emma in her car seat. I climbed in and made the 20-mile journey down to the Twin Pines Hotel off of Route 39 in Macksburg with Detective Lawson following close behind me.

We arrived at the hotel and got checked in for our stay. Detective Lawson took care of the cost for us to stay for three days. I’ve never had a great relationship with law enforcement, but Detective Lawson is the best I’ve ever met.

“You take care of yourself and that girl now, understand?” He said, smiling slightly.

“Yes, sir, I intend to. Please keep me updated.” I responded, trying not to sound as scared and tired as I actually was.

He shook my hand and nodded in agreement before shooting a quick wink at Emma. He retreated to his car and disappeared into the dense fog, headed back into the fray. I got the key and opened up the room, finding places to arrange all of our things. Three days was not a long time… but it wasn’t that short either. I didn’t want to be staying on somebody else's dime for longer than I had to.

I pulled out my laptop and started writing as soon as we got settled in, transcribing everything that had happened to us in the last twenty-four hours.

We arrived about an hour ago, allowing me to gather my thoughts and get everything typed out here. I got Emma tucked in for the night. She didn't seem to have any issues getting to sleep, even in a strange hotel room like this. Now, I'm just sitting here on this decrepit floral print mattress, and the only thing I can think of is that girl in the wall. I know that I did the right thing by calling the police, but something inside me is telling me I shouldn’t have. I don't know... I know that sounds strange. Maybe I’m just tired. Emma has been asleep for a while now… I think I’ll join her.",1,1752642720.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me.

The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

We arrived at the hotel and got checked in for our stay. Detective Lawson took care of the cost for us to stay for three days. I’ve never had a great relationship with law enforcement, but Detective Lawson is the best I’ve ever met.

“You take care of yourself and that girl now, understand?” He said, smiling slightly.

“Yes, sir, I intend to. Please keep me updated.” I responded, trying not to sound as scared and tired as I actually was.

He shook my hand and nodded in agreement before shooting a quick wink at Emma. He retreated to his car and disappeared into the dense fog, headed back into the fray. I got the key and opened up the room, finding places to arrange all of our things. Three days was not a long time… but it wasn’t that short either. I didn’t want to be staying on somebody else's dime for longer than I had to.

I pulled out my laptop and started writing as soon as we got settled in, transcribing everything that had happened to us in the last twenty-four hours.

We arrived about an hour ago, allowing me to gather my thoughts and get everything typed out here. I got Emma tucked in for the night. She didn't seem to have any issues getting to sleep, even in a strange hotel room like this. Now, I'm just sitting here on this decrepit floral print mattress, and the only thing I can think of is that girl in the wall. I know that I did the right thing by calling the police, but something inside me is telling me I shouldn’t have. I don't know... I know that sounds strange. Maybe I’m just tired. Emma has been asleep for a while now… I think I’ll join her.",3,1752642682.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1m142sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m142sd/what_are_the_best_diy_pergola_kits/,What are the best DIY pergola kits?,"After spending countless hours researching and testing different pergola kits, I wanted to share my experience to help others who are looking to enhance their outdoor space.

I recently transformed my boring backyard into an amazing outdoor living area using a DIY pergola kit. The difference is incredible - it's now my favorite spot to relax, entertain guests, and enjoy morning coffee.

Let me break down what I've learned about pergola kits and why they're worth considering:

First, the benefits:
- They're much cheaper than custom-built pergolas
- Installation usually takes just one weekend
- Most kits come with detailed instructions
- No specialized tools required
- Perfect for both beginners and experienced DIYers

I found some excellent options at https://athometouch.com/pergola that offer great value for money. The quality really surprised me - these aren't flimsy structures at all.

Important features to look for:
1. Weather-resistant materials (vinyl or treated wood)
2. Proper sizing for your space
3. UV protection
4. Warranty coverage
5. Clear assembly instructions

Installation tips from my experience:
- Always check local building codes first
- Get a helper - some pieces are heavy
- Prepare the ground properly
- Double-check measurements before drilling
- Take your time with the foundation

My personal recommendation for the best overall value can be found at https://athometouch.com/pergola. They have several styles that work for different budgets and space requirements.

Common sizes I've seen work well:
- 10x10 for small patios
- 12x12 for medium spaces
- 14x16 for larger entertaining areas

Additional features worth considering:
- Retractable canopy for shade
- Built-in lighting options
- Climbing plant support
- Privacy panels
- Rain gutters

Maintenance is pretty simple:
- Regular cleaning
- Annual wood treatment (if wooden)
- Checking for loose bolts
- Clearing debris from the top

Price-wise, expect to spend:
- Basic kits: $500-1000
- Mid-range: $1000-2000
- Premium: $2000-3500

The investment has definitely been worth it for me. My outdoor space gets used way more now, and I've noticed my property value has increased too.

Remember to plan for:
- Proper tools
- Foundation materials
- Time for assembly
- Weather during installation
- Help from a friend

If you're on the fence about getting a pergola kit, I'd say go for it. The transformation it brings to your outdoor space is remarkable, and the DIY satisfaction is pretty awesome too.",1,1752642658.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

[Update - Part 3],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0ec6v/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0edic/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

I shook my head slightly, blinking a few times, gathering my composure to respond to her.

“Well, honey… tell her that I said she is very welcome,” I responded, barely holding back tears.

I stood up and walked into the next room, just far enough so that Emma couldn’t see or hear me. I pushed my back against the wall and fell to the floor. The emotions overcame me as I began to cry. I did my best to be quiet as the tears flowed down my cheeks and onto my shirt.

Now that I knew the truth about what I had found, it broke me. It’s all too much for me to handle. That man could’ve been me… and the girl in the wall could’ve been Emma. I sat and cried for what felt like an hour when I was interrupted by a deep voice above me.

“Ahem… John?” they asked.

I quickly scrambled to my feet, wiping my face with my sleeve.

“Yes… Sorry, I was just…”

“It’s ok… I get it.” Detective Lawson replied. “We are finishing up here for the night. We are going to put you and your daughter up in a hotel for a few days so we can sort this out.”

He turned to look at where Emma sat in the kitchen and then turned back to me.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

I nodded back in agreement, even though I knew Emma was fully aware of the situation.

I shook the detective’s hand as he and the investigation team made their way out of the house.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

I came back into the house and started getting things together. I told Emma we were going on a trip, which got her really excited. I packed all of her essentials along with everything I thought we would need for a few days. I grabbed some clothes along with my laptop and threw them in my suitcase. I loaded my old Toyota sedan and secured Emma in her car seat. I climbed in and made the 20-mile journey down to the Twin Pines Hotel off of Route 39 in Macksburg with Detective Lawson following close behind me.

**I (35F) think my husband (37M) might be cheating on me but my evidence aren't very good. How to deal with it?**



So two weeks ago, I unexpectedly broke my phone when I dropped it. I was without a phone for a few days, and I had to make a calls to family and friends. I take my husband's phone (with his consent, of course). When I was looking for one person in his contacts, I noticed that he had someone signed as "" love"". Honestly, I found this a bit odd, as he's usually the type to refer to everyone by name + where he knows them from. Even I'm not described as ""wife"" but as ""OP's name.""

Despite this, even when my husband changes his phone, he always has the same number and transfers all his stuff, some of his contacts are even from school. So I started wondering if it was some ex-girlfriend he'd forgotten about or something. It bothered me, though, so the next day I approached him and said, ""Hey, when I was using your phone, I noticed one weird contact refered as ""love"" and it's bothering me. Could you explain it to me?"". His answer surprised me a bit because he said ""good that you mentioned it, I was just thinking about calling them. ""

To put it as simply as possible: ""love"" is a pizzeria which we use sometimes. The thing is... I'm 100% sure ""love"" only became a pizzeria after I used his phone. I don't remember the entire number, but I do remember the last two digits. Let's say it was something like ""11."" The pizzeria's number ends with something like ""33.""

I can't stop thinking about it. I have a feeling that because my phone broke unexpectedly, he didn't have time to change ""love"" to something else, but he knew I'd ask, so he switched after I'd finished using his phone. On the other hand, we've been together for 7 years and he's never been secretive, he never hid his phone, and I've never seen anyone signed as ""love"" call him. But ever since this thought popped into my head, I can't stop wondering.

But how do I approach this? Do I have the right to ask him to look through his phone? How can I trust him?

Only an idiot would save a number as “love” or something similar if they were cheating.

changelingcd

This. If there was a random woman's number saved as Pizza Hut, that would be better evidence.



**Update - 2 days later**



Hi, reddit

First, I want to apologize for not responding to my previous post. I wrote it before leaving the house, and I immediately fell asleep when I got home.

Now, today's events:

I decided to take a chance. While my husband was taking a bath, I used his phone. I found two numbers that matched the first one 11, but one of them was his sister's, so that was out. I wrote down the second number on a piece of paper. I quickly put the phone away. But ten minutes later, my husband was still in the bathroom, so I took a chance again and checked his phone again. He and this number exchange two phone numbers every day: when he should be at work and when I'm already asleep (I fall asleep first, my husband goes to bed a little after midnight). They also had a lot of messages, but all of them from my husband boiled down to ""how are you feeling?"" and ""do you need anything?"". No photos.

When it was time for me to go for a running, I took my phone and the number I had written down. I ran to the park, and called there. A woman answered almost immediately. An elderly lady. A truly elderly lady. Not his grandmother or anyone else in the family. But she was the ""love"".

This is where it gets even weirder: I told her I was a friend of (my husband's name). She told me she didn't know who I was talking about, and I could tell from her voice that she wasn't lying. She was genuinely confused. So I said that I was talking about the person she talks and texts with every day. She said, ""Oh, you mean (definitely not my husband's name)?"". I said yes. We had a conversation in which she praised him and called him her ""another soulmate."" and ""true angel"". She also asked me not to tell ""(my husband's) wife"" about our conversation and that he helped her every day and asked me when he can visited her again. I was very confused. I made up a quick excuse and hung up. I got home an hour ago and... I still don't know what to do.

I'm more confused than last time.

*when you get home say ""I called that number and spoke with the woman you text every day. Why does she think your name is x?"" Just ask directly and don't let up until you have an answer.*

**Historical\_Kick\_3294**

*100% this. OP needs to be really direct.*

**ChickenScratchCoffee**

*I hope he isn’t scamming her. That was my first thought with an elderly lady. Because if he was just going there to do good deeds, why wouldn’t he tell you that and why would she say don’t tell his wife? Put the piece of paper with her number on the table and ask him to explain himself. See what he says.*

My\_sloth\_life

Do you think she’s old enough to have dementia and I hate to say it but is he either looking after her or taking advantage of her?

MaddestMissy

If he was looking after her why using a fake name and making it such a secret? My best guess is he is scamming her. Can’t even be „just“ a dodgy hoping for inheritance move since he is using a fake name.

**JHawk444**

*Is it possible the woman he's talking to lives with the elderly woman?*

>OOP: she didn't mention anyone else

**Expression-Little**

*My first thought was that he is scamming an elderly lady who possibly has dementia. Do you have any kind of access to his financial records? Has he made any large purchases recently? Any big vacations?*

>OOP: Yes, no and no

**Taylor5**

*I find this very strange, why can't you just ask him?*

>OOP: Now? I think I'm afraid of the answer. The affair already sounded scary, but this... what if he's really taking advantage of some old woman?

**Taylor5**

*Could be a million and one different things, but like you said the little old lady said to thank him. Could be helping her, could be anything. Dont know unless you ask him. Instead you are coming to reddit and created a conspiracy that we are now all to nosey to let go of lol Mate, I would rather my mrs came to me and asked me honestly what is going on. I have nothing to hide so I would be honest and open. Id give my mrs my phone right away if she asked.*

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0edic/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

I shook my head slightly, blinking a few times, gathering my composure to respond to her.

“Well, honey… tell her that I said she is very welcome,” I responded, barely holding back tears.

I stood up and walked into the next room, just far enough so that Emma couldn’t see or hear me. I pushed my back against the wall and fell to the floor. The emotions overcame me as I began to cry. I did my best to be quiet as the tears flowed down my cheeks and onto my shirt.

Now that I knew the truth about what I had found, it broke me. It’s all too much for me to handle. That man could’ve been me… and the girl in the wall could’ve been Emma. I sat and cried for what felt like an hour when I was interrupted by a deep voice above me.

“Ahem… John?” they asked.

I quickly scrambled to my feet, wiping my face with my sleeve.

“Yes… Sorry, I was just…”

“It’s ok… I get it.” Detective Lawson replied. “We are finishing up here for the night. We are going to put you and your daughter up in a hotel for a few days so we can sort this out.”

He turned to look at where Emma sat in the kitchen and then turned back to me.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

I nodded back in agreement, even though I knew Emma was fully aware of the situation.

I shook the detective’s hand as he and the investigation team made their way out of the house.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

I came back into the house and started getting things together. I told Emma we were going on a trip, which got her really excited. I packed all of her essentials along with everything I thought we would need for a few days. I grabbed some clothes along with my laptop and threw them in my suitcase. I loaded my old Toyota sedan and secured Emma in her car seat. I climbed in and made the 20-mile journey down to the Twin Pines Hotel off of Route 39 in Macksburg with Detective Lawson following close behind me.

We arrived at the hotel and got checked in for our stay. Detective Lawson took care of the cost for us to stay for three days. I’ve never had a great relationship with law enforcement, but Detective Lawson is the best I’ve ever met.

“You take care of yourself and that girl now, understand?” He said, smiling slightly.

“Yes, sir, I intend to. Please keep me updated.” I responded, trying not to sound as scared and tired as I actually was.

He shook my hand and nodded in agreement before shooting a quick wink at Emma. He retreated to his car and disappeared into the dense fog, headed back into the fray. I got the key and opened up the room, finding places to arrange all of our things. Three days was not a long time… but it wasn’t that short either. I didn’t want to be staying on somebody else's dime for longer than I had to.

I pulled out my laptop and started writing as soon as we got settled in, transcribing everything that had happened to us in the last twenty-four hours.

We arrived about an hour ago, allowing me to gather my thoughts and get everything typed out here. I got Emma tucked in for the night. She didn't seem to have any issues getting to sleep, even in a strange hotel room like this. Now, I'm just sitting here on this decrepit floral print mattress, and the only thing I can think of is that girl in the wall. I know that I did the right thing by calling the police, but something inside me is telling me I shouldn’t have. I don't know... I know that sounds strange. Maybe I’m just tired. Emma has been asleep for a while now… I think I’ll join her.",1,1752642596.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

(Rape/ Facesitting/ Foot Fetish)

Takane Lui tapped away at the keyboard on her desk, browsing through the many documents and emails of her work computer. Messages from the managers and interns of Holox painted a clear view on how her business was going, and a few emails from her direct underlings (Hakui Koyori, Kazama Iroha and La+Darkness) had confirmed such reports. Money flowed in and out through spreadsheets- a mixture of donations, merchandise and concert ticket combined to show a clear grasp on how much money was being spent by her adoring fans.

Of course, a not-so-small percentage was automatically sent to her bosses at Hololive- about two hundred yen for every thousand that was earned. A necessary sacrifice- because, just like the interns and managers below Lui and her underlings, she was a slave to the industry.  The expectations of her station weigh upon her shoulders heavily, and the price of failure loomed over her like the reapers scythe.

Failure to meet those expectations was met with a swift removal from Hololives company umbellea. Graduation, the word clung to her heart like a cruel illness, memories of how her peers had disappeared from the limelight. Minato Aqua, Gawr Gura, and.. her underling, *Sakamata Chloe*, gone. Hololive told their fans that they were off pursuing better and greater things.

Only Lui and her peers knew the truth, that those who graduated were gone in the truest sense. Their lives had snuffed out within hours of their termination, each of them having betrayed Hololive in some way. Her hands stopped for a moment, shaking as she remembered unpleasant memories. The pink haired woman swallowed hard, pushing the thought aside and continued to read through the paperwork with a keen eye. She triple checking everything, the legal spreadsheets and the more dubious kind, showcasing the profits earn from extorting protection fees, loans and other misdeeds from the locals within Holox territory.

She had fans to please, a company to serve dutifully and local businesses and families to extort. She had no desire to graduate just yet, so Takane Lui will just have to try her best. She pulled at the collar of her dress shirt as she took a deep breath.

“Yeah, just got to give it my all.”

*Splash*

“Hey, stop, asshole!”

The splash of water echoed across the alleyway. It was followed almost instantly by loud footsteps and angry shouts. A shabbily dressed man, bloodied and his clothes covered in dirt, ran like his life depended on it, a gym bag slung over his shoulder swayed wildly as he moved. A group of three men followed a few metres behind him, each of them panting for air as they tried to catch him… only with each step the dirty man took, they lost ground. Their victim was faster than they were, hastened by fear and adrenaline.

“Fuck, he’s getting away.”

“I know, I know- shut up and keep running. She’ll gut us like fish if we don’t catch him.”

The chased continued like so for a few more minutes, as they ran through backstreets and alleyways. They group of three were losing more gound every second and it looked like the dirty man would be able to get away with his life and the gymbag slung over his shoulder. They no longer had eyes on their target, instead they focused their ears on the sound of his ragged breathes and the splashes of water puddles. The group of three turned to another alleyway, chasing the sound of the man. The alleyway that their target had chosen to run into was blocked by a chain link fence about four metres high. It was a dead end, and the victim didn’t look strong enough to climb it with the heavy bag over his shoulders.

Just beyond the fence, normally, everyday people walked. Some ignoring them, continuing their leisurely walk without issue and others turned towards their direction, before they picked up the pace. The dirty man heard the sound of three panting breathes behind him and turned his eyes down to the entrance of the alleyway. he flinched at the sight of them, pure fear plastered upon his face as he looked at them.

“Nowhere to run now, asshole. Give us the bag and maybe we’ll only beat you half to death.”

It was an obvious lie, and they all knew it. The dirty man shivered at their cruel comments as they walked towards him menacingly. Thinking quickly, he removed the gym bag from his shoulders, as if to drop it to the ground as they had told him to in hopes of mercy, only to suddenly turn around sharply on the balls of his feet and sling the bag into the air with all the strength that his noodle-like arms could give. The bag sailed through the air with the grace of a rock, clearing the sharp wire ends of the fence and landing onto the wet concrete of the street beyond the chain-link fence with a wet thud.

“Fuck!” The group of three ran down the alleyway, but the dirty man was quicker, climbing over the chain-link fence like a monkey climbs a tree. In the time it took the group to reach the fence, the victim had cleared the fence and landed upon the concrete on the other side, trying to stand.

“Grab him, grab the bastard!” One of the three men squeeze a large hand painfully through the chain-link, causing the dirty man to fall back onto his ass as he felt chubby fingers graze the fabric of his soiled hoodie. He scrambled back in fear, hands shakily grabbing the sling of the gym bag. He ran away, disappearing behind a brick wall and into the crowd- gone. The three men stood there, leaning against the chain-link fence as they try to catch their breath. The victim having got away with the bag they had been told to get no matter what.

“Shit, we’re soooo fucked.”

The other two had no other choice words to describe their situation.

Lui nibbled at a cookie, finding quiet enjoyment in the silence of her office. The paperowrk had been finishede only half an hour ago, and she only had a couple hours until her next livestream- where she would spend four or so hours entertaining her fans. Her personal intern had obediently visited the bakery down the street from Holox’s office building to retrieve her favourite cookie- a large double chocloate chip.

“You truly did well. Are you enjoying your reward?”

She looked down towards her bare feet, where the young intern sat upon all fours, supporting her tired feet with the crook of his back and the curve of his shoulder blades. Her swivel chair at been turned to the side, and she rested her head upon an open palm as she praised her loyal servant, her lipstick smudged slightly. His cute face was red, his brown eyes nervously looking from the clean carpet beneath his hands and the black lace panties she had chosen to wear today.

Lui’s leather shorts and brown pantyhose rested upon the desk, discarded when he had entered the room just ten minutes ago with her requested snack. Her red necktie sat upon her shoulder, removed to allow an unobstructed view of her unbuttoned white blouse, revealing the deep ravine of her cleavage and a hint of her black, lacy bra. She gently rubbed circles upon his shoulder blade with the back of her foot, humming as she took another bite of her cookie. She smiled, enjoying the power she held over this young man, her thoughts of graduation and boring paperwork forgotten as she enjoyed this intimate moment with her favourite slave.

*Knock, knock, knock.*

A quiet rapping of knuckles on wood echoed throughout the room. She had expected her three goons to arrive an hour ago, to report about some spy from NijiSanji that had stolen various files, videoideas and new song covers, and of course cash. The loss of various ideas and money wasn’t overly important in the grand scheme of things, Holox was talented enough to come up with other ideas, but the theft was enough to cause a headache if their rival company got their greasy hands on them.  Her slave looked between her and the door, unsure if he should move.

“Stay put- your reward isn’t yet finished. And do stay silent.” She mumbled, moving a foot to caress his dimpled cheek with gentle care, before she used her sole to cover his mouth. “Come on in.” The door opened as she placed her half eaten cookie upon her shorts, and a middle aged man came stumbling in with a clipboard in hand. He was one of HoloX’s many managers, contract to serve them dutifully until his last breath. Her eyes narrowed as she pondered why the group of three she had sent earlier wasn’t in front of her. The middle aged man jumped in fright from her cold expression, sweat dripped from his forehead.

“Where’s Larry, Moe and Curly?”

“… Um.”

“Speak, I don’t have all day.”

“.. They’re in the basement- like you requested Mistress Lui.”

The silence between them clung to the office like a thick, heavy blanket. It was oppressive, but only for the manager. Lui thought back to earlier that morning, where she had gave some order to the receptionists on shift. She had ordered the receptionist that if her three goons had failed in their simple task, that they were to be sent to basement for a rather strict punishment. She hadn’t thought about it since and had quickily forgotten, so sure of their success that she thought their failure wasn’t possible.

“And they’re sedate?”

“Y-yes, Mistress Lui.”

“Hmmm,” whilst her left foot had remained on her slaves face to keep him quiet, her right tapped away upon the crook of his back. How should she deal with this? Takane Lui pondered, before she soft grin widened into a maniac smile.

“Keep them sedated for a little longer. I’ll be there to within an hour.”

“Of course, it shall be done.” The middle-aged man turned on the balls of his feet, quick to leave before her mania was turned to hurt him. he gripped the clipboard in his hands tightly as he reached the open door.

“And do bring my toys to the basement.” The middle aged manager shivered, nodding quickly before he gently closed the office door. Lui turned her blue eyes down to her favourite slave, removing the sole that sealed his lips. As he inhaled air greedily, she gripped the cookie and nibbled on it once more. The manic smile never left Lui’s lips.

‘”Uggg… ahh…. mmh.”

Larry awoke. His mind was a fog, but he remembered the moments before his unconsciousness well. He had walked up to the receptionist with his co-workers, and she had innocently asked whether they had successfully completed their assigned task. She had blonde hair and was very cute, and Lui would find out sooner or later, so he told her about their rather pathetic failure. The next moment, the receptionist nodded to somebody behind him, and then he felt some sort of cloth being placed roughly over his mouth and nose.

Larry tried to move his arms, but he found that they had been bound to a metal table via handcuffs and he was seated upon what looked to be a cheap plastic chair. He could move them a little, but not enough to escape, *and by god, those handcuffs were tight.* His tired eyes looked around the room, trying to figure out where they were. The room was dark, so he couldn’t see much at all- but he could hear a pair of soft snores. His partners, Moe and Curly, were fast asleep on either side of the table, still knocked out by whatever those assholes in HoloX drugged them with. Could the receptionist have been a spy from some rival of Hololive? And if so, what did they want with low level goons like them?

“Fucking… hell.”

He murmured, trying to wake himself up further, but without coffee, the process was slow. He tried to stand, and after stumbling a little, he could do so with no issue.  he couldn’t move very far due to being cuffed to the metal table, *but hey, at least it’s something. Small mercies I guess.* He sat back down and without much else to do, he waited.

And waited.

The sound of a door creaking made his head snap towards the sound. A ray of light entered the room, and middle-aged man peeked his head into the room. he dumped a small plastic box into the room, kicking it further in with the side of his foot. “Ah, seems like one of you is awake. We can’t have that, can we?” He looked a little spooked, and with a shaky hand, the man threw a can into the air. It landed with a metallic thud, and rolled towards the table, stopping right by his feet. Stupefied by the situation, the lowly goon stayed silent as the man quickly closed the door.

*Sssssshhhh*

“H-hey. Get back here!”

Larry found his voice and stood to his feet. The sound of leaking gas reached his ears, and he kicked the cannister away from him. Was the gas lethal? *For all I know, it was.* He screamed, trying to run towards the door in pure fear but his mind was already groggy from the gas, and he tripped over his own feet. His knees hit the ground, and he yelped in pain as his arms hit the edge of the table. He tried to move, but Larry found that he couldn’t, the gas was too much.

“… Fucking… shi…”

Takane Lui dismissed her favourite slave, the young man left her office with a flustered expression and a limp cock. It had been about forty-five minutes since the middle aged manager had left, and after playfully toying with intern before ordering him to cum when she was done dominating him- she found herself incredibly aroused. She tapped at her bare thigh, before deciding that she’ll pay her three goons a visit a little early.

She stood up, quickly moving her pantyhose over her legs and underneath her blouse, before reaching for the leather shorts on her desk. The material clung to her, so she had to be a little forceful with it, jumping up and down to secure the waistband of the leather shorts high around her waist. Maybe next time, she should make her dutiful intern stand by the door whilst she fixed her appearance- the idea was worth considering. She continued with a small breathless sigh, re-buttoning her blouse and fixing her red tie back around her collar.

Lui exited her office for the first time in hours, her heel tapping lightly against the floor. She passed by many interns and managers, of both genders, and they looked away, their body language that of fear and quiet respect. She decided to take the stairs down to the basement, her imagination running wild with what she would do to the three goons who had failed her so completely. Eventually, she stood before a plain wood door with a full mask respirator and a note laying just at her feet.

She bent down and read the note.

*One was awake, so I had to gas them. Wear this.*

The handwriting was impeccable, which was surprising, she would have thought that the middle aged managers handwriting would be shaky. She fixed gas mask to her head, her breath coming out loud and echo- she opened the door and entered. She left the door open, and as she waited for the gas to leave the room, she turned on the light. She had to blink a couple times and wait for her eyes to get adjusted to the light, but when they did, Lui smirked. Two of the good rested upon their plastic chairs, heads slumped upon the metal table, and another laid upon the ground, his arms looked to be painfully grinding against the edge of the table.

“Poor, pitiful Larry,” she mocked as she walked towards the table, stepping over the unconscious Larry. She sat upon the unoccupied chair and leaned back against the chair- waiting for her prey to awaken. Waiting to deliver their punishment.

“Hmm, I can hardly wait.”

“Ugghh.”

“Nggh.”

“Hmmfh.”

Takane Lui sat idly, picking at her nails until all imperfections were removed. She waited until her prey awoke from their forced slumber. She smiled wickedly as her goons groaned, shiftly slightly as the slowly gained consciousness. The gas mask laid upon the metal table, right next to Larry’s cuffed hands. *And speaking of that pitiful goon*…

“Hello\~” She waved her hand slightly, Larry gasped in pain as his senses came back to him,  his arms grinded against the metal edge of the table. He struggled to his feet, and Lui noted that he had a couple inches on her, and whilst she sat, he loomed over her like a giant does to an ant. He was shaking, hissing in air through his dry lips as he tried to ignore the pain in his arms- and she could see the fear in his eyes. “Sorry for taking you chair, but my feet were beginning to ache.”

“… It’s no issue.”  He mumbled, his voice stubborn by his posture submissive. Lui had all the power, whilst he stood there, powerless before her. His co-workers began to awaken, groaning as the effects of the sleeping gas begun to wear. She waited for the grogginess of sleep to disappear from their eyes, she was in no rush.

*I have all night to punish them for their failures.*

“I see that the package I ordered you to retrieve is with the enemy.”

“Mistress Lui, we’re sorry- we’ve tried our bes-”

“Hush now. I have not allowed any of you to speak.” The pink haired woman stood up and walked over to the door. She bent down and fished around, retrieving something long, girthy and made of leather. She waved her hand, making the strap-on wiggle in the air. She took a sadistic pleasure in the looks of horror on each of her lowly manager’s faces as she stepped around the table, leaving Larry for last. “I’ll give each of you your punishment, all you need do is stay silent and take it.” She stood behind Moe, a short but chubby guy, dressed in the business suit that all HoloX managers are required to wear. She fastened the strap-on with practised ease around her crotch and looked down at the man before him. “Bend over, Moe.” He bowed his head and obeyed, like an obedient dog.

She unfastened his belt and pulled down his pants in a hurry. There was no need for foreplay, no need to ease him into the act of rough anal intercourse. All three of her goons had failed, and she wouldn’t be gentle in dishing out their punishment. With both hands, Lui gripped either side of Moe’s waist, groping his bare cheeks. She spread them apart and inserted her leather rod up his anus. She had no lube, but she thought that a dry fucking would only add to his punishment. “Hnngk!” He groaned, his voice a whimper of pain.

“Silence.” She muttered, but her voice echoed across the room, his groans mumbled. In and out. Back and forth. She moved her hips in a rhythm only she knew, slow at first before she picked up the pace. The sound of clapping flesh was an echo that was carried throughout the room, Moe’s hairy ass cheeks jiggled with her each thrust.

“Ungk… hnnhh,,, kkrk.” It annoyed Lui greatly that he wouldn’t remain quiet, but his groans were much more subdued. At the moment, Moe wasn’t a person, but a rapid dog to be tamed, and her leather strap-on was doing a fantastic job at bending him to her will. She slapped his ass hard, causing the skin to redden and the cubby man beneath her to gasp in shock. She leaned forward and took his small cock into her hands, giving him a dry hand job. Up and down, she moved her hand, but when she though that he would cum, she pinched the head of his penis hard.

“Hhhak!” He squealed like a pig.

  “You cannot cum unless I give the order. If you do, I will be less than pleased.” She humped his behind and rubbed his cock simultaneously, and when Moe got too eager, she would dish out the hurt. It was a cruel and unusual punishment, but it worked great to motivate her managers to work their best and provide successful results. Eventually, when Lui grew bored of his gasps and squeals, she picked up the pace of her hand job and eased on the anal intercourse. The man beneath her groaned, not one of pain, but of the desire to release his burden.

“You may cum.”

And he did. His seed squirted from his cock like a water fountain, coating her hand and the floor in equal measure. He gasped in relief, and slackened upon the metal table, thoroughly exhausted. Takane Lui could have continued to rape his anus, fucking him until his bleed from the ass. It wouldn’t have been the first time she had done so, but she felt a little merciful today. She pulled out and wiped her soiled hand upon the cloth of Moe’s suit jacket- but she left the strap-on dirty with his foul liquids. “Your punishment has been served,” she ruffled the chubby manager’s dirty blonde hair with something akin to affection… and turned her blue eyes towards her next prey.

She wasted no time in stripping her next victim of his pants and boxers. Curly was a tall, lanky man with a flat ass, but she humped his chocolate star all the same. He took it well. He groaned quietly underneath his breath and held back his desire to cum excellently whilst he gave him a hand job. Perhaps he had failed her many times before, but that mattered little as of now. he had failed today, so he would wash away that failure by taking her punishment. Lui whispered into his ear, and he came, soiling her hand and the floor around his feet. She turned to Larry, who still stood so tall.

“Nah, fuck this!” He shouted, taking a massive leap back, only stopped from moving to far by his cuffed hands. “This whole failure was their fault. They were the ones who had let that Niji-what’s-his-face get away, god damn it! And you-” His narrowed eyes were pointed right at Lui’s pretty face, crazed and afraid “You psycho bitch! Who the fuck rapes their underlings as a ‘punishment’. You make me fucking sick you twisted cun-”

He wasn’t allowed to finish his crazed rant. Takane Lui took four large steps and was before him, she was short but yet her stern glare made her seem so much taller. Her hand reached upwards and took a clump full of Larry’s red hair. She pulled and then forced his head to make contact with the metal table- *hard*. A dull ‘thang’ echoed, and Larry scream in pain. She pulled his head up, then forced it down. Again, and again. She only stopped her assault once he was fully sedated from the blunt force trauma, his crazed screams turned to sluggish moans of pain.

“You’ve been a very naughty boy… You’ll need a more hands on punishment, Larry.”

She leaned slowly forward, as if to make a show of it to her recently raped victims and unlocked his handcuffs. Without anything to keep him kneeling to the tableside, the lanky man dropped limply to the floor as if he was a puppet with his strings cut. He tried to stand, but with the throttling that his brain had been induced to, he was rather weak and uncoordinated. He weakly raised off the ground only a few inches, before flopping to the ground. It truly was quite pitiful.

Takane Lui watched, a spectator to his misery, as she unbuckled her leather strap-on and throw it to the side. She bent down and unbuckled her combat boots next, as her previous two victims watched with morbid curiosity, and Larry was still trying to stand with all his might. She ignored him for the moment; he wouldn’t be going anywhere any time soon. She placed her boots aside and stood up, swiftly unbuttoning her tight-fitting leather short shorts with practiced ease. She wiggled past her bottom and thighs, down to her ankles and stepped out of them.  With a kick of her feet and a teasing smile, the article of clothing was thrown to the other side of the quiet room. She noticed Moe and Curly’s gaze had abandoned their comrade, as if they had forgotten he existed, and were firmly directed to her crotch. To the sheer, black pantyhose that she wore on the daily and the lacy black underwear that laid beneath. The material of her pantyhose hugged her voluptuous curves wonderfully, and her panties left nothing to the imagination.

Takane Lui knew she was beautiful. Her countless fans of her live streams sang her looks and personality praises, enough that even a saint would develop a big head. However, it was quite kind of affirmation that she gained from her victims. It was the power she held over them, whilst her fans could leave her at any time to follow another idol, her underlings were stuck with her until they breathed their last. It made her feel powerfully, and the idol quite liked the feeling. Her grin turned to a feral smile, and she stepped forward, stopping short of Larry- who was trying to desperately get away from her.

To no avail of course, the idol was quite thorough with her beating.

“Turn over, Larry. I won’t snap your neck beneath my soles if you do so.” Her voice was sickly sweet, but the threat was crystal clear, and the lanky man below her stood still.  Frozen in fear- no, in pure *terror*. A moment or two pasted as time inside the room stood still. She waited, for Lui already knew what he would choose. A chance for mercy was infinitely better than certain death, but it was quite often that two separate roads lead to the same highway.

“Good boy\~” She praised, her white fangs glistened underneath the basement light, as he weakly flopped onto his back. He looked up at her, his brown orbs filled with half-shed tears and *terror*. Takane Lui gave him a slow, small wave of her hand before she stepped over him. Her feet were planted on either side of his chest, and she slowly bent her knees.

“Now, Larry\~ Take a deep breath.”

“MMMMPPPHHHH!!!!!!!!!”

Then she fell. Her rear-end connected with the bottom half of Larry’s face in a frontal facesit and a sickening crunch echoed across the room. Larry struggled weakly, screaming into the ass-cheeks and crotch that covered his nose and mouth. Whilst Lui wasn’t very heavy, she had still fallen onto his face with her full weight and the aid of gravity, and it seemed that his nose hadn’t been strong enough to resist the force of it.

“Ohhh\~ Was that your nose. Did I break. Your. Nose? Poor pitiful, Larry\~” She giggled, and as she laughed, she moved her hips from side to side, and his head followed each movement- and her ass jiggled with each sudden jolt of movement. His hands formed fists and weakly slammed into either her stomach or her thick thighs. However, he was quite low on air and was already weak from his beating, so the pain was minimal. However, she couldn’t let such rude disobedience go unpunished, so she snaked a leg towards her crotch, and pressed *down* with the tip of her toes.

“MMPHH!!!”

“Don’t get cocky, Larry.”

He screamed, and of course, trashed, but the struggle was minimal and Lui rode him like a cowboy would ride a wild horse. Her voice was firm, and she pressed down again, further- as if she was aiming to destroy his balls. He moaned, a pathetic, muffled sound that left her ass cheeks as a quiet whimper. He was almost out of air and would soon lose consciousness. The idol couldn’t have that; he didn’t yet deserve the mercy of rest. So, she lifted her foot from his dick and leaned forward, sliding down just enough to let him weakly breath in through his broken nose.

“Thirty seconds, Larry.” He started to breath in quicker, an awful wheeze that made Lui internally cringe. She counted the seconds, perhaps a bit faster than she should have, and moved backward just a smudge- it was enough to smother him once more. However, this time he only trashed about in discomfort, his hands slapping the ground weakly, or pawing at her thighs, begging for mercy that had been gone ever since he had thrown such nasty words into her face. However, whilst his fate was sealed, that didn’t mean that she had to make it all suffering and no pleasure. The pantyhose clad foot that had punished Larry so brutally for daring to harm his mistress, intruded past the waistband of his suit pants, and slowly drew circles into his wounded penis.

It slowly hardened with her encouragement, going from flaccid to half-mast in only three seconds. She pressed down, not cruelly, but with something akin to affection, as if patting a puppy for bringing back a thrown tennis ball. She continued to move her foot with practiced ease, giving him a satisfying foot job that only the rewarded ever got to experience. However, whilst Larry was gaining pleasure from her foot, he was still being suffocated by her ass. The slapping of the ground and gentle pawing intensified, and her slapped her thighs, begging for air.

“Enjoy your end, Larry. Very few ever get to die do pleasurably\~” He froze for a moment, as if confused by her dreadful words. However, he soon comprehended the weight of them, and weakly gripped either side of her bottom. He pushed, and he pushed- desperately trying to pry her from his face. Desperate to breath in life saving air. Lui reached down with her delicate hands and gripped a wrist with each, dragging them from her ass to her crotch.

“Nice try, Larry. You gave it your best.”  His legs kicked into the air, as if trying to strike her. A quick ‘punishment’ from her foot stopped that well enough, before she went back to giving him a pleasurable foot job. However, every now and then, he would twitch her feet too much, and Lui would need to dish out the hurt. A few minutes passed, and he stopped moving, passing out from the lack of oxygen in his lungs. She kept up the foot job, more out of curiosity than anything. Would he cum whilst unconscious? Or would he die without ever releasing his load. Just as he started to twitch, a minute or two from death, the idol saw his waist jerk and felt something slimy and sticky spurt from the cock beneath her toes. She removed her foot from his suit pants, and sure enough, a thin film of cum dripped from her toes. She looked to Moe and Curly with a frown. 

“Never disrespect me.”

“Y-yes, Mistress Lui!”

“N-never, I’ll never do that!”

They both nodded with fear, and the broken man beneath her went still- now a warm corpse instead of the living being he was a second ago. A lesson to those more fortunate, and a reminder to those who even thought to stand before her.",2,1752642591.0,hitwomanfantasies,0,1.0,False
1m141xl,https://i.redd.it/cnzxzks766df1.jpeg,I got bored on ChatGPT while waiting for AIX to boot. Remember OS airlines humor from the 90s?,"Here is the text output:

AIX Airlines — Enterprise-Class Confusion
You don’t buy a ticket for AIX Airlines. You submit a purchase order, wait 6–8 weeks, and then receive a FedEx envelope with a license key, a 400-page hardcopy boarding manual, and a microcode update floppy.
At the airport, there is no gate. You must first run:

smitty boarding

Then go through 10 nested menus, choose Initialize Flight, confirm twice, and enter your seat number in hex. If it fails, you check:

odmget -q ""name='flight1'"" CuDv

…and still have no idea what’s wrong.

Onboarding
The plane never crashes, but no one knows how to actually get on it. You have to configure your seat using the following command:

chdev -l seat0 -a position=aisle -a recline=TRUE
…but it fails with 0514-040 

Cannot apply change. You check errpt, which logs:

makefile
LABEL: AIRLINE_CONFIG_FAIL
IDENTIFIER: F1234D00

You Google that and end up on an IBM support page from 2003 that says:
“This is working as designed.”

Customer Service
You call IBM support. They ask for your machine serial, entitlement ID, and whether you're current on your AIX SupportLine subscription. Then they say:

“Have you tried removing and recreating the seat object in the ODM?”

Eventually, a Level 3 technician shows up at the terminal—physically—with a Toolbox for Java CD and a ThinkPad running PuTTY.

In-Flight Experience
The plane flies flawlessly, even during turbulence that sends Linux and Windows flights spiraling. The flight attendants wear suits, call you ""Sir/Madam"", and occasionally whisper things like:

“We still run 12 banks in Uruguay on this exact version.”

There’s no inflight entertainment unless you compile xeyes from source. You want coffee? 

Run:
smitty.beverages

…then select:
""Brew Coffee → Medium Roast → Output to Seat Tray""
…but the coffee doesn’t arrive because rc.coffee wasn’t linked in /etc/inittab.

Landing
Smooth and reliable. The wheels touch down like clockwork. But instead of exiting the plane, you must perform a graceful shutdown:

shutdown -Fh now

…or the ODM gets corrupted, and you can’t board next time without booting from the mksysb backup tape.

Summary
AIX Airlines doesn’t advertise. It just silently flies entire Fortune 500 companies through financial storms, Y2K, leap seconds, and ransomware attacks—without ever needing a reboot……but you’ll spend half your time trying to remember how to exit smit without breaking something.",0,1752642577.0,Sysadminhumor,0,0.5,False

[Update - Part 3],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0ec6v/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0edic/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

I shook my head slightly, blinking a few times, gathering my composure to respond to her.

“Well, honey… tell her that I said she is very welcome,” I responded, barely holding back tears.

I stood up and walked into the next room, just far enough so that Emma couldn’t see or hear me. I pushed my back against the wall and fell to the floor. The emotions overcame me as I began to cry. I did my best to be quiet as the tears flowed down my cheeks and onto my shirt.

Now that I knew the truth about what I had found, it broke me. It’s all too much for me to handle. That man could’ve been me… and the girl in the wall could’ve been Emma. I sat and cried for what felt like an hour when I was interrupted by a deep voice above me.

“Ahem… John?” they asked.

I quickly scrambled to my feet, wiping my face with my sleeve.

“Yes… Sorry, I was just…”

“It’s ok… I get it.” Detective Lawson replied. “We are finishing up here for the night. We are going to put you and your daughter up in a hotel for a few days so we can sort this out.”

He turned to look at where Emma sat in the kitchen and then turned back to me.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

I nodded back in agreement, even though I knew Emma was fully aware of the situation.

I shook the detective’s hand as he and the investigation team made their way out of the house.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

I came back into the house and started getting things together. I told Emma we were going on a trip, which got her really excited. I packed all of her essentials along with everything I thought we would need for a few days. I grabbed some clothes along with my laptop and threw them in my suitcase. I loaded my old Toyota sedan and secured Emma in her car seat. I climbed in and made the 20-mile journey down to the Twin Pines Hotel off of Route 39 in Macksburg with Detective Lawson following close behind me.

We arrived at the hotel and got checked in for our stay. Detective Lawson took care of the cost for us to stay for three days. I’ve never had a great relationship with law enforcement, but Detective Lawson is the best I’ve ever met.

“You take care of yourself and that girl now, understand?” He said, smiling slightly.

“Yes, sir, I intend to. Please keep me updated.” I responded, trying not to sound as scared and tired as I actually was.

He shook my hand and nodded in agreement before shooting a quick wink at Emma. He retreated to his car and disappeared into the dense fog, headed back into the fray. I got the key and opened up the room, finding places to arrange all of our things. Three days was not a long time… but it wasn’t that short either. I didn’t want to be staying on somebody else's dime for longer than I had to.

I pulled out my laptop and started writing as soon as we got settled in, transcribing everything that had happened to us in the last twenty-four hours.

Now, I'm just sitting here on this decrepit floral print mattress, and the only thing I can think of is that girl in the wall.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0edic/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

As part of Juro, every member of the Jamat present was given a Tasbih, an Abe Safa, and dry fruit

Hazar Imam said “My beloved father’s shoes are too big for me to fit, I am still learning “

""All the protocols that I signed yesterday are the work of many years of my beloved father, this is his legacy who worked very hard for his Jamat”

Prince Irfan said “I am not allowed much screen time and also not allowed many games but I do like to play Lego”

A girl named Khadija from Northern Pakistan now living in Switzerland wrote on a leaf “I love you Mawla Bapa and want to hug you “

When she met Mawlana Hazar Imam she asked “Mawla Bapa can I kiss you” and Hazar Imam said “Sure you are too sweet “Then she kissed Hazar Imam’s hand.

Hazar Imam said to young murids “Read books, don’t spend too much time on screen, I am telling my kids to do the same, read books and not too much time on screen”

Murids who have been living in isolated areas of  Europe and who are married in multi-faith marriages asked Hazar Imam what faith their children should follow. Hazar Imam said that any faith as long as they understand and follow the ethics then when they grow up they will decide their faith.
Multi-faith family session and Sunday afternoon 

On Sunday morning we headed back to Porte de Versailles and went to Pavillon 6 where we were told to take the elevator up to the green house - “La Serre” in French. 

We and a few others had some issues with our badges but finally that was resolved. Phones were locked into Phone lockers. 

“La Serre” is a beautiful space with a roof top garden, an out door patio area and an indoor area filled with plants and under a sun roof.
The patio had a bar area offering juice, water, coffee and good chai. And to eat there were fruits, pastries and cookies. 

We circulated around after having some chai and started to meet some other multi faith couples from all over France and also from Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. 

Around 11.30 am they asked everyone to come into the indoor area where there were cocktail tables set up and a small stage area. A woman named Sabrina spoke between French and English and stated that Hazar Imam would be arriving soon and what to expect: 

- In the room 200 multi faith couples (400 adults and a few babies) - 100 couples from Ile de France - Paris and surrounding - 50ish couples from other parts of France and 50ish couples from Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Ivory Coast 
- That the Ismaili spouse should refer to Hazar Imam as such and that non Ismaili spouse should refer to Hazar Imam as His Highness 
- That Hazar Imam would like to circulate amongst the crowd rather than speak to everyone together. Thus to place ourselves around the 10 cocktail tables in groups of approximately 20 persons. 
- That Hazar Imam would be coming from the morning Didar session with the Jamats from Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Ivory Coast, and the subsequent second youth Mulaqat. That he would spend 20 minutes to 30 minutes circulating. 

We arranged ourselves around the tables which were in a long U shape down the narrow but long room.

Mowlana Hazar Imam entered with Princes Irfan and Sinan. He and they began circulating while talking to about 2-4 people per grouping. 

The princes went ahead; Prince Irfan is fluent in French and English - easily switching between the two languages as he interacted with many adults in a bold and bright manner. His little brother Prince Sinan trailed behind much quieter but very observant. 

Michel had the chance to interact with the Princes and with Prince Irfan 2 times - they had a small discussion about the tree mural that he really liked, Michel later asked him how he was doing. The Princes again went ahead. 

When Mowlana Hazar Imam reached our group, he shook the hands of approximately 2 people and talked to 2 people who asked more intimate questions about interfaith family dynamics in JK such as - if for example I have a baby that is under 2 years and half way through a longer Khane session I need to relieve my wife - but I can’t go into the Khane to get the baby - what am I supposed to do? - apparently that was a question that was asked numerous times and a question that Mowlana Hazar Imam will further address in the future. He did state that he’s thinking about things like that and although places like France are more open it would be hard to introduce in Pakistan for example. 

When Mowlana Hazar Imam was discussing with the next group, the princes came to hurry Mowlana Hazar Imam along as he had promised to be done in 20 minutes but had gone over. They pulled at his vest as most kids do with their parents. 

In all Mowlana Hazar Imam spent approximately an hour with the multi faith families. 

As an aside - We had gone to get more water after Mowlana Hazar Imam was done speaking to our group and upon reentering the room we saw Prince Irfan approaching a snack table to get sweets - some on asked something like no one fed you anything and Michel was like it’s ok - take them (referring to the sweets) - he smiled largely stated he looooved sweets and proceeded to stuff his inner coat pockets with boiled sweets 😂 and then took an apple also - it was lovely to see the lighter side of the Princes. 

Organisation wise it was great to see everything that got done within less than a month, everyone was a bit stressed but overall everything went smoothly except for minor problems (example - for us it was waiting 1h in the heat to get the pass or 40 min blocked at the entrance because they didn’t have an updated list)

After that session Michel and I stood and talked with a few more people and then headed to Pavillon 1 for lunch - mini rotli with carrot pickle and raita which was very nice - and vegetarian biryani with lentils (I didn’t eat that due to allergies, but Michel said it was delicious) 

After lunch there was a musical program with some preformed dances and then an Afghani DJ with very upbeat tunes followed by more rasera style music. Many people were wearing traditional dress from Syria, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and then the Koja population in lenghas and sari. Everyone was happily dancing or clapping along. And then they opened the area near the lounge for Mowlana Hazar Imam so that people could come see the tree mural. There was also a mendhi station and thasbih making station for the children. 

As they did not wish the flowers to go to waste - members of the Jamats were welcomed to take them home and some went to the council offices as well.

We met through a mutual friend and spent 3 days together 3 weeks ago(we live in different countries). I had told him I loved jazz, bossa nova, and classical music. He is very introverted and a little.. timid? 

He recommended a bossa nova song in Italian, saying “This is bossa nova and in Italian, this singer also has a version of garota de ipanema :p” (we listened “garota de ipanema” together weeks ago idk how he remembered it)

I looked the lyrics up and they were soo sentimental and romantic. He is not native in Italian, but told me he minored it at college.

*You told me, “Come up to my place”
Winter is warm at my place
Don’t you feel how cold it is
In this city of ours?
So why don’t you come up to my place
It’ll just be you and me
I can offer you a coffee
After all, what harm is there?*

*But what did you put in the coffee
That I drank at your place?
There’s something different
Now inside of me
If there’s poison, then I’ll die
But it’ll be sweet, next to you
Because the love that wasn’t there
Is here now*

*I don’t even know what day it is
But every day, I’ll be with you
It’s become a habit now
One I don’t know how to lose, you know*

*This morning, love, thinking of you
The first flower told me that
Winter is now going away
But you, stay with me*

He recommended other 2 songs as well, but they weren’t as romantic and more related to the cultures of his country. He said he was curious about my opions on the two songs as well. He said things like “I think we walked past a statue of this singer lmk if you like it or not 🤓”

He seems to remember everything I said even after 3 weeks… and the lyrics are just too romantic. Am I reading too much into it? ",1,1752642431.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,1.0,False

[Update - Part 3],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/user/TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0ec6v/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’ve been trying to figure out the right way to say this… to explain what I did. I found something. This is going to sound insane, but I believe there is a body inside the rear wall of my daughter’s closet… and I’m starting to think this “Mr. Long” character is the one responsible for it.

It started this morning when I decided to investigate the closet. I didn’t think I could write anything worth a damn today, even if I wanted to, so I took the day off and kept Emma occupied with cartoons. I needed time to find out more. I used it to do a little digging into the wall. I grabbed a hammer from the garage and went to work. The stench was awful. I had to wear a nose plug the entire time, so I didn’t puke. I had pulled a good chunk of the wall apart when I noticed something white and smooth, tucked between two studs in the closet. I peeled the drywall away, pushing my finger into the cavity. It was long and round with what felt like a ball at the end of it.

Realizing what it was that I was feeling, I jumped back, dropping the hammer to the floor. Again, my mind would not let me comprehend what I was seeing. I tried telling myself that it was something else… but I had just uncovered a human bone inside my daughter’s closet. I didn’t push any further. I grabbed the chunk of drywall and pressed it back into the hole, covering the gruesome find. The only thing I could think of doing was to ask Emma about this “girl in the wall” she had been talking about. I know she’s just a kid… but sadly, she knows more about this than I do.

She was coloring at the table as I walked into the kitchen. I sat down next to her, fearing the task in front of me. I asked a question that I never thought I would have to ask my daughter.

“Hey, Emma… this girl in the wall you were talking about. What’s her name?”

She stopped coloring, staring blankly at the paper… like she was looking through it.

“She doesn’t remember.” She said, almost tearing up. “That’s why she’s sad. She wants a friend.”

I leaned in and put my arm around her, trying my best not to press her too hard.

“Did she tell you that?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Mr. Long told me. He says she wants me to be there with her.”

“What does that mean, baby?” I asked, my voice filling with concern.

With that question, she finally looked up at me. Her eyes filled with tears as she answered.

“She used to live here… but her daddy didn’t love her.” She said with tears dripping down her cheeks. “So, Mr. Long took her away to stay with him.”

She looked back at the paper, sniffling and wiping her face with her sleeve.

“You love me… don’t you, daddy?” She asked. “You won’t make Mr. Long take me, will you?”

I was shocked. Every synapse in my brain was firing in protection mode. The fact that she asked me that question made me feel like I had failed as a father. I couldn’t stand the idea that she even remotely felt like I didn’t love her.

“Of course I do, sweetheart!” I said in a calming, yet firm tone. “You know I love you, and I would never send you away. Don’t think about that anymore, baby.”

I pulled her toward me, wrapping my arms around her as she bawled against my chest. I don’t know what it is about the way kids say things, but their words are always so eerie. The calmness in Emma’s voice and how she spoke unnerved me... filling me with fear and dread like I’ve never felt before.

Later, after I put Emma down for a nap, I opened the closet door to investigate further. I pulled everything out of it… clothes, shoes… all of it. I stepped inside and pressed my ear to the drywall… right above the spot I had opened up with the hammer. I could hear the faint sound of water flowing through the pipes in the wall, but nothing unusual. Not knowing what else to do, I tried knocking. I guess I foolishly thought that someone would respond. It wouldn’t be the creepiest thing I’d heard if they had.

I paused for a moment and knocked again… but this time in a pattern. I didn’t plan it, but my fist involuntarily rapped against the wall in a strange rhythm.

Knock, knock… Knock… Knock… Knock, Knock.

My hand rested against the wall when suddenly I felt a vibration flow through the wooden studs and into my fist. It was the same knock… this time, coming from the other side. I stumbled back, almost tipping the lamp over. My heart thudded in my chest, causing a wave of nausea to wash over me. The putrid odor of the closet, followed by the phantom knocks, sent me into a sickening spiral of fear and confusion.

I ran to the garage and grabbed a sledgehammer. I needed to unveil whatever was inside that wall. I stomped back into the bedroom, angrily throwing the sledgehammer above my head… prepared to bring it down violently. As the hammer reached its apex, a female child’s voice swirled inside my head... distorted and raspy.

""Don't do it, Daddy.” It whispered, pleading with me.

I stalled for a moment, but the voice didn’t deter me. I brought the hammer down against the wall with a loud crash, sending dust and splintered wood flying into the air.

Piece by piece, I peeled the wall away. The first few fell away easily, breaking into old paint and chalk dust. Yet, as I pushed further, it became tougher… like something behind it didn’t want to be found. I kept pushing through until the rest had been cleared. After an hour, I had fully uncovered the hole that I had previously broken apart, plus another three-foot area around it. To my horror, what I had found inside the wall from before was definitely a bone. By the looks of it, it was an arm bone from a very small person. I continued, uncovering more pieces of bone until I had unveiled a full human skeleton of what looked to be a child.

Everything inside me screamed to stop and call the cops, but for some reason, I couldn’t. It was like something had taken hold of me… commanding me to push further. The hammer slammed into the wall again and again, simulating the battle going on inside my mind. One side of me was screaming, “Stop now! Call the cops!” while the other side screamed, “Keep digging! Don’t stop!” I involuntarily swung the hammer, knocking more pieces away until I had uncovered not only the child’s body but also a small hole next to it. The hammer buried itself into the wall, finally relinquishing its control over me. I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, breathing heavily.

I lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling, trying to catch my breath. The voice in my head had gone silent. All I could hear now was the thundering beat of my heart in my ears. I gathered my thoughts and pulled myself upright, now sitting facing the closet. I studied the macabre scene, scanning every detail. The child’s skeleton was in a fetal position, as if they had been pressed into the wall with force. I noticed that the lower leg bones were fractured in several places… as if they had been broken previously when this child was alive. The fragments from the leg bones filled the space between the studs, covering the floor and mixing in with the dust and debris. Next to them, in the hole I had uncovered, lay a small stuffed rabbit with the words “Mr. Long” scribbled across its stomach in black ink.

I pulled myself to my feet and shuffled closer, fearful of what I had just found. I could see deep scratches on the floorboards under the stuffed rabbit. As I reached down to move it aside, a nail rolled out from beneath it, coming to rest in a groove one of the scratches had formed. Following the lines, the scratch oddly looked like an H. Looking closer, I could see that more scratches met this one. Standing upright, I had revealed the hidden message. There, on the floor, were words scrawled into the wood in jagged, misshapen letters that read “HELP ME.”

I felt a strong sadness grip me. It felt like I was reliving the day that my wife died… with no understanding as to why. I sat back on my heels, staring at the crude carvings, when I heard a soft voice rise from behind me.

“Daddy? What are you doing?”

My eyes widened, and fear shot through my chest as I jerked my head around to look at the door. There Emma stood, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I jumped up, swirling on my feet, and scrambled to the door. I pulled her into my arms, trying to shield her eyes from the closet.

“Nothing, honey.” I lied. “Everything is fine.”

I felt like scum of the fucking earth lying to my daughter like that, but I had to for her protection… for her innocence.

I picked her up in my arms and carried her back into the living room, but not without question.

“Daddy, why were you in my closet?” She asked. “And why are you covered in white dust?”

I didn’t answer at first… not until she asked the next question.

“Were you trying to kill Mr. Long?”

I smiled at her, knowing in my mind that she was a lot more observant than I gave her credit for. She knew what I was doing, if only just an inkling of it. I sat her on the couch and slumped down next to her. I tried to gather my words, knowing I needed to figure out how to say this correctly and in a way she would understand.

“Well, sweetheart, I was in your closet because Mr. Long asked me to help him with your friend in the wall,” I told her, searching her eyes for acceptance. “So, that’s what I did.”

As soon as I heard the words come out of my mouth, I knew she wouldn’t believe them. I was going to have to tell her the truth, one way or another. The fact that I was talking to my daughter about a “girl in the wall” was crazy enough… but the idea that there was a real human skeleton inside the wall of her closet was even crazier.

Emma and I talked for about an hour about why I had done what I did. She seemed to accept the fact that it was because I was trying to help her friends, so she let it go for the time being. I called the cops once she settled down for the evening. I know I should’ve called them a lot sooner… but I just… couldn’t for some reason.

A detective came by around 6 pm this evening to ask me a few questions. His name was Detective Lawson. He was polite but visibly tired, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a notepad in the other. He looked like the type of man who didn’t scare too easily. I told him about the voices I heard and about this “Mr. Long” character. It wasn’t until I mentioned the girl in the wall that his face turned from tired and angry to concerned and intrigued. I showed him the wall with all its gruesome contents. I could tell by his demeanor that this wasn’t his first encounter with something like this. We talked about Emma’s imaginary friends and how it all led to this as we waited for his team. He didn’t laugh at me, nor did he question my sanity... which I had fully expected him to. He just nodded and took photos, being careful to capture every inch of the scene.

The rest of the crime scene unit showed up about ten minutes later, cordoning off Emma’s room. I held and comforted her the entire time as they brought in their equipment. Detective Lawson nudged me and gestured with his head toward the kitchen. I knew he had a lot of questions. I sat Emma down at the kitchen table and walked over to the countertop to meet him.

“You bought this place about four years ago, correct?” he asked, glancing around the room.

“Yeah,” I answered. “After my wife passed.”

He scribbled something down on his notepad, making sure not to reveal it to me. He furrowed his brow and looked up.

“Did you ever meet the previous family?” He asked. “And does the name Lucy mean anything to you?”

I had only lived in Oregon for four years. My wife and I moved here to get away from the city, but we never really got that close to anybody before she died… definitely not any Lucy that I could remember.

“No,” I answered. “Should I have?”

He flipped his notepad shut and pursed his lips like he was about to deliver bad news.

“Well, they lived in this house about ten years ago.” He said, his face curling into something more somber. “Single dad and his daughter… just like you… The girl went missing in 2017, about two years after they moved in.”

He removed his hat, placing it down on the counter. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows down, taking the weight off his feet.

“There were no signs of forced entry… no leads. The case went cold.” He said, staring blankly into the refrigerator door. “The father disappeared about a month later at the peak of the search.”

Those words sent a waterfall of adrenaline coursing through my veins. It felt like electricity was flowing through my body. I leaned against the counter next to the detective, who now looked more tired than before.

“So, they think he… Is that girl in…?” I asked, tripping over my words, trying not to say what I was actually thinking with Emma still nearby.

Lawson shrugged, shaking his head as he looked back up at me.

“Don’t know.” He answered. “He ran off. We’ve been looking for him ever since. And as for your other question, testing will tell for sure, but I can pretty firmly say yes at this point.”

His words felt like weights that hung on my shoulders. I didn’t want this… any of this. I just wanted a nice life for me and my daughter, and now I am caught up in a murder investigation.

I stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the distant chatter of the investigators bumping and banging around in Emma’s closet. Detective Lawson stood up straight, putting his hat back on and straightening it.

“Your daughter might be seeing things she doesn’t understand, but that doesn’t mean that there’s nothing there.” He said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Kids are sensitive… they can see things that we can’t sometimes.”

He patted me on the shoulder and then walked toward the bedroom to help the other investigators.

I was stunned. I had lived in this house for over four years and never once had an inclination or thought that there may have been something terrible hidden in the walls. Come to think of it, I guess that’s why I was able to afford it, honestly. I looked over at Emma, who was coloring at the kitchen table. She was swinging her legs and humming as she scribbled on the pages, as if in her own little world. I walked over to her and knelt at her level.

“You ok, honey?” I asked, trying to gauge how she truly felt.

She stopped coloring and looked up at me.

“I’m ok, daddy.” She said with a smile. “She wants me to tell you that she’s happy you found her. She didn’t like playing with Mr. Long anymore.”

My mouth fell open in shock. I must’ve looked like a moron in front of Emma. She kept smiling at me like I was supposed to be happy about it… But all I felt was confusion and a curling sadness in my soul. She smiled and continued coloring… nodding and humming like nothing had happened.

I shook my head slightly, blinking a few times, gathering my composure to respond to her.

“Well, honey… tell her that I said she is very welcome,” I responded, barely holding back tears.

I stood up and walked into the next room, just far enough so that Emma couldn’t see or hear me. I pushed my back against the wall and fell to the floor. The emotions overcame me as I began to cry. I did my best to be quiet as the tears flowed down my cheeks and onto my shirt.

Now that I knew the truth about what I had found, it broke me. It’s all too much for me to handle. That man could’ve been me… and the girl in the wall could’ve been Emma. I sat and cried for what felt like an hour when I was interrupted by a deep voice above me.

“Ahem… John?” they asked.

I quickly scrambled to my feet, wiping my face with my sleeve.

“Yes… Sorry, I was just…”

“It’s ok… I get it.” Detective Lawson replied. “We are finishing up here for the night. We are going to put you and your daughter up in a hotel for a few days so we can sort this out.”

He turned to look at where Emma sat in the kitchen and then turned back to me.

“John, that little girl is going to need you right now.” He said firmly. “I know this is hard, but you need to be there for her… I know you know that.”

I nodded back in agreement, even though I knew Emma was fully aware of the situation.

I shook the detective’s hand as he and the investigation team made their way out of the house.

“I’ll wait for you to get packed. Take your time.” He said as he turned and made his way toward his car.

I came back into the house and started getting things together. I told Emma we were going on a trip, which got her really excited. I packed all of her essentials along with everything I thought we would need for a few days. I grabbed some clothes along with my laptop and threw them in my suitcase. I loaded my old Toyota sedan and secured Emma in her car seat. I climbed in and made the 20-mile journey down to the Twin Pines Hotel off of Route 39 in Macksburg with Detective Lawson following close behind me.

We arrived at the hotel and got checked in for our stay. Detective Lawson took care of the cost for us to stay for three days. I’ve never had a great relationship with law enforcement, but Detective Lawson is the best I’ve ever met.

“You take care of yourself and that girl now, understand?” He said, smiling slightly.

“Yes, sir, I intend to. Please keep me updated.” I responded, trying not to sound as scared and tired as I actually was.

He shook my hand and nodded in agreement before shooting a quick wink at Emma. He retreated to his car and disappeared into the dense fog, headed back into the fray. I got the key and opened up the room, finding places to arrange all of our things. Three days was not a long time… but it wasn’t that short either. I didn’t want to be staying on somebody else's dime for longer than I had to.

I pulled out my laptop and started writing as soon as we got settled in, transcribing everything that had happened to us in the last twenty-four hours.

We arrived about an hour ago, allowing me to gather my thoughts and get everything typed out here. I got Emma tucked in for the night. She didn't seem to have any issues getting to sleep, even in a strange hotel room like this. Now, I'm just sitting here on this decrepit floral print mattress, and the only thing I can think of is that girl in the wall. I know that I did the right thing by calling the police, but something inside me is telling me I shouldn’t have. I don't know... I know that sounds strange. Maybe I’m just tired.

	•	Must-visit spots, especially for  food, coffee and thrift store. I heard that in some convenience stores and cheap places, you can actually eat really well, I’d love to know which ones!
	•	Budget tricks, I’m hoping to keep it around $1,000/week, but I can stretch it if necessary

We won’t be hiking Mount Fuji, as the trails are closed during that time, but I’m thinking of spending a night by Lake Kawaguchi instead to enjoy the view.

Also:
	•	Is it true that getting the JR Pass (bullet train subscription) is the best move for long-distance travel?
	•	What apps do you recommend to make my life easier over there (transport, reservation, navigation, etc.)?
	•	what is one personal must-do that you would suggest something that really stayed with you, that made your trip unforgettable?

I (25F) have my own two bedroom apartment that used to belong to my Uncle.

I made a friend during my Uni years I'll call Mary (27F). Mary had quite a hard home life - too long to detail here. I let her know that if she ever needed my help, she could always rely on me no matter what.

When we graduated I asked her to move in with me rent free, she tried to pay but I knew she had a lot of debt trying to pay for Uni so I told her no and to spend her money freeing herself from it. She was so thankful for this, and I loved having her live with me. When never fought about anything, both of us have the same cleaning habits and TV interests so there's never any arguments over the remote or who has to take out the bins, etc.

Tonight we were out at a super fancy restaurant in London as Mary had finally paid off the last of her debt, secured herself an amazing promotion at her job, and also finally passed her driving test. All these achievements in the same month were more than deserving of an award, so we splashed out. It was me, Mary, four of her work friends, and two friends we've known since Uni.

It was a great night, until I handed Mary a card saying amazing she is and how lucky I am to have her as my best friend, with quite a bit of cash inside to put towards her first car. She started crying and thanking me and we hugged for a long time. When she pulled away I told her I was so proud of her for kicking life in the butt, becoming successful, and showing her dad that his dickhead ways couldn't keep her down. After how she'd struggled through Uni, pushing pennies together, and working shit jobs, seeing her in her dream career and being such an accomplished woman is absolutely inspiring to me.

She looked mad and said ""please don't do that, you know I don't like it when you do that."" She'd never said anything like this to me - ever, so I have no idea where this was coming from. I apologised and said that I didn't realise saying these things would upset her as it's never been my intention. She just scoffed and rolled her eyes, and when I looked up at her colleagues they were all shaking their heads at me and glaring. I felt so awkward I wanted to shrink back into my own skin, and I was mortified that I hurt Mary.

Mary didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and ignored me at the table. When we split up to head home, none of her colleagues even looked at me as they left.

I said sorry to Mary as she was heading to her room to turn in but she just shrugged me off, told me she was tired and that we'll talk in the morning. I'm so anxious that she'll want to move out or never talk to me again. I keep going over every interaction in my head to see if a crossed a line in the past but she never gave any indication that I upset her saying these things before. All her colleagues messaged me saying I was an asshole for saying those things to her and 'belittling' her but I never ever meant any of those things like that.

I didn’t know how to update anything as I’ve never posted before, so when things happened, I wrote them down in notepad to update later, but all this stuff happened in the space of ONE DAY. I’m posting them all below because I didn’t get the chance to write them up after everything happened as my post didn’t have a judgement yet. I saw a lot of mixed reactions to my post, but there was also some great advice in there about how to approach Mary, so thank-you for that. I’m afraid all that well-meaning advice turned out to be for nothing so I’m sorry about that. Things are time stamped roughly to show how the day unfolded.

​

**UPDATE 1 [6:30am]:** So I’m even more confused than ever right now. After staying up all night and being constantly on the verge of tears, I finally heard my roommate moving around the kitchen, so I went to talk to her. She acted totally normal and started talking to me about some drama at her work while I just stood there kind of unsure what was happening or what to do. So I apologised again.

She looked up at me in confusion and said ‘why are you sorry?’ I reminded her of last night and how mad she was. Then she laughed and said ‘it doesn’t matter, don’t worry about it’ and then continued making breakfast. I asked if I’d stepped over a line last night, if the money was too much and if I made her feel inferior and she said ‘nope. We’re cool. It doesn’t matter, I think everyone just misunderstood the situation and you’re taking things to heart a little too much.’

I just am even more confused than ever. I told her about her friends texting me, telling me that what I said was belittling and that I was an asshole and she just shrugged and said they probably misread things and she’ll talk to them.

But I’m just so winded. I’m so tired because I haven’t slept because I thought she hated me, that I’d hurt her and she’d never speak to me again, but she’s fine? Like she’s completely normal and just chatting with me as if last night never happened but I’m just so confused?????? After seeing so many YTA comments I thought I’d really crossed a line this time, but she’s not phased at all?

She seemed to upset, ignored me for the rest of the night and her co-workers treated me like a criminal but everything’s okay I guess? I don’t know anymore. I’m tired and I’m going to sleep but things still seem unresolved to me. I’m going to talk to her about it when she comes back from work today because her reaction still really bothers me.

​

**UPDATE 2 [10am]:** I got a call from one of the Uni friends who was at the dinner last night and we had a chat. She asked me if everything was okay between me and Mary as she said she’d never seen Mary snap at me like that until last night. I filled her in on everything that we’d talked about and how confused I was as well. She reaffirmed many of my feelings about this being very out of character for Mary as she had also congratulated Mary and said similar things, as well as given her a bit of money in a card, along with an expensive gift, as did many of the others. After talking to my friend, I’ve decided that I need to have a long sit down with Mary to clear things up and it’s not only me who’s confused by her behaviour. Both the Uni friends are coming round later to have a chat since now we’re honestly quite concerned about her.

Her friends have no let up on their texts to me, so I don’t think she’s spoken to them. One said I couldn’t try and ‘sweep this under the carpet’ which is like what????? I’m thinking of blocking all of them as they just won’t leave me alone.

​

**UPDATE 3 [4pm]:** This is not an update I expected to make, not in a million years. Shit really hit the fan and went sideways in a way I never imagined. I’m confused, heartbroken, and really pissed off now. So long story short ITS ALL A FUCKING LIE.

One redditor said to me that my friends might have said something to Mary’s work colleagues about me that made them not like me. I talked to both of them when they came round in the afternoon and they both denied any of that. The one I had spoken to earlier on the phone (we’ll call Claire) said she’d call one of the work colleagues that she knows slightly well in order to clear things up. Let’s call the colleague Jane.

Jane turned up at the flat and instantly looked pissed, I almost wanted to hide behind the kitchen counter when she came in glaring daggers at me. We all sat down and I let Jane know that I’d spoken to Mary about last night and that she was fine but I was still confused. Jane then laughed and said ‘oh don’t try that shit with me, you can’t just pretend now that you’ve been exposed in public’.

The three of us looked at her without saying a word as we were all confused now. Claire asked her what she meant and Jane said that she knew how I ‘really treated Mary’. We both asked her to elaborate, and she stood up and went on this tirade about how I apparently regularly abuse and belittle Mary, then intimidate her into saying nothing about it and put on a smile for others. I wasn’t sure whether to laugh or cry at this point. She then showed me her texts with Mary where Mary wrote to her in distress about being locked in her room because I was having a meltdown about her making friends at work – SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

Claire and my other friend took the phone and looked through the messages as well, and I had to stop reading them as they all said stuff about how Mary was afraid of me and that I’d trapped her here and was extorting rent out of her. It all just leaves me numb and dead inside.

Eventually Claire got to a point where Mary said I’d cancelled her 21st birthday at Uni and told her she wasn’t allowed to go out. The things is, Claire and my other friend were AT Mary’s 21st birthday, which I’d put over £500 towards to have a themed Great Gatsby night she’d always wanted, which in the messages she was claiming never happened. We went over a lot of the stuff in the messages and realised that Mary had been spreading lies about me to all her colleagues about how I was abusive and she couldn’t move out because I was charging her so much rent money. This absolutely shattered me. Mary was a like a sister to me through our Uni years, and I can’t fathom why she’d say any of these things.

It took a long time, but after Claire and my friend went over all the accusations with Jane and I pulled up my bank details to show that Mary never makes a single payment to me except for her half of the bills, she seemed to cool down and settled into the same confusion we were all feeling. She let us know that Mary told all of her colleagues this story and that the reason they were mad at me is because Mary said I liked to use a manipulation tactic where I pretend I support her through everything but use her past against when whenever we’re in private. They all thought that’s what I had been doing last night! That everything I said was meant as a backhanded compliment!

Honestly I’m so just kdfhgkfd;jghfkl;gjhag;kfhkl about everything, I can’t even put into words the hurt and betrayal I feel that she’d spread these lies about me – for what reason? What benefit? I could never lift a finger to hurt her, but she tells everyone at her work that I isolate her from the world?

Claire had to calm me down as I couldn’t stop crying no matter what I did for ages, it was quite embarrassing, but I just couldn’t do anything else. Now I’m a little more level headed, still mad but not crying any more. I don’t even want to look at Mary again. My friends have told me not to make hasty decisions, even Claire said she was disgusted by the things Mary was saying about me in the texts when everyone knows them not to be true. I know that I probably won’t be able to clear my name with her colleagues, but I don’t really care about that. I just want to know why Mary’s said those things about me?

Jane went quiet by the end of our discussion and left without saying much, so I don’t know what that means for me in her eyes. My two friends are staying with me for the rest of the day until Mary comes home. We’ve all got a lot of questions for her to answer.

​

**FINAL UPDATE [10:15pm]:** I’ve booted Mary out of the flat. She threw away years of friendship for sympathy points with her colleagues and I still cannot understand why.

When she got home and saw the three of us watching television she got excited and said she’d make popcorn, but Claire took the lead and told her to sit down. She looked confused but complied. Claire led everything, I didn’t really know what to say to Mary at all and could barely make eye contact with her. Claire told her that Jane had been round and yelled at me for being an abuser and a bully and asked her why she’d say those things.

Mary acted confused as said that it must all just be a miscommunication, that Jane just twists things sometimes and she must have misunderstood stuff she’d said. Then Clair asked about the text messages and started mentioning each ‘event’ that Mary had cried to Jane about me being an awful person. Jane went quiet and then tried to say it was a work joke, but Claire wasn’t having any of it. She pushed harder about all of this and eventually Mary broke. She started crying and telling us that she never meant any of it, that it was a stupid thing and it shouldn’t matter, that she loved me with everything she had, and it was just a stupid story that went too far. She started begging me for forgiveness, but I was just so tired and still am.

I looked her in the eyes for the first time and told her she had a week to find a place and move out.

Then she started really bawling her eyes out and begging me to let her stay, that she didn’t think it would matter because I don’t work with them, but I told her I was not having that kind of bullshit in my life. I then said ‘so do you just make up lies about everyone in your life? Is any of it real?’ She went really quiet, dead silent at that point. I didn’t want to believe it, but the way she was looking at me and the lies she’d made up about me abusing her had me questioning everything she’d ever told me when we were at Uni together; about her dad beating her mum, about her being homeless from 16 until they divorced. I then told her to get her mum on the phone and she panicked and begged me not to. Claire then realised where I was going with this and asked her if everything we’d ever been told about her dad had been true and she cracked and said she ‘may have embellished a few things’.

I am so fucking fuming at this point, who the fuck makes up this kind of twisted shit, for what benefit? I can’t even write everything that was said as it just resorted into a screaming match between all four of us as we learned that Mary’s ‘tragic life story’ had been nothing but a concoction to gain sympathy from others. Her parents are divorced but there was no abuse involved, they just fell out of love and split. I had to learn this by calling her mother myself later on to get clarity. I’d never said a word to her mum about anything in the past because Mary had warned me against it. She said I could always be open with her about everything as she wasn’t ashamed, but her mum was ‘sensitive’ and didn’t want to talk about it.

So it turns out my best friend is a master manipulator and probably always has been. I AM SO TIRED AND EXHAUSTED OF THIS WHOLE NIGHTMARE.

This will be my last update as I’m done. I came here seeking help and advice to find a way to mend a mistake I’d made with a trusted friend, but it turns out that last seven years have been built on a lie. I’m fucking done. With Mary, with everything. I don’t want to see her again. I know she can afford her own place so I don’t feel bad about kicking her out. I don’t care what she does now, I just know that I don’t want her around anymore. I think I’m going to book myself some therapy sessions after all of this shit. It’s not a happy update, but it’s the only conclusion I’ve got. Thank-you to everyone for all the advice you’ve given me over the many updates, I appreciate all of it. I’m sorry it’s not cheerful, but just I hope I can move on from all of this.


**[Additional Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting-Fox-4506/comments/qnpda8/conclusion/): November 6th 2021 (18 Days Later)**:


I never thought I’d write any else to add on to this post, but holy shit did it blow up overnight! I never expected the amazing responses I got, nor the wonderful people in my messages sharing their stories and wishing me all the best. It honestly brought me to tears to just see this flood of understanding and empathy appear out of nowhere. Thank-you to everyone who took the time to message me or comment, I’ve now read each and every one and am so thankful for all the support you’ve given me. I didn’t think I’d update any further, but since there’s been so much recent response, I can give you guys a little conclusion to how everything fully resolved. I didn’t touch reddit since my last update because I needed a lot of time to process what had happened and having the place to myself was strange to adjust to at first, but as it turns out very necessary to begin the healing process.

Mary moved out the following Saturday of the incident. She spent the following days after the blow-up moping around the flat and wanting to talk to me, but I refused and told her I needed space. Her mum came on the weekend to help her pack up her things as Mary was going to move back in with her. Her mum cleared up a lot of the questions I’d had on my mind. I’d always been told by Mary that her dad had been abusive, but her mum had loved him so much she wouldn’t leave him, so she left home and was homeless when she was 14, sleeping under benches in train stations, just so she didn’t have to be in the house with him. She only moved back in when her mum finally got the guts to divorce her dad. This story I had believed for 7 years turned out to be completely fake. Not only was Mary never homeless, but her father was never abusive and loved both her and her mum very much. The reason I never saw him around was because he’d moved to Australia to pursue his career, which was the real reason for the divorce. He loved his family but wanted success even more so he left. Her mum told me that Mary’s dad was always inviting her over for the summer holidays, but Mary never went because she hates flying.

The day she moved out I stayed in my room and just hid away, but she knocked on my door before she left, and I answered. I still wanted to say goodbye, she had been my closest friend for so long that it didn’t feel right just letting her fade out of my life without a send-off. She asked me if I wanted the money I gave her for her new car back but I said no and told her to use it instead for therapy. She cried a lot and tried to hug me, but I kept her at a distance. I let her know this would be the final time we would ever see or speak to each other; I just couldn’t be around her anymore with the knowledge of what she’d done. She left sobbing and when she was gone, my little town flat felt suddenly bigger than it ever had before. It’s been hard adjusting to being alone in this place. For the first week she was gone I still expected to see her in the kitchen every morning, or on the sofa when I got home. It was unsettling to say the least.

I had my first therapy appointment last week, and I think it actually went well. I haven’t been to therapy since I was in school, so I was very nervous to begin with, but my therapist is a very lovely lady who helped me understand that Mary’s lies were her own making and I had nothing to do with their creation. A lot of people said she was probably a compulsive liar, maybe even a narcissist, and she seemed to agree loosely with that idea from what she’d heard.

In yet another revelation, I met with Jane for coffee as she’d asked me to meet up and clear up some details. She told me she’d been wondering about why Mary would make me the target of her abuse story and started asking people in her office about the things Mary had said about me in the past. One that stood out was a painter (they work in art restoration & distribution) who used his art as a means of channelling his traumatic history with his abusive stepmother. Apparently, Mary had taken quite a liking to him, and so she had first told him about her ‘abuse’ as a way of getting closer to him. She’d mentioned fancying him in the past, but I didn’t think she’d go to such lengths to create a connection between them. He’d been furious when he heard the truth, and now doesn’t speak to her anymore. Jane told me not many people do now. They were now all worried that she’d make up stuff about them and get them in trouble at work, so they’re keeping her at arm’s length as a result. I felt a bit bad when I heard this as I know that Mary is having a miserable time with our friendship group kicking her out as well.

Jane apologised to me, but I told her she had nothing to be sorry about, that this was all Mary and she was only trying to protect what she thought was an abused friend. We left each other on good terms but we don’t have much in common, so I doubt we’ll be friends in the future.

Claire came to stay with me for a bit which has helped with the loneliness a little. It’s hard to be alone after having someone practically attached to your hip with you for so long. Thank-you to you guys as well who left such kind messages in the comments, many of which were very helpful. I am so thankful to all of you for your words of advice and comfort you’ve given me. It’s made a shitty situation so much better to know there are people out there who’ve been through the same thing and offer words of encouragement to lost things like me. Thank-you everybody!

Forget all that crap. Ur not dumb u know the basics. Honestly the only secret is to stop lookin for secrets and just build a few simple habits u can actually do.  
  
Salads are ur #1 tool. Seriously just eat a big salad before ur protein. It fills u up so u dont feel like eating a mountain of other stuff after. Its a cheat code for feeling full.  
  
Try two big meals. If u hate tiny sad-looking plates then just skip a meal. Have a black coffee instead it kills ur appetite. Then u can have two actual decent-sized meals later.  
  
Ditch boxed food. This stuff pisses me off too. Its science food designed to make u overeat. Just eat real food stuff from the ground. U dont need a label to know an apple is good for u.  
  
Just walk. Seriously. U dont need an insane gym plan. Just start walking. 20 mins then 30 then an hour. It's easy it feels good and it helps everything else along.  
  
So yeah thats it. Salads maybe coffee real food and walking. Get into that routine and then the most important part is to focus on ur life not on food. The less u obsess the easier it gets.

I usually mix it in very little water so it hits harder. I've been drinking black coffee since my highschool, and during exams would consume higher doses to stay more alert and active due to caffeine tolerance.

Recently I decided to detox and reduce it gradually. I tried increasing water, reducing coffee quantity and dividing a strong cup into weaker cups. But even then, I’m sleeping most of the day (12+) in shifts, feeling exhausted and mentally blank. Waking up tired again and feeling sleepy like an hour after waking up, and feeling tired the entire day.

The worst part? If I sleep irregularly or take naps, I get taunted or scolded, and I don’t have the freedom to just rest and explain it’s caffeine withdrawal at home. I'm not someone who would love sleeping then anything, I wouldn't mind reducing sleep hours in case of heavy work schedule. I cant lay on bed for a week in the name  of caffeine detoxing. 

I don’t want to be dependent on coffee just to feel awake, but right now it feels like I have no other option.

If anyone has gone through this or has advice — how to detox without ruining your daily routine, what to eat, how to stay alert naturally — I’d really appreciate it.

Had a blast with my friends, console definitely needed a game like this, and hell, better if they add more thanks to this.

I must admit, while it was a pleasant experience, not everything was colors and rainbows, went ahead and wrote this ""overall experience"" thing with personal takes, so do read this with that in mind.

- The Good.

Overall, the game i used to watch a lot on YouTube feels and plays like it shows, raw, always making sure my attention was on one place and all places at all times,  always making sure that I didn't take my attention off a hostile while i had my eyes on the nearest doorway.

While i made a few setting adjustments, the game performed great, sound felt amazing, although aknost impossible to hesr my own thoughts lol, but adds the charisma this game has, didn't mind it much 

Difficulty shows, and I'm glad that taking your time (with obvious exceptions) rewards you well, I even took the time to get S grade on 2 missions.

Online multiplayer was fun! Met some good people and fellow console players too, although at first I couldn't get VOIP working, it was still great to have real teammates and some thorough communication.

Co-op play improved it all for me, from spending 10 minutes drinking coffee with my friends, to trying to complete a mision 3 times or more because we all got killed, it was a great time, and one I'll definitely repeat more than once.


- The Bad

So.. some of the obvious things out there that doesn't need to be mentioned, as my experience doesn't count towards any opinions regarding changes before the update.

That being said, it's obvious that everyone's opinions and complains are loud and visible, as much as elephant in a white room.
Do I let the community's complains change my opinion? No, do I acknowledge it? YES.

Let's start with some of the details: models, missing textures, jankyness, AI, while the impact on my experience wasn't entirely ruined or even considered awful, it didn't go unnoticed.

Inconsistent allied AI behavior, enemy AI being pretty much spec-ops disguised as an armed goon, it makes solo-play a.. unique experience.
Some missing hand textures, guns disappearing from your hands, small freezing when loading back from a mission, models not loading properly, clipping, amongst other things, while sometimes not there, always noticeable when they happen, and sometimes, being bad enough to force outcomes on certain missions, like grade decrease when that one piece of evidence somehow got out of bounds.

The bigger bad was online play for me, while gaming with randoms was fun, freezing was an issue every time you load into the lobby.

On a user experience side, out of 5 online matches with randoms, I was victim of pc warriors in 2 matches, in both matches I was teamkilled after a corny quote, and after they restarted the match and/or left it.

""You console [gamer word] ruined this game!!!"" - the random pc guy that blasted the back of my head with a 12g.

I admit I'm at fault, I should of waited out and not take any of the threats I saw in here as empty threats lol


Outside of that, some small high latency stuff, but I assume its because servers are host sided.



- My opinion


To put a stop to this once and for all, personally; the game was a godsend to me, console needs more tactical and slow FPS games, and this game Will hopefully open that door for more games 

Co-op with friends was amazing, and to me, the way this game was meant to be played.

Despite the 2 bad roots, pc players were very welcoming, wome stating their complains within reason, and others giving general advice to improve or just have a better experience playing solo.

The wait was worth it, it's definitely rough around the edges, but it can be improved, or at least I hope that there are changes are on the way.

Glad to finally be part of the experience in a way, i wasn't ready at all, but I know that in time; I'll be more than capable.

Over coffee (virtual, of course), she spilled the beans on her journey, and spoiler: It wasn't just the code; it was the docs that turned users into evangelists.

Sarah's early versions had solid features, but onboarding was a nightmare – think scattered notes and vague comments. She fixed it step-by-step: Began with a comprehensive overview doc outlining architecture and use cases. Added code examples with real-world scenarios, like integrating with CI/CD pipelines. For the win, she included migration guides for users switching from competitors, complete with diffs and benchmarks. This slashed support queries by 80% and boosted referrals, as happy users shared her docs in their teams.

Hitting $15k MRR felt surreal, she said, but consistent doc updates kept the product sticky amid competition. Devs and PMs grinding on similar paths, CodeCraft is a game-changer – it turns project ideas into pro docs automatically via 6 steps. Give it a spin: https://CodeCraftai.dev Complement it with GitHub's own wiki features for that extra collab edge without risking removal.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira.” 
“I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?"" 
Tristan paused, bitter smile curved his lips. 
""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life."" 
No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said. 
I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'
So all the love he showed me… was only a lie. 
What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap. 
Fine. If that’s the truth—I'd give them all exactly what they wanted. I’m done playing the fool.

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table. 

Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still blazing with that primal hunger from full moon.

""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""

""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""

Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.

My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""

He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his co//ck, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.

I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me. 

After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.

He kissed me lazily, then gave my butt a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""

I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""

He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.

I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.

Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.

At the dinner table, Tristan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""

Tristan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""

No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.

I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'

So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.

What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.

I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.

The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt

“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”

""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""

Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""

""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""

Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”

“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""

That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.

Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.

Just this morning, Ronan had fu//cked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.

Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.

I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.

All those buried memories came flooding back.

Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.

Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's illegitimate daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.

So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.

That's how my mother drowned.

When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""

I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.

I sued her for murder.

But the next day, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”

He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:

“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”

“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”

“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”

Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.

“NOW.”

A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”

The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.

I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.

“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.

Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

That single sentence sent me plummeting into the abyss.

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.

Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.

They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.

The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.

But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.

My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

That's when Ronan began his relentless pursuit.

Such careful attention, such devoted protection.

I saw him as my salvation and accepted his claim.

After our mating ceremony, the court found Mira innocent.

So I tried to let go, I wanted his pup. I just... wanted us to feel like a real family.”

I never imagined that my salvation was just proof of his love for Mira all along.

Ronan appeared beside me, holding an umbrella over my head.

The moment he saw me, his furrowed brow relaxed slightly, concern flashing in his eyes.

""You disappeared without a word. I was worried sick.""

""And it's getting colder every day. I'm buried in pack business with year-end territory disputes—if you get sick, how am I supposed to take care of you?""

I wasn't surprised he'd found me. He'd installed a tracking app on my phone.

He said he was afraid my depression would make me do something dangerous. He wanted to protect me.

I'd believed him.

But now I knew better. He was probably just making sure I wouldn't go after Mira.

I blinked, my tears already dried up, staring at the snowflakes falling from the sky.

""Old wolves say the Moon Goddess listens closer during the first snow. That's why I came out here.""

First wish: to sever my mate bond with Ronan cleanly.

Second wish: never having to see him again after I left the pack.

Third wish: for mom not to hate me.

Not to hate me for falling in love with the man who protected her killer. For wanting to have his pup.

Ronan draped his jacket over my shoulders, playfully tapping my nose. ""Then you should dress warmer. Look at your hands—they're freezing.""

""What did you pray for?""

I watched him put on his caring act, feeling nothing.

""About us. And about mom.""

Ronan's face went rigid. He studied me carefully.

""Mira is your half-sister, after all. Blood is thicker than water. She was devastated when your mom died too. You're each other's only family. It's been three years now, maybe...""

I knew what he was getting at. ""I know. I won't cause trouble anymore.""

I'd already sued her. Mira wasn't convicted.

I didn't appeal then.

Even if I withdrew the family's forgiveness letter now, it wouldn't change anything.

Ronan relaxed, relief flickering across his face. His mood clearly improved.

""Baby, I'm so glad you can let this go.""

""New year, new start. It'll just be us two now, and we're going to be so happy.""

I just listened in silence.

Ronan took me home.

Rowan was already gone, and Ronan said he had pack business to handle.

I sat there numbly, emotions crashing over me. Until, finally, I took out the bond-breaking deal—and signed my name.

I signed the papers without hesitation and headed straight to his office.

But I found the door half-open, and no one inside.

It was my first time entering Ronan's office—neat, clean.

A photo of Mira sat on his desk.

And scattered drafts at the desk's edge were covered with her name, written over and over.

Every stroke filled with boyish devotion.

I thought I could accept this calmly.

But I couldn't. My heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist, suffocating pain.

On the desk sat an elegant gift box containing a stunning sapphire necklace.

Priceless. Irreplaceable.

I loved sapphires—their cool, proud beauty.

But Ronan always gave me gold jewelry.

He'd say: ""Jewelry should hold its value above all else. Besides, you're beautiful—you look regal in anything.""

I'd believed his sweet words.

Now, holding the sapphire necklace from the box, I saw how beautiful it was. The center sapphire was the size of a quail egg, surrounded by delicate diamonds that sparkled with every movement.

On the back, engraved: ""MH.""

MH. Mira Hale.

My breath caught. I laughed through my tears, finally understanding, then fled his self-made prison of love.

Enough. It was really enough.

I needed to get far away.

I contacted the rogue network, arranged for them to fake my death.

Now I just had to wait for the pack council to retrieve the settlement papers Ronan had hidden for three years.

Ronan didn't come home that night.

The next day, he returned with a smile: ""Lyra, tomorrow is your sister's birthday and New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate together.""

""I already invited Mira to join us for dinner, using your name. You two have been distant too long—it's time to heal this rift. For me, please?""

I looked at Ronan.

He coaxed me gently, his dark eyes full of apparent sincerity and devotion.

Suddenly I remembered that darkest year when he'd looked at me the same way, taking the blade from my hands, saving me from suicide.

""Fine. I'll go.""

He wanted this, so I'd give it to him.

Consider it repayment for all those times he'd saved me during my worst episodes.

New Year's Eve.

Ronan had reserved the entire restaurant.

Mira arrived in a pristine white dress.

Ronan immediately dropped my hand and walked to her.

""Mira, happy birthday. This is my gift to you.""

I recognized the familiar gift box.

The familiar sapphire necklace.

Of course it was for her.

Seeming to remember I was there, Ronan added stiffly: ""Your sister and I picked it out together.""

Mira raised an eyebrow. ""Thank you. I love it.""

After Ronan left for the kitchen to place our order, she immediately dropped her smile and walked toward me.

""Luna Cross still remembers her poor little sister—how sweet!""

""But you do realize your Alpha is just my second choice, right?""

I glanced at her and sat down.

""That all you came here to say?""

Mira looked pissed that I wasn't breaking down, then her smile turned vicious.

""Of course not. You gave me a gift, so I've got one for you too.""

She pulled out a green jade bracelet and threw it on the table like garbage.

The moment I saw what it was, my blood ran cold.

This was the bracelet from my mother's urn.

How did Mira get her hands on it?

I lunged forward and grabbed her arm. ""How did you get that bracelet? Tell me!""

Mira smiled viciously. ""I dug up that bit//ch's ashes, obviously. See how thoughtful I am? I even saved the bracelet for you.""

""Lyra, if your mom hadn't refused to reject my father's bond, my mother never would've wasted away from heartbreak. It's all that bithc's fault—she deserved every second of drowning!""

""But even dead, she doesn't deserve a proper burial. So I scattered her ashes in the pack's waste dump where garbage belongs!""

Rage exploded through me. My vision went red as I wrapped both hands around her throat.

""Mira, you did murder my mother on purpose. I'll kill you!""

Mira struggled, laughing maniacally. ""Got proof I killed anyone? Your ex-mate loves me, your current Alpha loves me. They all think I'm innocent and sweet. They all protect me. What can you do about it?""

Her words only fueled my fury, but years of illness had weakened me. I couldn't choke her, and she shoved me away hard.

""Sister, why do you hate me so much? I know I was wrong—please stop hitting me.""

""Mira, are you okay?"" Ronan rushed over, having heard the commotion. He glared at me with pure anger and slapped me across the face without hesitation, his eyes full of disappointment.

""Lyra, she's your sister and you tried to choke her to death! Have you lost your mind?""

Mira shook her head pitifully.

""Ronan, don't blame my sister. It's all my fault—I'm the one who hurt our mother.""

Ignoring the bu//rning pain in my cheek, I stared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“How did she open my mother's coffin?! You… you sent her, didn’t you?! Only you and I knew where mom's grave was.”

""What are you talking about?"" Ronan looked incredulous. ""Mira just went to pay her respects. How can you think such evil thoughts about your own sister?""

He'd promised to hide his feelings for Mira around me.

But the moment there was any conflict, he showed his true colors.

Yet he still didn't realize it.

I looked at him with trembling hands and suddenly laughed.

""Ronan, since you're so determined to protect her, then keep protecting her. Don't ever change, even if I die tonight.""

""Because I'm afraid you'll regret it for the rest of your life.""

Ronan suddenly looked panicked. He released Mira and tried to calm me down.

""Don't say things like that to scare me—it makes me worry. I'm not protecting her, you just looked terrifying back there. You really wanted to kill her, you know that? Your mother was her savior—she was just paying respects. There's no way she'd desecrate your mother's grave. Stop being so paranoid. It hurts both of you.""

""I'm sorry I hit you. I was impulsive. Go home and rest, take your medication. I'll take Mira to the hospital to get checked out.""

""Once she's fine, I'll come straight home to you, okay?""

With that, he left with Mira.

Mira looked back at me, her lips curved in a mocking smile.

I stared at her, unable to take another step, my hands shaking uncontrollably, unable to breathe.

Overwhelming emotions crashed over me. I collapsed to the floor, completely broken.

I knew this was a panic attack.

My phone rang multiple times, but I didn't have the strength to answer.

After what felt like hours, I finally picked up.

""Miss Hale, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. The settlement documents you requested have been retrieved and sent to your residence. Please check for them.""

""Thank you."" I forced down my suffocating emotions, dragged my broken body up, and left the restaurant.

I deleted all of Ronan's contact information and threw away my old phone.

From now on, there was nothing between us.

On the way home from the hospital after dropping Mira off, Ronan's phone suddenly rang.

He answered, only to hear shocking news.

""Alpha Cross, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. We just recovered the body of a she-wolf near the coast. Found with her were a letter of forgiveness dated three years ago, and a suicide note.”

""The settlement was written by you for Mira Hale. We've also confirmed the suicide note was written by your Luna, Lyra Hale. We need you to come identify the body—""",1,1752639640.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
