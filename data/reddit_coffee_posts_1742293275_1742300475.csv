The first thing I noticed was having to use the restroom multiple times each morning.  

This became an issue for me because I've had a regular running schedule the past 10+ years. I get up, drink a couple pints of water, drink a coffee, use the restroom and then head out to run 3-5+ miles.  

I can use the restroom and feel ready to go, but it never fails, 1 mile or so into my run, I have to head back home to use the restroom again.  

I obviously eat a lot of fiber, I drink a lot of water. I'll have something light for breakfast or sometimes skip it.  I consistently eat lunch and dinner and never really eat past 6pm.  

Weekends I don't mind, I have an extra cup of coffee and wait out the second bathroom break.  Work days I'm on a schedule and just have to build in time to circle back to my house to use the restroom. 

Is there any way to better control the double bathroom breaks?   My preference would be one and done! ",0,1742300046.0,PlantBasedDiet,0,0.5,False

For me, drinking a warm coffee in the morning, and eating something with a lot of fiber and staying hydrated cured my constipation and bloating. Tea may work too, but coffee itself stimulates bowel movement, noticably more than tea in my case. It's important to stay hydrated as coffee also increases the need to pee, but as long as I keep that in mind I've been fine.

I know this isn't like some big news, and a lot of people may already know about it, but I haven't seen a post specifically dedicated to digestion in regards to coffee, and other tips so I wanted to do that!

One day, he introduced me to his close friend, Amy, who somehow became a small post of our group over discord calls and group chats. A couple of months later Amy was visiting from the UK. She was dating a guy we‚Äôll call Steve (19M)

Now, when I first met Steve, I wasn‚Äôt exactly swooning. But the more we talked, the more we realized we were basically cut from the same cloth‚Äîsame college, same field, same vibe. After Amy flew back, Steve naturally became part of our group. Coincidentally, my new job was just a minute from his house, so we started hanging out more‚Äîlunches, coffee breaks, and maybe a little too much ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù quality time.

Here‚Äôs where it gets messy: Amy wasn‚Äôt exactly girlfriend of the year ‚Äîin fact I‚Äôd say she was a nightmare. She had cheated on Steve multiple times, yet somehow refused to let him go. It wasn‚Äôt that he was still in love with her; he was stuck. Every time he tried to leave, she‚Äôd manipulate, guilt-trip, and trap him into staying. He was exhausted, done, and desperate to break free.

Then came a stormy December night‚Äîliterally. Floods left me stranded at work, and Steve, came to the rescue, taking me to his place until I could get home. That car ride? Electric. We talked about everything‚Äîhis toxic relationship, our lives, our dreams. At one point, he looked at me, I looked at him, and for a split second, the world stopped. But we turned away. He was still technically taken.

Fast forward a month‚Äîdrinks were had, inhibitions were lowered, and I sent Steve that text. The one where I told him he deserved better, that he should finally break up with Amy. His response? Are you asking me out? My answer? Yes.

[No evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent. ‚Äî Ps 91:10 ](https://preview.redd.it/b8henh22ofpe1.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3584931e5a754552f45c6282ef12e091c9c9511c)

‚ÄãWe know what it means to be fireproof or waterproof, but it is even more significant to be proof against sin. It is possible to be so filled with the Spirit and the presence of Jesus that all the enemy‚Äôs attacks bounce off our heavenly armor. The thorns and burrs along the path won‚Äôt stick to our heavenly robes, and the noxious vapors of sin will dissipate before the warmth of the Holy Spirit. We can walk in victory even through the valley of the shadow of death.

Just as red-hot iron repels water and the touch of human fingers, so when we are on fire with the Holy Spirit, Satan will keep his hands off us. The cold water he tries to pour over us will roll off, leaving us unharmed. ""He who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot touch them.""

It is said that before going into a malarial region, it‚Äôs wise to fortify the body with nourishing food. In the same way, we must be spiritually nourished and filled with the life of Christ, so that the evil around us doesn‚Äôt penetrate our lives.

¬†Review link: [https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991011140/recommended/2246340/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991011140/recommended/2246340/)

**Disclaimer:**

This review is the representation of my personal experience with the game. Issues and problems other may experience are not part of this review, since these did not apply or happen on my end.

¬†

**Summary:**

We have here on of the best entries to the Monster Hunter Series since World in 2018. This game is such a beauty, not only to its stunning visuals it offers, but also the detailed world life itself.  
Its very rare that we can experience such a detail loved worldbuilding and scenary. From the weather changes, to the monsters eco-behavior up to the detailed camp life.  
Even the smallest things like palicos in the field, not just vanishing into air, but actualy walking back to camp and refill. Or corpses of Monsters not just vanishing but decaying and growing plants on them (ofc. this takes quite some CPU power). Nothing else in the last 5 years offers such a detailed and love-work world. In Things like These you just want to sink in and watch it progress. The gameplay loop is king again and a massive blast, alone or with friends!

¬†

This game is better then MH World (basegame) and is a massive improvement in any PoV towards it. Its not on the content level and feature level as Iceborne is, but we also just stay at the very start of this games life-cycle. With a future Master-Rank expansion like MH-Iceborne in the future, this game can reach legenday status in the games series.

One thing that i sadly have to mod in, is proper ultrawide screen support (5760x1080+ -> 48:9).

The feeling and emergion feeling it brings is a must, when you experienced it just once!

¬†

¬†

**Gameplay:**

Its the perfect gameplay look to be expected from a Monster Hunter game, but done almost perfectly in the best simulation eco-system and a fully connected open world.

¬†

¬†

Starting a hunt goes more fluid then ever before, in the open field or with your handler that follows you everywhere you go, with no reason anymore to ‚Äûteleport‚Äú back to camp every time for a new hunt or quest. Thanks to the options to cook meals everywhere, the start of a hunt is dynamic as never before. You will encounter dynamic weather and biom changes that will effect endemic life and monsters alike.

¬†

Fast travel trough the wide lands, is also secured thanks to your new mount that fits the world building perfectly and does not feel forced in like the palamutes back in MH-Rise. I don‚Äôt want to go too much into detail here for story-spoiler reasons, but what is sadly missing so far is the palico kitchen or a proper managed arena with controlled encounters, but that may change in the future. Overall i can only say, gameplay is king again and the best reason to buy this game.

¬†

**Story:**

Capcom did what many had never expected them to do. Deliver a story that has focus on the overall World-Building of the Monster Hunter series, down to the great dragon war and the downfall of the old civilization. I am trying to prevent very heavy spoilers for these who want to find out themself on what is revealed here. But let just the following screenshots speak for themself how close we are getting here to the legendary history of the events and the downfall reason of the old civilization...

¬†

Capcom did accept the feedback that many (new) players do not like long stories bound to hunter rank leveling. Therefore they did keep the main story bound to the low-rank experience of the game with a gameplay time of 10-15h, so that even casual players can see the credits with moderate gameplay time investment. For these who want to know more of the main story and its effect on the world, will have more additional story content in the high-rank part of the game. For the true monster hunter fans with interest in the series core-lore and world building story, this game is the houly gem of the entire games series. Going into details, would just be spoilers sadly.

¬†

**Grind & Quests:**

We have here a Monster Hunter Game, that should already explain to everyone what to expect when it comes to grinding, hunting and completion. I do not have to explain that you need to hunt monsters for parts for your gear and weapon crafting. With some parts only available by cutting of parts of the monster or certain rare drops. All that iss elf-explained. What should be mentioned is that the RNG drops of decorations of MH-World is back. You can get more specificly by smelting later in the game, but the natural income of new decoration gems is the main grind next to Artian weapon parts. The main endgame-grind is all around making your gear perfect by getting the best decoration for your gear and RNG crafting the best Artian weapon for your needs. With friends on a daily 1-2h gameplay session, this is entertaining and rewarding alike.

¬†

There is one thing that does take the fun out of being a completionist. Hunting monster for gold-crowns is more easy then ever, thanks to the spy-glasses. Capturing endemic life is also quite easy because not all are achivment bound. What destroys all fun is the fishing with its mini-game mechanic. Capturing 30 whoppers or getting at least one Gajau is pure pain and 0 fun. If you can ignore that, do it and the gameplay fun will not break off for you.

¬†

You can achive quite the nice high-end gear with moderate grind investment:

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3446517061](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3446517061)

¬†

This is my current ‚Äûdamage build‚Äú that brings the most fun to my hunts so far, but there is also a healer build for supporting others on joined SOS flares. Community stay together and support each other. Thats what MH games were about and should still be. üòä

As a direct successor game to MH-World, i can assure everyone this game managed to surpass it and being more then a worthy successor to it. It is not on the feature and content level of MH-Iceborne by far yet, but again its at the very start of its lifetime cycle and still awaits its Master-Rank expansion in the future. So far the basis for it looks and plays almost perfectly.

Staying at State plaza hotel in Foggy bottom. 

I asked AI to generate this itinerary with specific prompts and wanted to see if this looks good?

Also, skipping the peak bloom weekend of March end and also April beginning due to high hotel prices and rush around that time. 

Will this time still be good enough to see the cherry blossom trees? 

Any good recommendations for food?

Also, is Georgetown worth it?

Any other suggestions to the plan are welcomed. 

Day 1: Arrival and Initial Exploration

‚Ä¢ 2:00 PM: Arrive at State Plaza Hotel in Foggy Bottom and check in.

‚Ä¢ 3:00 PM: Walk to the Lincoln Memorial. Take time to enjoy the Reflecting Pool and the nearby Vietnam and Korean War Veterans Memorials.

‚Ä¢ 8:00 PM: Begin an evening stroll along the National Mall to admire the illuminated monuments such as the Washington Monument and the World War II Memorial.

‚Ä¢ 9:00 PM (Optional): If you‚Äôre up for more, take a short ride to Georgetown. Enjoy a leisurely walk along the Georgetown Waterfront and explore its historic streets under night lighting. A stop for a dessert or coffee in one of its quaint cafes is a nice way to end the evening.

‚∏ª

Day 2: Museums, Capitol Hill, and Georgetown Evening

1je2ldt,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1je2ldt/cant_meet_anyone_to_date_or_even_hookup_with_and/,Can't meet anyone to date (or even hook-up with) and I'm at my wits end,"I can't find anyone to date and I've come to the conclusion it's largely because of where I live, and I don't know what to do about it (I live in Edmonton, Canada).

Until fairly recently I thought I was the problem, that I was ugly, and therefore some kind of ""incel."" But that isn't the case at all. I am a tall (6""2) white guy, I'm good-looking (or at least enough people have told me so at this point), have a full head of hair, and I'm not fat. I speak 3+ languages and I'm fairly well-travelled. I'm not a gamer or a drug addict. People generally seem to like me and I try my best to engage with them. By every metric about I should be eminently dateable.

And I've had several previous relationships, but they have either happened when I was living abroad, been long-distance or been with people who aren't from here and just happened to be here temporarily. My last girlfriend was a post-doc at the university and had to back to her home country after 6 months (when we started dating I mistakenly thought she was staying long-term, had I known I'm not sure I would have pursued her). In fact my last 2 were LDRs but I can't do it anymore and I'm tired of the cultural differences that seem to come up, and furthermore my job/field probably requires me to stay in Canada for the foreseeable future unfortunately (plus the fact is the COL seems to be even more fucked in the rest of the country makes it so there doesn't seem to be a lot of options when it comes to moving anywhere better, even if I could afford it, I don't think it's any better culturally speaking).

I have some minimal standards, mostly I just don't want someone who I'm not physically attracted to (a.k.a. fat) and/or has an obnoxious personality. If I am being honest, I wasn't even attracted to my last girlfriend and I tolerated it for too long because I felt like there was nothing better, and that wasn't healthy or fair to her. I feel like my standards aren't unreasonable but maybe I'm wrong, because that seems to be out of reach here.

But I've realized, the problem is, I can't meet anyone. I haven't been even on a date in ages, because there's no one to ask. Apparently women are lonely too, Ive seen them complain about it. Where are they then?  

The apps are useless and demoralizing, I never match with anyone, I get likes but only from ""undesirables"", and the ones I swipe right on either don't get shown to me because of the algorithm or they don't like me back. I'm not a huge fan of bars, anyway the bar/nightlife scene is terrible here, extremely overpriced, and too loud to talk to anyone anyway (almost all coffee shops close at 5 PM, it's like people don't go out to just have conversations). Just talk to women randomly? Where? In my everyday life I don't even see/remotely get to interact with women all that often...maybe in passing, or at the gym sometimes, but most people seem hyper focused on their routines, so I don't really bother. Work? Forget it, everyone I work with is way older or otherwise unavailable, and whatever job I've had always seems to be that way (also, there was one time I did meet someone at work, and it did not end well at all, I ended up losing that job and it basically gave me PTSD that set me back emotionally for years, long story).

Everything here is non-conducive to socializing and human connection. Part of it is the weather (6 months of sub-freezing temperatures), and part of it is the urban sprawl. To go anywhere you need a car. I've tried doing meetups and activities, they are inevitably 90% male, clearly looking for the same thing as me, and most people never seem to want to do anything afterwards except go home. I have a few friends, but frankly they are lame and of no help at all. It doesn't help that many people here don't seem to make friends after high school, if you didn't have a solid clique then, good luck. It doesn't help that culturally I don't really fit in here (I don't like winter, I'm not into hockey or quadding or driving a big pickup truck, I'm not conservative, not ""blue-collar"" etc I don't seem to have much in common with a lot of people here, in fact I've never dated a normie white Canadian woman).

I know for a fact, there are more men than women here. The ratios aren't extreme, something like 30,000 more men than women in my city of 1,000,000, but sometimes I wonder if it's enough to have a statistical effect. When I used to go to bars more when I was younger (10+ years ago), it was way worse, every bar was a complete sausage fest (that was the 2000's oil boom here) I feel like I'm still jaded from those times. It seems to have changed but I feel too old for that whole scene (besides, realistically all those 18-21 year olds probably don't want to date my mid-30's ass anyway, fair enough).

I don't know if this makes a difference, but I can't shake the idea that demographics are just against me. I feel like have no idea what ""normal"" is -- Is everywhere just varying degrees of suck like this now? Or is where I live just especially bad? Should I eat the costs and try moving somewhere else? Or am I in fact, the problem? I've become completely cynical about dating and about the future, and that's on top of all the uncertainty and fuckery happening right now in the world more generally.",6,1742296728.0,redscarepod,19,0.69,False

**RE: Complaints**
Hi Dina!

1997 Greenleaf Dr. is currently under notice. There is an open SR#1298832, noting progress has been made and they have an extension until 3.24.25 to get things in compliance.
I did note about the refrigerator on the open SR to let them know we are still receiving calls about that property.

1993 Greenleaf Dr. ---parking on the lawn is handled by non-emergency police. Reports at the time of observance should be made to 859.258.3600.

Let us know if you need anything else.

Enjoy your day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to bring some greenery into your home, why not try your hand at hydroponics? These soil-free growing systems allow you to cultivate plants quickly and efficiently. With just a weekend to spare, you can build your very own indoor hydroponic system. Here are ten creative ideas to get you started!

### 1. PVC Pipe Hydroponic System

Using PVC pipes is both cost-effective and simple. Cut the pipes to your desired length, drill holes for your plants, and connect them at an angle to allow the nutrient solution to flow. This vertical system saves space and enables you to grow multiple plants simultaneously.

### 2. Deep Water Culture (DWC)

DWC systems require a container filled with nutrient-rich water. A floating platform holds your plants above the water. Air stones connected to an air pump keep the water oxygenated, allowing your plants to thrive. This setup is great for larger plants, like tomatoes and peppers.

### 3. Kratky Method

This passive hydroponic system involves suspending the plant roots into a nutrient solution with no pumps or moving parts required. Place the plants in net pots and fill a container with nutrient mix to the optimal level. As the plants grow, the water level decreases, providing them access to both nutrients and oxygen.

### 4. Ebb and Flow System

The ebb and flow system uses a timer to flood the grow bed with nutrient solution and then drains it back into a reservoir. This cycle gives your plants the moisture and nutrients they need while allowing air to reach their roots. You can customize this system to suit different plant varieties.

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
### 5. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)

NFT is a highly efficient method where a thin film of nutrient solution continuously flows over the roots of your plants. This setup can be made using a sloped channel and a small water pump. It is perfect for growing leafy greens like lettuce and kale, as they thrive in this system.

### 6. Aeroponics System

Aeroponics involves suspending your plants in air and misting their roots with nutrient solution. This method provides excellent oxygenation and nutrient absorption. While it might take a bit more setup, the growth rate is impressive. You can use a plastic box and a few misting nozzles for this system.

### 7. Vertical Tower Garden

Turn your indoor space into a vertical garden! Using stackable planters or a vertical pallet system, you can grow multiple plants in a small footprint. This design is not only visually appealing but also maximizes sunlight exposure and air circulation for your plants.

### 8. Coffee Table Hydroponic Garden

Transform a coffee table into a stylish hydroponic garden! Use a shallow container covered with a decorative cover to hide your reservoir, then add plants on top. This approach combines aesthetics with functionality, giving your living room a fresh, green touch!

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
### 9. Mason Jar Hydroponics

Mason jars are a fun, DIY-friendly way to start small. Fill the jar with nutrient solution and place a net pot filled with your plant of choice on top. This system is perfect for herbs like basil and mint. Plus, it makes for an attractive kitchen display.

### 10. Hydroponic Bucket System

With just a few 5-gallon buckets and some tubing, you can create a simple hydroponic garden. Fill one bucket with nutrient solution and connect it to other buckets filled with plants. This system can be easily expanded, allowing you to grow more plants as you progress.

Building a DIY indoor hydroponic system is an exciting project that can provide fresh produce right in your home. By experimenting with different techniques, you‚Äôll discover what best suits your space and preferences. Enjoy the process, and happy gardening!

The Benefits of Indoor Hydroponics for Home Gardening Enthusiasts
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For home gardening enthusiasts, embracing indoor hydroponics opens up a world of possibilities. This innovative growing system offers numerous advantages that make it an attractive option for anyone looking to cultivate plants indoors. Whether you're an experienced gardener or a complete beginner, hydroponics can significantly enhance your gardening experience.

One major benefit of indoor hydroponics is the ability to grow plants year-round. Traditional gardening is often restricted by seasonal changes. However, with hydroponics, you can create a controlled environment that maintains the perfect conditions for plant growth, regardless of the weather outside. This means you'll have fresh herbs, vegetables, and fruits at your fingertips, no matter the season.

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
Another significant advantage of this method is space efficiency. Indoor hydroponic systems are perfect for those with limited space, such as apartment dwellers or individuals living in cities. Many hydroponic setups are compact and designed to fit on countertops or in small corners of your home. You can even utilize vertical gardening techniques to maximize your growing area by stacking plants upward instead of outward.

Indoor hydroponics also reduces the risk of pests and diseases. Soil-based gardening often introduces a host of pests and pathogens that can harm your plants. In a hydroponic system, plants grow in nutrient-rich water, which minimizes the chances of exposure to harmful insects and soil-borne diseases. This means you can enjoy healthier plants and a more fruitful harvest.

Water efficiency is another compelling reason to choose hydroponics. Traditional gardening requires a significant amount of water for irrigation, much of which can be wasted. In contrast, hydroponic systems use a fraction of the water because the nutrient solution circulates through the system. This not only conserves water but also allows you to provide your plants with precise amounts of nutrients directly to their roots, promoting faster growth.

Here are some additional benefits of indoor hydroponic gardening:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Faster Growth Rates:** Hydroponically grown plants often mature more quickly than soil-based plants. This can result in increased yields and more frequent harvests, making your gardening efforts even more rewarding.
- **Less Maintenance:** Without soil to tend to, soil-related tasks like tilling and weeding are eliminated. This can save you time and effort, allowing you to focus more on enjoying your plants.
- **Better Control:** With hydroponics, you have greater control over the nutrient composition and pH levels. This allows you to tailor the growing conditions to suit specific plants or stages of growth, leading to healthier and more productive plants.
- **Cleaner Growing Environment:** Hydroponic systems are typically easier to clean and maintain than traditional garden beds. This reduces the mess in your home and makes it a more enjoyable hobby.

Moreover, indoor hydroponics can also contribute positively to your mental well-being. Gardening has long been known to reduce stress and promote happiness. The act of nurturing plants, observing their growth, and successfully harvesting the fruits of your labor can be incredibly fulfilling. Indoor hydroponics allows you to indulge in this rewarding experience, regardless of your outdoor space.

For those who are eco-conscious, hydroponics is a sustainable choice. Because it uses less water and can often be done using organic materials, indoor hydroponic gardening can lower your carbon footprint. You control the entire growing process, allowing for chemical-free gardening, which benefits not only your health but also the environment.

With all these benefits, it's clear that indoor hydroponics presents a fantastic opportunity for anyone with a green thumb. Whether you're growing fresh herbs for cooking or nurturing flowering plants for beauty, the world of hydroponics provides endless possibilities for creativity and sustainability. Dive in, explore the options, and transform your indoor space into a thriving green oasis!

### Conclusion

As you embark on your journey into indoor hydroponics, each of the 10 DIY systems discussed offers a unique and engaging way to grow your plants right from your home. From simple setups using recycled materials to more advanced designs that provide a sustainable growing environment, there's something for every level of gardening enthusiast. These systems not only allow you to cultivate fresh vegetables and herbs year-round but also promote a deeper connection with your food and its source.

Some of my friends had done it and I decided kind of sporadically that I would do it.

I work as a musician and I normally eat a IF style diet anyway usually waking up having a coffee going to train Jiu jitsu and lift and then either eating before my gig in the evening or after, mostly a combo of both so I can get all my protein in. I didn‚Äôt follow this as a fasting protocol but just it fit my lifestyle.

So recently I had gotten back from a week trip to the Gold Coast (I live in Sydney) I was playing some gigs up there and probably being out of my routine I had been eating a bit crappy, and drinking. Got home from goldy and it was my birthday and I ended up eating some bad foods for a few days.

On top of that, I have nerve damage in my neck which started to act up again and sciatica in my glute and leg. So on Saturday I contemplated fasting to reduce inflammation.

I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything all day and had a steak after my first gig and then a pint of Guiness at my next gig. It was on the drive home I decided right from that pint of Guinness I‚Äôm going to do 48 hours fast to reset my body.

It was hard as it was st Patrick‚Äôs weekend and I‚Äôm Irish. Had to turn down pints of Guinness. And played 5 gigs from that last meal until last night (Monday).

Overall felt pretty good, only drank water, black coffee and zero calorie electrolyte powder.

After my last gig last night I did feel very hungry tho. Today I had a day off to chill and rest after all my training last week and gigs. I did struggle today on the final countdown till I could eat again.

I bought bone broth but it was a shit Campbells soup beef one and tasted disgusting so didn‚Äôt drink it. Instead I opted for some homemade guac, and some chicken noodle soup as well as some sliced pickles and a litre of coconut water.

Shortly after this I did the mother of all runny bowel movements which smelled absolutely vile haha 

But now I feel great, I just had scrambled eggs and more guac and feel pretty good.

# Coffee And Weight Loss

Ever wondered if your morning cup of coffee could help you shed those extra pounds? The idea is not as far-fetched as it sounds. Coffee, especially when consumed correctly, can play a significant role in weight loss. This is known as the ‚ÄòCoffee Hack to Lose Weight.‚Äô Let‚Äôs dive into how coffee can aid in weight loss and the science behind it.

# The Science Behind Coffee

Coffee is more than just a wake-up call. It contains several bioactive compounds that can have various health benefits, including weight loss. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how coffee works:

* **Caffeine:**¬†The main ingredient in coffee that boosts metabolism and increases fat burning.
* **Antioxidants:**¬†Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which help combat inflammation and may aid in weight management.
* **Chlorogenic Acid:**¬†This compound slows down the absorption of carbohydrates, potentially aiding in weight control.

Studies have shown that coffee can increase your metabolic rate by 3-11%. This means that your body burns more calories even when you are at rest. Here‚Äôs a table summarizing the effects:

|Compound|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Caffeine|Boosts metabolism, increases fat burning|
|Antioxidants|Combat inflammation, aid in weight management|
|Chlorogenic Acid|Slows carbohydrate absorption|

# Caffeine‚Äôs Role In Metabolism

Caffeine is the most important ingredient in coffee for weight loss. It stimulates the central nervous system, which can increase your metabolic rate. Here‚Äôs how caffeine helps:

1. **Thermogenesis:**¬†Caffeine increases heat production in your body, burning more calories.
2. **Fat Oxidation:**¬†It helps in breaking down fat cells, making them easier to burn.
3. **Appetite Suppression:**¬†Caffeine can reduce your appetite, helping you eat less.

When you drink coffee, caffeine releases adrenaline into your bloodstream. This hormone tells your body to break down fat cells and use them for energy. This process is known as lipolysis. The more fat cells you break down, the more weight you can lose.

Here‚Äôs a simple example:

* Drink a cup of black coffee before exercise.
* Caffeine boosts your energy and performance.
* You burn more calories during your workout.
* Result: More effective weight loss.

Remember, the key is to drink coffee without high-calorie additives like sugar and cream. Stick to black coffee or add a splash of milk for the best results.

# Antioxidants In Coffee

Coffee is packed with powerful antioxidants that can improve your health. These antioxidants help combat inflammation, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and fight off free radicals in the body. Here are some key antioxidants found in coffee:

* **Chlorogenic Acid:**¬†This antioxidant helps lower blood sugar levels and may reduce the risk of diabetes.
* **Quinic Acid:**¬†Known for its ability to enhance the antioxidant activity in the body.

|:-|:-|
|Chlorogenic Acid|Reduces blood sugar levels|
|Quinic Acid|Enhances antioxidant activity|

# Boosting Energy Levels

One of the most well-known benefits of coffee is its ability to boost energy levels. The caffeine in coffee stimulates the central nervous system, making you feel more alert and less tired. This can be especially helpful if you need to stay focused during the day.

Here‚Äôs how caffeine boosts energy levels:

1. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in the brain, which helps reduce feelings of tiredness.
2. It increases the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, which improve mood and cognitive function.
3. It enhances physical performance by increasing adrenaline levels in the blood.

Beyond boosting energy, caffeine can also improve mental alertness and physical endurance. This makes it a popular choice for athletes and those who need a mental boost. Drinking coffee before a workout can help you work out harder and longer.

To summarize, coffee not only helps in weight loss but also offers a range of health benefits. Its antioxidants fight diseases, and its caffeine boosts energy levels. Enjoy your cup of coffee, knowing it‚Äôs doing good for your body!

Many people turn to the coffee hack to lose weight. It‚Äôs simple: drink coffee to boost metabolism and suppress appetite. But there are common mistakes to avoid that can hinder your progress. Let‚Äôs explore these mistakes to ensure your coffee hack is effective.

# Overdoing Sugar

Adding sugar to your coffee might seem harmless, but it can add up. Too much sugar leads to weight gain, the opposite of what you want.

Here are some reasons to avoid overdoing sugar:

* **Empty Calories:**¬†Sugar adds calories without any nutritional value.
* **Blood Sugar Spikes:**¬†High sugar intake causes blood sugar spikes and crashes, leading to increased hunger.
* **Fat Storage:**¬†Excess sugar gets converted to fat, particularly around the belly.

Consider these healthier alternatives:

|Alternative|Benefits|
|:-|:-|
|Stevia|Natural, zero calories|
|Cinnamon|Boosts metabolism, adds flavor|
|Unsweetened Almond Milk|Low in calories, adds creaminess|

Switching to these alternatives can help reduce calorie intake and still keep your coffee enjoyable.

# Ignoring Portions

Portion control is crucial. Drinking large amounts of coffee can lead to unwanted side effects.

Here are some issues with ignoring portions:

* **Increased Caloric Intake:**¬†Larger portions mean more calories, especially if you add cream or sugar.
* **Insomnia:**¬†Too much caffeine can disrupt your sleep, affecting weight loss.
* **Digestive Issues:**¬†High coffee intake can lead to digestive problems.

To manage portions effectively:

1. **Stick to One Cup:**¬†Limit yourself to one cup of coffee per meal.
2. **Measure Ingredients:**¬†Use measuring spoons for sugar and cream.
3. **Choose Smaller Cups:**¬†Smaller cups help control the amount you drink.

These simple steps can help you stay on track with your weight loss goals while enjoying your coffee.

# Combining With Exercise

Introduction paragraph about What is the Coffee Hack to Lose Weight and Combining with Exercise‚Ä¶

# Best Workouts To Pair

Pairing coffee with exercise can boost your weight loss efforts. The caffeine in coffee can enhance your workout performance by increasing energy and focus. Here are some of the best workouts to pair with your coffee hack:

* **Cardio:**¬†Activities like running, cycling, and swimming are great. They help burn calories quickly and improve cardiovascular health.
* **Strength Training:**¬†Lifting weights or using resistance bands can build muscle. More muscle mass can increase your resting metabolic rate.
* **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):**¬†This involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest. HIIT is effective for burning fat and boosting metabolism.
* **Yoga:**¬†While less intense, yoga improves flexibility and reduces stress. Stress can impact weight gain, so yoga can be beneficial.

1je2brn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1je2brn/kendu_has_the_potential_to_be_a_multibillion/,Kendu Has the Potential To Be A Multi-Billion Dollar Brand,"This is gonna be an overview of Kendu, unfortunately due to the sheer size IRL products, events and other Kendu tales I cannot go through all of this in one post. In addition, there will be some things that I will forget, but I am gonna try my best.

**Introduction to Kendu**

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We were initially only on Ethereum but we have wormholed to the other 2 in the past few months. Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have 18k holders and this is growing even in this market.

**IRL Events**

Kendu has lots of events coming up and some that have already happened. In December, Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, this is a significant event, where lots of crypto enthusiasts were present. NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami.  
Kendu Pickleball, in India, Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in th Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  
Over the next few weeks Kendu is the main sponsor for Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!!

**IRL Products**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.

**Why IRL Alpha is Important**

IRL events/products are a great way for Kendu to reach both crypto enthusiasts and non crypto people. I don't see Kendu as a basic memecoin, I see it is a multi billion dollar brand, just like Nike and Sony. Kendu is dominating and entering lots of billion dollar industries. Kendu is bridging DEFI and IRL and this is a reason Kendu is gonna be a frontrunner this year!!!

We also have a lot of Kendu tattoos. I mean..... who else has that conviction?

[Tattoos](https://preview.redd.it/6kflwfgnjfpe1.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e7cd40c2cbf6d224f84b545b8e1caff07dbfeca)

**A Few Interesting Ideas**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 20 million market cap to 20 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over the tsunami that was Shiba Inu.  
Kendu can easily 1000x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram, even if you don't hold a bag. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : ) In the TG you can find me as Luke Skywalker.  
Skip the Starbucks and put the money into Kendu $10 can easily become $10000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to cement your name in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

1je2a88,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1je2a88/my_wife_developed_depression_after_my/,My Wife Developed Depression After My Criticism‚ÄîFeeling Overwhelmed and Guilty,"I'm a university assistant professor (30M), and my wife (25F) recently graduated with a master's degree but hasn't started working yet. We both come from wealthy families who could support us indefinitely, but we have very different upbringings.

My family, mostly academics, values debate, critical thinking, and open discussion, while her family, successful businesspeople, prioritized financial support but also disciplined her with physical punishment (e.g., slapping her face) when she was a child. She grew up somewhat sheltered, with little exposure to life's hardships.

# How It Started

Three years ago, when we got married, she began her master's program, which required internships. Out of six, she failed three, even though she tried hard. I remember one incident where she was excited about a mentor treating her well, but when grades came back, she received a **zero score** without explanation. The mentor then moved to another city, so even if we wanted to ask for a reason, we couldn't. She kept asking me, **""Why did this happen?""** I initially tried to comfort her, telling her that this is how the world works and we have to accept it, but after hearing the same question 10+ times daily, I lost patience and snapped, saying, **""Because you're stupid.""** I regretted it immediately, but the damage was done.

Over the years, I developed a habit of pointing out things she could improve‚Äîlike taking her hands off the wheel while driving, overspending on groceries but barely cooking (e.g., buying $100 worth of food but throwing out $90), or continuing to consume foods she knows make her sick (she frequently vomits from coffee but still drinks it). In hindsight, I realize I was approaching our marriage like an academic supervisor rather than a partner. I thought I was being practical, but she saw it as relentless criticism.

At the time, I didn‚Äôt realize how deeply my words affected her. I would say things and forget about them, but she never did. She internalized all my critiques and often brought them up repeatedly, telling me I made her feel worthless.

# The Breaking Point

Last year, she was about to graduate after delaying for a year due to failed courses. I was relieved because I thought we could finally start living independently without relying on family. Although we now live in a house her parents bought, and my parents also purchased a house for us in another city, I wanted us to buy our own place with our own money and reduce our expenses.

I started encouraging her to job hunt, but she spent most of her time watching TV. I kept reminding her every day, but without harsh words, I believed, **""You should start sending your CVs,""** but I said it too often. Eventually, she started crying randomly, even when I wasn‚Äôt saying anything. She also began **reliving old memories**, bringing up past criticisms and repeating them daily.

At that point, I knew something was wrong and helped her find a **therapist, GP, and psychiatrist**. Her mood has slightly improved with medical treatment‚Äîshe cries less‚Äîbut she still blames me every day, asking, **""Why did you say those things?""** Many of these incidents happened years ago, and I genuinely don‚Äôt remember all of them.

# The Diagnosis and My Struggles

Her therapist diagnosed her with **high-functioning autism**, which explains why she fixates on past negative experiences, repeatedly asks ""why"" about everything, and struggles to understand social norms. According to the therapist, people with autism are more prone to depression. The therapist also believes she got **PTSD from her internships, which then triggered her depression**. Before therapy, I didn‚Äôt understand her repetitive questions, and I used to tell her to **""just stop thinking about it""** because I felt exhausted answering the same thing over and over.

Now, I feel trapped.

* I feel that her parents and the failed internship may also have played a role in this. She **blames me every day now** for making her feel worthless but won‚Äôt blame her parents (who physically punished her) or the mentors (who failed her without explanation). She says it‚Äôs because her father supports her financially, and she can‚Äôt contact the mentors.
* Her **parents now blame me as well**, seeing me as the direct cause of her depression. They even told me, **""Our daughter doesn‚Äôt need to work!""**
* I have to **be extremely careful with my words** because if I say something slightly wrong, she spirals into tears. For example, today, she asked, **""Why don‚Äôt you push me to work anymore? Do you think I‚Äôm mentally sick?""** I reassured her, **""No, we just want to help you feel better,""** but she still cried and said, **""You do think I‚Äôm sick.""**
* My parents advised me **not to express frustration** because it could make things worse. I understand this, but I‚Äôm exhausted. I feel like I have to suppress all my emotions to avoid triggering another episode.

# The Guilt and Confusion

Although the therapist doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs my fault (I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs because I was there), I feel guilty that I may have **pushed her too hard** without understanding her limits. But at the same time, **is it really wrong to encourage someone to work so we can build a life together?** I also don‚Äôt know how to balance **supporting her** without **neglecting my own mental health**.

I worry that if this continues, **I might end up depressed, too**. How do I handle this situation while being there for her but also protecting my own well-being?

I'll arrive in Bangkok on April 26 (Saturday) and I'll leave the country on May 10. I'll fly out from Bangkok as well.

My problem is how to split my trip and my time there. 

First I'm not interested in beaches. If there's a place where you can walk or grab a coffee by the beach that's cool but I'm not the person who will stay in the beach sunbathing for hours. So swimming or sunbathing no.

I'm planning to stay in Bangkok for 6 nights. I know it will be very hot but I'm coming from a hot country as well so I think I'll manage. I'm not sure if 6 nights will be too much. I like the vibe of big cities and vibrant life because I love taking pictures and street photos. 

I saw Bangkok has many different regions. One question is, will it be okay to use public transport to move around? I'm okay to travel to one region and spend a few hours there and head back late in the evening etc...
Do I have to change hotels? I'd like to avoid.

Regarding the stay in Bangkok. Will 6 nights be good? I have spent 5 nights in Rome and 5 in Paris and it was okay. I'm saying that as a comparison. I don't know if Bangkok has more or less to see.

Regarding food. I don't want high end restaurants. I'll probably stick with street food or small restaurants.

What about the rest of the days? I'm thinking of flying to Chiang Mai for 4-5 nights then come back to Bangkok. 
That would leave me with 3-4 nights. Where should I spend them? 

Should I visit Pataya? I'll try to avoid touristic bars etc due to scams.

Should I just split my whole trip to Bangkok and Chiang Mai only?

The other thought is to go west. Kanchanaburi, or visit other parts around Bangkok which means I could take a break from Bangkok go somewhere then come back then fly to Chiang Mai then back to Bangkok and leave the country.

Any recommendations?

Regarding burning season. If it's not as if I'm next to a bonfire I'll be fine.",1,1742295560.0,ThailandTourism,6,0.67,False

I live outside of india, and we met through a mutual friend, and things started off well, but over time, I noticed little things that bothered me. I found that she was commenting on random ‚Äúcouple matching‚Äù reels on Instagram (like people comments on reel and page admin make match of couple and yes she was kinda nibbi). At the time, I thought she‚Äôd stop eventually, but then I saw another comment a few days later. I confronted her, and she promised she wouldn‚Äôt do it again, so I forgave her and let it go.

Then, a few days later, she casually told me that she went on a coffee date with another guy. She laughed it off like it was no big deal and said it was because she wanted a referral for a job. I was hurt but, for some reason, I told her it was fine and not to worry about it.

After that, things got worse. She started ghosting me in the middle of conversations, often not replying for hours and leaving me hanging. When I asked what she had been doing, her usual responses were things like watching movies or went shopping. Eventually, I told her that our relationship wasn‚Äôt working and ended things.

Now, I feel guilty like I should‚Äôve stayed in the relationship longer or handled things differently. One of my friends even suggested I should‚Äôve just stayed until I found someone else and then broke up, but I‚Äôm honestly not even interested in being with anyone else now.",6,1742295495.0,TwentiesIndia,2,1.0,False

**Introduction:** Hey puzzle lovers! Ever find yourself lost in a maze of letters, grinning ear to ear when you crack a clever riddle? Welcome üòä! In this kickoff post, we‚Äôre diving into **word puzzles** ‚Äì those addictive little brain teasers that have entertained us for ages across different cultures. Word puzzles span everything from the classic crosswords you tackle with your morning coffee to ancient Chinese character riddles passed down through generations. They‚Äôre not just games; they‚Äôre a global pastime that tickles our brains and brings us together.

**A Brief History & Fun Facts:** Word puzzles have been around *forever*. The first modern **crossword** emerged in 1913 when Arthur Wynne published a ‚ÄúWord-Cross Puzzle‚Äù in the New York World newspaper. But that‚Äôs just one chapter ‚Äì ancient Chinese riddles date back to **circa 2nd century CE**, thriving by the Warring States period. How cool is it that thousands of years and miles apart, humans were inventing games to play with language? Each culture developed its own twist. Western puzzles often grew from alphabet and word play, while Chinese puzzles leveraged the visual and tonal tricks of characters. Yet both traditions share something special: they‚Äôre **just plain fun!**

**How to Play (In Simple Terms):** Word puzzles come in many flavors, but they all boil down to one thing ‚Äì figuring out a hidden word or phrase using clues. For instance:

‚Ä¢ **Crosswords:** Fill in lettered grids using clues for each row/column. You solve each clue, letter by letter, until the grid is complete.

‚Ä¢ **Riddles:** Read a tricky description or question, and find the answer (often a pun or double meaning).

‚Ä¢ **Word Searches:** Hunt for listed words hidden in a jumble of letters.

Each puzzle has rules, but the goal is similar ‚Äì use your wit to uncover the secret word(s)! And don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll break down specific examples in upcoming posts.

*Fun fact: Word puzzles like crosswords became so popular that by WWII, newspapers feared they were a ‚Äúmental distraction‚Äù ‚Äì clearly, nothing stops a puzzle fan*

Myself and my partner (both in our late 20s) are going to Copenhagen soon for the first time. I am currently looking into accommodation options and figuring out the trip a bit. I have a physical disability that affects my strength and balance somewhat. I can walk approx 2/3km at a time (and more if I incorporate breaks/rests into my day). I prefer to avoid stairs where I can but I can manage them if I have to. However I 100% do not want to have to deal with a lot of stairs in wherever accommodation I am staying in.

Any suggestions on where the best place(s) be to stay? We want to pace ourselves - we like museums, galleries, maybe some live music, nice food/wine/coffee etc. Depending on the transport, I sometimes opt for taxis/taxi apps a bit more. If there's a particular app that is used there, it would be great to know in advance :)

I will of course continue with my own research, but any advice or tips would be appreciated. I hope it is okay to ask these questions here, if not, please let me know. Thank you in advance!",0,1742295140.0,copenhagen,7,0.33,False

For context, the machine is bossy and Terra Kaffee owners know, and we would follow every instruction it spit out at us. Empty the grounds, clean the milk dispenser, descale, empty the drip tray, we used flavorless beans.

Then fast forward to the end of Jan ‚Äò25 when I started getting an error 42 message so I emailed customer service. They had me do some voodoo backend magic and it seemed to work for a day or two. I basically was changing the milk line.

Then a few days later I started getting error 15 after every latte I would make. Only on lattes and never for my husbands drip coffee. The solution this time was to turn the machine off for 15 minutes and back on to reset the machine. It didn‚Äôt make a single difference and with each latte I made, the error 15 was back to destroy our lives. Customer service basically gave up and said we needed to send in our machine for repair. They gave some bullcrap promise it would take 16 business days to repair and then I would have my machine back. 

I sent it in and it was received on 2/27. The email provides a ‚Äústatus update‚Äù link which is a joke. I had to reach out to customer service to get a repair number because that was never provided to me. Every time I check the status it just says ‚Äúreceived.‚Äù I find myself having to reach out to customer service every other day for updates on my machine THAT I PAID FOR? I get the same response over and over, we‚Äôre looking into it, or I will escalate, but no answer.

I don‚Äôt know what else to do at this point. I‚Äôve requested a brand new machine, a full refund. This is absolute insanity. And now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve been duped by this company. Are they just going to keep my machine and never send it back to me? It‚Äôs sketch‚Ä¶

1je23nu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je23nu,Best placement/ width/ way to plan a garden path?,"Hi all,

In a few weeks i will have a nice shiny new garden office at the end of my garden. I'd quite like a path to it running down the left, I have 2 small children and don't really want to split the available grass space in the middle in two if I can help it. Any advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR Mainly trying to think about things like materials, drainage, placement, removal of existing garden architecture, path width, general planning and time/cost of DIY vs getting a pro.

Some extra details/ specific thoughts and considerations:

-The small wall at the end with the 3 posts and rope is being removed as is the old blue summer house. The front wall of the new office will occupy the space where the wall was with the doors where the middle post currently is leading onto a small decking step a foot deep and ultimately the grass.

-Less excited about stepping stones aesthetically and practically, but in fairness I've not really looked into designs and options.

-The load the path would need to carry would be mainly one adult man going up and down in the work day occasionally carrying a coffee. Not a utility pathway for wheelbarrows etc. How wide do you think I would want it for balance between comfort and leaving as much lawn width as possible?

-My plan is for the path to start from the step up to the lawn, curve to the left running close to the near planter and along the fence, then curve to the doors of the garden office as it nears the end of the garden. Would be shaped like a longbow, telephone or an open bracket ( if you will. Considering the route, is this too zigzaggy and will just become a pain to navigate? Id be stepping out of my house onto the patio (2nd picture), stepping right to the centre of the garden, only to go left again when reaching the lawn and then right at the end.

-The biggest obstacle to this route plan is the washing line and big planter with the cabbage palms in just after it (put in by previous owners). I feel the washing line could be removed, but if I were to remove the cluster of trees this feels like a far bigger job. Plus uprooting trees for the sake of a straighter path feels generally unsettling. Is there any reality where smashing out the brick planter itself, leaving the trees and threading the path in the small gap between the fence and the leftmost tree would make sense? Or is that crazy? See 3rd/4th pic, for the leftmost tree, the clearance is only 50cm at chest height, 60cm on the ground which feels far too narrow- but then again it's just a tree trunk, it might be fine? I've walked the route a couple of times and it's not awful awful, a little less natural than I would like, but it's hard to tell with the brick planter in place. Maybe I could cut out just the leftmost tree or two as opposed to all 5 if I really felt it was too narrow? I dug down a little to see if there were any massive roots etc. that would obstruct and seemed ok.

-I am on the fence as to whether to DIY some/all elements or to hire a pro. I think costs could end up completely skyrocketing if removal of trees is ultimately needed etc. How much ballpark would general path laying work cost anyway? Path would end up being approx. 25m long and I'm agnostic on materials other than it being suitably weatherproof and relatively low maintenance.

Like I say a complete novice, having only done the scantest of internet research. Please be kind and any help is massively appreciated. Thanks üòä

Can I get opinions please?,"sorry if this post is long but i want to give context. 

in the summer of 2019 i met a girl at the VIP line of a rock concert where we were meeting the musician. she and i were attending alone and we hit it off and became friends. for the next 6 months we hung out probably 7 or 8 times, attending more concerts together and generally just dinner/drinks etc. we always hung out alone. i never met any of her friends and vice versa. she had a long term boyfriend of several years who she would talk about and i met him once very briefly (for literally a couple mins) when he was picking her up after one of our nights out.

covid hits in 2020 and i didnt see her again for 2.5 yrs. im a bit of a hypochondriac and took the pandemic very seriously (and took a longer than normal time to work through my anxieties about socializing again). during this time despite not seeing each other in person, she and i maintained a close friendship through text and social media. we talked often about everything. she got engaged to her boyfriend, they bought a house and began planning their wedding which i was invited to. it was postponed 2 different times due to the lockdowns. by the time it finally happened in the fall of 2022 i had not seen her since early 2020. a friend of hers whom i didnt know added me to fb and invited me to the bridal shower. the bridal shower invite asked that a gift related to the home would be appreciated but not mandatory. 

at this point i was still not completely back to normal in terms of socializing and i was working through my anxiety about being maskless in crowds. i told my friend that i likely would not be coming to the wedding for that reason, in addition to the fact i literally would know absolutely nobody in attendance except the bride, and i would likely see very little of her that day anyway. she understood and was not upset. 

after her wedding i dropped off a gift to her house; a breakfast griddle and a stainless steel french press for coffee, a card with a nice congratulatory note and 100 in cash. she thanked me via a fb message and seemed appreciative. 

in the 2+ yrs since the wedding, ive gotten myself back to normal and we have begun hanging out again fairly regularly, usually just the two of us attending concerts, but we've also since met a few of each other's friends and gone on a short vacation out of town with our S.O's, i now know her husband fairly well too. 

this is the thing though, she very regularly talks about her wedding and tells stories about how fun it was, and the fact everyone gave her 400 dollars as a wedding gift. 400 is the magic number she brings up all the time lol she brings it up in the most bizarrely innocuous ways but i cant help but get the impression its a dig at what i gave her. she has even said ""my cleaning lady who came to my wedding didnt give me a gift but she offered me free cleaning services totally 400 dollars"". what i gave her totaled just over 200, but considering i didnt even attend the wedding and had not seen her in almost 3 yrs and didnt even know any of her friends and family, i actually thought what i gave her was fine. but i think she considers me cheap now. 

she and i actually get along very well, we have never had any fights or anything like that. she has worked in the restaurant industry her whole life, as a server and bartender, and most of her friends are in that industry as well. where i work for the government. during covid i worked from home (and still do) and she was affected financially more than me so im not sure if that is playing into it, and maybe she was expecting a bigger gift. it really does make me uncomfortable when she brings it up, especially considering its been years now. 

so im just looking for honest opinions, was my gift inadequate? i honestly have never given a gift for a wedding i didnt attend, that was a first. Its obviously far too late now to rectify it regardless but id like some outside opinions on this.

im so sorry for this post being so long.

Yeah, we‚Äôve all been there. 

Toilet seats are like the uninvited guests of adulthood‚Äînecessary, but rarely enjoyable. Enter the¬†**toilet seat cushion**, the underrated MVP of bathroom comfort. 

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this little gem changed my cold, miserable mornings into something resembling cozy. And trust me, once you try one, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever survived without it.

But wait‚Äîaren‚Äôt these just for grandma‚Äôs house?¬†*Absolutely not.*¬†Let‚Äôs dive into why these cushions are a game-changer, how to pick the right one, and why your backside will thank you later.

# Why Your Toilet Seat Needs a Cushion (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Not Just About Comfort)

# The Cold, Hard Truth About Toilet Seats

Let‚Äôs face it: porcelain was¬†*not*¬†designed with human comfort in mind. Winter mornings turn your throne into a mini polar expedition, and let‚Äôs not even talk about those awkward middle-of-the-night bathroom trips. A cushion acts like a¬†**thermal barrier**, sparing you from the shock of a seat that‚Äôs colder than your ex‚Äôs heart.

But it‚Äôs not just about temperature. Ever sat for too long and felt your legs go numb? Cushions distribute your weight better, reducing pressure points. Translation: no more awkward waddling out of the bathroom.

* [LuxeGrip Non-Slip Cushion](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/toilet-seat-cushion-review/)

# Beyond Comfort‚ÄîThe Secret Perks

FYI, toilet seat cushions aren‚Äôt just for your tush. Here‚Äôs what most people miss:

* **Easy cleanup:**¬†Spill coffee? Kid missed the bowl? Most cushions are wipeable or machine-washable. Take¬†*that*, gross toilet seats.
* **Style points:**¬†Yes, really. Modern designs range from sleek neutrals to quirky patterns (looking at you, avocado-shaped cushions).
* **Accessibility:**¬†For folks with arthritis, injuries, or mobility issues, cushions make sitting down less of a Olympic-level maneuver.

# How to Pick the Perfect Cushion (Without Getting Scammed)

# Material Matters‚ÄîAvoid the ‚ÄúCheap Squish‚Äù Trap

I learned this the hard way. My first cushion was a $5 foam disc from a discount store. Within a week, it looked like a deflated balloon.¬†**Pro tip:**¬†Prioritize these materials:

* **Memory foam:**¬†Contours to your shape, but avoid overly dense versions (they‚Äôll harden like a brick).
* **Waterproof PU leather:**¬†Wipeable, durable, and doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúgrandma‚Äôs house.‚Äù
* **Bamboo or cotton covers:**¬†Breathable for hot climates, but check if they‚Äôre removable for washing.

# Size & Shape‚ÄîBecause One Size Does¬†Not¬†Fit All

Not all toilets (or butts) are created equal. Measure your seat before buying! Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

* **Round vs. elongated:**¬†Match your toilet shape, or the cushion will slide around like a drunk penguin.
* **Thickness:**¬†1‚Äì2 inches is ideal. Too thick, and you‚Äôll feel unstable; too thin, and what‚Äôs the point?
* **Non-slip backing:**¬†*Essential.*¬†If it doesn‚Äôt have grips, prepare for a slapstick-worthy bathroom disaster.

# My Top Picks‚ÄîCushions That Won‚Äôt Let You Down

After testing 12(!) cushions (yes, I have no life), here are my ride-or-dies:

# The 10-Second Setup Guide

1. Clean the seat (because, ew).
2. Align the cushion‚Äôs elastic straps or adhesive strips.
3. Press down firmly. Done. If it takes longer than this, you‚Äôre overcomplicating it.

# Keep It Fresh‚ÄîCleaning Hacks

* **Weekly:**¬†Wipe with a Clorox wipe (for waterproof models).
* **Monthly:**¬†Toss removable covers in the washing machine. Use cold water to avoid shrinkage‚Äîunless you want a cushion fit for a Barbie toilet.
* **Stubborn stains:**¬†Mix baking soda and water. Scrub gently, then air dry.

# H2: ‚ÄúBut Do I¬†Really¬†Need This?‚Äù‚ÄîAnswering Your Skepticism

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the bathroom:¬†*‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this extra?‚Äù*¬†Sure, if you enjoy numb legs and frosty seats. But for less than $30, you‚Äôre buying daily comfort. Think of it as a latte‚Äôs worth of cash for a year of cozy sits. Worth it? Uh,¬†*yes.*

# Conclusion: Stop Suffering‚ÄîYour Butt Deserves Better

Look, life‚Äôs too short for uncomfortable toilet seats. Whether you‚Äôre binge-watching Netflix or just trying to pee in peace, a cushion turns a mundane moment into a mini spa experience (okay, maybe that‚Äôs pushing it, but you get the idea).

So, what‚Äôs your move? Keep pretending you‚Äôre immune to cold porcelain, or finally give your backside the upgrade it‚Äôs been begging for? I‚Äôll let you decide. ;)

1je1uue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concerta/comments/1je1uue/36mg_dose/,36mg dose,"Hi everyone,

I had been diagnosed with mixed ADHD then put on 18mg for a month. This helped a bit in the first days, but for the rest of the time the only thing that improved was my sleep and anxiety.
I am now taking two pills of 18mg (for a higher dose of 36mg, as per the doctors orders). 

I wake up, take the pills and then half an hour to one hour I feel so sleepy that I immediately dose off if I lie down. My eyes become heavy and its difficult to keep them open (its that bad).

Unfortunately this still continues after one week and I cannot just have a nap in the morning, I have a lot of work to do at my job in the next two weeks. I made the mistake of drinking two cups of coffee in order to stay awake and that made my ADHD way worse:
I wanted to eat, put some potatoes in the air fryer.. forgot I was hungry. A few hours later, I realised again I was hungry, took some potatoes, open the air fryer - only to discover the ones from this morning, half cooked and cold. 
Wanted some eggs, so I put oil in the frying pan and turned the stove on. Then I realised I had a meeting. Forgot about the stove. During the meeting, I smell something burning.. I rush to the kitchen to find smoke and the empty frying pan. 

My question is. Should I go back to one pill of 18mg? Or do I completely stop the caffeine and just take a nap after the taking two 18mg pills? 

Its incredibly frustrated to be honest.. And I want to completely stop taking anything.. I dont think they help me at all.

Checklist:   
\* A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate  
\* Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time  
\* Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone  
\* a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.  
\* Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.  
‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy   
  
Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me.   
  
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

I‚Äôm looking for coffee recommendations for my Korea trip. I have been to Korea once a year for the last 3yrs and really struggle with the coffee. I reside in Australia and prefer espresso style vs pour over, drip etc., I also prefer my coffee strong. 

What I struggle with in Korea when I‚Äôve walked into random cafes or even well rated ones is that the coffee is usually weak. I look at the colour of other people‚Äôs iced lattes / americanos / top of the hot lattes etc., and based on this order 5-6 shots for my iced latte (in au I‚Äôd get 3-4). I don‚Äôt know whether this is the reason why but more often than not it tastes like an ashtray - bitter and burnt. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the reason though because the colour looks right and weaker coffees just taste milky with a background of burnt. 

For reference on what tastes good to me, I rate %arabica at Coex. I like their coffee because it‚Äôs strong and creamy(?) -  doesn‚Äôt have a bitter / burnt aftertaste. In Syd, I like Campos coffee. I enjoy other cafes too but this is more to provide a reference point on what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶

I really enjoy going to Korea (it‚Äôs my motherland) and this is the only worry I have each trip‚Ä¶ if anyone could advise of cafes that make a really good espresso style coffee that‚Äôs strong, kinda creamy without the bitter aftertaste in the vicinity of Voco Gangnam Sinsa Station as well as Anmok Beach Gangneung and Gwangalli Busan (other locations I‚Äôm visiting), I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

I‚Äôm looking for quite close by to my accommodation as I‚Äôm hoping to grab, drink and go vs having to travel to coffee each morning‚Ä¶

I work remotely and we are doing pretty well. never had a house in Australia and due to some family falling out circumstances, mixed with cost of living in Australia we decided to go see the world. we sold everything and are down to our suitcases! in a hotel room a few days away from arriving in BKK as we speak!!

I got a digital nomad visa approved as did my family supporting me. we went on a holiday to Bali a year ago, loved it and after doing my own research, Thailand felt like the place for us to be.

we are staying in Bangkok initially, might start with booking a hotel for a week, then a condo somewhere for 1 month at a time. we have no desire to be locked down for too long, so 1 month condos moving around BKK then Thailand is our current plan.

my wife is homeschooling our kids whilst we are here, I'll work on my laptop in a coffee shop or workspace somewhere.

this is extremely exciting for us, we have never left the country as a family and my wife and I have only been to Bali. we are so excited for this new adventure in our life and it's such a rare opportunity for us to be in that we wanna make the most of it.

The morning hums, the world feels light,
a day unfolds, it starts out right.
The coffee warms, my breath is slow,
for once, I‚Äôm fine with taking it slow.
No rush, no race, no grand design,
just baby steps, this pace is mine.

I see the path, it‚Äôs taking form,
no need for storms or to feel reborn.
A little work, a breath, a choice, some strength, some doubt.
The quiet voice that tells me ""change is never fast"".
Baby steps will make it last.

And then there‚Äôs you‚Ä¶ still hanging there,
a weight, a whisper in the air.
Not here, nor gone, just in between,
a quiet shift, a change unseen.
My heart still lingers, my mind moves on,
Not quite steady, but with baby steps.

And through it all, I start to grow,
In ways I thought I‚Äôd never know.
Less seeking answers, less holding tight,
More trust in me, more trust in light.

So here‚Äôs to mornings calm and free.
To baby steps and finding me.
