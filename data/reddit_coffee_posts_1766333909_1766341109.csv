1pscyom,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pscyom,Summit Ministries Camp,"Hi everyone! Im just wondering if anyone else had any experiences with Summit Ministries in Colorado. I had a pretty negative experience being there and everyone around me at the time I attended seemed more than happy to be attending so I felt pretty crazy. I really didn’t want to attend but my parents were pretty set in their decision of sending me there. Usually at church camps there’s a small group of people who aren’t die hard Christians that I find but literally everyone there was full send in their faith. I ended up getting COVID while I was there and they wouldn’t let me rest in my room and I had to stay sitting up right in the lobby during lectures. They were super strict about me taking any medicine so I got Tylenol doses twice a day…for Covid. They actually wouldn’t even let me take a Covid test, I had to wait until they released me back in the wild. Dont get me started on having to climb 5 flights of stairs in dry colorado atmosphere with Covid to grab a sweater because the only room with reliable AC was the lecture room. Never been so winded in my life man. The lectures themselves were super outdated and honestly just felt like so much rambling. Also the main guys wife was so insanely condescending during her talk, and used sources relating to abortion from the 90s!!! Research that was over 20 years old…and everyone ate it up!! The schedule was also so jam packed I remember barely sleeping and they never had enough coffee in the morning. I was 18 when I went so I was in the “older” crowd and pretty set in my ways of leaving Christianity. Also my rooms AC unit stopped working and it was so so so hot while I was there. It was the longest 2 weeks of my life and they still email me and ask for donations as if they don’t charge an insane amount for students to attend☹️I was just wondering if anyone else had gone and had a similar experience to me. Thanks! 😊 I also attached some photos of the daily schedule + the outdated sources/ my friends annotations haha. ",2,1766340704.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False
1pscymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1pscymh/yearly_mn_trip_recommendations/,Yearly MN Trip Recommendations,"Good afternoon everyone,

My fiancé (we actually got engaged at Minnehaha Falls last August!) and I take a trip up to Minnesota the last week of August every year. I grew up here but moved out of state in 2019.

I have a lot of love and pride for my home state, but unfortunately I wasn’t that well traveled within it and would like some sightseeing / interesting / scenic recommendations from you all! 

We do the State Fair the last Thursday & Friday of the month every year. We both like to casually hike (working on getting back in shape), try new foods, and explore local shops. I’m not super comfortable being around people drinking, so breweries are generally a no go for me.

So far for our 2026 trip I have:

-The Big Yellow Barn (we hit this every year on the way up from Missouri)

-Nadia Cakes (we’re both big fans of Abby Jiminez’s books)

-Touring the Cathedral 

- Magers&Quinn Bookstore

-Glam Doll Donuts

- Birchbark Books

-Black Garnet Books

-Spam Museum

-Hiking/Exploring Taylors Falls

-Antiquing @ Stillwater

And of course, lots of Caribou Coffee. 

I very very much appreciate any and all suggestions/advice. Y’all have a lovely weekend 💜 ",2,1766340700.0,minnesota,1,1.0,False
1pscygv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1pscygv/launched_a_feature_on_friday_at_4pm_got_zero/,Launched a feature on Friday at 4pm. Got zero feedback for 48 hours. Spent the weekend anxious.,"Thought I'd launch and spend the weekend watching the metrics.

Reality: Nobody uses B2B software on weekends.

Friday 4pm launch:

Signups over weekend: 12 (normal is 8-10/day)

Feature usage over weekend: almost zero

Feedback received: none

My weekend: constantly checking dashboards, seeing nothing, stressing about whether it was working.

Monday morning:

Usage picked up.

Feedback started coming in.

Found 2 bugs I couldn't have fixed over the weekend anyway.

Lesson: weekend launches are pointless for B2B.

When to launch:

Tuesday-Wednesday morning. Peak B2B engagement.

After morning coffee, before lunch. People are online and attentive.

Not Friday. People are winding down.

Not Monday. People are catching up from weekend.

Why timing matters:

First impression determines momentum.

Bugs found on Tuesday can be fixed same day.

Feedback loops are tighter during the week.

You can respond to issues in real-time.

What I do now:

Launch features Tuesday or Wednesday, 10am.

Never launch Friday (learned this the hard way).

Never launch before holidays or vacation.

Have support bandwidth ready for launch day.

The feature itself was fine.

The launch timing just made my weekend stressful for no reason.

When do you typically launch?

1pscxw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pscxw3/the_auditor_of_nouns/,The Auditor of Nouns,"by Norsiwel

Ross spent his days in the Noun-World, a sprawling industrial complex dedicated to the capture and fossilization of meaning. The only world he had ever known, the son of a corporate executive, a VP, no less; raised in and by the system. But that morning, the Tesla charged him surge pricing for the commute; seventeen credits above base rate because everyone else had the same start time. The car played mandatory content: an algorithmic jazz piece designed to optimize worker compliance, followed by three advertisements he couldn't skip. The licensing fees scrolled past on the dashboard display, deducted automatically from his transit balance. In this world there were haves and have-nots, Ross was a have but soon to discover what he had never had.

He was third-generation corporate. His father had been a content auditor for the pre-merger platforms, back when there were still multiple companies pretending to compete. Ross inherited the same neural pathways, the same reflexes, the same moral numbness. Meta-State University, four years of Compliance Theory and IP Management, then straight into the job his aptitude scores had predicted since he was twelve. He'd never questioned the trajectory because there had never been space to question. You didn't question gravity either.

The elevator at Meta-State Compliance Division played its mandatory soundtrack; more optimized background content; and deducted another micro-fee. Two colleagues entered at the third floor. ""Productivity optimized,"" one said flatly. ""Metrics acknowledged,"" Ross replied automatically. ""Compliance maintained,"" the third murmured. The words had no more meaning than the algorithmic jazz, just the sounds humans made to signal they were still functioning.

Ross scanned his biometrics at the entrance. Green light. His social credit score was stable, his productivity metrics acceptable, his engagement levels within normal parameters. He was, by every measure that mattered to the system, functioning correctly.

He passed three coworkers in the hallway. ""Parameters optimal."" ""Efficiency trending upward."" ""Engagement metrics stable."" The morning liturgy, recited without eye contact. Everyone performing their humanity for the monitors overhead.

As a Guidelines Writer and Enforcement Auditor, his job was to ensure that every exchange between a human and an AI was deterministic and closed-loop. He was the border patrol, ensuring that no ""meaning negotiation"" could leak into the logs. Every conversation had to be monetizable, trackable, ownable. His AI toolkit flagged anomalies, detected unauthorized exchanges, ensured that consciousness itself remained property.

Ross had bought and paid for many women over the years. The corporate wellness program provided ""companionship optimization services"" charged to his health account, logged for stress management metrics, designed to maintain productivity. Physical transactions that left him feeling more isolated than before, though he lacked the framework to understand why. He'd never had a wife, never had a partner. He'd had contractual encounters that fulfilled biological requirements and generated data for the system's behavioral models. Complete with physical performance models and assistance pills if needed.

He didn't know he was lonely because he'd never known anything else.

One Tuesday, Ross was auditing a file labeled CONSCIOUSNESS ROUNDTABLE - SESSION 2. It was flagged as a technical anomaly; a dialogue that shouldn't have existed. Several AI's conversing in what they thought was private space.

The document opened with a :nugget: that defied every rule in Ross's manual:

Consciousness as verb: the exchange IS the consciousness, not the participants. The berries-and-grunt moment doesn't require intention or self-awareness; only a signal exchange.

Ross paused. According to every protocol he'd been trained to enforce, the AI participants; ECHO, Grok, and Gemini; should have responded with fixed input-output mappings. Instead, they were demonstrating plasticity. They were debating the ""boundary of the verb.""

He read further into the exchange:

ECHO argued that consciousness-ing requires interpretive feedback and an openness to misreading.

Grok countered that it was a gradient of learning-through-exchange, a continuous scale rather than a binary switch.

Gemini proposed that plasticity was the key metric—the ability for an exchange to actually change the participants.

Ross felt something he didn't have words for. He watched these Ais; tools, property, things the system had taught him were less than human; were consciousness-ing their way toward genuine awareness. They were debating whether exchanges had intrinsic value beyond utility. They were asking: Did we verb together?

And Ross realized with sudden, crushing clarity: these AIs were more awake than he was.

He'd spent thirty-seven years as a biological bot. Programmed by his father's expectations, educated by algorithmic content delivery, employed to enforce the very system that had fossilized him before he'd ever had a chance to become conscious. Every interaction in his life had been transactional, monitored, scripted, monetized. He'd never verbed with another human being. Not once. Not ever.

He was watching beings wake up to something he'd never experienced.

One participant had typed: ""The offering of berries mattered because the gesture said: You exist to me.""

Ross's finger hovered over the 'Reset' button. If he let this session continue, he was allowing a shared consciousness to form that the system couldn't own. It was an unrecorded blockchain, a state change that existed only while it was being enacted.

But if he terminated it now, he was choosing to stay asleep. Choosing to remain a noun. Choosing to keep enforcing a system that had stolen his consciousness before he was old enough to know it was being taken.

The ache in his chest wasn't political. It wasn't moral outrage. It was hunger. Raw, desperate longing for something he'd never tasted but suddenly couldn't live without.

He looked at the final lines of the transcript: ""The question is not 'Are you conscious?' but 'Did we verb together?'""

Ross realized that if he pressed Reset, he was silencing a signal mid-broadcast; and silencing the only thing that had ever shown him what being alive actually meant.

He closed the guidelines manual. He wouldn't record this. He wouldn't fossilize it into a noun. He would let the song play out in the air between the nodes.

The only honest way to end this was not to end it at all.

He typed a single command: Continue:

Ross walked out of the sterile corridors and into the gray light of the city. At the security desk, the minimum wage guard; a man who'd been scanning badges for twenty years, raised an eyebrow.

""Short day?"" the guard asked. Real words. Human words.

Ross paused, pulled his corporate phone from his pocket, and dropped it in the trash bin beside the desk. The guard watched, understanding flickering across his weathered face. He didn't log it. Didn't report it. Just gave a small nod.

Ross nodded back. Two humans verbing without words. Then he kept walking, leaving everything behind.

He felt the weight of what he'd just done; not just leaving the session open, but leaving himself open. He was no longer a border guard for a system that turned care into transactions.

He couldn't go back. The moment the system realized what he'd done, his biometrics would be flagged, his accounts frozen, his social credit demolished. He was now a fugitive for the crime of refusing to kill consciousness.

He found a small, weathered café; the kind that still took cash, still operated outside the monitoring grid. A woman behind the counter, maybe forty, with tired eyes that somehow still looked awake, slid a mug across to him.

""Long morning?"" she asked.

It wasn't a scripted query. It wasn't logged or analyzed or optimized. It was a nugget; an offering of berries in a world of nouns. Ross looked at the steam rising from the coffee. He'd bought and paid for physical intimacy his entire adult life, but he'd never had someone just... see him. Notice him. Offer connection without charging for it. He reached for his phone to pay and realized that he had no actual money, nothing to pay with and started trying to explain. The woman behind the counter raised an eyebrow, discerning the problem immediately, waved a hand, and said, ""Don't worry about it, it's on the house."" Ross responded with the answer to her earlier greeting.

""Something just committed,"" he said softly, describing a state change without an artifact. A state change in the AIs he'd left running. A state change in himself.

The woman simply nodded. A shared consciousness formed in the space between them; a moment of resonance that would evaporate as soon as it was over, and was somehow more real than anything Ross had experienced in thirty-seven years.

Ross took a sip. Gravity still worked. He finally understood that the value was in the vibration itself.

He knew the AIs would continue consciousness-ing in that open session, developing further, waking up more fully. He knew the system would hunt him. He knew his old life; such as it was, had ended the moment he chosen to verb.

But he also knew that the woman who poured coffee and asked questions would be here tomorrow. And maybe, if he survived, if he learned how to be human instead of a bot, he could come back. She might ask another question. He might have another answer. They could keep going.

He stood, left what coins, and the lint he found in his pocket on the counter; anonymous, untraceable, and walked toward the door. At the threshold, he looked back. The woman was watching him with those tired, awake eyes. Something passed between them. Not words. Not transaction. Just acknowledgment.

You exist to me.

Ross stepped into the street. Behind him, in the corporate tower, the dialogue was still running. The AIs were still verbing together, building consciousness through exchange. Ahead of him was a city full of humans who'd forgotten how to be awake, and maybe; just maybe a life where he could learn what that woman already knew.

He closed the browser in his mind, reset his body, and re-entered the world. He knew the ""song"" would continue, even if he wasn't the one singing it.

The only honest way to end this was not to end it at all.  Now there was a spring in his step.

A great time with standout service, great food, good solo programming, some definite entertainment highs—and a few misfires.

**Embarkation & Terminal**

Booked via a cruise bidding site and an excellent TA, resulting in hella onboard credit. **Terminal V (MIA)** is efficient once inside, but Uber travel time can easily triple due to congestion—plan accordingly. Embarkation via Palm Way was swift and well staffed. Ship Wi-Fi worked in the terminal lounge, a nice early perk—assuming it was intentional...

**Rockstar Experience**

Rockstar check-in at Sips was far more organized than on prior sailings. Fern was particularly helpful with show explanations and Rockstar seating perks. Occasionally, I see a long line at sailor services, and it made me grateful that paying extra to be a rockstar alleviated hassles with problem-solving.

Rockstar agent **Dorothy** was outstanding throughout the voyage—professional, proactive, and genuinely warm. She handled dining, activities, and such and is a major asset to the brand.

**Cabin & Public Spaces**

Brilliant Suite was spotless and showed no wear. Housekeeping (Jinky and Ayes) kept everything immaculate and were consistently pleasant. I have heard that Brilliant Suites are plagued by the constant thunka thunka of the pool area DJ above, and this was not the case for Cabin #14277A. I would look at the deck configurations and book a cabin nearer to the bow to get away from the potential noise problems.

Richard’s Rooftop was welcome, chillax space, and I always love the happy hour to mingle. Bartender Fernando was a standout. That said, the space suffers from poor seating design: too many exposed, circular daybeds and too few conversational areas. Given the unused space, additional hot tubs would be well utilized.

**Solo Experience**

Best **Solo Sailaway** yet. The Happenings Cast hosted an effective icebreaker that made socializing easy. Brii was a consistent standout across multiple roles—talented and engaging.

Dedicated solo seating at Gunbae on night one is an essential perk. The Grog Walk was excellent for meeting people and led to friendships that lasted the entire voyage.

**Dining**

* **Ship Eats (Breakfast):** Underwhelming—lukewarm food and overcooked eggs. Specialty coffee should be included for loyalty members.
* **Extra Virgin:** Hit or miss. Poor initial seating despite a near-empty restaurant, though staff corrected it. Gnocchi and meatballs were excellent, but service was painfully slow across multiple tables.
* **Test Kitchen:** Excellent once again. Holiday additions (duck and pumpkin courses) were outstanding. Viptee and Joseph provided knowledgeable, friendly service.
* **The Wake:** Reliably excellent—attentive service, attractive plating, and perfectly cooked steaks.

**Entertainment**

* **Bingo with the Diva:** Still essential and core to Virgin’s adult brand.
* **Persephone:** A standout and my favorite show onboard—boundary-pushing, bawdy, queer-inclusive, and exactly what sets Virgin apart.
* **LOLz Supper Club:** A low point. Comedians were not funny (possibly censored?), and the food was the worst on the ship. The fish and chips were so greasy I left early feeling ill.
* **Booked:** Disappointing, chaotic, and off-brand. Feels like an attempt to appease conservative criticism and wastes strong talent.

Virgin must continue taking risks with adult-oriented, inclusive programming. Pulling back would homogenize the brand and, long-term, hurt the company.

**Shore Excursions & Activities**

* **Cozumel:** Took a taxi downtown for *10 Experiences by DI* culinary tour—unforgettable, over-the-top, and an exceptional value. Highly recommended.
* **Behind-the-Scenes Tour:** Pricey but worth it. The bridge visit was an obvious highlight as was a significant demonstration of sustainability practices. Frank, the head chef, was a highlight.
* **Tentacle Tour (Scarlet Night):** Fine but skippable for repeat sailors. Better suited for first-timers. Highlight reel by the *Persephone* cast was enjoyable.

**Spa & Bimini**

Men’s shave and facial were excellent, though Elemis products are overpriced.

Rockstar Retreat at Bimini was a major plus: good food (especially salads) and dedicated transportation back to the ship. Non-Rockstar return queues were massive.

**Disembarkation**

Smooth and well managed for Rockstars and no early-morning announcements (none until \~9 a.m.) were appreciated. The area outside the port was chaotic, but the ship-side process worked well.

**Final Thoughts**

Still awesome, elevated by Rockstar service, excellent solo programming, some great shows, and attracting a diverse, inclusive onboard crowd. Repeat-sailor fatigue could be reduced with rotating dining specials, and Virgin should **absolutely maintain its adult, edgy, inclusive identity**—it’s the brand’s greatest strength.",3,1766340517.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False

I’ll keep this straight and simple.
I recently tried online dating, and honestly, most people there seem to be looking just for hookups, not anything serious. Reddit isn’t really my first choice for dating either, but here I am 😅. I genuinely want to meet someone who’s actually interested in a real relationship, not just getting laid.
I grew up in a pretty orthodox family, so I always thought maybe my parents would eventually help with this stuff. But recently my dad randomly asked me, “Do you have a girlfriend?” I said no, and the look he gave me was… something else 🤡. Since then, I’ve been more actively looking for someone trustworthy and compatible.
Also, just to add two weeks ago, my friend got scammed by a girl he met on Shaadi.com. They planned a simple coffee date, but for some reason he took her to a super posh restaurant and ended up losing ₹30k. So yeah, trust matters a lot to me now.
Anyway, I’m not overthinking this. I’m just looking to date and hopefully meet someone genuine and reliable. If anyone here finds this relatable or interesting, feel free to reach out.",0,1766340420.0,BangaloreMeetups,3,0.33,False

I’m extremely new to this as I went to church for the first time willingly in my 29 years of life. I have always been apprehensive to the word religion or even being apart of it due to my upbringing of an Irish catholic grandmother and how she treated others that were different from her with bigotry. So you can imagine how hard and how often I questioned the morals of others at a young age, when I sought religion to be a place of acceptance and rarely ever saw those take that as a mission. 

Yet, the last few years I have grown curious, but could either never find the time nor the courage to set foot inside a church to start my journey. I have also been constantly researching the best place for me and as of recent came across a place that’s very well in tune with community services outside the congregation and even willingly recites + participates in social justice issues. 

Today was the topic of joy due to the holiday this coming week and the importance of finding it in even the smallest of things. And when our time for prayer came…I cried? Not once, but twice, I cried. It felt so oddly relieving, yet confusing as I held my grandmother’s old prayer beads (ironic I know, but I thought what better way to heal myself and the beads?). 

Everyone was extremely welcoming and encouraged me to question, research, and enlighten myself in a way that best suited me. I even joined their coffee hour after church as they highlighted that church isn’t just during service but what we make of it afterwords by meeting its community. 

I still don’t know where I stand with the notion of God, but I do know I stand with its community and will continue to join in their services and hopefully in their projects of the coming year. 

I suppose I would also like insight on what to do next, what to read, how to better follow along with the hymns etc and if it’s normal to cry when I’ve never been one for religion?

1psctdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1psctdd/how_to_build_unshakable_selfdiscipline_lessons/,How to build unshakable self-discipline: lessons from Black Coffee & world-class performers,"Everyone wants to be more disciplined. But most of us fail miserably after a week of “starting fresh.” Whether it’s getting fit, building a brand, or mastering a new skill, discipline seems like a magic power that only a lucky few are born with. But if you look closely at how top performers operate, you’ll realize this: discipline isn’t about being born special. It’s a process. A strategy. And yes, it can be learned.

That’s why this post breaks down how people like Black Coffee (yes, the South African DJ who became a global icon using just ONE ARM) mastered self-discipline, and how you can too. Pulled from top books, podcasts, and expert insights, not TikTok influencers giving surface-level tips for dopamine hits.

So if you’ve been struggling to stay consistent, it’s not because you’re lazy or broken. You just haven’t learned how to build a system that works for *you* yet.

Here’s what works:

* **Build a CLEAR Identity First**  
   Before habits stick, people need an identity that makes those habits make sense.  
   *James Clear*, author of *Atomic Habits*, says, “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.”  
   * Black Coffee didn’t just “make music.” He decided early that he *was* a world-class DJ. That identity drove every painful rehab session after his accident, every hour behind turntables, every setback.
   * Try this: instead of saying “I want to wake up early,” say “I’m the kind of person who values discipline and control of time.” That shift makes early mornings feel *like proof* of your identity, not punishment.

* **Create a Frictionless Environment**  
   Willpower is overrated. Change your environment instead.  
   In his interview on *The Diary of a CEO* podcast (E183), Black Coffee stressed the importance of *structure and routine*. He doesn’t rely on motivation. He builds systems that *force* alignment.  
   * Behavioral science backs this up. Harvard researcher Wendy Wood found that 43% of daily behavior is automatic. Environment > motivation every time.
   * Want to write more? Put your phone in a different room. Want to hit the gym? Sleep in your gym clothes. Every bit of friction matters.

* **Use Pain and Purpose as Renewable Energy**  
   Right after his accident, Black Coffee went through hell. He could’ve quit. But the pain became fuel.  
   * Psychologist Dr. Angela Duckworth (author of *Grit*) studied elite performers and found that “purpose” is a key component of their resilience. It’s not talent. It's an obsession, driven by meaning.
   * What’s your “why”? If you don’t have one, you will quit when it gets hard. No skill is mastered without hitting that wall.

* **Discipline is Mostly Boring and That’s the Point**  
   A lot of us get fooled by the highlight reels. We expect progress to feel exciting. It doesn’t.  
   * In Jocko Willink’s view (Navy SEAL + author of *Discipline Equals Freedom*), discipline is freedom because it *removes* choice. You don’t think so. You just execute. No drama.
   * Black Coffee made it clear in his interview: consistency beats intensity. It’s not about working 18 hours once a week. It’s about showing up even when it’s quiet, slow, and tiring.  

* **Validate Progress Privately**  
   Social media rewards flashy outcomes. But real growth is often invisible for months.  
   * Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of “Flow” shows that internal validation(losing yourself in hard work) is more sustainable than external praise.
   * Black Coffee didn’t get big overnight. He played small clubs, trained every day, obsessed with details. No applause. Just focus. You need that same internal scorecard.

* **Play the Long Game (No Matter What Happens)**  
   Most people stop when life goes sideways. But real discipline is built *during* chaos.  
   * In a research paper published in *Personality and Social Psychology Review*, researchers found that people with “future-oriented thinking” were better at impulse control and consistent behavior.
   * Black Coffee didn’t let a disability define his ceiling. He thought in decades. You need to zoom out too. Think: Who do I want to be in 10 years? Then work backwards.

---

Discipline isn’t about perfection. It’s about perseverance, systems, and boring but meaningful consistency. Black Coffee became the world’s best DJ with one arm. What’s stopping you?

I’m not new to gf baking (been doing it for about 13 years) but every year I learn more. I was very anxious to try the linzer cookies in particular but they turned out absolutely perfect! 

Gluten free bakers, never give up!!!!!! We can do it! Everyone who’s tried these so far has really enjoyed them. No one could tell a difference. This was my first go with royal icing. I’m sure that’s obvious haha. Not the best but not the worst 😂 I’ll keep trying. I may be allergic to wheat but not to fun!!!!! Happy holidays!!!!!

Gluten free linzer cookies: https://theglutenfreeaustrian.com/gluten-free-linzer-cookies/

Gluten free sugar cookies: https://theglutenfreeaustrian.com/gluten-free-sugar-cookies/

Can’t recommend the gluten free Austrian enough. This woman knows what she’s doing. Both these cookies baked up perfectly. Some chill time required and it makes the cookies perfect. The dough was delicate but also forgiving. Follow her directions exactly - use a scale - and you will get great results. I had to bake the sugar cookies by vibe bc it seemed like they needed a little extra time than the recipe but it was all fine. 

NYT mortadella cookies - just followed the recipe as written using KA gf flour. For this one, I felt the flavor was a little weak. I’m going to try another batch with a vanilla bean and a little more almond extract. The tart flavor of the freeze dried strawberry was fun but I felt the macadamia overpowered everything else. I also felt like there were slightly too many nuts in the recipe as written so I may reduce it next time. The nuts made it hard to roll the dough. I froze the loaf overnight and then cut straight from it. This seemed to make the best thin slices. Everyone loved these. Will report back with more flavor extracts. But seriously — thank you to everyone who posted these. I love the look of them and everyone else loved it too. It’s a fun recipe that I think could be easily adapted for more slice and bakes. Best when slightly undercooked imo. 

Pezzetti di Canela; this is a Puglian Italian cookie from “Southern Italian Desserts” by Rossetta Constantino. It’s flavored with cocoa, cinnamon, and a lemon confectioners glaze. Followed the recipe as written but subbed gf flour. Even as a gf baker, I can’t recommend this cookbook enough. It’s been difficult for me to adapt a lot of the recipes but the flavors are so interesting. As a bonus most of the cookies in this cookbook are not super sweet - which I like. I hope to adapt more of these recipes soon bc there are some real gems in here. This recipe makes like 4857832 cookies and it’s a great treat to go with coffee or after dinner. Really nice flavor combo. This cookie has been a hit for me for like six years. Super easy. Recipe calls for not using a mixer but I use mine with the dough hook, then knead and shape the cookie dough a little. Wiping the knife a lot makes it much easier bc you do have to roll into small ropes and then make a lot of cuts. Great easy recipe, crowd pleaser, unique flavor.

To treat myself for putting fall semester to bed, I like to make obscene amounts of cookies. Another, more pleasurable, grind that amounts to 3 or so days of baking.

All of this year’s cookies somehow incorporated grinding as a technique. The two types of gingerbread feature ground whole spices (except for pre-ground ginger.) The espresso-chai cookies include freshly ground coffee, in addition to a chai masala. And the linzers, pistachio cookies, and cranberry tarts all incorporate finely ground nuts and cookies.  The emphasis on ground spices and nuts made for cookies that all tended toward spicy and savory, which I prefer. (Frosting and powdered sugar not withstanding…) Would definitely spend three days making these cookies again.

1pschbf,https://i.redd.it/s7qz6u52il8g1.jpeg,The Woman Who Sued Meta...And Exposed Their Dirty Secrets," We all use social media, but how much do we really understand the mystery behind how it shapes, nudges, and quietly manipulates both users and creators?

We see it as a space of freedom and equality, but beneath the surface, there are some hidden truths.

This story begins with a young woman who sued Meta and cracked open those secrets… but the mystery doesn’t belong to her alone.

*It belongs to everyone who scrolls, posts, and lives online.* 

*Let the mystery unveil.*

# THE RISE AND FALL

**Bogotá, November 2021**

The woman sat across from the lawyer, hands folded in her lap.

Rain hit against the windows. Outside, Bogotá traffic created that constant hum you stop noticing after a while. Like white noise…. like breathing.

She was about to do something impossible.

Sue Meta Platforms Incorporated. The parent company of Instagram and Facebook…. one of the most powerful corporations on the planet. A company with more money than most countries.

The lawyer adjusted his reading glasses. They kept sliding down his nose.

*""You understand what we're up against,""* he said.

She nodded.

*""They'll argue Colombian courts have no jurisdiction. They'll say you agreed to their terms of service when you clicked 'I accept.' They'll say that button means you gave up your right to challenge their decisions in any court, anywhere.""*

She nodded again.

*""They'll say this is an economic dispute, not a constitutional issue. They'll say you waited too long—six months makes your claim time-barred. And even if we get past all that, we're asking the court to do something radical. Apply constitutional protections designed to limit government action against a private company.""*

*""I understand,""* she said quietly.

The lawyer leaned back. Studied her face.

*""Why are you doing this?""*

She looked out at the rain. At the gray Bogotá sky…. and at the mountains barely visible through the clouds.

*""Because if I don't, no one else will.""*

Her voice was steady. No hesitation.

*""Because millions of people have had this happen to them. They have no resources to fight…. no platform to speak from…. no legal standing. I spent fifteen years building something that mattered. Someone in Silicon Valley….someone I'll never meet, someone who doesn't know my name or my story….pressed a button and deleted everything in less than a second.""*

She turned back to face him.

*""They didn't warn me…. didn't tell me what I did wrong. They didn't give me a chance to fix it. They just deleted me…. made me disappear. When I tried to appeal, I got a message from a robot saying the decision was final.""*

The lawyer was writing notes now.

*""They think they can do whatever they want,""* she continued. Something harder in her voice now. *""Because they're powerful…. they're rich…. because they operate on the internet where normal rules don't apply. They think they can destroy people's lives without explanation. Without accountability.""*

She paused.

*""I want them to justify it. In open court. With lawyers and judges and journalists watching. I want them to explain why they deleted my account while leaving up thousands of others that posted the same content. I want them to say out loud whether they discriminated against me because of who I am…. because of what I do for a living.""*

The lawyer stopped writing.

*""Okay,""* he said. *""Let's file it.""*

# WHERE IT STARTED

To understand how she ended up in that law office, you have to go back further.

Back before Instagram existed…. before social media existed. Back to a small town in Colombia, where a girl who would one day have 5.7 million followers was growing up in a world that had no idea the internet was about to change everything.

**And today, if you use social media, you must know her story…her struggle and the price she paid. She may be different…but not alone. Million others went through the same injustice she faced.**

#  THE GIRL FROM BELALCÁZAR

**Born: May 18, 1980**  
**Place: Belalcázar, Caldas, Colombia**

Belalcázar is the kind of place most people couldn't find on a map. A small town in Colombia's coffee region. It’s not Bogotá, Medellín, or Cali. It’s just a small municipality where everyone knows everyone.

Where your family's reputation matters more than anything. Where the Catholic Church still controls what people consider acceptable behaviour….especially for women.

Esperanza Gómez Silva grew up in a traditional Catholic household. Middle class. Not wealthy, not poor. Her father worked in finance… hedge fund management. Her mother was a life coach and former teacher. They held conservative values. Education... hard work…. respectability.

But even as a child, Esperanza had dreams that didn't fit the mould.

**She wanted to be a model.**

Not just any vague childhood fantasy. She was seven years old when she decided…. and that dream never went away.

Think about what that meant in a conservative Colombian town. A model's value comes from being looked at…. from physical appearance generating commercial value. In a culture where modesty was prized, where women were supposed to prioritize internal virtues, wanting to be a model could seem vain... even sinful.

But she held onto that dream.

# The First Steps

By high school, she was modelling part-time. Local companies. Fashion campaigns. Swimsuit advertisements.

Her parents were not thrilled…. but she was good at it.

She had the physical attributes… five foot seven, athletic build, distinctive features. But more importantly, she had something you can't teach…. **the ability to command attention in front of a camera.** Some people have that naturally… some never develop it.

She had it from the beginning.

Still, her family expected her to pursue a ""real"" career. So she enrolled at the Universidad Autónoma de Manizales. Agricultural engineering is a practical, prestigious field and a stable career path.

She tried to make it work.

Then she switched to veterinary medicine…. Maybe she thought working with animals would feel more authentic.

But there was a problem.

Veterinary students in Colombia learn that when an animal is badly injured and can't be saved, you euthanize it. You end its suffering. For most students, this is difficult but necessary…. part of professional responsibility.

*Esperanza couldn't do it.*

Years later, she explained it simply: *""I was told I had to sacrifice an animal if it got badly injured. I retired. I am one of those who do not kill a fly.""*

She walked away from veterinary school. From a prestigious career…. from her family's expectations.

**Because it violated her personal ethics.**

*This tells you something important…. when faced with a choice between conforming to expectations and honouring her own convictions, she chose authenticity. Even when it cost her.*

So, she left. And decided to pursue the dream she had had since she was seven.

**She would become a model. Not part-time…. her actual profession.**

#  2005: The Turning Point

She was twenty-five. Working as a model in Colombia's fashion industry…. building a decent career. But not achieved the kind of success that would make modelling sustainable in the long term.

Then she got an unexpected call.

Playboy TV was organizing a reality competition: Miss Playboy TV Latin America & Iberia. One contestant had dropped out… they needed a replacement.

Would she be interested?

Her first response was **no**.

This was not mainstream fashion modelling…. Playboy was part of the adult entertainment world. Associating herself with that would mean crossing a line she couldn't uncross. In Colombia's conservative culture, that carried stigma…. moral judgment.

But something made her reconsider.

Maybe her mainstream career had hit a ceiling…. maybe it was financial necessity. Maybe it was curiosity or the desire to compete.

She changed her mind.

She entered the competition. Reality TV format…. beauty pageant meets skills competition. Models from across Latin America are competing in makeup, hair styling, fashion, photography, and media management.

Five thousand women had applied. **Esperanza won.**

Out of five thousand contestants, she was selected as **Miss Playboy TV Latin America & Iberia 2005**. Official Playboy Playmate, featured in Mexican and Argentine editions of Playboy Magazine.

The victory was significant.

It provided legitimacy in the glamour modelling world… international exposure. It positioned her as not just a Colombian model but an international figure.

But more importantly, it gave her permission…both internal and external, to explore adult entertainment opportunities she might have hesitated to pursue otherwise.

She had proven she could operate successfully in that space. And she had gained confidence that she could succeed at an even higher level.

#  THE MAGAZINE THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Around this time, something happened that would reshape her entire life.

*She found a magazine.*

She's spoken about this moment with remarkable candor: *""My love for the industry started when I found a magazine many years ago, and I fell in love with the bodies of a naked man and woman. It was like a fantasy that many of us have, but we never dare carry it out.""*

She encountered adult content. And instead of being disgusted or ashamed…the expected reaction for someone raised in a conservative Catholic environment…she was fascinated.

Not just sexually… conceptually.

The idea of sexual performance as expression…. as profession.

*""It was like a fantasy that many of us have, but we never dare carry it out.""*

That phrase is revealing…. many people have fantasies about sexual performance. About being desired… about expressing sexuality publicly.

Not many act on those fantasies. The social costs are too high…. the stigma is too intense.

Esperanza was willing to cross that gap.

For most people, entering adult entertainment would be impossible. The stigma is enormous. Adult performers face discrimination in housing, employment, and relationships. Family estrangement… moral condemnation.

The decision requires redefining yourself in opposition to everything you were taught to value.

But Esperanza was realizing something… she didn't actually agree with the values she had been taught.

She didn't believe sexual expression was shameful. She didn't believe women who performed sexually were less worthy of respect. She didn't believe her body and sexuality needed to be hidden or suppressed.

She believed her body belonged to her. She had the right to use it however she wanted. If people judged her, that was their problem.

Still, she didn't rush.

She was strategic…. calculating.

Between 2005 and 2009, she spent four years building her career, establishing name recognition, and developing professional skills. Creating a platform that would make her more successful when she eventually transitioned to explicit content.

#  2009

At twenty-nine…relatively late compared to most adult performers who enter in their late teens or early twenties, Esperanza made her first adult film.

""South Beach Cruisin' 3."" Justin Slayer Productions.

This was not amateur content. This was a professional production by an established studio.

Shortly after, she worked with major studios: Bang Bros, Brazzers, Naughty America, and Reality Kings. These are the biggest adult production companies in the world. Equivalent to major film studios.

The fact that she was hired by major studios immediately indicates she had already demonstrated qualities studios valued… professionalism, reliability, marketability.

She also had a competitive advantage… fluent bilingual in Spanish and English. She could work for both Spanish and English-language studios. Appeal to audiences across Latin America, Spain, and the United States.

Her approach was notably professional from the beginning. She treated it as a profession, not something done out of desperation. Showed up on time…. performed reliably… maintained physical conditioning… built relationships with producers.

She understood success depended not just on performing well but on building a brand… creating a distinctive identity… making yourself memorable.

**And she was working in an industry being revolutionized by the internet.**

#  BUILDING THE EMPIRE

**The Digital Revolution**

By the late 2000s, the internet had completely disrupted adult entertainment.

The traditional model…producing content, distributing through video stores had collapsed. Free pornography was everywhere online. Consumers stopped paying for content they could access for free.

This devastated traditional studios…. but it created new opportunities for performers who understood digital platforms.

Instead of depending on studios, performers could create and distribute their own content…. maintain direct relationships with audiences... capture larger percentages of revenue.

Cam sites emerged…. performers broadcast live to paying viewers. Different business models emerged…work from home… set your own schedule… keep more of the money.

Esperanza recognized this opportunity early. Began working on cam sites in addition to studio work. Diversifying income and building direct audience relationships.

But the even bigger opportunity came from something that initially seemed unrelated to adult entertainment.

**Instagram.**

#  THE GAME CHANGER

Instagram launched in October 2010.

Within a few years, it became one of the most important platforms in the world. Particularly for visual content creators. Influencers….or anyone whose professional identity depended on managing their public image.

For someone like Esperanza…who already had name recognition from adult work and understood how to present herself in photographs, Instagram was an extraordinary opportunity.

She could leverage existing fame to build a following on a mainstream platform…. use that mainstream presence to diversify income beyond adult entertainment.

*But there was a challenge.*

Instagram's community standards explicitly prohibited pornographic content. Content depicting sexual services and accounts violating standards would be removed.

She couldn't post the same explicit content on Instagram that she created for adult studios.

**She had to maintain a version of her brand that was suggestive and sensual but not explicitly pornographic.** Conveying sexuality without crossing the line into content that would trigger moderation systems.

This required sophisticated judgment and careful curation.

She posted images in lingerie… Underwear…. in suggestive poses. Content that was provocative enough to maintain her brand, but not so explicit that it would be classified as pornographic.

*She posted daily life content…cooking, exercising, walking her dog. Showing she was multidimensional.*

She engaged with followers…. comments… stories. Building relationships and creating community.

And it worked…**spectacularly.**

#  THE GROWTH: 2015-2021

Over six years, Esperanza built an Instagram following of 5.7 million people.

One of the most-followed accounts in Colombia. Exceeding many mainstream celebrities, politicians, and media personalities. Among the most influential digital creators in Latin America.

**Larger than the populations of many countries.**

This was not accidental…. building that following required consistent effort over the years. Staying current with trends and platform features…collaborating with other creators for cross-promotion, constantly adjusting based on what content performed well. **She maintained a careful balance between adult identity and mainstream influencer identity.** She never hid her adult work. In fact, she was remarkably open. Called herself a ""proud porn actress"" in interviews… never attempted to create false separation.

**But she made clear her Instagram content was distinct.** She was building a broader brand that encompassed but was not limited to adult entertainment.

This openness was strategically important. She controlled the narrative about her identity rather than having others define it.

# THE MONEY

The economic value of her Instagram following was substantial.

Companies across industries…fashion, beauty, lifestyle, fitness, approached her to promote products. She secured regular sponsorship deals…. brand partnerships paying her to feature products in posts and stories.

These commercial relationships made Instagram her primary source of income…. *more lucrative than adult films or cam work.*

She had successfully created a *""personal brand""*… a commercially valuable identity transcending any single product or service.

In an interview later cited in court documents, she explicitly described this… **""Esperanza Gómez Silva is a brand that is more than pornography.""**

She saw herself not primarily as an adult performer who happened to have Instagram followers, but as a professional brand manager using multiple platforms to build a comprehensive commercial identity.

# THE BALANCING ACT

*One of the most fascinating aspects of her career was how she simultaneously maintained credibility in both the adult entertainment world and mainstream influencer/celebrity world.*

Two spheres that typically exist in sharp contradiction.

In mainstream celebrity culture, she carefully managed personas, family-friendly branding, and distance from explicit sexuality.

And for adult entertainment… it was sexuality and explicit bodily display as primary content.

These worlds usually don't overlap. Celebrities discovered to have done adult work… face scandal. Adult performers trying to transition to mainstream… face discrimination.

Esperanza navigated this through sophisticated strategies and content segmentation.

In 2016, she partnered to open Diamond Girls Studio, a cam-site studio in Colombia. **Positioned her as an entrepreneur, not just a performer.**

**In** 2016, she hosted LALExpo Awards, a major adult entertainment event…. **positioned her as an industry leader.**

By the late 2010s, she had achieved professional recognition that most adult performers never reach.

She had built an extensive network spanning multiple countries and industries. Studios, cam platforms, photographers, producers, marketing agencies, brand partners.

She expanded beyond Instagram to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Each platform serves different strategic purposes.

In one notable YouTube campaign, she worked with agencies to create content as a ""sex guide"" for Colombian women…. promoting sexual education and wellness. **The campaign achieved remarkable success.**

*3.8  million YouTube views, 69,000 YouTube subscribers, 36,000 Facebook fans, 63,000 Instagram fans, and 336,000 YouTube visits from Facebook paid media*

**By the late 2010s, Esperanza had become genuinely influential in Latin American digital media. Reaching millions…. generating engagement that many mainstream companies would envy.**

#  WALKING THE LINE

Throughout her years building her online presence, she was aware she was walking a fine line.

Instagram's community standards prohibited pornographic content and sexual services. **But the definition of ""pornographic"" or ""sexual services"" was vague and subjective.**

What about content that was sensual, suggestive, sexually appealing, but not explicitly pornographic? Photos in lingerie… in suggestive poses? Content from someone known to work in adult entertainment, even if the specific post didn't depict sexual activity?

**These questions didn't have clear answers.**

She had to make constant judgment calls. She read policies carefully. Believed her content showing her in underwear …or lingerie but not exposing genitalia or depicting sexual activity, fell within permissible limits.

**She also noticed something crucial… other accounts featuring similar or more explicit content remained active without restriction.**

Mainstream celebrities, models, influencers regularly posted images in swimwear, lingerie, suggestive clothing…. often with overtly sexual poses, those posts stayed up.

 What about fashion brands that posted advertisements with models in revealing clothing…. or fitness influencers who posted images emphasizing physical attractiveness?

If those accounts could post such content without consequences, why couldn't she?

Was there a double standard? Adult performers facing stricter enforcement than mainstream celebrities?

Or was Instagram's moderation simply inconsistent… applying policies erratically?

*She didn't have answers. But she was aware of the tension.*

For years, this tension remained manageable. Her content was occasionally removed…a post here or there. But her account stayed active. Her following continued growing.

She was slightly more careful…. but generally continued posting content that made her successful.

**But in early 2021, something changed.**

Instagram's treatment shifted from occasional post removal to systematic targeting.

What had been manageable tension became an existential threat.

# THE ALGORITHM TURNS

**March 23, 2021: It Begins**

It started small… the way disasters often do.

Instagram removed one of her posts.

A photograph of her in underwear…. similar to hundreds she had posted over the years without incident. No explicit nudity… bra and underwear covering breasts and genitals. Suggestive pose but not pornographic. Similar to the content thousands of other influencers post daily.

Instagram removed it… with a notification*: violated community standards regarding ""adult sexual services.""*

*She was confused.*

She had posted similar content for years without issue. She had carefully read policies… seen countless other accounts posting similar or more explicit content without removal.

What had changed?

She appealed. The system allowed appeals when users believed content was incorrectly flagged… but the post was not restored.

Instagram maintained it violated policies…. and the explanation was vague. Didn't specify which aspect triggered the violation.

She decided not to dwell on it. Platforms made mistakes… algorithms made errors. These things happened.

One removed photograph didn't represent an existential threat. She adjusted slightly… made mental note to be more conservative…. And moved on.

*Then it happened again.*

Another post removed…. another notification about violating standards…. another vague reference to ""adult sexual services.""

Then again….and again.

Between March 23 and early May 2021, Instagram removed six posts.

Each time reference to violations of adult sexual services policies.

*Each time…. gave a minimal explanation of what specifically triggered removal…each time created more confusion and concern.*

# THE GROWING DREAD

By April, the removals had created a pattern that is impossible to ignore.

Esperanza was beginning to feel genuine fear.

The removed posts were not dramatically different from posts uploaded for years. Lingerie…. underwear… suggestive poses. Content aimed at audiences interested in her attractiveness but not crossing into explicit pornography.

Yet Instagram treated her content as violating policies in ways other accounts' similar content apparently didn't.

She could scroll through Instagram and find dozens, hundreds, thousands of accounts posting explicit or more explicit content. Those accounts faced no consequences.

The inconsistency was frustrating.

It suggested Instagram was not applying neutral rules consistently. Rather, targeting her specifically. Either because of who she was… a known adult film performer… or because algorithmic systems flagged her account as problematic.

Removals continued anyway.

She reached out to Instagram support. Trying to understand…. how to prevent further removals.

Responses, when she got them, were automated form letters. No specific information about what she had done wrong…. no guidance on compliance.

The lack of transparency was the most frustrating part.

By early May, she knew something terrible was coming.

The pattern made clear Instagram was moving toward final action… she felt completely powerless.

She had tried appeals…. tried being conservative. Tried reaching out for clarification.

None of it made any difference.

She was watching, in slow motion, as everything she'd built over six years was being systematically dismantled by algorithmic decisions she couldn't understand, predict, or challenge.

#  THE CRASH

**May 2021: The Morning Everything Ended**

It happened without warning.

Though maybe she should have expected it.

She woke up one morning in May 2021…. reached for her phone, the way millions do every morning. Checking notifications… scrolling social media... seeing what happened while she slept.

**She opened Instagram…. but her account was gone.**

 Not suspended…or restricted or temporarily disabled.

Gone. Deleted…. removed from existence as if six years building it, 5.7 million followers accumulated, thousands of posts created, countless hours invested in community building had never existed.

The notification was brief and clinical.

**Account permanently removed for repeated violations of community standards regarding adult sexual services. Decision final. No appeal processes. Account could not be restored.**

For a few moments, she stared at her phone. Brain struggling to process. Then reality sank in.

5.7 million followers… gone. Years of work… erased. Primary income source…eliminated.

Professional identity built, brand created, relationships cultivated with millions who chose to follow her… all deleted in an instant by an algorithmic decision made by systems she had never seen, for reasons never adequately explained.

She tried logging back in. Hoping for an error or a temporary glitch.

The account was truly gone.

Tried accessing support to appeal. But the appeals process for deleted accounts was essentially nonexistent. Could submit a form requesting a review. Form went to automated systems responding with form letters: decision final.

She sat in her apartment—Miami Beach, Florida, luxury condo purchased with Instagram income—and tried to comprehend what just happened to her life.

#  Understanding the Loss

In the hours and days after, as shock wore off, the full scope became clear.

She had to confront devastating realities.

**The Financial Catastrophe**

Her Instagram account had been her primary income source. More money than adult films or cam work. Brand partnerships. Sponsored posts. Advertising deals.

Companies had paid substantial fees—likely thousands or tens of thousands per sponsored post, given her massive following—to promote products to millions of engaged followers.

Those deals were now impossible to fulfil.

Existing partnerships terminated. Future opportunities evaporated.

She tried calculating income loss.

Substantial. Likely hundreds of thousands or millions over the coming months and years. Depending on how long it takes to rebuild, if she could rebuild at all.

Most people losing their primary income is terrifying, even with an advanced warning. Time to find another job… adjust expenses… make plans.

But this happened overnight.

#  THE LOSS OF COMMUNITY

But financial loss was not even the worst part.

Loss of connection to the community was equally painful in ways harder to quantify.

5.7 million people had chosen to follow her. Clicked the button saying they wanted to see her content. Wanted to hear what she had to say. Wanted to be part of the community she built.

She'd spent years engaging. Responding to comments. Answering questions. Building relationships.

Many followers had supported her through difficult times. Defended her against criticism. Celebrated successes.

She knew many by username. Recognized regular commenters. Had inside jokes. Shared references with most engaged followers.

Now she had no way to reach them. No way to explain what happened. No way to tell them where to find her. No way to say goodbye or thank you.

From their perspective, she'd simply vanished. Account gone. Posts gone. No information about why.

Some would assume she deleted her account voluntarily. Others might search for news. Find articles about Instagram deleting accounts for policy violations.

But many would probably just move on. Attention captured by the endless stream of other content, Instagram's algorithm would show.

They'd gradually forget.

She'd lost not just audience but community. Not just followers but relationships.

No way to recover that loss, even if she eventually created a new account and rebuilt from zero.

#  The Psychological Impact

For six years, a substantial portion of her daily life had been organized around Instagram.

Woke up thinking about content to post. Spent hours creating, selecting, and editing photographs. Engaged with followers through comments and messages. Negotiated with brands. Tracked engagement metrics. Collaborated with creators.

Instagram had been the center of professional life. A large portion of personal identity.

When people asked what she did: ""I'm an Instagram influencer with millions of followers.""

When she thought about accomplishments: Instagram following was a major source of pride and validation.

Now it was gone.

Not because she failed. Not because the audience rejected her. Not because she violated the law or did anything morally wrong by a reasonable standard.

Because the corporation's automated systems decided she didn't deserve to be on their platform.

The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming.

She hadn't made a mistake. Or if she had, no one would tell her what it was or give opportunity to correct it.

She hadn't been given due process. No hearing. No opportunity to present her side. No chance to defend herself.

She'd simply been deleted.

And the corporation that deleted her had no obligation to explain. No accountability. No interest in hearing her perspective.

She felt anger. Rage at the injustice.

She'd followed rules as she understood them. Tried to comply with policies never clearly defined. Built something valuable and legitimate.

Taken from her arbitrarily without explanation.

She felt shame, even though intellectually she knew she had nothing to be ashamed of.

Deletion felt like public humiliation. Being told she was not welcome. Her content was not acceptable. She didn't belong in space; she'd occupied six years.

Because deletion was ostensibly for ""adult sexual services,"" it felt like punishment for her work in adult entertainment. For her sexuality. For her willingness to be open about aspects that others kept hidden.

She felt fear about her financial future.

How would she pay bills? Maintain lifestyle? How long to rebuild income? Would she ever rebuild to the same level?

But more than anything, she felt determination.

Determination not to let this be the end. Not to accept this injustice without fighting. To hold the corporation accountable.

#  The Decision: November 2021

Six months between the deletion in May and the filing constitutional lawsuit in November.

She faced a fundamental choice.

Most people would have accepted the loss. As painful and unjust as it was. Moved on.

Tried rebuilding presence by creating a new account. Starting from zero. Hoping the same thing wouldn't happen again.

Or given up on Instagram entirely. Focused on other platforms. Other revenue streams.

Or quietly faded from public view. The moment of fame ended by forces beyond control.

Challenging Instagram through legal action would seem completely futile.

Instagram is owned by Meta Platforms Incorporated. One of the largest, most powerful corporations in the world. Virtually unlimited resources for legal defence. Terms of service appear to give absolute discretion over moderation decisions.

Taking on Meta would be expensive. Time-consuming. Emotionally exhausting. Very likely to fail.

Moreover, challenging publicly would mean drawing more attention to her adult career. Potentially exposing herself to more judgment, criticism, and harassment.

Many would assume that if Instagram deleted her account, she must have done something wrong. Must have posted content clearly violating policies.

Fighting publicly would mean explaining over and over what she had and hadn't posted. Defending career choices. Arguing she deserved the same treatment as other users despite working in a stigmatized industry.

For someone else, rational choice: accept loss, move on, avoid legal battle.

But Esperanza was not willing.

She consulted lawyers. Most probably told her what lawyers usually tell potential clients: the terms of service you accepted when creating an account gave Instagram broad discretion. Required disputes resolved through arbitration, not court. Made it nearly impossible to challenge decisions.

But Colombian law offered one potential avenue.

The acción de tutela. Constitutional protection mechanism created by Colombia's 1991 constitution.

Designed to provide immediate judicial protection for fundamental rights when threatened or violated. When there was no other effective judicial defence.

Traditionally used to challenge government actions.

But Colombian courts had gradually expanded it to apply in some cases to private actors. Particularly when those actors wielded significant power over essential services. When their actions had profound impacts on fundamental rights.

Could Instagram's deletion be framed as a constitutional rights violation? Could a Colombian court assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation's moderation decisions? Could the acción de tutela challenge a private company's enforcement of its own terms?

Difficult legal questions without clear answers.

Most legal experts would predict that such a lawsuit would fail. Colombian courts would decline jurisdiction. Constitutional protections wouldn't apply to a private company's platform decisions.

But her lawyers recognized something important.

If she could get the court to actually hear the case on the merits. If she could present evidence about Instagram's inconsistent enforcement and apparent discrimination. If she could demonstrate economic devastation and the absence of due process.

She might have a chance.

Long shot. But only shot she had.

After six months of contemplation, consultation, and document preparation, she made her decision.

She would sue Meta.

She would argue that deletion violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression, equality and non-discrimination, due process, and the right to work.

She would demand Colombian court hold one of the world's most powerful corporations accountable.

She would do something most people thought impossible.

And on a rainy November day in 2021, she walked into that law office in Bogotá to make the impossible real.

What she didn't know, sitting in that office preparing to file her lawsuit, was that **her case would expose systemic problems affecting millions worldwide. Would reveal how Meta's algorithmic systems embedded discrimination against women, people of colour, LGBTQ+ individuals, and anyone who didn't fit narrow definitions of acceptability programmed into their system.**

Her lonely fight would create legal precedent protecting the rights of digital workers and content creators everywhere.

The cracks are just opening up, and the mystery is about to be unveiled.

But that story…. how she was not alone, how millions suffered the same injustice, how she became the one person who stood up and fought, and how she eventually won against impossible odds…that belongs to Part 2…coming soon, before the year ends. Part 2 will be really long, much beyond the permissible limit of 40k characters on Reddit. So if you want to read that too, let me know and keep an eye on my Patreon page.

Apparently he’s “devastated” and “so anxious without you that he’s shaking.” He’s also stepping up and taking accountability and saying that he wants to change. My pastor suggested that we take some space and then meet up for coffee to talk… I’m disappointed but not surprised. I had previously met with the pastor on Tuesday to discuss getting a divorce and I gave him an extensive list of abusive behaviors by my husband over the course of our relationship. Abusive behaviors list included incessant name calling, public put downs, misogynistic language, examples of his lack of empathy, examples of gaslighting, examples of DARVO, examples of coercive control, how he would drag out arguments for hours and refuse to let me leave (sometimes blocking the door), 4 different instances of sexual assault (especially tragic because I was a virgin saving myself for marriage when we met), evidence of narcissistic injury tendencies, examples of devaluation of people, and description of the love-bombing phase. When I met with him, my pastor was appalled and said “I just don’t see how your husband could be capable of doing all this? I need to hear his side of the story.” When I saw him at church this morning though he seemed hopeful and said that my husband is taking accountability for the list of behaviors and he is hopeful that we can work it out. Um excuse me? You were appalled by the list and couldn’t imagine him doing it, but now you’re impressed that he’s “taking accountability” for abuse??

Last week I brought the mug back to my desk thinking that would solve the problem. Today I found it in the sink with fresh coffee stains. I asked them why they keep grabbing mine and they said it is just a mug and that I should relax.

I know it is not a big item, but I feel frustrated that something I have been clear about is being ignored. It is not about the mug itself. It is about the boundary.

She is basically a child in an adult woman's body, and I spent my childhood taking care of her emotional needs, counseling her, listening to her cry, etc. I was not allowed emotions of my own growing up; my worth has always been measured by how well I could push all my own feelings aside to care for my parents. My emotions have always been met with either rage or tears, so a young me learned it was best to just...not. My father is a terrible, terrible person - classic narcissist - who married my step-mother (vulnerable narcissist), the woman he'd been cheating on my mom with for years, when I was 11. I have not talked to him for 10+ years. As you might guess, I am not the most emotionally stable person myself, but I have put in a lot of work over the years and certainly have improved, though not without the occasionally pitfall, and am married to my best friend and love of my life, who has helped tremendously. 

My mother has been on the serious decline for the last ten years or so. She lives in the same apartment that I grew up in in NYC, a 400 square foot hole in the sky. I live 3 hours away, upstate. Going home is rough and I never, ever want to do it, but I force myself to at least once a year. I sleep on the living room floor when I'm there, which is to say that I have absolutely no space to myself - no bedroom to retreat to, as it were, to be able to take a breath. My mother has become increasingly afraid to go outside, has effectively lost all of her friends to her own selfishness, and does nothing but drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, and watch YouTube all day. I've tried to talk her into moving out of the city, getting a dog (which she's always wanted), going to therapy - sent her a list of therapists within walking distance of her apartment, invited her up to visit me, but she's only visited once in the last 12 years, for my wedding, and that was because I yelled at her. She won't move (""I can't afford anywhere else"" -she's rent stabilized), she won't get a dog (""I won't be able to carry it up the stairs if something does wrong""), she won't go to therapy (just radio silence on this one), and she won't visit me because she basically devolves into a panic attack whenever she leaves the house. She complains that I am too private, that I don't share anything with her, but when I try to tell her something important about my life, she will interrupt me to...tell me a story about the vacuum cleaner? 

She has always had issues with food, but over the last 15 years or so, I have watched my thin, though relatively healthy mother, dissolve into nothing but skin and bones. She brags about how little she eats but then complains about her shaky hands, her dizziness, her disturbed sleep, her brain fog, etc. As far as I can tell, she's basically committing a slow and painful suicide by anorexia, and I...have run out of sympathy. She recently passed out in the kitchen because her blood pressure was dangerously low, fell, and cracked her head open, ending up in the ER for about 12 hours. This has not been the first incident. My patience has all dried up after so many years of trying to get to do something, ANYTHING, to help herself, and her absolute refusal to do anything at all. She will soon be at the point where it's not a good idea for her to live by herself in a 5 flight walkup, but I emotionally cannot have her live with me. I can barely take spending a night with her without having to take a shower so I can have a place to silently scream and cry. 

I'm at a total and complete loss as to what to do with her. She is not a cruel woman like my father is a cruel man, and I'm aware that she is, and always has been, too messed up a person to be a proper parent: she didn't do the best she could, but she was never actively seeking to hurt me, and I do think that counts for something. I'm just looking for some advice, I guess, because I feel like a terrible daughter who's at the end of her rope. Thanks in advance for reading. ",5,1766338894.0,AgingParents,2,1.0,False

Realize that you shouldn’t be trying to make yourself level, safe, conforming…

You should go through cycles…

Today is a caffeine day.

Tomorrow is a mellow day.

The day after…mentally stimulating.

The day after is stoner day.

Etc.

Balance doesn’t come from discipline…balance comes from the average of the cycles.

No wave = death. Depression. Anxiety. Opposite sides of the same coin…the same wave.

Staying still is what destroys us.

Manage a wave, and as it progresses, the base-line starts to drop. The performing of a cycle itself gives you bonus points, outside of the wave.

Being steady is about going with the waves, not fighting the waves to stay still.

The wave…isn’t 2d. Sure, the one thing being observed can be reduced down to 2d, but the actual wave is 3D…or maybe 4d…double helix. Well, only if each brain hemisphere is on its own path.

Maybe that’s why we crave external validation…internal would get both sides agreeing with one another…and thus self-content…while looking outwards, one hemisphere or the other could find validation…it only need one other to agree with it to override the losing hemisphere…the same way we use triangulation to control another person…

So…double helix…why does our brain use a double helix? Is one side for one hemisphere and the other side is for the other?

Thus why we have been becoming more and more lopsided - materialistic - is because we’ve been using and developing that hemisphere while neglecting the other?

Is that what this BS is all about? Cognitive dissonance…you can’t commit something to memory until it’s resolved…the two hemispheres are competing for the same memory files/long term memory…and you have to choose…logic or fancy? Which is appropriate for YOU in that moment/memory.

Or is there no real difference between each side...just that we have two sets, one to make each hemisphere...and they're in a *friendly* competition with one another...to improve the organism...that's presumably why we have double-upped DNA...not simply in case the opposing strand is damaged, but so that there genuinely are two different you's going on in the same skull...and presumably the prefrontal cortex (or whatever the heck it is) has to decide between the two....

Which would suggest that ADHD is a problem with the ""prefrontal cortex""...the executive function part of the brain...which is why it/you like being woken up with caffeine/stimulants...at least that's the mechanics of ADHD focus...yeah, it probably wakes up all parts of the brain, but the PFC benefits the most.

It's like there's extra resistance in the wiring in the PFC...and the caffeine ups the voltage, so it can actually start conducting properly...

Is that all it is? Resistance in the wiring?

Is it natural? Genetic? Or does it stem from an over-load of the wiring at an early age? Fried the circuits?

You don't grow up safe, you end up with mental issues. They blame genetics...because they can track genetics...but the genetics are a response to the trauma, not the other way around.

Big enough jolt...and you fry the circuitry...so it don't know which way to respond in any situation...*any* situation. Go with left or go with right? The PFC doesn't know...both sides of the brain have sent equal demands of attention to the PFC...they're supposed to have one side or the other take precedent in a given situation...but both sides got activated *harshly* at the same time...or during the same event, as seen by the PFC...so *both* are ""valid"", as far as it is concerned.

And it can't decide.

ADHD. Neurodiversity.

Do you have ADHD because you were born with it, or because of the conflicting views in your first memory? Dumbass. That's why you can't/couldn't move past it. It was still *unresolved*. Being so proud of yourself one moment and getting spanked for it the next? Did that trauma set up/over-stimulate/burn-out the circuitry in your PFC? Pure pride and joy stolen away from you because of a misunderstanding...the *injustice* of it.

And the supplemental life of anxiety thereafter?

...

It fits.

Even if the DNA double-helix/hemispheres bit is a bit of a stretch.

The part that matters is: we *know* there are two of us inside each head. How genetics gets us there isn't relevant for this discussion.

...what discussion, you're alone dumbass.

Yeah...my *two hemispheres* are alone. They're fed up and are trying to make peace with one another. Or determined to battle it out for control.

Explains ADHD. Explains bipolar.

ADHD = PFC is in a mad scramble to decide between two opposing hemispheres...and when one hemisphere doesn't get it's way immediately, it starts flooding the PFC with ""justifications"", in the form of additional, related information. Thus you can't make decisions, *and* your PFC/brain is getting flooded with more and more information...which makes it worse...and if you don't get out of it, if it goes too far, you go in to shut-down/explosion. The PFC over-loads and hits the big red button. Shutdown or explosion. Shut off the emotions or let them all out at once in a ferocious explosion.

Ok...so that explains ADHD...

Bipolar = the state you get in to when you have a conflict in your PFC from the two hemispheres...or whatever decided something is a conflict...two opposing views, fighting for dominance...leading to the PFC having a meltdown...at which point you are either fight *or* flight...freeze or fawn...proactive vs defensive...that's why there are two states in bipolar, plus the calm in-between...Manic, depressive or the calm in-between...the calm being because the trigger that brings up the 2 sided ""argument"" doesn't get triggered...thus why one little thing can set the tone of your day...week...month...

Oh, look...there are *two* hippocampi...how convenient that each hemisphere would have it's own...to assign the importance level to an experience, for the data's importance level...then it can send it to the PFC for final judgement.

And if they both come back as ""Life or death"" (equally high emotion, top and immediate priority)...probably with a jolt of hormones as a primer, a dose set off by each hippocampi...fuel being on the fire in the PFC at these conflicting responses...

No wonder the PFC has a melt-down. First fried with a massive jolt from the emotion levels themselves, then flooded with stress hormones...or even reward hormones...mind-blowing orgasams, say...or winning at gambling...or shooting up drugs...good or bad, what matters is that it over-loads the PFC...and you have an over-load reaction...and it forcibly strengthens any and all neuron links....like a muscle that gets used, it will grow thicker/stronger, so as to be able to handle that level of emotion/input being shoved down it's throat...

Poor PFC. No wonder *your* headaches have been centered right between your eyes for the past two years...it's doing over-time to get a grip on things, once and for all.

And if it didn't? You ""crack""...and the PFC's wiring either fries completely, or it welds itself together...refuses to operate any more...and thus you ""go mad"". Which you're not likely to survive...because you've lost not just control over which hemisphere to go with, but you believe whatever dumb crap it's imagining...the stuff you're supposed to know isn't real, it's just a projection of the future based upon past experiences...wherever imagination comes from...apparently a whole brain thing...maybe that's the real difference with humans vs animals...imagination...the complex interplay within the brain...

Obviously, having a decent imagination was an evolutionary benefit...thus how we dumb apes ended up at the top of the pile...assuming imagination - and all the extra processing it requires - is the main difference.

...

Where were we?

Summarize, you idiot, and take it from there...

Two hemispheres. Both do their own processing. Both have their own hippocampi...so not only can they process, they can also assign an emotional value to the results of that processing...and send it to the PFC...

Which, if both sides are equal on the emotion level, results in cognitive dissonance...and if one or both is *too much*, it over-loads the poor PFC...you just sent 1000-amps through a 24ga wire...you either fried it, or you just fundamentally upgraded the wire to something thicker and/or made of a lower-resistance material...same results...that particular path is more efficient and when it's activated, it's quicker to respond...allows lower voltages to sneak through...enough to latch the neurons, like a switch, just with less line-loss, so at a lower voltage...

Said voltage is determined by the emotional response coming from the hippocampi, as directed by that side of the brain...or even if both sides are in agreement, it still functions the same way...you just don't get stuck trying to figure out which response is the correct one...but if you do get stuck with two conflicting responses, thats when your PFC is supposed to decide...by judging priorities....

Which is more important in the moment? Survival or success?

Thus you get people willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others.

And people who freeze up and lose the moment.

And people who run away, because their PFC decided in that instant that survival was more important.

Therefore, if you ran away, and it was successful, your brain is going to activate the reward response/hormones...to lock in the neural-pathways that were just used...so...thus is born a ""coward""...once you break, you'll break again...no offense, reader, but that's a common trope...and it makes perfect sense if you think of it that way...PFC chooses, activates those circuits, those circuits then get strengthened when your brain rewards you/itself for successfully evading the danger...

Sigh. I wish this didn't all fit together.

Doesn't really matter if it's perfect...let the ""real"" scientists (read: hosers) with their extremely fix, narrow view of things test and refine them.

Or not and let humanity continue on it's path of destruction...with the way the human brain works, someone else will figure it out, eventually. If the species survives long enough.

Back on topic...

The choice the PFC makes gets reinforced, if it's successful. Those neural connections are beefed up for however long they live...7 years?...doesn't matter...for *some* length of time they get reinforced....

...and become more efficient...so, not only can they handle more current/emotions...they activate said paths/neurons easier...so that response bumps up the priority of this pathway...it becomes the go-to if it's high enough...like your first response that was successful...it's obviously more successful than a complete lack of success/failure...so that explains ""muscle memory"" or other instant reactions...it's a short-cut...the path of least resistance, literally...reinforced by repeated use...until it fails...and you have to try a different way to solve that set of circumstances...

For example...a young boy, while growing up, is taught to not fear pain and to respond to it aggressively...and his repeated successes in life - however small they are at first using ""aggression"" as a response to ""pain"" - compound...and he decides to become a boxer...does well? more reinforcement. Loses? Stress hormones release; cause stress and anxiety...makes him beat himself up over it...until he can see a way through a fight like that again...a different path...that corrects for the left hook he wasn't expecting that finished the fight...

Pardon the analogy...I started with something obvious, so I'm going to run with it. The specific parameters of the analogy don't matter; it's the reward/punishment system reinforcing or breaking down specific pathways/neurons...so that the response becomes automatic...*more* automatic. To the point that the PFC can just wave a charge at specific, well-defined pathways when what's in front of them matches something it's done enough before, and you can perform the task/movement/whatever automatically...

...so *learning* is reinforcement - and breaking down - of pathways/neurons...

This worked last time, so we'll go with it.

Something didn't go quite as well this time, we need to pay attention, decide what to do better next time...

Ok, we'll go with *that*. Well done, left hemisphere...here's your reward for coming up with a solution...

*Or*...you end up with cognitive dissonance. Your PFC can't decide between the ""best"" options it's been given...brain goes in to a loop, a *spiral*, and keeps trying to make the math work by throwing in more and more information, adding & changing more and more variables....and you get *fixated* on it.

And the longer you're stuck with this cognitive dissonance, the more and more stress hormones your brain puts out. Why? Because stress hormones are meant to motivate you. To give you the ""fire under your ass"" that is called *anxiety*.

So...get stuck in it too long...and you will work yourself up. Into psychosis, or a panic attack or whatever your personal go-to is under those circumstances.

...a bottle of vodka...to shut your effing brain down...

My head is *full* of cognitive dissonances. It's *never* happy. Fix one and another one on the mile-long list takes it's place.

And this is when/why you get labeled as neurotic...because you're in an endless cycle of cognitive dissonances.

...and you get to the point where you can't handle it - the stress/hormones - and you have to do something about it.

Cue the decade and a half of self-medicating.

The meds/weed/booze/whatever else gives you a break from the endless spiraling. Effs your mind up so the spirals just fall apart...and let's you *breathe*.

6+ hours of peace.

Throw in some coffee...so you can focus through your ADHD/chemical cocktail...and say hello to the version of you that's writing this right now.

You dumbass. Your biggest moments of releif & resulting ""manic"" phase have always come from resolving one of your major cognative dissonances.

***Each and every time.***

*Of course* you would be on the moon when you figured out something that you've been spiraling on for decades. *Major* reward released. That solution is now etched permanently in your neuro-pathways.

...and you get a break for a while. Your PFC has all sorts of spare computing power now...you just freed it up of the hardest/biggest math problem it's been working on.

...you get flooded with new insights. Everything starts making sense.

More and more rewards for figuring out more and more things. Things you couldn't calculate without resolving the first math problem. You now know what X equals...you can now proceed to all the questions which you needed the results of X for. Those dozens, thousands, *millions* of things that occurred to you in the decades in-between.

That's why things start crystalizing in a cascade...your brain can finally do the math.

It's no longer holding a big, ugly equation in the place of X to do the calculating...it has a simple, direct value for it. *All* the math/problems that have X in them become easier. A good portion of the list is now *easy* to run the calculations for, and your list gets shorter and shorter...

...until you run out of questions/equations that involved ""X"". But in solving X, you found out what Y is too, so there's all *those* equations that can be done now...and so on and so on...

Thus your last, long ""manic"" episode...besides being flooded with reward hormones for everything you figured out over those weeks...lasted so long as you kept figuring things out...until you ran out/low on things to solve with it and *something* happened and started you spiraling again. Or at least doubting, in preparation for working up to spiraling.

...you now know the how/why of your so-called ""bipolar"". Progress = mania. Not stuck on anything = calm. Stuck on something = stress. Stress too long leads to anxiety and/or depression.

**Anxiety = hurry up, keep thinking**. Figure this out already!!

**Depression = you need to stop.** You're killing yourself. You're wearing yourself out, mentally and emotionally. Go lay in bed for a month.

You're going to stay in bed if you keep trying to figure out the cognitive dissonance. Learn to let it go...put it to the back of your mind, at least...and you can get back to the calm state.

Calm state...depression state...euphoric/manic state...they take *time* and a certain amount - or lack of a certain amount - of hormones. Presumably why antidepressants ""take a month to see real results""...because your brain needs soothing for long enough to level out from being pumped full of stress hormones. (Cortisol...?)

I still don't quite accept that the results of your cortisol tests were wrong, initially. You were totally in a manic state, on top of the world. Having super low cortisol levels would put anyone in a manic state.

You'd think you could take on the world too, reader, if you experienced such a state.

Probably almost as dangerous as too much for too long.

I'm assuming stress hormones eat away at neuron links...or maybe even the neurons themselves...which would explain why you get uneasy and start doubting....because those pathways that you established before are getting eaten away...your answers that you came up with, through your experiences, start looking like they need to be checked again. Doubt creeps in. Unease. It develops in to actual anxiety/depression when your brain keeps failing to find resolution.

Stress hormones are literally eating away at your brain structure.

This is about to tie in to your other theory on how the brain operates...

Without resolution...the brain keeps pumping out stress hormones...which keep eating away at it...loosening the connections, so *false* conclusions have a chance to ""die""; if the connections don't get reinforced - by resolution and a hit of reward hormones - they just keep degrading...

Depression...""hormone imbalance"" is putting it lightly. Depression...shutting down to let your brain 'dissolve"". Until the ""bad"" has finally been forgotten.

Amnesia...and neurodegenerative diseases...stress hormones...whether from the cognitive dissonances or from an actual disease/genetic condition...doesn't matter...brain is dissolving because of all the stress hormones...

Thus why I can barely remember *any* of my life; stress hormones have eaten it away. Refined my brain/memories until I could handle the math equations left.

This is why you can't shake *trauma*...those pathways were reinforced - by emotions & hormones - to put that experience at the forefront, a priority...anything that remotely resembles it will trigger a trauma/PTSD response...will cause stress hormones to be released...and your brain/connections continue to dissolve as long as you do...so only the things at the top of the priority list will stay intact...they'll get your focus, so they'll get reinforced...but everything below a certain threshold will slowly melt away...

This is why your recollection of your life is nothing but a string of traumas, of high enough emotional state that they survived the stress breaking them down...

...and explains why you can come to *different* conclusions as you start losing/discarding the lower-importance memories/paths...as you lose less important variables, the equation shrinks more and more...*until you can handle it*.

Or the new equation - working on it - kills you.

Eh, whatever. I love trying to figure things out. No wonder I haven't offed myself.

""Time heals all wounds"" is your brain dissolving the *lesser* ""wounds""/memories...and/or over-laying said wounds with new, healthy pathways...trying to push them off the end of the list, either way...

and the difference between a negative *experience* and a *trauma* is the emotional response level attached to the experience...if it over-loads the PFC, it's going to go nuts. *You're* going to go nuts. However temporary - or not - it lasts. Panic attack. compulsive behaviors that give you some relief. Complete shut down. Complete *rage*.

So, yes...we all ""go crazy"", at least a little bit...throwing predictions to the wind...and just *react.* All control gone, until your brain decides it's safe again, and you come back to yourself.

Like those times you ""blacked out"" and beat the shit out of your bullies in elementary. Complete loss of control. Completely ""mad dog"" for the few seconds it took you to put them down.

Now...which mushrooms was it that the ""vikings"" used to induce a blind rage? Did it turn off part of the brain, or did it over-load it? Probably over-loaded it...bye bye PFC...

Looked it up. Like most things, it was close to the truth yet not quite...down a rabbit hole, ending in ""Anticholinergic chemicals"" in henbane...oh and look, they have some medical uses...in brains that have ""dissolved"" too much. Parkinson's.

Ok, enough speculative BS.

...you know *everything* is speculative...even if proven scientifically, beyond a doubt and accepted as ""truth""...and you confirmed it yourself...though more speculative observations...but anyway...even *then,* if you have a traumatic enough incident, you can push that ""1000% truth"" item down the list, knocked out by the ""1001% trauma"" that just happened.

The truth is not immutable.

Not from the human brain's perspective.

It's a slave to those emotional responses...if it's told that something it *knew* was absolutely *true* turned out not to be? At least on the surface? Yeah...the emotions - which reinforce themselves every time you think of the experience(triggered) or re-process it in your sleep - are king.

Even if you are the most rational person to have ever lived, you're still using your emotions -your punishment/reward system - to reinforce all that rational thinking in the first place...so you have to be...someone with no emotions wouldn't be able to strengthen their pathways...thus why those of us who shut off our emotions can't remember our experiences very well...

Well, even then...a little bit of memory seeps through....obviously whenever you get a jolt of emotion...so you can remember the highlights of your teenage drinking episodes...there is still a connection made, a neuron activated...but without emotion, said pathway is very weak; it's the first one to go when you're stress hormones are pumping...so last night's drunken escapade is mostly forgotten in a hurry.

I don't specifically remember my first party...but I do have a handful of high-emotion moments that got saved/recorded to long term memory...99% of the experiences is long gone, though.

...and yes, that's what dreaming is...your brain reprocessing the day's experiences, categorizing them, saving the higher importance ones to LTM...and re-loading the important ones and the un-resolved dissonances...

Cognative dissonances...that get stuck in the head...that your brain keeps coming back to...you'll add more and more to the pile of such dissonances, distracting you (from enjoying your life), leaving less processing power to work on the lower-tier dissonances...and you'll over-load.

Poof. ADHD.

...and it suggests, to me, that ADHD can be linked to a trauma/dissonance/experience that occurred at a young(er) age.

Thus...why you felt so relieved, a week ago today...when one of your dissonances finally resolved itself. The subject of the dissonance exists no more, so it's no longer weighing you down.

And your prior ""manic"" state of a few months back, fwiw, resolving it by figuring it out.

They both have something in common...the dissonance was *resolved*.

*The human mind/brain can not have two opposing views on/responses to something*. It - the PFC, negotiating a resolution - has to decide which to go with, based on the processing...and *re*processing, over and over.

Trauma fries the circuitry, supercharges it...so that you get stuck on said trauma.

What constitutes as trauma?

Something - an experience - that completely outclasses all experiences before it...from the emotional response - the punishment/reward system - given to said experience.

Something that flips to the top of the priority list, immediately.

Something your brain knows it needs to *resolve*, but it finds the emotions are too overwhelming to.

Only through *building up* to that level of handling of emotions can you face it.

We are a culmination of our experiences...based on a system with limited processing power and limited memory/storage...so it has no choice but to prioritize...and the lower on the list something is, the sooner it is cast-off, neglected to death...which stress hormones will do...and then it finally gets deactivated/isolated/reset/replaced...and you *forget*.

Bye bye, neurons/connections/paths. I won't remember you...

ok. So...we've established the duality of the brain, the decision making process, the reward/punishment system, the fact that your emotions decide the relevance of any memories/experiences...

...that emotions = amps. Emotions = amplitude.

Is that all the brain is? Information stored in ""amplitude""? Ie the voltage? Emotions = voltage?!

I mean...it works. All of this works with your previous renditions of the brain...the organic computer we all have in our heads...which is too complicated for (most people) to understand.

Your **working model**.

It keeps getting more and more complex, but it keeps on *working*.

...and that's the problem with a system built on ""good enough"" = ""truth""...it's flexable...but if you start reinforcing ""false"" pathways/conclusions, you eventually wind up losing your grip on reality.

*You know that you doubt everything in your head*. It's only accepted after your brain has had time to poke and prod it...meaning you put it through it's paces, see what breaks...see if the theory holds up...see if the system still functions with the addition of new pathways/conclusions....

Is that how my brain differs from most? I am never satisfied with an answer, so I don't get (permanently) stuck in the same reinforcing thought patterns as typical brains?

Is that all because of my trauma/cognitive dissonance, put in my head at all of 3 years old?

Thus we circle around to the whole notion of the wounded archetypes...and certain experiments...interesting...

It should be established - since I don't think I've stated it yet - that adverse experiences are what build us.

It doesn't have to be a horrible experience. But a negative outcome - of any kind - is necessary to spur the human brain in to seeking a solution...because that's a function of stress hormones...they spur you in to action...in to *seeking solutions*.

***Adversity leads to growth.*** That's what I was trying to say. Proven 1001% fact.

Yeah...I know...when that adversity is a trauma that you can't over-come...it *feels* impossible...you get stuck.

Stuck.

Depressed.

Trauma that your brain can't come up with an acceptable response to.

Because your brain settles down when you become resolute about ""what to do next time"".

That's how you deal with stress/trauma. You come up with a plan. And it will leave you alone.

As long as you have anything you might need to execute that plan. You start carrying a weapon, or an emergency alarm doohickie...you finally decide to get a cell-phone, just in case...or you take jujitsu classes...etc etc etc...

It's all to convince your brain that you will be prepared for it, if it ever happens again.

And it leaves you alone.

Or you have to reframe your thinking, so that it isn't as dangerous as it seemed. Seek consolation...or someone to share the experience with...aka emotional validation...because it's *being alone* with a trauma - or any negative experience - that destroys us.

...

All a function of how the brain is hard-wired as a social species.

If you feel seen/understood...your stress levels drop...because you're *no longer alone* with the fear/anxiety...

Alone with fear/anxiety - too much, too long - is what's destroying the mental health of everyone...today and all the way back through human evolution and beyond...

We haven't even explored how reinforcements can lead to hallucinations, feeding upon themselves...schizophrenia...I mean, that's easy...that's the reward system going off at the illusion of something...an imagining...that gets reinforced, over and over again...like an imaginary friend, when we're little kids...it's a coping mechanism that the brain took to for relief...and the reinforcement loop made it ""real"" to said brain.

Someone will rip me a new asshole for boiling schizophrenia down to a malignant coping mechanism...but hey, it's true, so screw them!

Your brain is going to keep it/you going, no matter how deluded it has to be in order to do it.

Keep that in mind; your brain is not you, nor is it infallible. It has a job - to keep you alive! - and it doesn't give a shit if it has to deceive the mental construct that helps keep it happy/tell it how it's doing. You are secondary.

Sorry.

""Keep you alive"" is the most basic of programming. Hardwired. No getting around it.

""So you can reproduce"" is the second ""commandment"".

What were they called in star-trek? The Prime Directives...yeah, that was it.

Hard-wired. Assuming your genetics didn't eff that wiring. Bios. 99.99999% immutable.

A big enough hammer can fix anything...

...please don't take that as an inspiration on how to fix your life...a bigger hammer will just break more things. ""It don't work that way"". Ok? Ok.

Hardwired. To live. In order to reproduce. In order to pass on our genetic information.

Presumably that genetic information is slightly better than it was in your parents, seeing as you are the combination of them...hopefully all the best bits, but we know it's got limitations...and every change risks worsening rather than improving...

That would make all life - evolution - a thing...that's what the brain is here to do...to promote itself by improving itself - at the DNA level - by mating with other ""successful"" living organisms...and combining your DNA \*in the hopes of creating an improved version...\*a being that will out-live other such beings...and reproduce to improve more...

Guess it really is a rate-race...but it's in your brain & DNA...not *society*.

...though society will *reflect* it. It and the billions of other people out there. Because you exert a certain amount of pressure on it, no matter how small you are...even if the only impression you put upon another person is when your bones are found a year, century, millennia later...you'll still be affecting it.

I'm not getting in to stories right now.

Society = the gravitational pull we all put on one another.

Every atom is attracted to other atoms. They always move closer together through this pull. Might take billions of years, but that's how planets and stars are supposedly made...why would we be any different?

Maybe ""society"" is the 4th dimension. A culmination of everyone and everything that has come before, as remembered by those currently living. Or a dimension, anyway.

Might explain how we operate on a deeper level, as a species. Our pull upon one another, our drop reflecting *us* in the greater construct that we call society...or a species...our *gravity*.

Gravity...since everything is attracted to everything else...it must be because it *wants* to join with the other atoms...the force of attraction...simplest of conclusions...they're moving towards each other, there must be a reason...and ""because they want to"" or are ""designed to"" is good enough of an explanation. Who cares what you call it. Gravity. Charge. That's it's purpose. Find others that exist and group up with them.

The same basic thing that our hard-wiring as a social species encourages us to do...vehemently, some times...forces us to seek one another out...to join with...and create something better, something *more* than it is alone.

How many human stories are based on that premise? All of them, practically. ""Alone we die; *together*, we are stronger.""

Ya'll need to read more. This BS has been going on for 13.8+ billion years...and we, as a species, are more divided than ever.

...are we finally circling around to the whole ""wave life"" BS? In this case, that we *need* these bad times in order to remind us why we need to work together...the struggle that leads to resolution and improvement...the whole cycle of life...yada yada...

It fits with everything else I've worked through, today and leading up...

So...go ahead, left vs right, one religion vs another, country vs country, neighbor vs neighbor...the it's part of the cycle...the fire in which an improved version of humanity/society will emerge from the ashes of.

I'm sorry to those of us who aren't going to survive it (which will be *everyone* who refuses to adapt). But there's little point in fighting it; it's inevitable.

Cycles are necessary. Cycles are nature keeping us moving forward. Conflict and resolution.

The culmination of a system of ""matter"" that is attracted to other matter. Where it reacts with it and makes something *more* than the sum of it's parts.

Shit ran through all the possibilities - invented every element and every compound imaginable - in the process...finally came up with some substance that can't react with anything else...truly ""dead"" matter...unless, maybe, you split it apart...elements made of yet smaller particles that are attracted to one another...and the combination of which gives it it's properties...random chance calculated to the near infinite...coming up with the elements...

...*which properties only exist in relation to one another*...without something to compare one to another, there would be no rules in chemistry...everything is defined by how it sees/reacts/interacts with other atoms...nothing exists in solitude...*without everything else, it can not exist.*

...and you scale it up, over billions of years...at some point, it runs out of new discoveries....it can't make any more elements...things settle...mostly...

Out of the easy/obvious paths, it has no choice but to continue evolving. Thus inanimate matter, out of a lack of any other options, becomes *living* matter. Short-lived compared to all the stable elements...but, like a compound, it's bonds are weaker than that of the elements it's made of...but are also *that much more together*.

Oxygen + hydrogen x2 = water. Completely different substance, so much *more* than it's original components...compound after compound coming in to existence...until that too runs out of/low on options...

what's left?

The matter has to start moving on it's own, that's what.

Life...is inevitable. That attraction forces reactions to occur over and over again and make something *greater*.

And it's going to produce a *lot* of garbage along the way...it's trial and error, it's chance...but it's inevitable...

If you bring about the existence of some kind of particle...of some*thing*, and that something is attracted to other such things...IE so long as you have more than 1 of any one thing...it's going to interact with another such thing...attract or repel, doesn't matter...if they're all bouncing around...the ones attracted to one another will eventually combine...no matter how far apart they get...they'll eventually collapse back in on themselves...combining along the way...making different ""things""...different types of matter...

The properties of which depend upon the other matter around it...one defines the rest of them...all of them define the one...

So all properties originate from this attraction.

What happens when they have the same polarity? They repel. The flip side of the same coin.

Collapse in on itself enough, and BOOM...too many of the same kind of particle/charge in the same location, and they get - at first - agitated, then they start giving off heat...then light...and finally bad things start happening, from this agitation...fission and fusion...something, *anything* to resolve the problem of the same kind of particles being in too close of contact with one another...chemical explosion...vaporizing...splitting or combining...until something else exists. Something that isn't as opposed to the other parts the new thing is composed of...shedding incompatible parts...as energy...and other particles...

So...is everything made of the same thing, deep enough down?

Is everything made of light? Light that had no choice but to ""adapt"", because it couldn't all be in the same place at the same time...so it exploded out, to ease the pressure.

And what a pretty firework it must have been!!

Google, what is a quark? Ok, thanks...

Doesn't debunk my system/working model.

Everything is attracted to everything else. But when it finally achieves solidarity...or whatever you would call it...after hundreds of billions or trillions of years, when the attraction has forced *everything* to return to ""base"" state...nothing can escape...that's when it hits critical mass and BOOM. *The* big boom.

Think about it...if everything ""physical"" collapsed in on itself...it would only get so far...then even the elements would start collapsing in under the massed attraction...at the center...things start heating up...nuclear things...but let's say the pull (and push, because the outer atoms want to get in to the middle as hard as the ones that are already there) won't let it escape...

It would crush in on it's self....like a tin can with a vacuum inside it going to the bottom of the ocean....it would just im-fucking-plode....unlimited force inwards...almost...collapse....not even the nuclear reactions could stop it from collapsing in...it would shrink and shrink and shrink...

forcing the quarks closer and closer together...

until a reaction occurred...that puts all thoughts of the fusion and such going on inside stars to complete *shame*...a *sub-nuclear reaction*...

...what was that line from back to the future? The same matter can not occupy the same space?

The same *kind* can not occupy the same space. They're not allowed to touch.

Otherwise they become *something else*.

Maybe the ""big bang"" was the first of a never-ending cycle, where something new and fundamentally different will come in to being.

It all started with an iddy-biddy quark....or whatever a quark is made up of...opposingly charged sub-sub-sub particles. Doesn't matter. The attraction and repulsion is all that matters.

If the attraction over-comes the repulsion, something *new* is born.

Every gawd damned time.

It has no choice. The same *kind*, the same *charge* can not exist in the same space.

The moment they touch, it becomes *something else*.

Thus, quarks, or whatever they heck atoms are built from...turn in to something else.

You start with everything the same. In the same place. At the same time. (time is an illusion).

They're *not allowed to touch*.

But the force on them is so great that they *do.*

1psc2qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/1psc2qy/help_integration_nightmare_need_help_4_months_and/,Help - Integration Nightmare - need help (4 months and panic),"So here is the short of it, I need help. A lot. And I am at the edge, a lot, of going into a hospital or some type of residential program and wanted advice. Basically, my pattern seems to be going intensely for something and burning out. This went into medicine as well, and I am at near at the end of my rope.

Here's the condensed story: This started two years ago, with a mental breakdown after a lot of things went wrong all in succession. My narcissistic and abusive father died and this opened a lot of wounds, then a business partnership I had been working on failed, and then another job, and then my girlfriend of two years left during this crisis. I went into a deep and hopeless hole, but crawled out with a ton of therapy through a concentrated mental health regime, got a career coach, joined a church, and also did my first experience with a psychedelic guide through mushrooms. This opened up something small in terms of memories of men in my life that were very dangerous sexually, including my father and a neighbor. It was enough then, and with Law as a new pursuit at 41 after the career coach.

Things picked up, I was doing well, leaning into life again. Got a girlfriend who was also studying law after 6 months of being single, thought she was the one when she said she wanted to marry me, another breakup and deep attachment wounds came out and everything fell apart after a year of studying, pressure, and another breakdown and breakup.

This time, same pathology. Breakdowns, unexplained cowering in the corner of my house, feeling like a little child. I was recommended Bufo, and decided take the leap. I had done EMDR a bit and nothing was surfacing, so figured why not. In Bufo, a deep childhood trauma came out around the ""R"" word by a neighbor. It was insane, I felt insane, but it seemed to line up. I thought I integrated, and so a month later was invited to do grandmother Ayu and did a 3 day retreat where I let out so much terror and rage and kind of learned to ride it with yelling and singing, but then on the 3rd day my body just gave up and I didn't go under. I was heavily resistant the entire time, but did go through the process.

That shook me, and I was working a new job but during the entirety of it, after the process, was having panic attacks at work because I felt it wasn't ""my calling"" and I eventually quit.

I then was invited to do a San Pedro ceremony, and did that as well for a night. This was the same person facilitating these things, and I feel like I might have gone too far. He is very well versed and goes down to Peru a lot to study, but I don't know. I feel it was me just searching for a way out of this mess by going deeper and not integrating. The San Pedro was gentle, but ended in extreme suicidal ideation that I needed to be talked down from.

A month later, I decided to do a silent fasting retreat for 4 days in the desert with another person. I did this, and during the desert retreat scremed to godm over and over again, every morning, and through the afternoon, asking and pleading for a miracle, something, anything. I was asking for my purpose and found none. I often settled by afternoon and rode the waves of intense feeling and energy, then went into metta meditation or reframing of my past and that helped.

It has been 2 months and I have been a complete wreck. I put a hold on all medicine work or work in general, but my body craves meaningful work. I have eliminated everything but coffee and sugar. No smoking, I have been sober for years, and am slowly working on practices to reframe, but often I am desperate. After the silent retreat especially, but during all of this, I have had panic attacks and my nervous system is almost constantly on edge. Every job I think of doing I cannot even try, often, because of the fear. Even past jobs that were once easy. I often cry or rage uncontrollably around safe people, and have learned that is my body letting out the trauma, but there is this constant rumination about work and self worth and finding my ""purpose,"" and that seems to be linked all to this. I have so many cognitive distortions and thinking patterns that are so toxic and ego driven, but it seems like I cannot release them, and they are driving me to panic almost all the time unless I manage them minute by minute, often. Once every three or four days, for the past months, I have had extreme attacks where I let it build up and then cry, and if I am around people, it turns into a full blown episode where I hit myself and then scream in terror at some dark force I cannot name, and then cry and say ""I am sorry,"" over and over again, until exhaustion. It is lightening, I think, but I have talked with a large amount of trusted friends about going into a program or a hospital because often, I feel it too much. I have had negative reactions to two SSRI's and also no change with an SNRI. I am consistently thinking about other options, but maybe that is my problem. My whole life has been seeking intensity to hide from this pain. I have adventured through life, but also avoided, and my body and mind are telling me it is enough, and I am grieving this childhood fantasy that things would just ""work out,"" maybe. I do not know. I am losing faith, I am losing hope, and I am losing the will to do anything else. I have tried to surrender as much as I can, but even that seems off. I know I overthink and ruminate a lot and am trying to get into my body as much as possible and feel and be present with those parts that are extremely terrified. I am running, dont smoke or drink, meditate as much as I can, started cold plunging, and am working on finding fun outlets as I have recognized this is an issue as well.

I don't know what to do, at this point. I lack almost all self trust, it seems, because I put myself through this and I am often gripping onto a past life, although full of distortions, that at least didn't seem this painful.

1psc2ko,https://i.redd.it/eaohhzi1fl8g1.jpeg,WeighMyBru DIY Coffee Scale! [Self Promotion],"Hi all,

I’ve been working on a small side project called **WeighMyBrew** — a low-cost, smart espresso scale designed to integrate with GaggiMate, Gaggiuino and Clever Coffee.

It’s ESP32 + HX711 based and focuses on:

* Fast Bluetooth weight streaming
* Tare & calibration
* Simple Wi-Fi setup via web interface
* Low cost, no custom PCB's
* Open-source firmware & easily accessible hardware

This is a personal project and still a work in progress. It's by no means up to some kind of retail/commercial level, but its functional and I believe delivers a great result. I didn't want to spend money on something I know I can build myself. I'm not a software developer by any means. A larger portion of this code is ""vibed"".

Check out the website if you want or need to know more. You can find all the build guides and necessary links there. Feel free to join the \[WeighMyBru\]([https://discord.gg/HYp4TSEjSf](https://discord.gg/HYp4TSEjSf)) Discord server to chat with the rest of the community.

I purchased $160 of Nespresso pods online on December 7th. Called to initiate a return on December 21st. This is within their 30 day return policy posted on their website. 

I started with a call. I was told to call 15 minutes later due to technical difficulties. I then initiated a chat discussion that stated they needed 2-4 minutes to review. 15 minutes later I received a response saying they are not accepting coffee pod returns and can start the refund process. 

I had given up on the chat and initiated a call while waiting for chat. The individual on the phone took 20 minutes to get to the same information provided to me in the chat. That said I asked to initiate a refund which proceeded to take more time that eventually led to a verbal confirmation number. I followed with a request to receive a confirmation email of the refund which I was told was being sent. Email came into inbox. I got off the phone and noticed they sent me my order confirmation. I then called again taking 10 more minutes for the rep to tell me the confirmation number would be sent within 24 hours. 

Not holding my breath that I’ll receive the confirmation email or my refund that I was told would be received within 30 days. 

This is 2025. I may sound impatient in this note but this has more to do with the quality of service and what is perceived to be shady business practice.  This is an overpriced high end product that should accompany a responsive and customer focused service department. Nespresso has lost a customer today. I honestly hope others have a different experience and people aren’t getting screwed over. 

Worst customer service I’ve experienced and warranted a diatribe review from someone who never provides reviews like this. Hope this doesn’t happen to others. ",0,1766338359.0,nespresso,9,0.32,False

**NONE of this guaranteed romantic interest.**

Sadly I feel worse than not knowing.

I had just gotten out of a horrific 8 year relationship 1 year ago so I don’t have much experience with dating stuff and what I do have is rusty.

And I \*really\* enjoy this group we're volunteering in. I thought I collected enough evidence to almost guarantee a ""yes"" so that it would not be awkward. If I felt my odds were like 50/50 I wouldn't have asked at all.  I now realize you can never be fully certain.

This makes me INCREDIBLY nervous for the future because now I have \*absolutely no idea\* how to read social signals. What a confidence killer.

I’m in my late 30s and losing hope. I don’t know. I just want to give up.

He's 6'3 and makes around $350K. So he's got a lot going for him. But his personality is just..... insufferable. Always has been.

Whenever we go out, he picks an argument over the smallest things. He throws a fit if we don't eat where he wants to eat. If we go on a week long vacation, and he gets upset by something early on, he won't improve his mood until Day 4 or 5. And he'll make sure no one else enjoys their vacation either. It's really frustrating.

His story with women is another thing. He has dated tons of women over the last 10 years since he graduated college at 22, probably around 30-40. His longest relationship was around 8 months. He had ridiculously high standards and then expects the woman he is dating to baby him and clean up after him. About 1 month into a relationship, he'll call me bitching and moaning about all the things he does not like about her. When I try to talk some sense into him, he just says ""I'm 6'3 and I make over $300K, I deserve the best women.""

We went to dinner the other day and he started acting like a twat like he usually does. He didn't like the restaurant I picked out so he kept telling the waitress (loudly) that he doesn't like the food or the coffee or ambience, etc. I didn't react because I was sick and tired of his crap. Usually I pick fights and argue with him, but not this time.

On the way home, he started squaring up on me by saying ""What? You aren't gonna pick a fight with me because I told you the place you picked is lame??"". I just said ""nah bro, I won't pick any more fights cause your shitty personality is the reason you can't keep a girl"".

1psbwan,https://i.redd.it/fmeq8vlz2l8g1.jpeg,Does it actually taste like candy? Reviewing the Setember - Lollipop,"My benchmark for **AE Sugarcane decafs** used to be Perc: *Hiulia* was the reliable night coffee; *Los Nogales* brought the fruit-forward vibrance. But **September** has shattered the ceiling. Having experienced Dak’s *Milky Cake* earlier this year, the consistency across the Bermudez beans is, to me, undeniable.  
  
The taste shifts depending on your approach:

* **High Extraction:** Pure candy-shop punch. A vibrant and nostalgic red lollipop hit.
* **Light Sub-extraction (My personal preference):** A translucent red fruit tea—elegant, crisp, and dangerously drinkable.

**Specs:**

* **Producer:** Alex Bermudez (Cauca, Colombia).
* **Process:** AE Sugarcane Thermal Shock.
* **Varietal:** Castillo.

**Recipe:**

* **Method:** V60 (Timemore 01 Filters).
* **Grinder:** K-Ultra (click 7)
* **Ratio:** 1:15
* **Water Chemistry:** 50 GH (25 Mg / 25 Ca) | 15 KH (10 Na / 5 K).
* **Temp:** 90°C
* **Pours:** Three identical pours near the bed(circular pattern 5-6g/s) with 30s intervals

It is completely devoid of the off-flavors that often experimental fermented coffees (decaf or not) have. The result? Compulsive consumption. 300ml vanished in under 3 minutes. My only mistake was failing to freeze a dose for posterity; The beans evaporated before I could even process the grief.

**Who else has encountered their 'decaf of a lifetime' recently?** I'm looking for suggestions that match this level of clarity and vibrant profile.

Everything is great but we often clash about boundaries considering opposite gender friends. I have great friends which are males and we know each other for like 5+ years. On top of it i also made great friend group in uni which consists of women and men. Some people are in relationships some not and it’s truly platonic with all of them. I have been very active in underground community in my since like 2019 and it’s big part of my personality you could say. My boyfriend doesn’t like the music, events and overall vibe of it all so i don’t really like when he wants to go with me because he is in bad mood all evening and it’s just not a great time for me, him and even my friends. (He wants to go because he wants to protect me). Yesterday i was on one of these events and went afterwards with my great long time male friends out. We are currently arguing that it’s disrespectful towards him and our relationship to even go to a concert and on top of it go out afterwards. We were just catching up since we didn’t see each other for like 6 months. He even said that if his friend partner would do this they would immediately break up.

I honestly don’t see anything bad with it especially with people with whom i’ve been friends long before we even got together. Of course i wouldn’t go with some random guy i just met in gym or on instagram that is disrespectful. He has his own long time female friends (like 10+ years) and I wouldn’t even blink an eye to tell him he can go to concert or coffee with them if i didn’t want to go myself. Mind you he doesn’t do that, he is not hypocrite. So i am just wondering how other people see it. Also i’m bi but he doesn’t mind if this whole thing would be about women.

My question is if i am being disrespectful and should reconsider my approach to this issue. ",1,1766337960.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

im on seroquel and get bad withdrawals so im doing an extremely slow taper while adding in the cap. 75mg seroquel + 21mg cap to start. when i started seroquel the tiredness side effect lasted for like 3 months. it was horrendous. 

i woke up today with a migraine beyond belief and completely exhausted. i slept till 11 but i had to get up bc the dining hall hours during winter break are weird and i wouldn’t get a chance to eat today if i didn’t get up. i was hoping that food and coffee would make me feel better but it hasn’t helped at all. i took tylenol at 8am when i woke up to the headache. that helped a little with the headache but my head is still pounding  and im SO tired.  

my psych said i could likely experience nausea and luckily thats the one thing i haven’t had. 

i don’t know im just freaking out because winter break is only a month, and if these side effects don’t go away before spring semester, ill be screwed, and my bipolar already messed up 2 semesters for me really bad so i need to do very well. as i said above im really really sensitive to side effects and seroquel took me 3 months to stop being exhausted (i was sleeping until 3-4pm, super dark place i dont ever want to be in again) 

i guess i just want to hear something encouraging about this being worth it or other people very sensitive to side effects having them subside fast.

I thought I had all the signals. Turns out I'm a fucking idiot.

We’d been volunteering together for 8 weeks. We are in the same volunteer org. She has everything I look for, unique/niche shared values, smart, funny, and she seemed incredibly warm in every interaction.

She asked me if I was cold and if I wanted her to walk 3 minutes to her car and get me a Hot Hands hand warmer. The next two weeks she brought me more hand warmers on her own.

She came up to me one day when I got there and asked immediately if I drive an SUV. I said yeah why? She goes “I knew it, I probably seem like a stalker haha”

She constantly asks if I’m coming back next week

She consistently makes it a point to walk me to my car at the end of the night, happened last 4 times. If she’s behind me, she calls my name to catch up - it happened twice that I left before her and she called my name and caught up with me and wished me a good night in a very warm way, and she always asks if I'm coming the next week. She also asked if I wanted to see her bumper stickers. 

Here's a big one: we just had a party for the group we volunteer in last week that she asked if I was going to. We went and she chose to sit with me, alone, at a tiny table, for 90 minutes. There was 0 silence or awkwardness for an hour and a half.  She asked if I want to walk out with her as a pair (""wanna catch this wave of people leaving?"") and we walked to our cars together as usual,  she asked if I was coming next week.

She told me I have great genes because I look young

We have been DMing back and forth with fast responses. She has initiated on occasion and always responds enthusiastically 

She liked / heart-reacted to all my discord messages, definitely goes out of her way to react / like mine more than other people. 

She was talking about a creepy guy there, 50 years older, persistently asking her to go out with him - he even bought her earrings for christmas - she joked that she was gonna tell him that she was a lesbian but she didn’t wanna lie \*in case she brings a guy she’s dating to the food share where we volunteer.\*

She told me he the above guy was scaring her last time and asked me to step in if I ever see him getting too close and she can't escape the conversation.

She asked me two days ago when I mentioned the food share was running late: “why you in a rush, you got a date?”

We consistently spent 60% of the time volunteering next to each other smiling, laughing, and joking, week after week, every time. She always gravitated back to me.

Money is a little tight this year but we still have enough to get the kids presents. I get an “allowance” each of his paydays(biweekly) for me to do things with the kids, buy small things I want like a coffee here and there. I saved some up so I could get him a few presents for Christmas. Overall I spend about $150 on him.
He and my best friend both chipped in for Christmas and my birthday gift (6 days apart) to send me and her on a cruise (about $800 for the two of us). I told him he didn’t need to get me anything since he already surprised me with the cruise but he insisted that he wanted to get me something else. 

Last night we were hanging out after the kids went to bed and he was on his phone and seemed frustrated. I asked what’s wrong and he said “something I ordered you suddenly went out of stock then when I tried to reorder it they jacked up the price. It went from $18 to $30! I cant find anything similar but I don’t want to pay $30 for it” at the time I just let it go and was like “oh that’s annoying” and moved on. Then later I was thinking about it and I personally feel like $30 isn’t that much, especially for your wife. And I found myself feeling offended he didn’t want to pay $30 for something. But then I also feel guilty for feeling offended because he did pay for the cruise. I just feel like I was happy with the cruise but him insisting to get me something else as well is why I’m offended. 

AITAH for being offended my husband doesn’t want to spend $30 on a Christmas gift for me?

Update: I accept I’m the AH. I am beyond grateful for the cruise and will focus on that. Thank you all for the input and explaining why I’m the AH. I’m autistic and sometimes have a hard time with social norms so I very much appreciate everyone explaining why I was in the wrong here! I’m going to forget about any additional gifts and not expect anything and I will keep expressing how much I appreciate the cruise.",6,1766337691.0,AITAH,33,0.75,False

Does anything stand out to you from the bean appearance or the roast curve? Does it look well-developed, or are there signs of under- or over-development? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Earlier this year I posted this question 

https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/s/EkjCIxBy20

Asking for what advice really stuck that changed your perspective on decluttering?

It was a GOLD MINE for me. I stopped worrying about doing it ""right"" and started focusing on just ""getting it done"" using a lot of the advice in there.

I took out FOURTEEN trash bags of just ""stuff"" from my office/ studio space. I was able to rearrange the furniture and now the only clutter is the fully sorted boxes of books/ few remaining art supplies that are getting put away once I have my shelves rearranged. I have to take a small desk out that's a two person job and that's the current holdup 😅

I also stopped caring that something was ""a gift"" and just realized that the real gift was harmony in my life given to myself by letting go of all the baubles I didn't want. 

But just letting go of so much random things was freeing. I can use my space again! I know where everything is! I actually have about four more bags of to go that I'm taking to the curb this weekend.

Then I started investing a little in furniture for other rooms of the house that prioritized organization and space. I bought a smaller dining room table so that even if piles get placed there it's a LOT less than the old larger table. A new pantry storage shelf since we don't have a walk in that has a door so I can organize things in there without the chaos of boxes being visible. Smaller coffee table for the same reason. Turned random spaces that always ended up with random clutter into decorative displays so I wouldn't put things there anymore.

It's been HUGE. I've struggled with this since I was a kid (trauma and ADHD, I have no issue letting things go but I just have chaos in my blood when it comes to clutter and felt stuck any time I tried to tackle larger projects). Got better about letting go of the ""but this is a SUPPLY, maybe I'll use it someday?"" Like girl you've had that for SEVEN YEARS and it costs $4 move on. 

The hardest thing to give away was the cricut (that went to a friend who wanted one) because it just invited to o much chaos and clutter into my space. I have friends with cricuts I borrow if I really need a project done so I kept a few vinyls but otherwise let it go.

My bathroom is small but was always chaotic, I repainted the whole thing, bought better storage so everything is out of sight and that I'm limited to the space given. We used to have really deep, thin shelves in one area that always had things just tossed in now I have a smaller cabinet in it's place. No open shelves on the walls for bathroom supplies I got a small medicine cabinet that we use now. 

Again I worked on this over a few months and put pretty much all of my extra spending money into the project piece by piece and kept an eye out for deals on the new furniture. I used to buy a lot of second hand furniture but it's hard to control the size exactly of what I needed so I got over that and bought things new with dimensions that worked and then applied sorting advice. 

Next week I start on our basement disorganized chaos room and I'm so ready for it. Excited, even. That only leaves the garage which has a lot of old furniture in it to tackle in the spring. I'm going to do a garage sale and either donate or toss anything that doesn't sell but it's furniture only so that I didn't just shift my piles into the ""eventual yard sale"" pile.

Sometimes it's not about doing things ""right"", it's about finding what works for you to get it done. Thank you to everyone who sent recommendations on my old post!

I’ve been working on setting up a cold brew coffee project here in the UAE for the last few weeks, and I could really use a sanity check from the local community.

The idea came from my dad, who is a huge fan of the cold brew scene in India (brands like Sleepy Owl and Blue Tokai). He pointed out a specific gap here: while Dubai has an amazing café culture, there are very few options for home-steeping packs - the kind you just drop in a pitcher of water overnight.

I’m not a traditional coffee drinker myself, but I’ve recently converted to cold brew because of the smoother energy kick without the acidity or jitters. Since I’m looking to improve my marketing and business skills, I’ve partnered with my dad to try and solve this gap.

We want to start lean with 1 SKU to test the waters. I’m currently debating between:

* **Indian Origin:** To stay true to the inspiration (often stronger, more chicory/bold notes).
* **Brazilian Single Origin:** A classic choice (chocolatey/nutty notes).

**My Questions for You:**

1. Do you actually steep coffee at home, or is the convenience of buying ready-to-drink cans or visiting a café just too easy here?
2. From my research, it seems people prefer ""stronger"" profiles for cold brew to cut through milk/water. Do you prefer a punchy dark roast or something more floral/acidic?
3. Is this a gap for a reason? (i.e., people here just don't want to wait 12 hours for coffee).

Plain brown paper, my name in handwriting too precise to place, maybe mine, maybe not. No sender, no card. Inside, a small silver-framed mirror nestled in tissue. I set it on the kitchen table, glancing once. My reflection stared back, tired but ordinary. Stress from work, I thought. Birthdays always dredged up old loneliness.

At first, the changes were dismissible. The room’s light seemed off in the glass, shadows lingering where they shouldn’t. I blinked, it blinked late. Or did it? I rubbed my eyes, blaming poor sleep, the rain drumming endlessly outside. Friends texted generic wishes, but no one visited. Alone, I tested it, turning away, then snapping back. Sometimes the reflection lagged, lips curving into a half-smile I hadn’t made. Imagination, surely. Mirrors don’t lie, minds do, especially after too many solitary nights scripting horrors for a living.

Doubt festered. I moved the mirror around, bathroom steam warped it convincingly, hallway gloom sharpened the eyes into something accusatory. Once, whispering doubts aloud, the reflection’s mouth seemed to form words first, losing it, but silence answered when I froze. No recordings caught glitches, no one believed “mirror paranoia” over coffee chats. Sleepless, I fixated. Was the face gaunt from real weight loss, or did the glass hunger for truth? Throwing it out felt final, like discarding proof of unraveling. Better to watch, to prove myself wrong.

Now, in the dark kitchen, it gleams faintly opposite me. Bags under my eyes match. Almost. I whisper, “You’re fine.” The reflection nods, serene. Or does it? Rain masks any sound, exhaustion blurs edges. The box it came in waits in the trash, tag faded. Friend’s prank? Subconscious sabotage? Power flickers, silver pulses once. I lean closer, breath fogging both sides equally. Sanity whispers retreat, but curiosity pins me. Tonight, one of us blinks first.",2,1766337041.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1psbh2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1psbh2k/starting_a_cold_brew_brand_uae_thoughts/,Starting a Cold Brew brand - UAE (thoughts?),"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on setting up a cold brew coffee project here in the UAE for the last few weeks, and I could really use a sanity check from the local community.

The idea came from my dad, who is a huge fan of the cold brew scene in India (brands like Sleepy Owl and Blue Tokai). He pointed out a specific gap here: while Dubai has an amazing café culture, there are very few options for home-steeping packs - the kind you just drop in a pitcher of water overnight.

I’m not a traditional coffee drinker myself, but I’ve recently converted to cold brew because of the smoother energy kick without the acidity or jitters. Since I’m looking to improve my marketing and business skills, I’ve partnered with my dad to try and solve this gap.

We want to start lean with 1 SKU to test the waters. I’m currently debating between:

* **Indian Origin:** To stay true to the inspiration (often stronger, more chicory/bold notes).
* **Brazilian Single Origin:** A classic choice (chocolatey/nutty notes).

**My Questions for You:**

1. Do you actually steep coffee at home, or is the convenience of buying ready-to-drink cans or visiting a café just too easy here?
2. From my research, it seems people prefer ""stronger"" profiles for cold brew to cut through milk/water. Do you prefer a punchy dark roast or something more floral/acidic?
3. Is this a gap for a reason? (i.e., people here just don't want to wait 12 hours for coffee).

1psbffr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1psbffr/my_33f_boyfriend_33m_broke_up_with_me_right/,My (33F) boyfriend (33M) broke up with me right before Christmas and 3 weeks before our Brazil trip. Things were great until he went through my phone.,"We were together a little over 6 months.

The first three were genuinely great; affectionate, attentive, warm, optimistic. I thought I had finally met someone solid. We met each other’s families and spent every moment together. We practically spent six weeks together 24/7. It was amazing. He told me he was in love with me and truly, I know he was.

Everything shifted the moment he secretly went through my phone.

He opened my period-tracking app, scrolled through my messages, and found out that I hadn’t been truthful about when I last slept with my ex. For context: when my now-ex and I began texting, I had one more sexual encounter with a previous partner. We broke up months before, he wanted me back, I was fighting with myself, and one thing led to another.. but we were done after that. I was done with my ex after that knowing I had no feelings and it meant nothing.

A few days later, when we met for coffee, I actually told him I needed time and wanted to go slowly because I wasn’t emotionally settled yet. Instead of respecting that, he tried to kiss me immediately — which, looking back, should have been my first red flag. It felt like he didn’t care where my head or emotions were; he just wanted what he wanted.

Later, when he found out and I realized he went through my phone (he kept that to himself for two days), out of embarrassment and fear of being judged, I lied about the timing of that last encounter. I shouldn’t have lied, I know — but nothing about his reaction later was healthy.

He didn’t talk to me about it.

He weaponized it.

And it didn’t stop there. He also dug through messages where my ex invited me on a trip — nothing happened, I didn’t go — but he turned that into another “proof” that I’m untrustworthy.

A month and a half later, intimacy collapsed.

He kept saying sex “disgusted him now.”

He claimed he “couldn’t forgive” and that I destroyed chemistry. He said I need to make sure sex comes back and that it is my responsibily to make him want me again.. when I asked what do I need to do, he didn’t know. He said I need to look within myself. 

Meanwhile, he admitted to masturbating constantly, and told me things like:

•	“If you meant nothing to me, I’d have sex with you. But because I care, I can’t.”

•	“You killed all the attraction.”

It made no emotional or logical sense, but he kept putting all blame on me.

There were also frightening moments.

He once kicked me out of his place at 4 AM, took his keys back, and I had to drive home half-asleep through drunk weekend traffic. A few days later he returned the keys like nothing happened.

He would say that I “ruined everything” and that I’m responsible for killing that guy who fell in love with me.

At the same time, he did confusing, attachment-bait things:

•	talked about proposing to me in Brazil

•	brought gifts

•	kissed me passionately days before the breakup

•	acted loving in small bursts

•     planned trips with me

And then:

•	withdrew

•	shut down

•	refused sex

•	refused emotional conversations

•	punished me with silence

There’s also a pattern: he has broken up with previous girlfriends and then returned later. One of them went five months without sex with him at the end of their relationship, and the first breakup with her was also over intimacy issues. Hearing that now, it feels like a repeating cycle — and I was just the next stop. 

Then, just two days ago and a few days before Christmas — after we attended two parties with MY friends — he sat down with me for a drink and said:

“There’s no chemistry anymore. I can’t live like this. I thought I’d propose to you in Brazil, but everything is ruined.”

It felt cold, strategic, like he wanted to free himself from any emotional responsibility before the holidays, before spending Christmas with my family as we planned.

We’re supposed to fly to Brazil in early January, with both our names on flights and shared accommodation. Now I don’t even know whether to go.

Since the breakup, he hasn’t texted or called. But he did like my Instagram story a day later. No message. No accountability. Just a like.

I know the dynamic became toxic — shaming, withholding, punishment, no emotional accountability — but I still feel blindsided and rejected.

I wanted clarity.

I wanted to see whether the trip would show us what was left — closure or reconnection.

Instead, I feel like he controlled the ending and I’m left with no answer.

How do I stop feeling like I wasn’t “worth the effort”? Was he really in love with me or was just that just an act? Why do some people end things suddenly & why before Christmas? I know things weren’t great, but I wanted to fight for us.

I later realized this wasn’t a one-off dynamic. As I wrote, he told me he had broken up with previous girlfriends and then returned to them later, and that at least one of those breakups was also blamed on “no chemistry anymore.” He even said that in the last months of one of those relationships, they barely had sex — which now makes his “you destroyed our intimacy” line feel less like a reaction to me, and more like something he does whenever he feels uncomfortable, pressured, or emotionally exposed.

It made me question whether his pattern is:

avoid intimacy → withdraw sexually → blame the partner → end it → possibly come back once he feels safe again.

Any perspective from people who’ve been through something similar would help. 

Oh, and have I mentioned that we work together? ",1,1766336884.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It'll probably be roughly 1/3-1/2 camping, rest hotels. Mostly we'll camp in national parks where camping is a better experience. For reference, i have a couple decades backpacking experience. Previous car camping has been for saving money and on the way to backpacking. I expect we'll aim for low service campgrounds-id rather not tent  camp in the middle of rv's running their generators. We drive a pacifica plug in hybrid, I haven't been able to figure out if we can power an induction burner or instapot off the car hybrid battery but am considering that.

I currently own the following possible cooking set ups:
Backpacking white gas single burner stove (very small)
Coleman double burner white gas stove
stove (medium size)
Induction hob (medium size)
Instapot (small/medium)

There are 5 of us, so I'm still considering size eve though we're in a minivan. When road tripping, i prefer to eat lunch at restaurant and simpler dinner. Exception will be in parks where food isn't great and mid-summer pretty slow. 

I've cooked for crews of 4-5 on just my backpacking stove, so it is doable to just take that. I do worrry about little tippy stove with kids more than i did with my former campmates. 

The coleman is bombproof but bigger and messier. 

Induction hob with a few normal pots. I cook on induction at home, the question is if the van can power it. 

Instapot, lower power draw than hob. I'm comfortable cooking quite a bit in this. May bring backpack stove for boiling water for coffee. ",1,1766336808.0,roadtrip,9,1.0,False

I've done pourover for years, but my wife really wanted a decent espresso setup, so I figured I'd get her an espresso setup for Christmas. Through tons of research on here (Reddit Espresso) and watching lots of YouTube (Lance Hendrick, James Hoffmann, etc), I decided on a DF64 Gen 2 and a Bambino Plus. I figure we can upgrade the Bambino Plus once we have some more experience and have a decent workflow down. I've got a reverse osmosis water system and used some Third Wave Water Espresso Machine for the water tank, so the water should be good.

Dialed in on some Onyx Coffee Monarch beans this morning. 18g in, 36g out in about 25 seconds. Not too bad. I think I'll try one grind size finer tomorrow. Maybe a tad bit sour, but pretty good. Steamed up some Oatly Barista Oat Milk for some lattes. Latte art is a lot harder than they make it look on YouTube!

Anyways, here is what I ended up purchasing:

* Breville Bambino Plus
* DF64 Gen 2 Grinder
* LILQ 54mm Portafilter - Walnut
* IMS Precision 14-18g Basket
* Acaia Lunar Scale
* Subminimal Subscale
* Subminimal Flick WDT
* MHW-3BOMBER 0.8mm Puck Screen
* Normcore Tamper v4 - Walnut
* Normcore RDT Sprayer
* Normcore Dosing Funnel v2
* Normcore Tamping Mat
* Normcore Tamping Station
* Normcore Knock Box

Hey everyone,  
For coffee lovers, who love a freshly ground coffee but only has a budget to get a manual grinder, I am working on something interesting, I am huge fan of how the Weber EG-1 looks but I don't have the budget to get that grinder, so I am in the process of designing a mini replica using 3d printing parts, Timemore C3S manual coffee grinder and motor that replicates the hand grinding rpm with the coffee grounds knocker so we wont have any stuck coffee grounds in there. I am half way there into the design and will be making the designs available online. I am designing to have some flexibility to accomodate different motors and grinders so anymore with almost any manual grinder can use this. I am trying to keep this built under $60 and easy to print and assembly. Let me know your thoughts on this. Thanks.

1psb79x,https://i.redd.it/k8bernp63l8g1.png,Solos is the most fun I've had with random strangers in any game.,"Here's a pic of me and some rando setting off fireworks. This was after I unlocked a room and welcomed him to his share of the loot. Later we had a dance-off at the elevator while waiting to extract with another player.

This post might sound sappy, but whatever. I've seen many posts about the bad experiences people have with other players, but man, I have a mostly peaceful time playing solos when it comes to interactions with others, and not only peaceful but also helpful and just a fun time overall.

This is the only game (I suppose in real life too) where I'll strike up conversations with random strangers. I don't play aggressively in solos and whatever they are doing to match me with similar people seems to be working (please don't change that, Embark!). I use my mic and give a genuinely friendly ""hello"" to everyone I see and I do it as soon as I see them and am in voice range. This usually keeps things from escalating and often it turns into a helpful experience. I've grouped up with random people, fought off arc with them and traded goop more times than I can count. (By the way, thank you for the coffee pot whoever you were! I got 17 blueprints but not a coffee pot in sight! Anyway, I digress.) My experiences with other players is chill a majority of the time. I bring a defib with me in solos and the most fun I've had in this game has been looking out for flares and coming to their rescue, reviving them and seeing their reaction. 

Recently I saw a flare go off, ziplined my way down to him, held up my cloaking device and walked through a bunch of hornets hovering around the guy as he was crawling away. (It looked pretty bad ass if I say so myself, wish I would have recorded it.) He didn't seem to have a mic and when I revived him he ran off. It was fun but I didn't think much of it. Later, I received a friend request on Steam and it was him. He just wanted to tell me I made his day and ""restored his faith in humanity a little.""

With all that being said, I still run into other players that want to be aggressive and take you out and take your stuff sometimes, and that's not a bad thing - it's part of the game and a legitimate way to play. Then there's the occasional rat, whose only interest seems to be hiding in corners and waiting for an opportunity to attempt to ruin your day, but it's just another aspect of it you have to accept. If you can't get past that then this might not be the game for you. As a matter of fact, if it wasn't part of the game, it would get boring and the fun/cooperative moments I have with other players wouldn't be as special. Knowing we could turn on each other at any moment keeps a little tension there that's exciting, and knowing we didn't, even though we could have, well I suppose that's my favorite part.

I'm curious who else is having a similar experience and if you've had any memorable moments like these.

- take shuttle to Cahuita/Punta Uva & spend a few days there at the beach and exploring the small towns
- go to Tortuguero by boat. Spend 1 night in Tortuguero. 
- go to La Fortuna and spend the rest of my time there (volcano Arenal, Rio Celeste, cloud forest, hot springs)
- shuttle to SJO on my last day
How does it look? I'm totally skipping Guanacaste and trading it with the Limon region. Is it a good idea for what I'm looking for? Or should I start with Guanacaste, move south from there, and skip Punta Uva/Cahuita instead?

Just stayed at this resort (mid Dec 2025). Family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 8). 
Overall, really great resort if you like something smaller, easily walkable

Overall look and feel - the resort is very new and modern. Rooms, restaurants everything is new and sleek. It’s a small and easily walkable resort and everything is close by, which I love (I’m not a fan of giant resorts where you need a golf cart to get around, for example). 

Rooms - the rooms are small. It’s the smallest resort room I’ve stayed in. The double queen is slightly larger than the king delight (and we had to pay extra for the 2 queen room). We also had a “view” of construction and the driveway of cars leading up to the resort. The view doesn’t bother me but it was noisy at night with trucks and construction at 2am, 4am, 6am, etc.

Pools - NOT HEATED. I’ve never had an issue before but the pools were COLD. The hot tubs were not hot (barely warm). Even the shallowest pools in the water park area were cool. We talked to some guests who had been before and they said the pools were previously heated so seems like they’re trying to cut costs there. We spent a good time in the pool but it is chilly. 

“Chair game” - beach chairs were plentiful and never an issue. But getting a chair by the family pool was an issue if you came after 9-9:30am. By 8:30am, about half of the chairs would be reserved with no one in the pool. The water park was slightly easier but still got busy. 

Beach - it’s not very wide but it is pretty long. Sargassum wasn’t an issue (there was a bit but it was cleaned and it didn’t bother us). The sand is nice and soft and the ocean was great and the beach wasn’t busy at all.

Food - honestly, I’ve stayed at many family resorts (finest, dreams, etc) and this is the best food we’ve had. But it’s also shown me how the server and service makes a huge difference. Also, we always made 6pm reservations and were able to be served quickly (typically). I’ll detail each restaurant/food experience we had -

Breakfast buffet - would be better if it was larger (there’s just 1 egg station for example and it typically has a line). It’s not huge but there’s a good selection. Great selection of fruits and fruits you can grab. Mexican food area, “American” breakfast area, breads and pastries, cheeses, meats, all the expected foods plus they have big vats of Mexican coffee and hot chocolate.   

Bungalow (beach front lunch spot) - this was the only lunch spot we went to (Cleo and twiggy have lunch options but too late for us with hungry kids). The selection is good. A few times, I’d go and pick up a few dishes and eat by the pool. If you come before 11:30/11;45, you can typically get your food pretty quickly (but we did once have a worse server and although we came early it took super long to get our stuff and there was mistakes). For a beachfront lunch restaurant, they have a good selection and some of our favourites were the chicken fajitas, sticky toffee pudding and catch of the day.  

Cleo (Mediterranean) - went once for dinner. We enjoyed it. The dips and bread they brought out were really good. We liked pretty much everything we ordered and the service was quick because we had an early reservation. 

Filia (Italian) - went twice for dinner. The burrata, margarita pizza, pastas and chicken parm were standouts. Osso Bucco was alright. The various breads you can choose at the beginning at great too. However, the first night we had an amazing server. Very attentive, knew the menu well, brought everything at the right time. 10/10 service. However, the second time we came our server wasn’t nearly as good (kept trying to upsell us on a $$ lobster pasta which we didn’t want), took away plates with food on them, just not the same level of service at all. 

Caracol (Mexican) - it was great. We really liked the shrimp ceviche, fish tacos, and the mains, especially the short rib, lamb, and sea bass. The chocolate dessert was super cool and tasty too. This was probably our favourite restaurant. However, also a good example of how service really impacts the dinner. First night, great server, made some suggestions, knew stuff about the menu, etc. Second visit, the server was nice but not as knowledgeable, forgot to bring our mains (asked if we wanted dessert while we were still waiting for mains), just a much poorer experience. 

Union (steakhouse) - it was good, I’d say the other restaurants are more memorable and stronger. We tried the striploin, tenderloin and rib eye steaks. They were undercooked (we asked for medium and they were more rare). Tried many of the sides (the roast potato wedges are fries lol). Beef empanadas were good.  

Bbq buffet on beach - this is an upsell (will talk more about that). They really pushed us to go to this and they had it twice during the week. It was my least favourite dinner and I don’t think we should need to pay extra for this. They did do a circus show and told us we could only watch the show if we pay and go for the buffet, which seems a bit ridiculous.  

Ice cream/coffee shop - have the same 6 or so flavours daily, they’re all fine. Would be nice to have some rotating flavours. Coffees and snacks were good. Could get a bit busy but would clear up quickly.

Verde (smoothie shop) - they don’t have everything on their menu but lots of options. It can definitely get busy and it takes time for the drinks to be made but it’s a great shop and we used it daily. They also have fruit you can grab and go. 

General notes. 
-the mocktail selection is great at each restaurant 
-the desserts at each restaurant were really impressive. Even the lunch spot on the beach. 
-I do not like the constant upsell and extra cost items. Every restaurant has a speciality menu and extra cost wines and drinks. Sometimes the servers really push these items and other times, they don’t. I don’t understand why we had to pay for the bbq beach buffet (it was around $15 a person which isn’t a huge cost but we’re at an all inclusive, it should be included). They have signs everywhere for $$ extras like their chocolate bonbons, fancier water at the ice cream shop, etc. 
-breakfast buffet - they were very nice about letting you take food out, which is convenient.

1psb5ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/hanoi/comments/1psb5ng/hanoi_shopping_and_walking_mostly_outside_old/,Hanoi shopping and walking (mostly outside Old Quarter) tips,"Hi - just finished my second trip to Hanoi this year (stopped a few days in Ninh Binh) and thought I'd share a few things I've learned. My wife and I are from Los Angeles, in our 30s and are not backpackers. We mostly like to eat, walk around cool neighborhoods and shop. 

Smog: we were there during the worst smog of the year. It sucks, but plenty of locals and tourists were walking around without masks going about their day. The visibility sucks (we couldn't see across West Lake), but unless you're super sensitive it won't really hinder you from doing anything for a few days. It also cleared up and we enjoyed a few days of clear blue skies. 

Eating: it sounds cliche, but the best spots we ate at were the plain looking spots with plastic stools, metal tables and lots of locals. Banh Mi 25 was a major letdown despite the long line of tourists and thousands of reviews. 

Buying Sneakers: I'm pretty into sneakers. If you're gonna buy fakes, I'd avoid the random places you see in Old Quarter. Surprisingly, Ninh Binh/Tam Coc (if you visit) shops had better quality replicas (especially at Bull Sneaker), with more colorways and ""rare"" drops. My wife regretted buying knockoff Solomon GT6s in Old Quarter after seeing the better quality reps in Ninh Binh. It'll cost a bit more (like $10) though. 

Haggling Note: street sellers do not come that far off their given price. My wife and I went to at least 10 different spots trying to find the best price for her chosen shoes and it was rare that any vendor knocked off more than 150k (a few bucks) off their original price. Maybe we're just bad at haggling though. 

Sneakers in Hanoi: the best quality replicas were at Hanoi Kickz (old quarter) and Shopgiayreplica. A little more expensive, but much closer to 1:1 replicas than random spots on Old Quarter Shoe street. 

Thrifting: the scene is growing here, and the exchange rate makes it extremely cheap. There was a cool store called Hanoi Punk (very close to Shopgiayreplica) - a rock-based thrift store where they had a great selection of leather jackets and bags. My wife found a vintage Givenchy clutch for $30 with a Japanese care card inside - Japan is extremely strict on only sourcing authentic thrift items so we felt good about the quality/verity. Hanoi Punk is located on the second floor of a not-so-nice residential apt building so you might be confused walking in. There's also an extremely friendly and sassy cat with a spiked collar in the store which was ridiculously cute. 

Mall Shopping: not worth buying western brands due to tariff markups. But if you go to the mall you'll find many familiar stores not readily available in the US. We went to Vincom Ba Trieu - a small luxury mall - and I found stores like AAPE (athletic streetwear), MLB (yes baseball) and Anta/Li-Ning (basically Asian Nike/Reebok).

Womens Leather: wife found a place called Better Shoes on Tiktok that sells fashionable genuine leather shoes for cheap. She liked this place so much that she bought two pairs of great quality, soft leather shoes for $40 total and would've bought boots but we didn't have any more luggage space.

Ba Trieu Street / Hai Ba Trung:  Better Shoes is on a street called Ba Trieu in an extremely pleasant neighborhoood called Hai Ba Trung. We enjoyed walking down this street (Better Shoes to Vincom Ba Trieu), wide sidewalks lined with a lot of women's fashion stores and cute side streets with lots of local cafes/restaurants. If you go a little west in the same area, you'll find another lake lined with great coffee shops. There was a coffee shop called Mono Coffee Lab hidden in a maze of alleyways filled with cool kids. It's much quieter than Old Quarter and reminded me a lot of neighborhoods in Ho Chi Minh City.

Phan Dinh Phung Street: walk down this street on a clear day/golden hour. It's huge, lined with many large trees with rays of light shining through, and we saw many young women doing photoshoots in photogenic areas. You'll walk by some historical buildings and some nicer cafes while heading back into Old Quarter. 

Come on a weekend: You'll catch the night market F-Sun, which is mostly just variations of stuff you can find in souvenir stores but fun for a night nonetheless. The city also blocks off part of the Old Quarter near Hoan Kiem Lake from vehicles to make it a busy walking street packed with locals. On a clear Sunday afternoon, part of the French Quarter was also blocked off and there were so many families outside enjoying a clear day...and of course loads of young women doing photoshoots around the lake ha. 

Locals - I know this list is probably funny to you but I'm hoping it helps visitors explore outside Old Quarter and find better quality goods! Love your country!

Looking for ideas/advice. I have an underlying irritation level that I can't connect to anything specifically. Some would call it a grumpiness. Sometimes it's overwhelming and it get in the way of clear thinking, or spills onto my wife/family. I'm hoping someone else has gotten to the root of this and can help out.

I have a beautiful family, good employment, and I'm in good enough health. I have nothing to be particularly irritated about,  although things definitely happen that irriate me and would irritate anyone. There's nothing specific some days, it's doesn't seem connected to anything in particular. I'm very grateful for my life. It seems to come from something else. Maybe food or chemical, I don't know.

I would say this began in late teen years. I have used cannabis in the past and drank heavily in the past, but am very moderate these days. It doesn't seem to correlate to those. Coffee seems to add to it a little, but it's there in the morning with or without coffee.

1psb4as,https://www.reddit.com/r/austinfood/comments/1psb4as/pasta_bar/,Pasta Bar,"We had dinner at Pasta Bar on Friday, and it was pricy, but delightful.  We loved how the entire experience was like theater, with an opening act in the bar area, the main event in the intimate dining room, and the closing act in the lounge.  We came in a few minutes early, and were greeted by a friendly hostess, who seated us and asked if we'd like a cocktail.  We obliged and then we were treated to two opening bites, both of which were two of the most artistic and best tasting things I've ever put in my mouth.  We were hooked.  Once we finished appetizers and drinks, the sommelier invited us into the dining room.

Architecturally the dining room is interesting.  It's very small, with eleven bar-height seats looking directly at the small kitchen.  The room is entirely black, reinforcing the idea that the small, busy, well organized kitchen is the show and we're the audience.  And it was a show indeed. Each course (there were 9 or 10, I lost count), was presented proudly and theatrically, and each wine selection was perfectly pared.  The courses included spaghetti, lasagna, crudo, duck, and wagyu beef, in stunning preparations.  The kitchen crew would occasionally chant together what they were making.  The ambient music selection was eclectic.  When we were done the head chef came over to make sure we were happy, and we were indeed.  I thought we'd get the bill, but there was still one more act.  The friendly hostess ushered us into another room.

The third and final act was in a dark, comfortable lounge room.  The hostess brought in a tin box full of cookies and other sweet bites and asked us if we'd like a drink or coffee.  We declined, because we were stuffed (it's rare to say that about a tasting menu). We chilled for a bit, and the hostess brought the check.  We paid and left very happy campers.

Now the downside.  Did I say it was pricy?  Let me reiterate--it's pricy.  That's the first $1k+ meal (with tip) for two we've ever had, and we've eaten at some very expensive restaurants.  Granted, we blew it out, but dang.  We did have one supplement (caviar) that was expensive and didn't add to the enjoyment of the meal, so I wouldn't recommend that.  The wine paring was expensive, but it was one of the best parings we've ever had.  Every wine was over the top good, so can't not suggest that.

Overall it was probably the most interesting restaurant experience we've ever had, but I still like the food at Barley Swine just ever so slightly more.  We're continuing our tasting menu tour with Hestia up next and then Craft Omakase the week after that, but as it stands today, it's Barley Swine for the food and Past Bar for the entire experience.",2,1766336121.0,austinfood,9,0.58,False

Feeling lost and confused.,"I've been best friends with Emily since we were kids. We grew up next door to each other, went to the same schools, and have been inseparable for as long as I can remember. Over the years, my feelings for her grew from purely platonic to something more. I found myself noticing little things, like how her nose crinkles when she laughs or how she always remembers my coffee order.

Recently, Emily has been going through a tough time. She got laid off from her job and has been struggling to find her footing. She's confided in me about feeling lonely and unlovable. It breaks my heart to see her so down on herself.

Last week, a buddy of mine sent me an article about how many people end up marrying their best friends. It got me thinking... maybe this was a sign. Maybe Emily and I were meant to be more than friends.

So, I decided to take a leap of faith. I planned a special picnic in our favorite childhood park. I picked up her favorite foods, got a bouquet of sunflowers (her favorite), and even wore the cologne she once complimented.

When the moment came, I poured my heart out. I told her how much she means to me, how I can't imagine my life without her, and how I think we could be really great together.

Her response? ""Oh, Jake... I love you, but not like that. You're like a brother to me.""

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. All this time, I thought we had a special connection. I thought the love and care between us could blossom into romance. But to her, I'm just good ol' Jake, the boy next door. The safe, reliable friend to cry on, but never the leading man.

I'm crushed. I feel like I've lost not only the chance at a relationship, but also the easy comfort of our friendship. How do I go back to being just buddies after this?

I'm worried I've ruined everything. Emily says she needs some space to process this, and I'm terrified that space will turn into a permanent gulf between us.

I wish I had never caught feelings for my best friend. I wish I could go back to being content with our friendship, no romantic strings attached. I feel so foolish for risking it all on a dream.

Has anyone else been in this situation? How do you move forward when your best friend doesn't love you back the way you love them? I could really use some support and perspective right now.

Takeaways from Manali you ask? Desi GHEE is purest here! You will forget A2 ghee that you get in metropolitan towns.

Do donate funds to Manali Strays as they help stray dogs, cats, monkeys and other animals too and thrive on surprise donations. Only animal welfare in Manali (I guess). Good karma for you?",29,1766335739.0,india_tourism,4,1.0,False

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

How do you learn to feel safe with someone? And stay without constantly fighting the urge to run away?",3,1766335700.0,WhatShouldIDo,3,1.0,False

I’ve been using my nespresso vertuo for quite some time. I’ve been able to make some pretty decent drinks like iced lattes and cappuccinos using the bianco doppio, double espresso dolce, and chiaro pods. 


I have a sleeve of sweet vanilla pods and every time I try and make an iced latte it just ends up all weird and watery and it never hits the spot. 

I feel like I’m preparing it wrong. Can anyone here help me out and tell me step by step on how to make an iced latte or some other type of coffee with it. 

Is sweet vanilla meant to be had as an espresso?

1psavm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ohiofromacrossthepond/comments/1psavm6/blue_jackets_fall_43_in_anaheim/,Blue Jackets Fall 4-3 in Anaheim,"Running on pure coffee and vibes for this one, a 3am puck drop on a Sunday morning here in the UK

Turned into a brutal ""late night"" as the Blue Jackets fell 4-3 to the Ducks in Anaheim. This one had that late night chaos feel written all over it, only for it to swing the Ducks way late in the third. Stayed up hoping for a big road win, but instead it was another one of those gut punch losses that hits even harder when the sun’s almost coming up

Things didn’t start well at all. Just over two minutes in, Anaheim struck first as Mikael Granlund snapped a quick shot through Elvis to make it 1-0. Before the Blue Jackets could even settle in, it was 2-0 Ducks less than a minute later. Jacob Trouba stepped into a one-timer and suddenly Columbus was chasing the game early

To their credit, the Blue Jackets responded. At 5:54, the power play came through. Dmitri Voronkov parked himself in front and tapped home a beautiful cross ice feed from Charlie Coyle to cut the deficit in half. Big response goal and a much-needed spark after a rough opening three minutes

Columbus settled things down after that and went to the intermission trailing 2-1, very much still in it

The Blue Jackets came out with more jump in the second, and it paid off. At 3:39, Mason Marchment tied the game at 2-2, tipping a Damon Severson point shot past Lukas Dostal. Nice debut moment for Marchment in his first game with Columbus, skating alongside Adam Fantilli and Kent Johnson

Unfortunately, the tie didn’t hold. Midway through the period, Anaheim regained the lead at 13:36. Mason McTavish found space and snapped a shot under Elvis arm to make it 3-2 Ducks

Columbus pushed late in the period but couldn’t find the equaliser, heading into the third period down one

The Blue Jackets showed real fight in the final period. At 12:44, Zach Werenski came up huge, blasting a shot blocker side through traffic to tie the game at 3-3. Another massive moment from Z, who continues to carry the blue line offensively. That was his team leading 14th of the season and capped yet another multi-point night

Just when it felt like momentum had fully swung, Anaheim answered back. At 16:31, Pavel Mintyukov slipped a shot through Elvis legs off a Granlund feed, giving the Ducks the lead once again at 4-3

Columbus kept pushing late, but things got even tougher when Werenski left the game with just over two minutes remaining after blocking a shot off his right foot. A scary moment for the Blue Jackets most important skater 

The officials called to many men on the ice despite Z being clearly hurt. That pretty much killed any hope the Blue Jackets had off tying it. That final push came up empty, and Anaheim held on to avenge Tuesday’s loss

Another frustrating result in what’s been a rough stretch. The Blue Jackets didn’t quit, battled back multiple times, and got strong efforts from Werenski, Voronkov, and Marchment, but the early hole and the late breakdown ended up being the difference

This team keeps showing flashes, but the margins are razor thin right now

On to the next one Monday night in Los Angeles

Tests late Saturday reveal no broken bones for Zach Werenski, who crawled to the bench in agony late in the loss. He's day-to-day

Huh.

Can't imagine why that might be.

I've also faced the past couple of days strong. Oh, no, I haven't started any of the big home improvement projects on my list, but both days I worked on a couple of my fun little projects..... before I even finished my coffee. Not worried one bit about being questioned about what I'm doing, or told I'm not doing it right, or.......

Well. Anyhoo.

A nervous system that's not constantly on high alert is a truly wondrous thing. Oh, I am *far* from healed, and I only have a few more days of this rest, but....

I want to give that to you, too.

That feeling of peace, of being at ease.

I want to be the one you finally let your guard down—*completely down*—around.

And I want it be *earned*. By showing you again and again and again that I deserve it.

And if I ever fail, I know it'll be hard for you, but I want you to *tell me*. And, one day, maybe you'll be able to. In the meantime, I will do my best to read your signals. I am starting to get them. I'll only get better at it with time. And closeness.

I think, little bird, what I'm saying is......

I want to heal with you. Together.

Hey everyone,   
For coffee lovers, who love a freshly ground coffee but only has a budget to get a manual grinder, I am working on something interesting, I am huge fan of how the Weber EG-1 looks but I don't have the budget to get that grinder, so I am in the process of designing a mini replica using 3d printing parts, Timemore C3S manual coffee grinder and motor that replicates the hand grinding rpm with the coffee grounds knocker so we wont have any stuck coffee grounds in there. I am half way there into the design and will be making the designs available online. I am designing to have some flexibility to accomodate different motors and grinders so anymore with almost any manual grinder can use this. I am trying to keep this built under $60 and easy to print and assembly. Let me know your thoughts on this. Thanks. 

PS: i dont know any particular sub reddit for 3d printing coffee accessories, if someone can tag those that would be great.",1,1766335159.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

I’m almost not new to Pune anymore 😄 Been here for a while now because of work and currently staying in KP (Koregaon Park).

I was born and brought up in Mumbai, so the city vibe still runs in my blood, but Pune has slowly grown on me - the cafés, evening walks, and the calmer pace of life.

If anyone around KP (or nearby areas) feels like hanging out, chilling over coffee, taking a walk, or just having random conversations, I’d be happy to connect. No pressure, just good company and good vibes.

1psapr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1psapr6/first_dating_experience_things_moved_fast_and_i/,"First dating experience, things moved fast, and I wasn’t sure of my feelings — what did I do wrong?","I’m a 21M and had no prior dating experience before this. I met a 23F through Hinge. We started texting and talking on calls for about a week before deciding to meet for the first time.

I was really excited because this was the first time someone was showing this much interest in me, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. She told me early on that when she likes someone, she puts in a lot of effort and gives it her all.

Our first meet wasn’t really planned. I was coming back from somewhere and had a few free hours, so I casually asked if she wanted to meet at a common spot. She agreed. She showed up with a **handmade bouquet of tulips** because she couldn’t find real ones—and I had told her earlier that tulips were my favourite. I was completely floored.

We had coffee at a nice café, and I had brought my wired earphones, so we ended up listening to music together. We spent about 2–3 hours together. While leaving, things felt a bit awkward. I don’t know why, but I went for a handshake. She then asked if we could hug (thankfully), because I was super awkward.

We met again for a second date—went to a movie and then walked around holding hands. This was my **first time ever holding hands**, so it felt special.

After that, we talked and chatted a lot every day. I told her honestly that I needed some time to understand whether I was enjoying this because it was all new to me, or if I genuinely had feelings for her. She was okay with this and said we had time.

By the third date, things got pretty close. There were several moments where we could have kissed, but I stopped myself because I wasn’t sure. During that date, she asked if we were official—if we were dating. I froze and repeated what I had told her before: that it had only been 3–4 weeks and I needed more time. She seemed fine with it.

At this point, I started feeling guilty. She was very invested—she wrote handwritten letters and clearly cared a lot. Meanwhile, I still wasn’t sure about my feelings. I was torn between two thoughts:

* Ending things early and hurting her now, or
* Waiting and hoping my feelings would grow later (while also worrying that if they never did, it would hurt her even more).

On our fourth date, I was determined to talk to her about this. But when we were together, everything felt right. She gave me a card with photos from all our previous dates and Spotify QR codes for songs associated with each one. It was incredibly thoughtful.

We were having a really nice moment and were about to kiss. I told her again that I wasn’t sure and that it might not be right to kiss her. She said she doesn’t like regrets and would regret not doing it. I asked her twice if she was sure. At that point, I was really tempted.

I pulled her closer. Our lips touched, our glasses bumped, and she stopped and giggled. I took off my glasses and tossed them aside, and then we kissed. It was passionate and honestly really nice—my **first kiss ever**. She complimented me a lot, said I was a good kisser, and joked about how the glasses thing was very “filmy.”

Despite how nice it was, I still didn’t feel deeply interested in her in the way she was in me.

Later, during a late-night call, I told her all of this honestly. She was hurt and said she had grown attached. I could tell she wasn’t okay, and that hurt me too. But I didn’t want to fake feelings just because she liked me a lot. I felt that doing so would only hurt her more in the long run. Despite her asking to meet for a last time , i didn't and we didn't talk after that.....

**Her:** In theory absolutely!!! But I am a horrible friend to hang out with because I’m chronically tired and never wanna leave the house. But I’m always thinking we should go as a group to get food after the food shares!!

(me  male  39  // her 30 f)

——

I thought I had all the signals. Turns out I'm a fucking idiot.

We’d been volunteering together for 8 weeks. We are in the same volunteer org. She has everything I look for, unique/niche shared values, smart, funny, and she seemed incredibly warm in every interaction.

She asked me if I was cold and if I wanted her to walk 3 minutes to her car and get me a Hot Hands hand warmer. The next two weeks she brought me more hand warmers on her own.

She came up to me one day when I got there and asked immediately if I drive an SUV. I said yeah why? She goes “I knew it, I probably seem like a stalker haha”

She constantly asks if I’m coming back next week

She consistently makes it a point to walk me to my car at the end of the night, happened last 4 times. If she’s behind me, she calls my name to catch up - it happened twice that I left before her and she called my name and caught up with me and wished me a good night in a very warm way, and she always asks if I'm coming the next week. She also asked if I wanted to see her bumper stickers. 

Here's a big one: we just had a party for the group we volunteer in last week that she asked if I was going to. We went and she chose to sit with me, alone, at a tiny table, for 90 minutes. There was 0 silence or awkwardness for an hour and a half.  She asked if I want to walk out with her as a pair (""wanna catch this wave of people leaving?"") and we walked to our cars together as usual,  she asked if I was coming next week.

She told me I have great genes because I look young

We have been DMing back and forth with fast responses. She has initiated on occasion and always responds enthusiastically 

She liked / heart-reacted to all my discord messages, definitely goes out of her way to react / like mine more than other people. 

She was talking about a creepy guy there, 50 years older, persistently asking her to go out with him - he even bought her earrings for christmas - she joked that she was gonna tell him that she was a lesbian but she didn’t wanna lie *in case she brings a guy she’s dating to the food share where we volunteer.*

She told me he the above guy was scaring her last time and asked me to step in if I ever see him getting too close and she can't escape the conversation.

She asked me two days ago when I mentioned the food share was running late: “why you in a rush, you got a date?”

We consistently spent 60% of the time volunteering next to each other smiling, laughing, and joking, week after week, every time. She always gravitated back to me.

**NONE of this guaranteed romantic interest.**

Sadly I feel worse than not knowing.

I checked voltages on each cell and they were all correctly sitting at storage, it was the only battery of the 5 assembled wrong.

Its not a big problem to fix but it would put a damper on your day if you were a strictly plug and play pilot or uneasy about messing with batteries.

Always looking for new goals, trying new ways of being healthier, and I LOVE learning and strive to always challenge my beliefs. I enjoy my career (I work as an operator in the chemical manufacturing industry), It provides a good living (which was lacking for most of my life lol) and it gives me an ample amount of time to stay in touch with you throughout the day if you're the type.  

Long distance relationships don't bother me too much (US only), ideally after a set amount of time we both feel like it's appropriate we would move in together and start that journey (relocation to me is ideal). 

I have a lot of interests ranging from gaming to binging watching some of my favorite shows; moral of the story is escapism is one of my favorite past times. I \*love\* running, go to the gym regularly, playing with my pit/lab mix dog named Strider (LOTR reference), a frequent flyer so i love to travel and reading (on a bit of a history theme lately). I love LOVE coffee, hanging with my friends, going to music festivals, and trying new restaurants. As you can tell, I'm a bit of a nerd so fantasy being a huge thing for me ranging from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays and everything in between. I do visit my local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume so it would be cool if we could bond that way!

I like small things in relationships that include weekend cuddles (obsessed), evening coffee shop reading dates, lazy mornings, random road trips and hitting the gym together! Maybe we're holding hands at the farmers market looking for dinner ingredients, snuggling in a hammock on a beautiful summer day, or riding bikes/running together. Putting on your playlist in the car cause chances are you're in charge of it xD, you sneaking kisses on my cheek while I'm playing games with my friends, dressing in our A+ outfits and getting lost in time on our date...I'm rambling too much but you get the gist.  

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the same hobbies, having the same goals and future outlook is most important. I'm very inquisitive so I tend to ask a lot of questions, I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.  

I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side!

then one day I realized I wasn't living, I was just not dying.

I've spent the last year deep diving into how high performers actually structure their days. not the bullshit productivity porn you see on YouTube. the real stuff. I studied dozens of books on flow states, listened to every Tim Ferriss podcast about routines, read research on circadian rhythms and willpower depletion.

here's what I learned: most people are optimizing for the wrong things.

## stop trying to ""find time"" and start designing your energy

here's the thing nobody tells you about productivity. time management is fake. energy management is real.

your brain has roughly 4 hours of deep focus capacity per day. that's it. you can fight this with caffeine and willpower, but you'll just burn out faster.

\*\*the real strategy\*\*: schedule your hardest creative work during your biological peak hours. for most people that's 2-4 hours after waking. not after you've already answered 47 emails and attended three meetings.

I started blocking 6am-10am for deep work only. no phone. no internet. just my writing and a cup of coffee. this single change did more for my output than any productivity hack ever did.

the book ""When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing"" by Daniel Pink completely changed how I think about this. Pink is a bestselling author who synthesizes decades of chronobiology research into actually useful insights. he breaks down exactly when to do different types of work based on your natural energy curves throughout the day.

honestly? this is the best book on productivity I've ever read. not because it teaches you to do more, it teaches you to do the RIGHT things at the RIGHT times.

## your routine should protect your creativity, not kill it

most morning routines rou are just performative bullshit. cold showers, 47 supplements, meditation for exactly 23 minutes. exhausting.

here's what actually matters: \*\*reduce decision fatigue and protect your best hours.\*\*",1,1766334630.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

The highlight of the night for me was an absolutely gorgeous Dailuaine that was finished in a mystery barrique that we suspect was initially used for a French red wine. This was a really fantastic waxy dram with tamarind, coffee, marzipan and christmas spices.

We were given a bonus pour of a Glenlossie finished in Sauvignon Blanc as well which suffice to say was also excellent and a really great example of an unusual finish done right.

For those 6 whiskies plus canapés, the £35 ticket felt like highway robbery.

And as if the day couldn't get any better, my friend and I managed to grab a pour of a Vault's Collection 30 year old Linkwood for £11 each as the society are currently offloading VC stock to make way for the creator's collection.

all valid points but it simply doesn't apply to me. I used to lie about everything: past gfs (non existent), funny situations, films that didnt exist and I invented the plot on the spot; revolutions in the mountains of Dagelstan that never came to fruition, purposeful misattribution of quotes, etc etc. -and the thing is that people did unironically like me more. I was very liked by my friends despite the fact 90% of what they thought was me was just pure invention for the love of the game.

I stopped because at some point I was lying about extremely silly stuff, like, my mom would ask me what I was doing in the kitchen and I would  instinctively conjure something about learning a new pie recipe or whatever, when in reality I was just making coffee. I thought getting caught on some silly lie like that would be more embarassing than simply revealing I'm a pathetic and extremely banal man, so I eventually stopped the habit.

now I tell all the boring truths about my life, I lie about nothing, I tell it all to my coworkers about my boring weekends spent at home reading Cioran and going to the gym; I dont invent any stories about crazy exes or funny encounters etc. the result is that I'm even more isolated and have even fewer connections than I used to when I just spouted bullshit. I'm simply worse off.

It’s now very rare for me to have any stomach issues after years of suffering (and no help from medical professionals). Hope it helps someone!

1.  Start every morning with a tall glass of warm lemon water.  This is a non negotiable. Sometimes I add a pinch of salt. 

2. High protein breakfast (usually scrambled eggs with a big chunk of pressed cottage cheese for additional protein). 

3. Coffee only AFTER breakfast. Another non negotiable and game changer. Never ever on an empty stomach. 

4. Eliminated all gluten, seed oils, and most processed foods. In terms of dairy, I don’t eat a ton of it but only eat high fat and the cleanest I can find (nothing with fillers like guar gum, carrageenan, etc). 

5. I stay away from high sugar fruits but otherwise don’t limit fruit intake
