1gb3ho4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gb3ho4/the_last_three_years_have_felt_like_an_elaborate/,The last three years have felt like an elaborate prank.,"I just need to vent to someone I don’t know, because to everyone I know, I’ve got to (somewhat) hold it together.

Three years ago, my husband and I moved states to be closer to family because we had our first baby. It took us a year to find a house, and we had to stay with family twice and at a terrible, nightmare of a rental at another point. Feel like I was robbed of a happy first pregnancy because of all the chaos and drama that came with our living situations. We’re not people who are involved in drama, ever.

I also left a 7-year career I loved to be a stay at home mom. Love my toddler and baby more than life itself, but we’ve had so many obstacles all at once that I feel like I’m spiraling mentally and can’t enjoy being a parent.

We bought a beautiful, old home two years ago and it’s been nothing but trouble. We have had to replace both HVAC units, fix the crawlspace, replace a bathroom, and were lied to during the sale of the home. Poison oak, ivy, and sumac keep overtaking all of the vegetation on our property, no matter what we do. A year ago, a skunk got under our house and sprayed and it took a month to get rid of the smell. Two months ago, fleas somehow got into our house and we had no idea how until we found a hole in hidden deep in the foundation and a feral cat with fleas living under the house. We’ve also had an opossum, squirrels and bats get into our house or crawlspace. Seems like old homes just have endless entry spaces no matter how many times/ways you seal up the house.

A guy started building a house in the woods behind our property a few months ago (legally, on a piece of property he owns). Since then he has stolen our water, illegally made changes to our property, threatened to sue us for defamation after we asked utility companies how he was getting away with what he was doing, and he’s just constantly causing tension and drama around here. We’re just peaceful, chill people. We don’t invite drama, why is it chasing us?

Every couple of weeks we are coming across something we need to repair or purchase. Our vehicles have started acting up. We have chickens and one of them was killed last night. Our six month old baby has been a terrible sleeper since day one and I get about 1.5 hrs of sleep per night (my husband works 14 hour days and leaves for work at 3am so nights fall solely on me unless I’m desperate for help). Our toddler is in a sleep regression and it takes 2-3 hours of her crying and screaming per night to get her to sleep, no matter what we try.

I’ve lost hair from stress and have a receding hairline at 28 years old. I can’t lose the baby weight even though I’m eating very well and very little. None of my clothes fit anymore and I still haven’t made any friends in this area. Every day is just a blur of stress and I feel like I’m missing out on all of the important and special things.

While typing this, I spilled my coffee on a brand new rug, and tripped and fell while going to get carpet cleaner 😂

Bleh. I feel better after venting. I have so much to be thankful for and just needed to get the stupid stuff off my chest. Gonna move on now.",1,1729778915.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1gb3f0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stripe/comments/1gb3f0b/psa_stripe_is_not_the_same_as_having_your_own/,PSA - Stripe is NOT the same as having your own Merchant Account. >> Things I with I knew starting as a new business owner processing payments.,"TL;DR:  Stripe is a convenient payment processing proxy for your business with it's own rules.  A ""merchant account"" is your own direct banking relationship, but with all the pre-qualifiers of approval.  
\-----  
  
DISCLAIMER:  I am \*not\* a professional in the payments industry, nor do I have any expertise in this field beyond my own experience (and I'm definitely not promoting anything).  I'm just another normal small business owner trying to get legitimately paid for my business services (and scared \*\*\*tless reading some posts here).

There is one concept that seems to be commonly misunderstood in this sub that I've only come to slowly realize myself as an online merchant with several years of successful processing with Stripe, PP, etc,.. and just more recently my own merchant account:  
  
1. Stripe (or PayPal & Square) are not providing you a real banking ""Merchant Account"".  You are getting access to share in \*their\* merchant account.  This is why Stripe has it's own terms-of-use and rules that are more restrictive regarding payouts and chargebacks than normal banking rules may be in your local region.  You are playing in Stripe's sandbox and sharing their toys.  You are not building a true merchant/payment bank processing history using these services (at least not one that is transferable to most normal banks).  This relationship is more like borrowing your friend's credit card for a day of Xmas shopping and having your own personal handshake agreement on the terms of how to use it.  It does not build your own credit score.

2. A ""merchant account"" for an online business is an actual partnership with a online payment gateway, a payment processor \*and\* a bank that agrees to underwrite your business (risk assessment, credit, etc).

3. Getting a real merchant account involves several weeks of application process - including providing all your personal, banking and credit information.  If you are a new business this will mean many months of personal banking statements, credit checks, full personal information on all business owners (addresses, contact info, ID cards, personal SSNs/tax IDs, business EIN, etc).  It may also even include a surprise physical site visit to your business office address by your payment processor's agent.  (Hi Bob, would you like some coffee?)

4.  Having a legitimate merchant account will give you the ability to fully process credit cards - even an online virtual CC terminal and the use of physical CC terminals.  It will ALSO make you liable for your website and business being PCI complaint for the privacy and handling of CC data (and the associated liability to be sued for screwing it up).

5.  A legitimate merchant account for a new processor will likely mean you'll pay not only % fees on each transaction, but also some monthly processor/gateway fees and even a ""hold back"" period where X% of every transaction is held in escrow by your processor to build up a reserve against you going out of business and being liable to customers for refunds/chargebacks.  On the flip side, once your business builds up 6+ months of clean transaction history, you can shop yourself around to other processors for better rates.

\-----

With all of this understood - this is why Stripe may seem to ""approve"" you at initial signup, and then kick you out (and freeze your assets) later.   They appear to take the approach of ""approve most anyone to start, and then actually validate the business once the money starts flowing"".  This makes some business sense if you consider the global volume of applicants signing up for their service.  If you were a FinTech payment biz, why would expend so many ""person hours"" doing all the validations mentioned above to verify a new merchant/subscriber when likely 80+% of them will never process any real transaction volume (which is where you actually earn money yourself from them in fees)?

Stripe appears to wait until some certain trigger threshold of $$ transactions is met, then they start to actually look at your business and decide if it really meets the ToS criteria, if you have valid IDs, etc, 

As a small business owner I 100% understand how processing transactions for months with everything going smoothly and then suddenly losing access overnight to both your payment processing and existing funds could absolutely crush your cashflow and ability to live (aka. pay rent to not be homeless).  

For myself, the massive amount of horror stores in this sub motivated me to get my own merchant account as a fallback. Going through that process then helped me to understand better how this all works and now evaluate my risk of processing with 3rd party providers.  

**I guess the point of this..** if you understand what you're signing up for you can better evaluate your own risk.  If you even think you may not be able to meet the criteria above (including all the Stripe qualifiers of being in a ""high risk"" industry), then it may be in your interest to not try processing with Stripe/PP/Square, and instead just apply for a real merchant account out of the gate (it seems many business banks also offer this an additional service add-on).  This way, you'll know in advance if your payment processor will accept your business and can rest easier once you are approved.  Plus you'll now have a banking business partner, with an actual dedicated account reps (aka. individual email & phone support), and even a real bank that will help you fight against illegitimate disputes and customer CC fraud.  

This is not bashing on Stripe.  I've been happy with their service/tools and the fees they charge me are in line with having my own merchant account as a small biz.  As my business hopefully scales, the % I save per transaction with my ""real"" merchant account will benefit me more, but in the meantime, Stripe also has advantages with their online tools.

1gb3ef3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Air_Fountain/comments/1gb3ef3/wuyi_tea_the_king_of_oolong_teas/,Wuyi Tea: The King of Oolong Teas,"Wuyi Tea, known *in Chinese as* 武夷茶, is a highly celebrated type of oolong tea that originates from the majestic Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province, China. Known for its unique flavor profile and rich cultural heritage, Wuyi Tea is often referred to as the ""king of teas"" and is one of the top ten famous teas in China. It is widely recognized for its distinctive qualities that blend the freshness of green tea with the depth and complexity of black tea. Among the many varieties of Wuyi Tea, **Wuyi Rock Tea** (武夷岩茶) and **Da Hong Pao** (大红袍) are particularly revered for their exceptional taste and history.

# The Unique Origins: Wuyi Mountains and the Seven Stars

Wuyi Tea is named after its place of origin, the Wuyi Mountains, a stunning UNESCO World Heritage site located in northern Fujian. The Wuyi Mountains are often referred to as the ""Southeast Seven Stars"" because of their striking natural beauty and mystical significance in Chinese culture. The region is famous for its rugged terrain, which creates a unique microclimate ideal for tea cultivation. The rocky cliffs and fertile soil provide the perfect conditions for growing Wuyi Tea, which is also known as Wuyi Rock Tea due to the influence of the rocky terrain on the tea plants.

The environment in Wuyi Mountain plays a crucial role in the tea's flavor. The mountainous terrain, combined with frequent mists and fogs, allows the tea leaves to mature slowly, absorbing the minerals from the soil and the moisture from the air. This slow-growing process contributes to the tea's distinctive aroma and rich taste.

[Authentic Wuyi black tea is “Lapsang Souchong”. Its origin is at Tongmuguan Jiangdun and Miaowan area of Wuyi Mountain Nature Reserve. Tongmu, Jiangdun and Miaowan village of Tongmuguan is the base for American, England and other countries’ missionaries to spread Christian.](https://preview.redd.it/gewzr0vmnpwd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc321b85009737af9320f57be058f58a89618657)

# Wuyi Rock Tea: The Essence of Oolong

Wuyi Rock Tea (武夷岩茶) is considered the finest of all oolong teas and is widely regarded as the best oolong tea in China. It is a semi-fermented tea, meaning that its production process lies between that of green tea and black tea. This unique method gives Wuyi Tea its signature characteristics: the fresh and floral fragrance of green tea combined with the robust and smooth taste of black tea. The semi-fermentation process allows the tea to develop complex flavors, including hints of roasted nuts, minerals, and fruit, creating a tea-drinking experience that is both refreshing and full-bodied.

Wuyi Rock Tea is known for its ""rock essence"" (岩韵), which refers to the mineral-rich flavor derived from the rocky soil where the tea plants grow. The unique ""rock flavor"" is a key factor that distinguishes Wuyi Rock Tea from other types of oolong. Connoisseurs of tea often describe the taste of Wuyi Rock Tea as smooth and mellow, with a lingering aftertaste that combines sweetness and richness.

# Da Hong Pao: The Legendary Tea

One of the most famous types of Wuyi Tea is **Da Hong Pao** (大红袍), or ""Big Red Robe,"" which has achieved legendary status in the world of tea. Da Hong Pao is known for its high quality, exceptional taste, and rich cultural significance. It is a type of Wuyi Rock Tea but is considered to be in a league of its own due to its superior flavor and historical importance.

The origins of Da Hong Pao are surrounded by myth and folklore. According to legend, the mother of a Ming Dynasty emperor was once cured of an illness after drinking Da Hong Pao, and in gratitude, the emperor had the tea bushes that produced the leaves dressed in large red robes to protect them from the elements. The original Da Hong Pao tea bushes, which are said to be over 350 years old, still grow on the cliffs of Wuyi Mountain, though tea produced from these original bushes is exceedingly rare and expensive.

Da Hong Pao is known for its complex flavor profile, which includes roasted, floral, and fruity notes with a smooth, thick mouthfeel. It has a lingering aftertaste that is both sweet and slightly smoky, making it a favorite among tea connoisseurs around the world. Due to its legendary status and exceptional quality, Da Hong Pao is considered one of the most prestigious teas in China and can fetch exorbitant prices at auction.

# Production Process: The Art of Wuyi Tea

The production of Wuyi Tea is a meticulous process that requires skill and precision. The tea leaves are hand-picked, and only the tender, young shoots are selected. Once harvested, the leaves undergo partial fermentation, which is a delicate balance between the oxidation process of black tea and the minimal oxidation of green tea. After fermentation, the leaves are roasted over charcoal, which gives Wuyi Tea its characteristic roasted aroma and flavor.

The roasting process is critical to the development of the tea's flavor. Depending on the desired taste, the tea leaves may be roasted multiple times at varying temperatures. This process not only enhances the tea’s fragrance but also gives it a longer shelf life. The final product is a tea that combines the freshness of green tea with the smoothness of black tea, along with the unique mineral notes that are characteristic of Wuyi Rock Tea.

# The Health Benefits of Wuyi Tea

Like many oolong teas, Wuyi Tea is not only enjoyed for its flavor but also for its numerous health benefits. It is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from free radical damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. The polyphenols in Wuyi Tea are known to promote digestion, improve metabolism, and aid in weight loss. Additionally, the tea’s moderate caffeine content provides a gentle energy boost, enhancing mental alertness and focus without the jittery effects associated with coffee.

Wuyi Tea is also believed to have calming properties that help reduce stress and promote relaxation. The combination of its smooth taste and soothing aroma makes it an ideal tea for unwinding after a long day.

I was diagnosed in 2015 with relapsing remitting MS and was initally taking Teroflunomide, I changed to diroximel fumarate around 12 months ago. Since diagnosis I have been lucky enough to have never knowingly experienced any relapse in my MS although an MRI in 2017 did show new activity, nothing new has shown up since then. 

  
Because of this background I genuinly have no idea what a relapse actually looks or feels like, so I dont know if what I am currently experiencing is one. 

  
I came back from a family holiday about a week ago and was feeling OK, I returned to work on Tuesday and after that a wall of tiredness hit me like a tsunami. I have never suffered with fategue before and the only time I have ever felt this tired was when I had COVID about 3 years ago (I have no other symptoms so fairly sure its not that). I feel lightheaded and I am struggling to concentrate on tasks. Driving to work yesterday I thought I should probably not be driving feeling like this as I could feel my eyes zoning out. I slept for 12 hours on Tuesday night into Wednesday and another 10 hours last night and I wake up feeling no more rested than I went to bed. Coffee doesnt seem to lift the malaise either.  



So, does this sound like a relapse? If so what should I do? I have regular meetings with my MS team a few times a year, should I reach out to them?

We were and still are in a somewhat small community of friends and coworkers, where everyone knows everything. The pain of our entire city knowing and speculating kept me from initiating the divorce for a long time, until I couldn't take it anymore. 

When we initially physically separated, I was so lonely. The kids were with him 50% of the time and the adjustment was one of the most painful processes I've been through. I cried regularly. I would have done anything to get a text or a phone call from someone asking if I wanted to go out for coffee, or just asking ""how are YOU?"". But most people didn't, and I didn't really even know who to reach out to beside my mom and my BFF who lives in another state. Locally, nobody really seemed to care about how I was doing.

Now it's about 10 months later. The clouds have parted somewhat. He and I are very amicable but definitely separated. And I find it really incredible how the same people who went black when things were really hard, are now the people asking me all about my divorce. ""Is it final? Who got which assets? Is it cordial? Are you dating? Is he dating?"". The questions are not actually about my well-being, or his, but just information-seeking. And why? People I am NOT even remotely good friends with, asking me all about it. I feel like a rebuttal is in order, like ""how is YOUR marriage and sex life??"" or ""why do you want to know?"", but I try to be polite even though it's intensely annoying. Anyway.

I remember being young and coming down the stairs every morning and looking out back and seeing my dad throwing up over the back railing. I think his morning cigarette did him in. This was an every single day affair sometimes a few times in the morning and we kinda assumed that it was because of a problem he had with alcohol at the time. But now that I am growing and starting to really feel the effects of this disease, i’m realizing i’m doing the same. 
I wake up, have a couple sips of water, and throw them right back up. Drinking slowly doesn’t often help. Sometimes it takes me being awake for a couple hours before I can even keep a cup of coffee down. I always feel better after I vomit, but I’m tired of this being an every morning thing and I wanted to ask if anyone else is having this. is this a PKD thing? or should I be speaking to my primary care physician about something else?

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

I must have looked like I won the Hamilton lottery in 2015 as I saw the seminal text (to a niche audience) “Inside Out and Outside In” (Berzoff et al., 2016) amongst the James Patterson novels.

Is this the crystal slipper in my quest for kindred spirits? Who placed this lightly coffee-stained paperback - whose pirated PDFs I reference daily - into the Little Free Library I visit daily? Are you my new best friend? My soulmate? Or have I lost my mind from sitting through the bastardization that the MSW curriculum had become?

Are you also a psychoanalytic social worker? Are you also a single, monogamous millennial of the sapphic persuasion? Are you in my Practice III class, and we’ve already met? Or maybe you’re a DBT stan who hates the unconscious!

1gb2ur4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberCupid/comments/1gb2ur4/happn_dating_app_review_does_serendipity_really/,Happn Dating App Review – Does Serendipity Really Work for Finding Love?,"Ever passed someone on the street and thought, “What if...?” Well, *Happn* is the dating app that tries to turn that little “what if” into something real. Unlike the usual swipe-fests, *Happn* matches you with people you’ve physically crossed paths with. You walk past a stranger at a coffee shop? Boom—Happn's got you both covered. It’s like a second chance at that meet-cute moment you missed.

So, what’s it really like using *Happn*? I gave it a shot to see if serendipity can actually lead to love. Spoiler: It’s fun, but there are a few quirks.

**How It Works**  
Once you set it up, *Happn* tracks your real-time location and shows profiles of people you’ve encountered throughout the day. Kinda cool, right? It’s like Tinder, but instead of endless swipes, you see folks from your daily routine—people who were literally right next to you at some point. You like their profile, they like yours, and now you’re chatting about the coffee shop where you almost met.

**What Makes It Different**  
The main draw here is *Happn’s* real-time matching. You’re not just swiping through randoms; you’re swiping through people you’ve *actually* crossed paths with. Honestly, it makes dating feel a bit more organic. If I liked someone’s profile and saw that we’d both been at the same park or café, it gave us something fun to start chatting about.

Oh, and there’s a game called **CrushTime**—you guess who’s liked you from four profiles. I won’t lie, it’s a fun little distraction.

**What’s Cool, What’s Meh**  
The best thing? It feels real. No more endless scrolling through faces you’ll never meet. Plus, you can send a **FlashNote** (basically a message) *before* matching, so if you’re feeling bold, you can make the first move. I found this great for getting noticed quickly.

But there are cons too. If you’re in a smaller town, *Happn* might be a bit of a dud. The app’s charm works best in big cities where crossing paths with strangers happens all the time. Also, watch out for battery drain—*Happn* keeps your GPS going, so don’t be surprised if your phone dies quicker than usual.

**My Verdict**  
So, is *Happn* the best thing since sliced bread? Maybe not, but it’s a refreshing take on dating apps. For city dwellers, it’s a fun way to see who’s nearby and take the plunge into serendipitous romance. But if you’re chilling in a small town, it might feel like you’re waiting for a match that never shows up.

Bottom line: If you’re bored of swiping and want something that feels a bit more...real, *Happn* could be your app. And hey, even if you don’t find “the one,” at least you’ll know who’s been checking you out at your local coffee spot.",1,1729777150.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False

I think I’ve lost around 10 pounds so far. My main concern is whether this routine is sustainable. I know I’m the type who can stay consistent if I don’t stray from the plan, but I’m worried that if I take a cheat meal or indulge too much, I’ll derail and lose motivation.

I take 5-10mg olanzapine at night for sleep and because my dr thinks I need it but I don’t want to put on weight because I feel disgusting when I’m too overweight- I’m 165cm and 75kg.  

So the dr gave me duromine 30mg which I have been on before and I believe it did give me energy whilst reducing my appetite however that was over 10yrs ago.  My first day taking it I was lucky I only had a 4hr shift because I was almost falling asleep on the job, the second day was much the same I felt a slight elevation in mood- a bit speedy but by lunchtime I was exhausted again.  

Thanks to a couple of short blacks I restored my energy but I’m really confused as to how after taking 30mg at around 7am I’m starving by 11am and exhausted by midday yet coffee which I drink very little of gave me more energy than these stupid pills.  I’m thinking it’s not indicative of undiagnosed adhd because it used to work.

Anyone else suffer from this?  If the pills weren’t $100 a box I’d just throw them away but perhaps it’s the method of administration like idk if it’d instant release or extended release

Imagine that you have a long-lost uncle who is wildly successful as a coffee merchant.  You know almost nothing about this uncle, until he dies, and his lawyers contact you and invite you to a reading of his will.  In his will, you find out that he has left you his entire coffee empire, which is worth tens of millions of dollars!  There is a catch however!  You cannot receive the inheritance unless you can honestly claim that you LOVE coffee.  The lawyers are going to give you a lie detector test where you must say out loud: *“I love coffee.  Coffee is delicious, and I deeply enjoy drinking it*” without setting off the lie detector test, which voids the entire thing.

The problem is that you hate coffee! From the very first time your parents gave you a sip of it as a young child up until this very moment!   The lawyer continues the reading of the will which says, “*If you cannot proclaim that you love coffee today, you may return in exactly one year and take the lie detector test again.”* 

You have one year to learn to love coffee in order to receive this incredible inheritance that will change your life.  How do you go about doing it?

1.)   We would start by drinking a small amount of coffee every single day.  When I started to drink coffee, Matushka had to pour 10 teaspoons of flavored creamer and dump in half a bottle of Hershey syrup for me to swallow it.  Eventually, I decreased the amount of sugar and creamer slowly, to where today, people who see me drink coffee would say that I now put in the *“normal amount”.*

2.)   We would begin to learn all there is to know about coffee!  Where is it grown?  Who grows it?  What kinds of coffee are there?  There are coffees from all over the world.  We would learn about iced coffees, French pressed, pour overs, etc.

3.)   We would surround ourselves with people who love coffee, because that makes it easier to begin to like and tolerate something.  We would go to cafes and coffee shops, talking to people about why they like coffee and what kinds of coffee do they prefer.

All these things and more would help us to develop a tolerance for something that we did not like.  Eventually, we get to a begrudging appreciation, a few moments of pleasure here and there, and then towards the end, a real deep appreciation for the drink that is going to change our lives forever.

I heard this image on “The Arena” podcast by Fr. Josiah Trenham last week, and could not wait to share it with all of you today, especially when we consider the Gospel account that was just read for us.  A young man approaches Jesus and asks Him, “*Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life.”*  Our Lord responds by telling this man to keep the commandments, to which he responds: *“I have done all these things from my youth.  What do I still lack?*

Jesus said to him, *“If you want to be perfect, go and sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come follow me.”*  Our Lord reminds us in the Gospel today how much are treasures and possessions keep us from the perfection that is found in the building up of virtues.  So, he tells the Rich young man, and all of us living in the wealthiest country in the world, *“sell all that you have, give to the poor, and come follow me.”*

It is said that when St. Anthony the Great heard this incredible text, his heart was pierced to such an extent that he immediately walked out of the Church, sold everything he had, settled his affairs, and went immediately into the desert to follow after Christ.  As an incredible of an example as that is, I wonder how many God-fearing Christians that have heard this Gospel Lesson read to them year after year, have followed suit? Who among us today is read to go home today, list our homes to sell them, clear out our bank accounts, and enter into a monastery?  If we are honest with ourselves, we often leave these Gospel lessons in the same manner as the rich young ruler…a little bit dejected because this is too bitter of a pill for us to swallow.

How many other bitter medicines does our Lord offer us throughout the Gospels?

Jesus says *love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you.*  Why would I want to begin to love someone who has caused me pain?

Our Lord and the Apostles constantly talked about prayer, calling us even to *“pray without ceasing”*.  How am I supposed to do that with all of the other things I have going on in my life?  Father wants me to come to Liturgy on a Wednesday evening and Thursday morning this week for a feast day?  Is he crazy?  Does he know what I have going on?

Our Lord, and through Him His Church tells us to fast from meat and dairy at certain times during the year.  Jesus obviously never lived next to my neighbor who likes to slow cook ribs outside on Good Friday!

How do we learn to love the Christian Life dear ones, especially the things that our Lord teaches us that we simply do not want to hear?

Just as we started with small cups of coffee every single day, so it is a good practice to start small in the Christian life.  Have we never had a regular prayer rule?  Offer up **one prayer** in the morning and in the evening.  Have we never read scripture?  Read **one chapter** of the Gospels every single day.  Do we not offer up 10% of our income for the Church and the poor?  Tithe a percent of everything received to the Church, and another percent to a favorite charity…increasing by 1% every single year.  Start small and stick with it.

Just as we learned all there was to know about coffee through study, so too should we study our Holy Orthodox Faith!  When we want to learn to embrace something of great value, our desire should be to study and learn as much as we can about it!  Most parishes offer educational courses and studies, and with the increased popularity of “Zoom”, there are changes to learn from classes all around the country!  Find one and dedicate yourself to it!

Finally, we surround ourselves with people who love the Church just as much as we do.  When we go to Church and leave immediately after the Dismissal, we do ourselves a tremendous disservice by not talking to one another afterwards.  Always plan on staying after to have coffee and a small breakfast with one another! Learn about who others in the community are and what they are about.  How did they find their way to the Church?  How are they managing in their journey towards Christ?  We have an incredible opportunity to do that in the parish community we are in, where there are no cliques or agendas…just people who are all trying to draw near towards Christ.  This is an incredible gift…let us not waste it dear ones!

We just began the new Liturgical Year on September 1st.  Like the example of the coffee inheritance, what will we do with this New Year that God has granted each one of us…these precious days that have been given to us for Metanoia (Repentance)?  May God Grant us all the Wisdom to begin this year by increasing our Love for Him through the teachings that He preached to a world, that was destined for an inheritance that goes beyond imagination.",1,1729776993.0,SophiaWisdomOfGod,0,1.0,False

I pulled up to the speaker and started to order my drink, donut and the pack of hockey cards that I seem to be addicted to buying. 

“Could I have an XL tea with two milk,” I started my order, already wondering what card I’ll pull.

“Drive up.”

Now I knew, logically, the person on the other end was being impatient, and had assumed I only wanted a drink. But I’m tired of the phrase “sorry, I’m not done with my order yet,” so I drove up. 

The cashier told me my total and handed me the debit machine and was surprised when I said that I also wanted cards and a donut. I think the kicker was when I said “I assumed he couldn’t hear me so told me to drive up and finish my order.” 

It was a minor inconvenience for them, and didn’t add more than half a minute to the wait behind me. I’m sure they won’t learn anything from this, either. ",128,1729776910.0,MaliciousCompliance,12,0.94,False

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

I've been to about 100 AA meetings since then. I've tried to work the steps with a couple of different sponsors. It hasn't gone well. I have been told that my problem is that I thought too much about the steps and what the words mean. This seemed odd to me. I've come to the conclusion that AA isn't the right forum for critically thinking about the steps. Below are some of my concerns about each of the steps. I'd appreciate your thoughts on my thoughts.

  
\-The 12 steps and some of my concerns-

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become

unmanageable.



I don’t think so. I am powerful over inanimate objects. Alcohol is an inanimate object. It is also a powerful drug. I used alcohol . At times I used it to excess. But I drank the alcohol...it didn’t jump out of the bottle and into my mouth. I drank it with full knowledge of what alcohol does to humans. And I got predictably drunk on each occasion that I drank. In short, I used the alcohol and I got the expected effects of the alcohol. The things I did in a drunken or hungover state were basically the things that people do in those states. Nothing really out of the ordinary. With that said, my life may have been and may be unmanageable. That is a difficult thing to determine. Did bad things happen while I drank alcohol? Yes. Was my health negatively impacted by alcohol? Yes. Did ceasing to drink alcohol make my life more manageable? Probably yes. But I don’t see it as a situation where somehow alcohol itself exerted power over me and rendered my life unmanageable. It just didn’t go down like that. I’d say that depression, a terrible marriage, laziness, vitamin deficiency, the after effects of trauma, and a handful of other things were working on my life situation too. Alcohol was just one of about 10 things that were in the mix while life was unmanageable. It’s not like you could take the alcohol out and everything would have been magically better. I did and it isn’t. With all that said, I have determined that alcohol isn’t good and I don’t want to use it.



2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to

sanity.



Wait. What? I never said I was not sane. So why am I asking to be restored to sanity? Why not ask a higher power to restore manageability if that’s what I supposedly lost? Why is Power capitalized here? That seems like a big jump. Assuming for the sake of argument that I drank alcohol and therefore my life became unmanageable as implied in Step 1, why can’t I just not drink? What if I worked toward that goal? Why do I need some outside power to fix me? If there is such a higher power then why did he let me get hurt in the first place? This step seems to be inconsistent with Step 1. Also: I came here just to get some support with my decision to not drink alcohol. I didn’t come here asking to be made sane. Am I in the wrong place? “Came to believe” is a weird phrase here. Especially when what follows is a couple or a few different things, all of which deserve some serious treatment. Among those things 1. insanity 2. the existence of some higher power 3. the existence of a higher power that was previously non operational 4. the existence of a higher power that takes requests in responds to them. These are big things. If these steps were a court filing or a geometric proof then these things would need to be separate line items. In journalism this kind of inserting big things in the middle without elaboration is called burying the lead.



3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we

understood Him.



Holy shit! That’s a lot. This assumes that there is a higher power...that I or we understand him...that he wants the job of helping me on a daily basis…and more. It says “we” here. Do we all have the same God? Is the “we” here each one of us individually or is it the collective we? Back to this God concept. It presupposes an intervening power type God, one who makes day to day things happen and those things haven't been decided by that God yet. That is a very particular kind of God. If our God is constantly in action, how did that God let me harm myself with alcohol in the first place? Where was he then? This is problematic. But I digress. Now I am going to “turn (my) will” over to this God? Sketchy. If I say I’m turning over my will and then he doesn’t actually grab the reigns then how will I know that? Is this like a Tesla autopilot situation where it works pretty good on the highway but you need to keep your hands on the wheel at all times or else you might kill someone? What if I turn my will over to him and then I do some seriously messed up stuff? Is that him driving? Is that defense recognized in court? By my girlfriend? If I turn my will over to this God will I be able to do some wild parkour type stunts? Watch me do a handstand on this railing! What if I understood or we understood God incorrectly? The step says we turn our will and lives over to him as we understand him. Seems like we should try real hard to understand him well if we have so much riding on these tires. Is there a user manual? I’m gonna wade into this one slowly. I’m going to take a few small risks to test this new autopilot feature before I really trust that it works well. I’ll start by letting my higher power’s will flow through me at the convenience store when I buy a lottery ticket tomorrow.



4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.



This sounds like a great thing to do. I support this. But it’s a hard thing to do. Most people are going to suck at this.



5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature

of our wrongs.



Wouldn’t an all powerful God who grants requests and moves things around on a daily basis already know about all of my weaknesses and have a detailed list of all the bad stuff I ever did? This seems silly. “Admitted to ourselves…” This is tricky. What do we really know about ourselves? Even if the wisest person in the world tried to make a fearless moral inventory I expect that it wouldn’t be thorough. We tend to remember things in subjective, already-interpreted ways. We are often the heroes of our own stories –even when we were the villains. The temple to Apollo at Delphi had the inscription “Know thyself” precisely because it’s a hard thing to do. It’s a complicated, never ending task. A couple of thousand years later Freud told the world that we have a subconscious mind, the id. He said we don’t really know what it makes us do. So I can try make a list of my moral shortcomings but it’s probably gonna be pretty bad. Number one: tries too hard to do an excellent job at all times. Number two: overly polite and courteous. Number three: forgetful sometimes. I maybe have four or five more. Admit our shortcomings to another human? Are we protected by attorney client privilege or a duty of confidentiality that has some legal force to it? Look, sometimes groups try to gather dirt on new initiates to use as collateral...that’s a nice way of saying that they use it for coercive purposes. Asking for my secrets sounds a bit shady. Like something a high control type group might do.



6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.



I just want to stop drinking. OK, I also want to lose a few pounds and get healthier. I cannot run a six minute mile. Please remove these defects of my character. Does it work this way? For the record I never said that I thought my character was defective. Sure, I could probably be a better person. But I don’t want to call myself defective. Please don’t think of me as defective. I am not. I am just a person and I try to be a good person. Sure, if I am drinking too much then I can be a bit self centered. That’s why I have decided that I don’t want to abuse alcohol. Maybe just remove the desire to drink. Not sure that’s a defect of character. It’s just a thing that can causes more trouble than it’s worth. The bad outweighs the good.



7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.



I thought this club was about not drinking. I’m not sure I want all of my shortcomings removed. If I had no shortcomings then wouldn’t I be perfect? That sounds kind of miserable. I think it would be tough to be around me if all of my shortcomings were removed. Imagine if I did this step and I believed it actually worked. That would have me walking around believing that all of my shortcomings had been removed. That would be a bad kind of headspace for me I think. So if I’m going to ask this God –who sounds a bit like [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) delivering me everything on my shopping list-- to remove my shortcomings then I’d like to specifically exclude a few of the small ones that I think make me more lovable from that strike list. Like my corny sense of humor. I want to keep that. My admitted over-use of my horn while driving. It’s a shortcoming but I like it. I also want to occasionally forget things that I should remember. That makes life interesting. I also want to disappoint people sometimes in small ways so that they are genuinely excited when I do something really good. This step wants me to ask “humbly” for something really big that I don’t entirely want. Could I be less humble when I ask God to remove just a few of shortcomings?



8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make

amends to them all.



Damn! That is a lot of people. Some of those people might have had it coming. There are probably some people I hurt that I don’t even know I hurt. This step seems like a big job. Right out of the gate let me say that I’m not gonna call my high school girlfriend who I haven’t spoken to in like 30 years. It didn’t end well. I was a dick. She knows that. She doesn’t want to hear from me now I am quite sure. I’m gonna let some sleeping dogs lie on this one. It’s for the best. Trust me. Not even gonna put her on the list. That’ll save time. Or how about this: can God, while he is listening to my lists of character flaws and removing all my defects please just put a little peace in the hearts of anyone whom I may have harmed? I would sign off on that 100%. Also: if I don’t do this step as described then please just know that starting in Step 3 I turned my will over to God and so it is Him –not me-- that is botching this step. If I don’t do this step or if I don’t do it well please blame God for my weakness, laziness, cowardice, and lack of dedication to this process. I specifically requested that he remove these weak traits in Step 6. If they are still there then I suppose he didn’t do it or just hasn’t done it yet. And that’s OK. Just don’t blame me if he didn’t deliver on time.



9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so

would injure them or others.



I like the saving clause in this step. If I owed you an apology and you didn’t get one it’s because it’s probably best that we let bygones be bygones. The last thing I want to do is injure anyone, especially you or me. If this sounds really lame then please know that this is exactly what God wants for us (see what I already did in Step 3 and Step 6 above). If you feel like I owe you money then please write me a short note. Show your math.

10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly

admitted it.



This sounds solid to me. I like it. I think we should all try to admit when we mess up and try to fix things as best we can. We should also be kind to others when they mess up. Plus we should accept apologies gracefully.



11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with

God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and

the power to carry that out.



What if God is already really busy? What if he just knows that you want these things and you don’t want to bother him too frequently? Wouldn’t God get tired of hearing the same request from me over and over again? I tried meditating but it didn’t work right. It makes me have to pee.



12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry

this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs



Most of my heavy drinking pals are not gonna respond well to this list of Steps. I don’t drink anymore and still a good handful of them seem pretty strange to me. It’s gonna be a tough job. A spiritual awakening sounds really big. When did I have one? Right after Step 11? Could I just ask God for one back at the beginning? Why not? It says “having had a spiritual awakening….” Does that mean I don’t have to proselytize to drunks about the 12 steps until I have had such an awakening? Does that mean that if I don’t have a spiritual awakening then I don’t have to do this missionary work? Having had sounds makes it sound like a condition precedent. What is the current pay rate for carriers of this message? Will there be an expense account for coffee and donuts? Also, what precisely is the message? Is the message all of the steps? Because if all of the steps is the message then that’s a tough sell because of what I said above. Anybody who hears these steps is bound to have some questions and concerns like mine. I am apparently still waiting on God to deliver the clarity that I am hoping for. As for “practice these principles,” I am confused. I think I may have missed the list of principles. I saw the bit about apologizing promptly. I can try to be mindful of my character flaws I suppose. In that sense I can see where a couple of the steps might be principles that could apply to how I deal with my nextdoor neighbor. But I don’t see how they would apply to me eating a cheeseburger. I really just want to stay the course on not drinking and maybe meet a few sober pals. I’m a bit worried that if I had a spiritual awakening then I would lose something cool about me. I met some guys at AA who claimed to have had a spiritual awakening and they kinda seemed like sanctimonious dicks.",0,1729776685.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,0.5,False
1gb2ny4,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1gb2ny4/i_can_drink_coffee_again/,i can drink coffee again 🥲,"just wanted to share a success story now that i am a little over 6 weeks in. i just went to pour my second cup of coffee and realized i haven't been able to do that since before starting zoloft because my anxiety was practically debilitating and i couldn't handle the caffeine. i am a stay at home mom with a toddler and broke my foot back in july. it was the worst thing i've ever had to go through. i couldn't get her down the stairs by myself to go outside or leave the house and it sent me into a full mental breakdown with panic attacks that landed me in the emergency room and is what led me to starting zoloft. my starting point was at the lowest of my mental health, so the first few weeks of taking it were a little rocky i won't lie. but now practically all of my side effects are gone and i feel like i can function again and be more present. we have gone to the park every day this week and i find myself doing things that previously i would've been too anxious for. just wanted to share something positive for anyone who needs it! 

edit to add: i also have ocd and part of that is what led to my panic attacks. my anxiety and ocd were just feeding off of each other and my intrusive thoughts were becoming too much. now they're practically gone and manageable so if you're struggling with that, it did help me.

1gb2lqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiniPCs/comments/1gb2lqh/minisforum_um760_slim_thoughts/,Minisforum UM760 slim thoughts,"I got the UM760 a few days ago from Amazon UK. They only had 2 units left and it is now out of stock (at the time of writing this).

My feedback is extremely positive. It is well engineered and has a small footprint. Looks slick and modern in black, with no flashy colorful designs. The case is extremely well damped. I can put my ears to the desk and not hear any vibrations transmitted. It is not just the rubber feet that do this. This must be well designed.  I could not say the same about an M7 I got from GMKtec that used to make my coffee jump in a mug on the desk.

This unit is inaudible when doing moderate-heavy tasks. Truly. I have been using it all day today and have not heard noise. Silent. It's very similar to MacBooks in that regard which I did not expect at all. I even ran Geekbench 6 benchmarks which surprisingly barely caused any audible noise. You can only hear it when bringing your ear closer to the unit. I have sensitive hearing, by the way and I get easily annoyed by sounds especially at higher frequencies. I can confirm there are no unpleasant high frequency sounds and fans are truly inaudible to me and only make a pleasant balanced low sound when stress testing the CPU. If you told me it was fanless, I would have believed you if I did not know any better.

With Geekbench 6, I got around 2500 in single core and 10300 in multicore so it is more capable than many Ryzen CPUs, especially when it comes to single core performance (which many apps and games rely on). Multicore is at least on par with a 6900hx. GPU performance is also pretty good. I got around 29000 in Vulkan Geekbench 6. Obviously, these are benchmarks but there are many videos on Youtube with impressive 60+FPS AAA 1080p gaming results with frame generation on.

Stability wise, I have been up and running for around 3 days now without a single hiccup.

Wifi speed using my 1 Gbps connection is around 250 Mbps download. This is significantly higher than any other minipc I have used. Bluetooth range is equally impressive which is echoed in some reviews on Youtube. I can go upstairs with my BT headphones on without any loss in quality.

The performance, stability, quietness and build quality of this unit is something to admire, especially at a price point of 310 GBP and 2 years of warranty. It comes with 16 GBs of DDR5 ram, along with a PCIe Gen 4 Kingston at 1 TB which by the way yielded excellent results on CrystalDiskMark.

I believe Minisforum is set to regain its solid reputation with this. I would also not underestimate the 7640hs. Its CPU single core performance is pretty much on-par with top of the line Ryzen 9 8945HS.

The brother who is just younger than me, ""Finn"" (21M) has been acting really weird towards my girlfriend, ""Georgie"" (22F) over the last two or three months. I've been with her for almost two years and he's never been a creep about it before but recently it's just been too much. 

It started off with the little things that I just kind of brushed off (stuff like touching her unnecessarily as he moved past her, things that you just kind of assume are in your head and don't take notice of). As time went on it kind of got more, saying things to her like ""you look so cute when you smile"" or ""why don't we hang out alone more often?"", having conversations with her where he just keeps asking her questions and it doesn't feel like a very natural conversation and she's clearly uncomfortable. These comments started after Finn broke up with his long-term girlfriend himself and he's been single since.

We'd talked about it before but she said that she didn't want me to talk to him about it, but a week or two ago she asked me if I would. So I asked him to get some coffee with me and I told him that he'd been making Georgie feel kind of uncomfortable, and that I didn't like how he was acting around her either, and he apologised and said that he would stop. 

Yesterday, Georgie and I as well as two of my brothers including Finn went around to my parents house (I know Wednesday is an odd one for a family night, but it's always kind of been ours just to stay in touch. not necessarily every week but you get what I mean) and after dinner sat down to watch some TV together. I went into the kitchen while everyone else sat down to make myself a cup of tea. When I got back, Finn had sat next to Georgie on the sofa, put his arm kind of around her shoulders while she clearly tried to move away from him and he gave me this big grin and said ""Careful before I steal your girlfriend"". 

I'd been in a kind of state of disbelief about the whole thing. It felt insensitive especially considering I'd already talked to him about it. Georgie asked him to stop and asked me if we could leave, and so I said we would. I told Finn that I wasn't going to see him again until he sorted out whatever kind of issue he obviously has going on, and that he's out of line and making everyone uncomfortable with it. A couple of my brothers texted me after asking what was going on, why Finn was pissed off, etc. I told them the situation and they said he was just joking around about it or whatever.

I get that he might not be doing it in all seriousness, but I don't want to put me or Georgie in a situation where we both have to feel uncomfortable until his actions change and we don't anymore. We don't usually fight as a family and I don't want to have been too harsh on Finn but I feel like his actions are out of line. AITA?",2,1729776113.0,AmItheAsshole,7,1.0,False

This green tea originates from Duyun City in Guizhou Province, an area that belongs to the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The region’s unique environment, combined with centuries of tea cultivation tradition, has made Duyun Maojian a prized beverage, sought after by tea lovers both in China and internationally.

# The Geography and Climate of Duyun

The tea-growing region around Duyun City is blessed with ideal natural conditions that significantly contribute to the exceptional quality of Duyun Maojian. Located in the misty mountains of Guizhou Province, the area is characterized by its cool temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall, creating a perfect microclimate for tea cultivation. The soil is rich in nutrients, providing the tea plants with the minerals they need to thrive.

These environmental factors, particularly the high altitude and moist climate, allow the tea leaves to grow slowly, absorbing the essence of the natural surroundings. As a result, Duyun Maojian Tea develops its distinctive high aroma and fresh taste, making it stand out among other green teas.

[The shape is relatively straight, round and smooth, the tea leaves are covered with white hairs, and the taste of the tea soup is very fresh, strong, sweet and unique. Mao Jian, the colour of the tea broth is turquoise, the tea leaves spread out and slowly sink to the bottom of the cup, the tea leaves are uniform and smooth, soft and fresh green. The colour, aroma, taste and shape of Mao Jian has a unique personality, its colour is fresh, clean and free from impurities, the aroma is elegant and fresh, and the taste is fresh, mellow and sweet.](https://preview.redd.it/zi3oifksfpwd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6755c53f2e54bd2c2f4627229980e6ef4e937cc)

# Appearance and the ""Three Greens and One Yellow""

One of the defining characteristics of Duyun Maojian Tea is its appearance, described by the phrase ""Three Greens and One Yellow."" This refers to the visual qualities of the tea leaves and liquor that tea connoisseurs use to assess its quality.

1. **Dry Tea (Yellow-Green)**: The dried tea leaves of Duyun Maojian are tight, slender, and slightly curly, covered with fine white hairs. The dry leaves exhibit a yellow-green hue, which is a hallmark of high-quality green teas and indicates the tender, young shoots that were hand-picked during harvest.
2. **Tea Liquor (Yellow-Green)**: When brewed, Duyun Maojian produces a clear yellow-green tea broth. This bright and clean color reflects the freshness of the tea leaves and the careful processing techniques used by local tea artisans. The color of the tea liquor is a key indicator of its quality, with the yellow-green tint being both aesthetically pleasing and a sign of the tea's purity.
3. **Leaf Base (Yellow-Green)**: After steeping, the leaves at the bottom of the cup reveal a similar yellow-green hue. This is yet another indication of the tea’s freshness and the care taken during its processing. The uniformity of the color, from dry leaf to brewed broth, highlights the tea's consistent quality.
4. **Green Buds**: The tips of the tea leaves, or the buds, are a vibrant green, symbolizing the tender growth of the tea shoots. These green buds are prized for their delicate flavor and contribute to the tea’s overall complexity.

# Aroma, Flavor, and the Art of Tasting Duyun Maojian

The aroma of Duyun Maojian Tea is one of its most celebrated attributes. Upon brewing, the tea releases a high, floral fragrance with a hint of fresh grass and chestnut. This aromatic profile is both refreshing and soothing, making it an ideal tea for moments of relaxation.

When it comes to taste, Duyun Maojian delivers a fresh, brisk flavor with a balanced sweetness and mild astringency. The tea is light yet full of character, with subtle notes of nuttiness that enhance its complexity. The tea leaves a pleasant, slightly sweet aftertaste, making it both refreshing and invigorating.

The texture of Duyun Maojian is smooth, with a rich body that coats the palate. Its delicate umami undertones add depth to the flavor, making it a versatile tea that can be enjoyed in both casual and formal settings.

# The Cultural Heritage of Duyun Maojian

Duyun Maojian Tea is not just a drink; it is a symbol of the region’s cultural and agricultural heritage. The tea is deeply intertwined with the traditions of the Buyi and Miao ethnic groups, who have cultivated tea in the area for centuries. Local tea farmers have perfected the art of growing and processing Duyun Maojian, using techniques that have been passed down through generations.

The tea's designation as one of China’s top ten famous teas has elevated its status not only in Guizhou but across the country. Duyun Maojian represents the essence of Guizhou’s tea culture, a reflection of the region’s unique environment and the dedication of its people to preserving their traditional way of life.

# Health Benefits and Modern Popularity

Like many green teas, Duyun Maojian is rich in antioxidants, which are known to have numerous health benefits. The tea’s high content of catechins, a type of antioxidant, helps to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve metabolism, and boost the immune system. Additionally, the moderate caffeine content of Duyun Maojian provides a gentle energy boost, enhancing focus and mental clarity without the jittery effects associated with stronger beverages like coffee.

In recent years, Duyun Maojian has gained popularity both in China and internationally, as more people discover its health benefits and delicate flavor. It has become a staple in the diets of those who seek to combine wellness with tradition, making it an increasingly sought-after tea for daily consumption.

**Training**

Toronto would be my third marathon overall, first international race. I had previously run Philadelphia in 4:25:00 (2021) and Wilmington in 5:25:00 (2023). With both races, I swore I wouldn’t run another marathon: I had hit the wall hard during both at around miles 17/18. I had used modified Hal Higdon’s plans.

I started training July 1st using the Runna app, but switched in August to the BPN training app as I preferred the weekly mileage (peak was 50M/week). I competed in two half marathons over the course of training and ran one 20-miler. The worst thing about my 20-miler was the steady mist of rain, which I took as a good sign.

# Pre-race

I flew to Toronto on Friday morning and went to the expo that afternoon. The expo was amazing; Philly and Wilmington were nothing in comparison. I spent probably too much on Asics gear, but I love running clothes and will always shell out to celebrate a cool experience like running a marathon. 

I ran the 5k the day before with my mom as a shakeout. We ran it in 35:47, which was around her goal and my easy pace. We then spent the day walking around Toronto and going into vintage shops in Kensington Market. I likely walked too much (had almost 30,000 steps by the end of the day), but I'm used to walking a lot living in a big city. For dinner, I had an orzo salad and lentil+peanut butter soup from Mandy's Gourmet Salads.

I surprisingly slept great the night before, falling asleep at 9:30pm and only waking up once at 4:20am. I woke up for the marathon at 6:30am and had a Nature’s Path toaster pastry, banana, and coffee. Our hotel was about a 20-minute walk from the starting line. I got there with enough time to use the bathroom and stretch before heading to my corral.

# Race

Miles 1-14: I love running half marathons and, other than an urge to use the bathroom, I felt strong over these miles. I used other runners as pacers, finding that I liked and could hold their paces well enough. I didn't mind running with the half marathoners, and the split wasn't too bad either. I knew that I was going to speed up with the half marathoners leading up to their finish, but was appreciative of a hill that helped me to slow down. I ultimately held my easy half marathon pace (\~9:45/mi) through this part.

Miles 15-20: I had to use the bathroom *badly* at this point and had inevitably slowed down because of it. Luckily, I found a port-a-potty at the next aid station and quickly used it. This part of the race was the worst as we ran along a long stretch of road that had nothing really to look at and was mostly in the sun. I was getting mentally frustrated trying to figure out when we were going to turn around. I walked for maybe 4 minutes through this stretch to lower my HR since it was almost at max. I also started walking through the aid stations, allowing me to drink cups fully and refill my handheld between stations. I also resolved that from 20 to 24 or so I would walk the first .10M of each mile.

Miles 21-24: I ended up not needing to walk again. I think strength training really helped me here because my legs felt strong and I didn't feel tired (other than, you know, the usual exhaustion of running 26M). I latched on to another runner for a bit as I liked her pace, but ended up pulling ahead of her at some point. I mentally prepared myself for the run back on the long stretch of road and felt it wasn't as bad going back towards the city. This section of the race reminded me a lot of the section in the Philly Marathon where you run down Kelly Drive through Manayunk and turn around to head back down Kelly Drive. I ended up passing some people I had seen were further ahead of me earlier in the race and catching up to some people I had been running with before I stopped to use the restroom. I think somewhere along here I checked the TCS app for my pacing and saw that I was going to PR by 8 minutes, which brought up my spirits a lot.

Miles 24-26.2: I definitely kicked it too early, thinking the finish line was closer than it was. I saw my parents and waved and just tried to get to the end. I was hitting close to my max HR and pulled back a little to prevent myself from fainting. I crossed the finish line and felt great. I checked my phone and saw that I had run 4:25:45 and was confused since the app had told me I was going to come in well before 4:25.

# Post-race

I met up with my parents and we went over to St. Lawrence Market for food (I'm sorry Canada, but Montreal-style bagels don't hold a flame to NYC/Philly bagels). I was tired walking around so we just went back to the hotel and rested. I flew home the next morning and although sore and tired, I didn't feel too bad. I'm running Philadelphia in a month, so will take the next week off before a maintenance phase. I plan on running that race at my Zone 2 pace and taking the city in as I really didn't enjoy the race my first time.

Overall, I think this went well for me! I was 45 seconds from a PR and, while bummed, I was happy that I actually enjoyed the race, especially with it being on my birthday. I hadn't even intended to go for a PR until the previous weekend, having planned to take the race at my Zone 2 pace. I loved being able to see the different areas of Toronto and honestly, I'd run this race over Chicago or NYC.

**Things I Did Differently This Cycle That I Think Helped Me**

1. Strength Training: I went to solidcore (okay, not true *strength* training) twice a week. I do lower body at the 50+ class spring load. As I said above, I think solidcore helped my legs be strong throughout the race.

2. Nutrition and Hydration: For Philadelphia and Wilmington, I was in quasi-recovery from an eating disorder. I was definitely not eating nearly enough and didn't really carb load (my pre-LR meals for Wilmington were sweetgreen salads, for instance). I also didn't adequately fuel during my LRs or the races themselves. For Wilmington, I used Trailwind as I was having trouble with acid reflux with gels, but I don't think it was enough for the distance. This time around, I started carb loading a week before and practiced fueling during LRs. My fueling plan was to take a Clif Blok every two miles starting at mile 3; a BPN gel every five miles starting at mile 5; and electrolytes pre- and intra-run on top of my handheld. I executed this perfectly on race day, although after mile 20, I started taking in Tapped Caffeinated Gel, which I think revitalized me.

3. Taking LRs easy: Training in July/August meant some hot runs, so I took most of my runs easy. My pace for the 20-miler for instance was 11:00+/mile, and I always felt good following my runs, even though they sometimes felt like a slog.",3,1729776055.0,running,1,1.0,False

I'm more of a tapioca enjoyer myself, but I think it would be hard to create a kitchen device which creates tapioca from scratch. On the other hand, the process for creating popping boba is relatively easy, and could be easily automated. 

The question is would you guys buy such a product? Imagine putting a drinking glass in position, pressing a button, and being served popping boba fruit tea from the comfort of your own home. Is that experience something you would be willing to pay money for?

To help you visualise the product I have attached some images, the first is a coffee maker - which I like the style of (just imagine boba instead of coffee); the second Is a quick AI image I generated using Copilot just for the sake of visualisation and vibe (the final product would probs not look like that lol).

Please let me know your opinions on such a product! Or questions you may have! They are much appreciated and I will try to respond to all of them! Thank you!

I don't think I drink a lot, in that I don't typically go out to bars or restaurants, and I drink 1-3 glasses of wine maybe 4-5 nights a week. I've always told myself that it's because I love beverages (give me a new coffee, smoothie, seltzer, whatever any day of the week) but I know now that it's a coping mechanism/a way to relax after work.

  
I've tried a lot of ways to manage this--making my work less stressful, not buying wine at the liquor store and instead waiting until grocery shopping, remembering that alcohol is damaging to my health on a multitude of levels, placing the bottle alllll the way in the kitchen rather than bringing it out to the living room, thinking how nice it would be to save $60 a month--but it's also just a habit. I come home, I uncork a bottle, I start 'unwinding'. I don't want this to be a habit anymore, but I know I do it because it's easy--easier than, say, filling a tea steeper and waiting for water to boil. 

  
At this point, I feel like I have the knowledge to start this journey but I haven't internalized it to....*actually* make a change. I know the first step is always the hardest, but do you have any tips? ",6,1729775516.0,SoberCurious,7,1.0,False

2. For airport to my Hotel, I was thinking of just taking the normal train since it is only a few minutes slower but it's way cheaper?
3. Do I need reservations for those popular restaurants like Odarijip for example?
4. For those that went to N-Seoul Tower, how was your journey to and fro? Is shuttle bus the right way up? How is the walk down?

 But, even better, if you are not prepared for a hurricane, even as a lifelong Floridian, you can ask for people to help you buy your condiments to refill your refrigerator.  When in reality, you will use that hundred dollar donation to buy Starbucks and McDonald’s of course they think they’re treating themselves but really they are just making themselves look like fools.

The grifters can only rely on the kindness and lack of awareness of their viewers. Their unaware viewers don’t see through the facade of a “struggling family”. Mr. and Mrs. grifter could easily get a W-2 job and support their family. They could even Thrift on the weekends if that was their desire. But no, they want to rely on the kindness of their viewers to send them cash for coffee, McDonald’s, and to refill the condiments and the refrigerator post hurricane Milton.

If they WERE  a successful reselling couple, they would not be crying the blues to their viewers on the live sales. 

They would not be saying that Thrifting is hard in Florida. They would not be saying that we can’t find items at a decent price to resell. They would not have trashed their primary channel and alienated viewers over politics. They are scrambling to find their footing in the reselling community, slinging themselves with fellow Trump supporters. 

It won’t work. Will either channel survive? No. The self proclaimed Black sheep of the reselling community have completely alienated themselves from 99% of the decent resellers on YouTube. The decent resellers, Thrifter  junker Vintage Hunter, Cult of Vintage, just to name a few figured out the grifters and now chose to not associate with them. This is very smart on 
their  part. 

Now the grifters are trying to align themselves with SugarBritches and start doing live sakes with them. LoriAnn of SugarBritches has quality items with great prices. I think her channel is SugarBritches Sweet AssFinds and she has sales Thursday evenings. 

I hope she gets the real word on the chapter two grifters. It would be better for her to NOT associate either the confused house on noble chapter two vintage Grifters.

As for mine, I use shop pay so I log in with my email. When I get to the password, I get a  little Shop pop up and get in that way. 

Most purchases post-account should be there and you should now be able to access them without codes.

Exceptions: purchases made pre-account, mystery W’s (donuts, accessories, upsell mystery offers), advent, and Chuck the Duck apparently. There’s also been issues with Little Twin Stars not showing up in accounts for some reason too.  

I tried to add Chuck same way I did for other kits I purchased outside the website and I got this response “Right now, we can only add kits sold directly from our website.” I suppose that’s a fight for another day. 

For some reason, my manually added W’s are permanently on the top of my account and I have to scroll down a bit to where those end to find where my recently purchased starts.

I would assume if you’ve used different emails to purchase in the past, you may have  to make more than one account to view all your kits. 

If you want to try to get kits added to your account the email is help@thewoobles.com
They’ll at least need the email you used to purchase the kit. Depending on who is on the other end of customer service they might ask for an order number or a shipping address or a photo as proof of purchase.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I updated my K1 this morning, no issues.

My K1 was rooted.  What I did was:

\- Ran the Creality K1 Reset Utility to reset settings to default.  (Google it if you don't know what that is).  This of course toasts your root.

\- Allowed the printer to go through the setup phase.  Had a coffee.

\- Check for and upgrade to the new firmware via the printers LCD screen.

\- Again, allowed it to go through the setup phase. Had another coffee.

\- Choose the root option in the menus.

\- Run the Install Helper Script via SSH.  This makes installing the software very easy.  (Link: [Install Helper Script - Wiki for Creality Helper Script](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/helper-script/helper-script-installation/)).

\- Install my choice of software, which for me is Mainsail, KAMP, Input Shaping, and Timelapse and allows me to use Orca seamlessly.

I don't bother backing up my config files.  It is easy enough to re-root and setup again. Most of the process was drinking coffee, and not hands on. In total, took about 45 minutes.

I believe the key to a successful firmware upgrade is not trying to upgrade while not at default / rooted state.  The printer even warned me about this before doing the upgrade.",1,1729774425.0,crealityk1,1,1.0,False

We are all so different and our fitness journeys will be different. I personally hate counting calories and I hate cardio. I was able to lose 65 pounds over a year and a half by doing exercises I love and eating foods that are healthy but taste delicious and are low calorie but filling, strength training and walking for cardio.

1. You don't have to count calories depending on your goals and starting point. I was eating pizza, pasta, soda, juice and sugary coffee with no vegetables and drinking alcohol every day. Switching to healthier versions of things made it so I was automatically eating less calories (calorie deficit). Choosing things like reduced fat sharp cheddar over regular or switching from a sugary coffee to one can of Celsius in the morning can make such a huge change. 

2. Start small with exercises and remember that as a beginner it might be hard to keep up with the exercises in a video you watch. If the person doing the video is using ten pounds, it's okay for you to use no weight, or resistance bands or two pounds. Don't push yourself so hard that you end up hating it. I remember when my core was so weak that I couldn't even feel it to brace it, but stick with it because things will change. If exercises feel difficult, imagine how much easier it will be if you just stick with it and do the same exercise weighing 10 or 20 lbs less. 

I'll probably stop here because it's already so long but I just want to help people become the healthiest versions of themselves. You can do anything you set your mind to and just because it hasn't worked in the past doesn't mean you can't make a change now 💕",1,1729774420.0,beginnerfitness,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/vrxbcuyo7pwd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=567921a0402d95234091c1bbf732fb9910440f6e

In all seriousness, however, we've got work to do even on the most boringest of days and, oh, is it boringy! But this is where opportunity lies and consistency is key. Let's take a look at what we can see in today's options data!

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/23 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ixawfrnf0pwd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=962ef415ab7e7d111964629c1808bded6acf81e4)

As proposed, traders took the path of least resistance yesterday, walked our price up almost to our large gamma positive position at $21 right off the open and then traded the price down to almost a biweekly low ($20.34) on a total volume not seen since 5/1 (under 3mil) before closing up just under VWAP. Total options premiums barely cracked $5mil on the day and were skewed heavily bearish. No real funny business to point out here. This one looks by the book given the structure that presented itself yesterday.  

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[10\/25 OI Changes 10\/23-10\/24](https://preview.redd.it/aeoblsxa6pwd1.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd34a2ee2f09cac18f202915b35980e718c252f)

We are still seeing some new OI pop up on our nearest term expiry, but obviously volume is slipping as our price action flattens. Yesterday saw barely any new Put OI and only notable new Call OI at $20.50 and $21. Our Max Pain for this week just based on these factors has slid down to $20.50. All other expiries out into November OPEX increased at a trickle (< 850 contracts per strike). Yesterday was QUIET.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/wd5ehyem1pwd1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=229813418d7498e8d42e41f290090ad4063f9acb

Unsurprisingly, our Gamma Exposure structure does not look too different from yesterday's trading. The net negative gamma position wedged between $20 and $21 still promotes scrubbing up and down that range. If we open close to or head below $20.50 our path of least resistance is to head up toward $21 and test resistance at that level. If we open closer to $21 and test it early, then path of least resistance is to head back toward $20.50 and retrace our steps yesterday.

This is all contingent, as I've mentioned, on our consistently hyper low-volume environment, which isn't enough to overcome these large Call Gamma positions and their accompanying antipathetic MM hedging. 

A gamma ramp structure is still in place and looking very similar to the one we saw emerge back on 9/20. We had a full week of selling, some interventive shorting to push us sub $20 and keep us pinned between $19.50 and $20 all the way into Friday's open before the price rocketed up to $22 on the back of 61mil shares traded.

Obviously, contextual circumstances then are not what they are now. The gamma exposure environment, our concentration of call gamma stacked on three strikes above our current price position, and our low-IV, downward trend heading into Friday do resemble that 9/20 set-up however. Maybe lightning strikes twice, maybe the #riseandgrind keeps on keepin' on into a Max Pain-y finish. We'll have to see what today looks like.

**Technicals**

[8\/1-10\/24 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/0hn1a7mx4pwd1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=f789024e14fc79fb2541e78e63b7a609dd70bb82)

If you've been reading these sections with us so far, you'll know there are two main scenario archetypes which take shape heading into next week and November:

1) The AIMA CATalyst Scenario: Keith or something Keith know's about will happen on National Cat Day (10/29) or related to it that causes our price movement to deviate from our current trading paradigm and ramp up IV a bit.

2) The Undisturbed Ecosystem Scenario: We continue to stay flat, our moving averages continue to tighten, our trading range compresses, IV continues to slip lower, and we don't get paradigm deviation until around Thanksgiving when the build up to the Q3 earnings report begins. 

There's no real way of predicting whether one of these is more likely than the other. The former requires interventive change via informational externality, the second requires no such intervention to appear for about five weeks.

**IV Trends**

[10 Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/sz8stgp99pwd1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=51b798984a003252b649fc042538440858ca322f)

Interestingly, we did get a bit of an implied volatility uptick on the day yesterday despite the fact that volume trended down and our price went nowhere. This looks to have been the result of our opening move to $20.98, which quickly brought the instantaneous IV value up over 77% in the first few minutes of the day before it collapsed back to about 74% at the close. GME still, thus, displays sensitivity to IV fluctuations on upward price action. We'll still need a significant volume uptick or special information period (like earnings) to anticipate any major appreciations to our current levels.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Low volume suggests more scrubbing between $20.50 and $21 and a Max Pain finish between $20.50 and $21. It is possible, however, that with a volume uptick we see some upward volatility off a gamma ramp up to $22 reminiscent of 9/20. On the longer time frame, we still wait to see whether National Cat Day will bring with it some excitement or whether we wait until the GME Q3 earnings report to deviate from our paradigm. Nothing here is deterministic. We'll just have to wait and see.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",110,1729774105.0,Superstonk,11,0.94,False

Went through “hookah pens” as we called them back in the day, small pod systems, giant box mods, Juul, disposables.. Pretty much any vape that’s out there, I’ve used. 🤣

I recently got offered a new job in a health system network, although it’s WFH the company as a whole is completely tobacco free and requires a nicotine test along with your normal drug test. 
My current job is draining me mentally and physically, and this is finally the perfect opportunity for me to move forward in my career. 

Thankfully the hiring process is lengthy, so I have time before my nicotine test. I took my last drag this morning at 5:00 am (accidentally did it upon waking up before realizing and tossing it in the trash because clearly I have no willpower LOL)

Gonna pretty much use this to keep myself accountable, as well as keep an update of how my withdrawal journey is going for anyone who may need it in the future. :) 

** First 3 hours - I can definitely feel myself going through the muscle memory “motions” of looking for my vape. I don’t necessarily think I have any withdrawal symptoms yet, but the habit part of it all is already tough. When I’m driving, I normally go right for my vape in my lap. If I’m watching TV I absentmindedly take a drag. Essentially every time I’m bored, I’m used to reaching for my vape. Aside from pushing through that, all seems to be good so far.

1gb1q2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gb1q2j/i_think_my_wife_is_being_bullied_by_her_friends/,I think my wife is being bullied by her friends.,"Advice needed desperately!
This is a VERY long post, but a lot has gone on in my wife’s friendship group. I love my wife and am at a loss over what advice to give as she is metaphorically tearing her hair out over this whole situation.
My wife (32 f) is one of those people who adores their friends and considers them an important part of her life. So as this situation has unravelled, she has taken it very personally and it has upset her beyond anything I’ve seen in the decade I’ve known her, moreso even than a recent serious health-scare that she has had.
I will start by saying that my wife’s longtime friend (who we will call A) is, in my opinion, a selfish narcissist who is only interested in relationships that benefit her. Aside from this opinion, I will present only the facts of the situation from this point of the post.
Things between my wife and A soured during A’s most recent relationship, which ended with A’s partner defrauding her of thousands of dollars. Both my wife and I disliked A’s partner as we could see she was a manipulative no-gooder, but it was A’s partner so we put up with it for her sake. A’s partner manipulated A into limiting contact with my wife. Eventually, she ended up cheating on her and stealing thousands of dollars before ending the relationship. A moved home with her parents and my wife stuck by her friend to help her through this awful time.
Fast forward to a few months ago and A goes on a weight-loss journey and gains a lot more self confidence. She starts going out more and seems to revert back to being a teenager in terms of her dating life.
A becomes a lot closer to my wife’s other friend (who we will call B.) B is going through her own life events, and while never being particularly close to A, the two bond over their shared issues.
Then my wife’s health takes a serious turn for the worse. The family and I rally around her, but A texts my wife and literally says, “I’m a bad friend and can’t support you the way you need.”
A had a similar response when my wife’s mother was going through a health scare a year back. My wife responds, “I don’t need support, I just need normality from my friends.”
A replied bluntly, “Our friendship has changed. I will be civil with you in public, but just don’t expect us to spend time together one-on-one.” Obviously my wife was devastated. After all the help that she gave A over the years, A can’t even have the decency to react in a compassionate way to my wife’s bad news. There seemed to be no obvious reason for this sudden change in attitude.
A begins distancing herself from my wife, excluding her from catch-ups and social events, choosing to spend the time with B instead. At this point B is still kind and supportive to my wife and they have a fairly good relationship.

 Then my wife goes to a three day music event with A, B and a few other friends. She sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with her friends, but struggles during the event with her health. Both A and B end up ditching her on day two and my wife decides not to go back for day three when A and B both deviate from the planned meeting arrangements.
After this event, A further distances herself from my wife and she starts to become concerned that she is also losing her close friendship with B.
My wife and I have many conversations about the state of her friendship with both A and B, and she confides in me that the situation is now causing her more emotional distress than her long term illness. I start to consider that this is some form of bullying by exclusion, and that my wife should begin to reconcile with the fact that A is not the friend that she once considered her to be.
Then, myself, my wife, A and B attend a birthday event for a mutual friend. Things are frosty at the start. On the car ride there, with my cousin and I in the front, and my wife and B in the back, B says earnestly that there is no issue or drama between them either, and that she has been going through a serious issue at home which means she has been quiet recently. B asks my wife not to mention it to anyone, although my cousin and I were in the car to hear everything, and B had told everyone about the issue at our mutual friend’s party. My wife and A eventually have a frank conversation at this party where A backtracks on her words and actions, declaring that her and my wife are “absolutely fine and that there are no issues.” My wife is elated and thinks that things are back on track.
My wife’s relief lasts for about a day until she tries to arrange a coffee-catch up with A. A replies bluntly “I’ve already told you our friendship has changed and I’m not comfortable making plans with you privately.” My wife is again upset at the two-faced nature of this behaviour; that A will say one thing in public, but another thing in private. My wife has a bad few days with her health after this and I suggest she goes to the movies with her childhood best friend (C) to take her mind off things. She takes my advice, going to the cinema with C (who is an absolute diamond of a person.)
She comes back home with some news.
“You’ll never guess who Me and C saw at the movies!”
“Who?”
“It was A, on a date! I don’t think she saw me, but I recognised the man she was with.” “What? Who was she with?”
“X from her work.”
“Isn’t X in a relationship?”
“Abso-fucking-lutely.”
After some investigating with mutual friends, it turns out that A has been seeing someone from work who is already in a long-term relationship with another co-worker of theirs.
My wife texts A to find out what the hell is going on and A replies, “If anyone asks, you didn’t see me and I wasn’t there.”

 A continues to distance herself from my wife, and after another period of time it becomes obvious that A doesn’t really want a close friendship with her anymore. Unconsolable, my wife speaks to another mutual friend of ours for advice, and ends up telling the whole story I have just told you, including the cheating scandal and the information that B had let us know about at the birthday party a few weeks prior.
Somehow this gets back to B from our mutual friend, at an event that my wife had to leave early for health reasons. A has (in my opinion) gotten in the ear of B, and now B has a larger issue than necessary with my wife. B texts my wife and says “You told our mutual friend about my issue when I asked you not to. That’s not what friends do.” This is despite the fact that B told myself and about 6 other people about this issue of hers AFTER asking my wife not to tell anyone.
I explained to my wife that even though A has been acting like a bully, B might have a legitimate reason to be upset. She copped the blame for imparting this information, and apologised profusely, hoping to mend any broken trust. This was 4 weeks ago, and now both A and B are ghosting my wife.
This brings us up to date.
My wife is distraught that two long-time friends are essentially ignoring her and dividing the rest of the friendship group. My wife is willing to invite A and B to events to be civil, but both of them are still excluding my wife and ignoring her. I think she is coming around to the fact that the friendship with A will never be repaired, but she is more cut-up that B is falling into the same pattern as A.
Even after all of this, the thing my wife is most upset about is that both A and B were bridesmaids at our wedding and she thought that they would be lifelong friends who would always have her back.

There are things I wouldn't change and a lot of things I would. Hopefully some of my thoughts could help some of you who are earlier in your journey.   


• Maternity leave is NOT HOUSWIFE LEAVE. Do not feel that you need to do 100% of the housework. This is a dynamic we fucked up very early on. My husband is in the habit of doing barely anything and I don't know how we'll cope when I'm working full time again. I regret every minute my baby had to cry while I was doing housework.   
  


• It's ok to change your mind. It's ok to do whatever it takes to get everyone through the day or night. Co sleep, don't cosleep, breastfeeding, bottles, baby led weaning, pre-made pouches, screen time, dummys, it really doesn't matter. We've gone backwards and forwards on every issue you can imagine and ultimately all that matters is that you and baby are safe, sane, and hopefully happy.  
  


• Make time for yourself. It feels indulgent to pick up a hobby on maternity leave but it's a valuable opportunity you might not get again. I started one hobby when my baby would only contact nap to make use of the time I was nap trapped, and now she naps in a cot I have started others. It feels like an investment in skills I hope to share with her one day, as well as making me feel more like myself.  

  

• Be kind to your body. I tried too hard to lose weight at the beginning of my mat leave and I was too exhausted and it didnt work. It also affected my milk supply and baby's growth. Now we have more routine and spare time I have lost all the baby weight with much less stress. In the middle I ate a tonne of cake at coffee mornings and I don't regret a single slice of those.   
  


• Arrange childcare as early as possible. I should have chosen a nursery when I was pregnant and in a productive nesting phase. We left it too late and had little to no choice in where we sent her. If you can afford it, start them at childcare before maternity leave ends so you can both adjust - sometimes I collect my baby after just a few hours because I miss her and I wouldn't be able to do that if I was back at work already. We've also been able to work through the usual illnesses they pick up without it affecting work.   
  


• Everyone struggles. There's a mum out there with the exact same issue youre experiencing and other mums struggling with the exact opposite too. This shit is so hard. You aren't alone and better days are just around the corner. You're doing a great job.

I used to be someone that was so motivated, inspired, and dedicated. In university, I was the top of my year in a hard STEM degree, and the sky was the limit with incredible prospects for my future and career.

From then, everything else went downhill and 5 years later, I don’t think I can carry on anymore. 

The heartbreak was completely unbearable, to have the rug being pulled from you like that, and then to see him plaster the relationship all over social media, and refusing to give me closure after a breakdown and a manic message. 

Since then, my career has tanked, I started and then dropped out of a PhD, I went on antidepressants that have given me brain damage and physical health conditions still, even 3 years off the drug. 

I have no friends, and no family. 

My mum, dad, and brother have neglected and abused me my whole life, and I decided to go no contact and cut them out of my life 3 years ago, but now I’m just at a complete loss. You’d think cutting out terrible people from your life would make you feel better, but it hasn’t. 

On the friends side, I don’t have any true friends. If anyone does reach out, I’m always the spare friend to vent to when they have a spare 5 Mins. No one wants to make plans with me. 

I don’t get to do anything fun. I see people have girls trips and brunches, go to gigs or coffee shops, but it’s also hard to get any hobbies, I have none.

No one shows up for me even when I beg and plead for just a coffee date or anything. 

My job is in my field, but it’s entry level on poor pay, with no prospects for promotion. 

I’m full of sadness, pain, and anger. Mostly because the people who have caused me the most amount of pain are living their best amazing lives, and I’m suffering. Especially my ex who’s now gone on to marry the one he left me for, and is living the exact life we planned together, which is causing my brain to short circuit.. 

I don’t eat, I don’t do anything. 

I know I need to build a life for myself but I cannot. I’m barely existing at this rate.

***With the potential for explosive profits in a $70 billion industry, CBDL's innovative product line and strategic market positioning stand ready to deliver unparalleled returns for shareholders, making this a true game changer in the Hemp market.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / October 24, 2024 /** The U.S. is on the verge of a historic shift. With the Biden administration, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, taking bold steps toward federal marijuana legalization, the opportunities for companies in the cannabis and CBD sectors are poised to skyrocket. For CBD Life Sciences Inc. (CBDL), this is more than just a legislative breakthrough, it is a once-in-a-generation chance to capitalize on a booming market and become a dominant force in the hemp industry.

According to industry projections, the legal cannabis market in the U.S. is expected to surpass **$70 billion by 2028**, driven by a surge in demand for both recreational and medicinal products. This creates a vast new revenue stream not only for marijuana companies but also for CBD businesses, which are uniquely positioned to tap into the wellness and therapeutic segments. CBDL, with its innovative product range and robust retail partnerships, is perfectly aligned to seize this opportunity.

**Record-Breaking Growth and Momentum**

CBDL has already shown its ability to scale rapidly, with a **1405.46% revenue increase since February 2024**, an astonishing achievement in a market that continues to expand. This growth is not by chance but a result of strategic investments in product development, market expansion, and partnerships with major retailers like Walmart. CBDL's flagship **3000MG Pain Relief Cream** has already garnered significant traction on the Walmart Marketplace, and the company's expansion into Alibaba is set to fuel further growth on the global stage.

Federal marijuana legalization would only accelerate CBDL's trajectory. With public support for legalization at an all-time high-over **68% of Americans** favoring decriminalization, according to Gallup polls-the shift in regulatory policies could unlock a new wave of consumer demand for CBD-infused products. As more states and businesses embrace CBD for wellness, pain relief, and therapeutic applications, CBDL is positioned to be at the forefront of this emerging market.

**Revenue Potential and Explosive Growth**

The potential for explosive growth is undeniable. Experts predict that CBD companies could see a **500% increase in revenue within the first year** of federal legalization. For CBDL, this could translate into hundreds of millions in new sales, as the company expands its product offerings and penetrates new markets. Already, CBD-infused beverages, topicals, and edibles are witnessing increased interest among consumers seeking natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals.

CBDL's upcoming launch of the **CBD Horse Paste** for equine care and the **Mellow Mornings CBD Coffee Creamer**, now being used in local coffee shops, are prime examples of the company's ability to innovate and tap into niche markets that are ripe for growth. With a diverse portfolio spanning human and animal wellness, CBDL's potential to become a household name is rapidly materializing.

**Investor Appeal: Why Now is the Time**

For shareholders and investors, this is a pivotal moment. The combination of impending legalization and CBDL's aggressive growth strategy creates an unparalleled investment opportunity. The company is not just focused on retail, it is also making significant strides in wholesale distribution, particularly through its planned expansion into international markets via Alibaba. With a global audience and the growing acceptance of CBD worldwide, CBDL is primed to expand its reach and revenue.

Federal legalization will result in broader access to financial services for cannabis-related businesses, including CBD companies, allowing CBDL to secure better funding, expand faster, and scale its operations more efficiently. In addition, legalization could ease restrictions on marketing and interstate commerce, giving CBDL the ability to amplify its brand and reach millions more consumers.

**The Future of Health and Wellness**

CBD is no longer a niche market. It is an integral part of the future of health and wellness, offering natural solutions for pain management, anxiety, sleep disorders, and more. CBDL's products cater to these growing consumer needs, with formulations that focus on quality, bioavailability, and maximum efficacy. As the CBD market explodes, CBDL's commitment to innovation ensures it will remain a leader in delivering innovative products that meet consumer demand.

In a time when investors are seeking high-growth sectors with strong fundamentals, the CBD industry, backed by the momentum of federal legalization, offers incredible potential. CBDL, with its impressive track record, strategic partnerships, and forward-thinking approach, is aimed at delivering substantial returns.

**Conclusion: A Groundbreaking Opportunity for Growth**

For CBDL, the push toward marijuana legalization is the catalyst needed to take the company from exponential growth to unprecedented success. With the CBD market predicted to grow by **over $25 billion** in the next few years and the potential to capture a sizable share of the legal cannabis market, CBDL is positioned to transform from an emerging player to an industry giant.

This moment represents an extraordinary opportunity for existing shareholders to see significant value appreciation and for potential investors to enter the market at the perfect time. With a sharp vision, a diverse product line, and a strong retail presence, CBDL is not just riding the wave of legalization-it is leading the charge toward the future of CBD and wellness.

Chapter 1: **Backward**

I'm software engineer with 9-to-5 job who likes creating difference things, my journey started back in 2010 with simple websites for game's extensions, it was my first experience as a project owner, it was beautiful time with a lot of mistakes but it felt like having my own car and choosing my own road. That feeling has stayed with me for many years, and that’s why we are here now.

Chapter 2: **Rise**

Let's start from the beginning, Idea to create Plugin for Figma appeared by accident, I was looking for ideas for first ""serious"" project and I thought creating a plugin might be a good idea since I’ve often used similar solutions in the past. After doing some research, I understood that generation, optimization, and deletion in the context of working with images are essential features for any developer, especially since website loading speed is crucial and some times important. So, I decided to start working on it.

Chapter 3: **Responsibility**

It’s no secret that choosing the right technologies is a crucial process and forms the foundation for product development and its long-term maintenance. Solo developers have more flexibility in this case, as they can experiment with new approaches that might not be available for enterprise projects. However, current trends show that most of developers rely on boilerplates or purchase them from well-known ""guru"".

For the plugin, I choose development speed and experience with specific technologies. **ReactJS**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, and a few other packages fully met my front-end needs. For the API, I chose **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **BullMQ** with **Redis** for queues. Later, I integrated Telegram for notifications in case of critical errors. Everything is deployed on a VPS in Docker containers, and I’m happy with how it’s working now.



|Front-end|Back-end|
|:-|:-|
|ReactJS|NestJS|
|Radix-ui|Grammy|
|Reduxjs/toolkit|Typeorm|
|React-hook-form|Traefik|
|TypeScript|PostgreSQL|
|Tailwind|BullMQ|
|React-router-dom|Redis|



Chapter 4: **Сonclusions**

The project has been around for a few months now, and during this time, I’m truly grateful for first users. This journey has brought me immense pleasure, along with a ton of new knowledge. Many cups of coffee have been consumed, and one of the most enjoyable parts has been discussing the functionality with my loving wife. As the great philosopher said, ‘It is better to try and fail than to not try at all'.

**THE END**

P.s The end for this post but not for this project, I will be super grateful for feedback and advices, cheer!

BestSelf plans to move forward with a long-planned affordable housing project near Buffalo's Central Park neighborhood early next year.

Rising construction costs and a development team shakeup have slowed the path to the groundbreaking, according to Steven Walters, chief administration and legal officer for BestSelf.

The city planning board this week approved a one-year extension for the project, its fourth.

Originally announced as a $15 million project, rising construction costs have increased the price tag to about $27 million. The development team needed to seek additional funding sources to close the gap, Walters said.

1gb15fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1gb15fe/19f_what_song_have_you_been_listening_too_on/,[19/F] what song have you been listening too on repeat this week ? ,"Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while it’s way too hot outside and I’m having some homemade ice tea and im watching this show called “ oogappels” fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream. I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . Life has been feeling kind of pointless recently and I’m hoping to find someone that makes me abit more excited to be alive everyday ( I know sounds like a big ask ) 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

-Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
-a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
-complaints about nonsensical things
-someone that you can annoy at any time of the day 
-someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
-just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )** 

Does that sound good to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyway ;))
