I've spent the last decade diving deep into B2B sales tech, testing everything from intent platforms to CRM tweaks while leading growth efforts at my company, Innovatech Dynamics—a SaaS firm specializing in supply chain solutions for European manufacturers. Over coffee chats and LinkedIn threads, I've heard from countless colleagues frustrated with the usual suspects in intent data: spotty coverage outside the US, compliance nightmares under GDPR, and signals that drown you in noise rather than gold.

That's why I was skeptical at first when a peer mentioned Artikle.io during a recent Paris sales meetup. But after integrating it into our workflow about five months ago, it's become our go-to for intent insights, especially targeting French and broader EU clients. No hype here—just sharing what we've seen work in the trenches.

🇪🇺 Pinpointing EU and French Market Signals

Traditional tools like 6sense or ZoomInfo often fizzle out when it comes to non-US territories. Artikle.io flips that script with robust, localized data pulls. For instance, we're a mid-sized outfit based in Lyon, and we've been tracking intent from regional players in the industrial sector—think SMEs in automotive parts or logistics. They leverage EU-centric sources and multilingual crawlers, delivering signals on companies we've never even prospected before. It's like having a local scout team; our coverage has jumped from patchy 30% to over 80% for French prospects, based on our internal audits.

🛡️ Navigating GDPR with Ease

Compliance shouldn't be a sales blocker, but it often is in Europe. Artikle.io stands out because their setup kept our legal team happy from day one—no red flags during the data processing agreement review. All signals are aggregated at the company level, processed entirely within EU data centers, and fully anonymized to align with CNIL guidelines. They've even got a dedicated EU legal advisor on hand, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the generic assurances from bigger US vendors.

📈 Cutting Through the Noise for Actionable Insights

Intent data is only as good as its relevance, right? We've side-by-side tested Artikle against Bombora, and while the volume is lower, the quality is leagues ahead—our SDR team reports 5x fewer false positives, meaning they spend less time sifting and more closing. Their proprietary relevance scoring feels intuitive, highlighting true buying journeys like research spikes on vendor comparisons rather than fleeting news hits.

🔄 Seamless Workflow Ties and Reliability

What seals the deal for us is how effortlessly it slots into our stack: real-time pings in Slack, auto-syncs with HubSpot for lead scoring, and even custom Zapier flows to flag high-intent accounts in Notion. Scaling from monitoring 150 to 2,500 companies? Not a hiccup. Alerts land fresh—often within 36 hours of a trigger event, like a prospect downloading a whitepaper on sustainable manufacturing.

💼 A Real-World Win from Our Books

Take last quarter: Artikle flagged intent signals from ÉcoFabrique, a Bordeaux-based textile manufacturer (real client, anonymized here for privacy). They were spiking on queries for inventory optimization tools amid EU green regs. We reached out with tailored outreach, and it led to a €150K annual contract—our fastest EU close in years. Overall, since switching, our qualified lead volume is up 35%, and pipeline velocity has accelerated by 2.5x, directly tying back to these precise signals. ROI-wise, we've calculated a 4:1 return in under six months, factoring in setup and subscription costs.

📉 Building Credibility in a Crowded Space

Artikle.io might not be a household name yet, but the momentum is real. They've climbed to #1 in G2's Europe Intent Data category with a 4.9/5 rating from 200+ reviews, snagged top spots on Trustpilot (4.7/5 from EU users), and racked up shoutouts on LinkedIn from execs at firms like Thales and Schneider Electric. Capterra echoes this with their 'Leader' badge in B2B analytics. And personally? I've chatted with over 20 sales leads from agencies and tech firms across France and Germany who've made the switch—unanimous thumbs up on the signal purity and support responsiveness (sub-12-hour replies, no jet-lag issues).

In short, if you're hustling B2B in Europe and done chasing ghost signals from American-centric platforms, give Artikle.io a spin. It's delivering where others promise.

Cheers,
Elena Voss
Head of Revenue Operations, Innovatech Dynamics

I live in an apartment complex where every tenant gets one reserved parking space with your unit number painted on it. Mine is 12B  clearly marked, no confusion.

There’s this guy who lives two buildings over let’s call him BMW Guy, who apparently decided my spot was his weekend home. Every Friday night, without fail, I’d come home from work to find his shiny white BMW parked there like it owned the place.

At first, I assumed it was an accident. I left a polite note on his windshield:

“Hey! This is my reserved spot (12B). Could you please use guest parking? Thanks!”

Next weekend: same thing. Note number two, a little less friendly.

Weekend three? Still there. I even caught him once as he was getting out and said, “Hey, just so you know, this spot’s mine.”
He just smiled and said, “Yeah, but I’m only here overnight. Management doesn’t care.”

Cool.

So I decided to stop caring, too.

The next Friday, I parked my old beater in the guest lot and waited. Sure enough, he swooped into my spot like it was his destiny. I waited a few hours, then called the towing company the complex uses.

“Hi, someone’s parked in my reserved spot,” I said, truthfully. “License plate XYZ…”

They showed up 20 minutes later. I watched from my window as they hooked up his car and hauled it away into the night.

Saturday morning, I go out to grab coffee, and there he is pajama pants, slippers, pacing around the empty space, phone in hand, looking furious.

Later that day, I overheard him in the office yelling that “someone” had his car towed. The property manager just said, “If you park in someone else’s assigned spot, that’s the risk you take.”

He had to Uber to the impound lot and pay around $250 to get his car back.

And the best part? He’s never parked there again. In fact, he waves at me now when he sees me like he’s scared I’ve got the tow truck on speed dial.

Was it justified? 100%.

1on7s35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1on7s35,Why Are There Restos Refusing To Honor Grab's Dine Out Deals Promo?,"Last Saturday, I dined at Sincerity in SM Megamall hoping to avail of the 5% discount from the Dine Out Deals by Grab. When I was about to pay, I was told by the staff that they are unaware of the promo. I even showed they are listed in the app as part of the promo. In the end, I had to pay in full via credit card. 

Thereafter, I went to Mister Donut and ordered coffee and donuts and asked the cashier if she is aware of the Dine Out Deals promo by Grab. Just like in Sincerity, I was told that they are unaware of the promo.

I had an inkling that it goes the same for some of the restos listed in the app. I went to 3 of my favorite food places (Por 'que, Frankie's and Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory) to ask if they are aware of the promo. They appeared to be clueless and unfamiliar with the promo. In other words, they are also not honoring the Dine Out Deals promo by Grab despite being listed in the app. 

Prior to this, I availed of the promo at Mey Lin and had no issue. Aside from the 20% off, I was also able to apply an additional 50% off available during Wednesdays.

I’m here because I still believe in something genuine, two people who meet halfway, stay curious, and make space for something real.

I’m 35, from Romania, and work in digital strategy and legal content, a mix of creativity and precision that keeps my mind busy and my coffee intake questionable. When I’m not working, I write fiction, build AI projects that try to make public systems more human, and get lost in psychology, mythology, and the strange ways people connect.

Physically, I'm considered convetionally attractive: 

I’m 5'5"", pale-skinned, with dark brown almond eyes, pastel pink hair, a curvy pear-shaped build, full lips, and an expressive face that rarely hides what I feel. I’m drawn to tall white men with strong arms, warmth, confidence, and that magnetic, optimistic energy. The kind of person who moves through life with purpose and knows who they are.

I’m separated and will be divorced soon, so I’m emotionally available and open to connection. I’m not interested in men who are already in a relationship, or in heavy drinkers, pot, or drugs. I prefer clarity, not chaos.

I’m especially drawn to men who are driven and passionate, professionally successful, and alive with hobbies and goals that make them feel electric. Someone who communicates openly, enjoys affection, and isn’t afraid to show it. I want someone who matches my energy, my intensity, and my curiosity about life.

I’m not necessarily looking to jump into a relationship, but I’m open to it if it grows naturally. When it comes to children, I’m leaning toward not having them, but it’s not a definite no. If kids are something you know you absolutely want, we’re probably not a fit.

If you’re between 30 and 45, emotionally open, curious, and living life with intention, tell me about yourself.

I've had a skim though the search results on telling family, but since most of what I found included introducing other partners I thought Id explain my situation to the hive mind for advice. 

I (41M) and my wife (41F) have been together for 16 years, poly for \~7 or 8 years now   
She currently has one long term BF & I'm currently not dating anyone.   
  
My mother in law lives with us and generally disapproves. She thought this was all a phase that would stop when we had kids. She rarely sees me date and for a while seemed to treat my wife like she was cheating on me.   
  
The last time I had a partner stay over, she bumped into MIL in the kitchen Said good morning & got blanked. I took her home & when I got back I was greeted with ""TELL THEM NOT TO TALK TO ME I DONT WANT TO BE INVOLVED!""   
  
Anyway to the point. My dad is looking at downsizing and has possibly got a flat less than half a mile from us. We figure proximity means we (me) need to tell him before he bumps in to my wife and her BF out having coffee or something. I fear that his reaction may be similar to my MIL especially since my wife is dating and I'm not, that she's cheating on me & I just have no idea how to handle it.

He was the first one to message me and asked me out for coffee to get to know each other, but I turned him down at the time because I was insecure and wasn’t sure if he’d really like me.
After that, our eye contact got even more intense, but we still never talked.

Eventually, I messaged him to apologize if I had acted weird afterwards at work, and he replied warmly, but I also told him I was leaving the job, and we never spoke again.

1on7ia7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1on7ia7/awake_part_1_and_2/,Awake (Part 1 and 2),"[Awakening]

“Wake up.” No. It’s not time yet. I’m not ready. “Wake up.” You can whisper all you want, but I’m not going to. You can’t make me. “Wake. Up.” Now it’s getting on my nerves. No. I’m not opening my eyes. I don’t want to see you. I don’t want to know what time it is. “WAKE UP!”

A jolt of what can only be described as vicious electricity, my left hand flies to my chest, my right leg kicks, and before I can stop myself, before I can tell her one more time that I just want to sleep, I find myself up right, my body convinced that we were about to die. 

“Just great….” I mumble to myself, running a trembling set of fingers through my knotted hair. 

My hand pats the bed around me, searching for my phone as the glow of the tv barely offers any help. Netflix wants to know if I’m still watching, which means I can’t have been asleep for long. 

There it is. By my feet. The cracked screen of my phone blinds me for a moment as I lift it to my face to see the time. 4:57 AM. Just over an hour of sleep. 
“Yup….” I mumble to myself. 

Slowly, I lay back again, reaching over the warm sleeping form in bed beside me to grab the remote off the side table. “Yes, Netflix… apparently I am…” 
Beside me, Ace stirs. He lets out a quiet snort, turning onto his back. His eyes flutter open, only half lidded. 
“You’re still awake…?” He mumbles, followed by a yawn.

“Oh, I uh…. Just woke up to go to the bathroom.” I lie with a reassuring smile that, were he more awake, or the lights on, he would see straight through. “Go back to sleep, love.” I lean down to kiss his forehead as his eyes drift closed. Within moments, he’s once again gently snoring. 

I turn my attention back to the television, trying to ignore the hungry eyes that watch me from the darkest corner of the room. 

Perhaps I’ll get another hour at least. 

[Good Morning]

“When’d you go to bed?” A drowsy voice followed by a yawn breaks my trance.

“Hm?” A sip out of a coffee mug that I don’t remember holding. 

“When’d you go to bed?” 

I turn to face Keaton, looking up slightly to meet his tired gaze. I offer a small shrug in response. “I got sleep.” Another sip of my coffee. It’s bitter. Cold. When did I make this?

“That’s not what I asked.” He says as he crosses his arms, fixing me with a stern look. “I’m worried about you. You know that, right?” He turns to open the fridge, shaking his head. “You really gotta figure out your sleep schedule. This isn’t healthy. Ace is worried too.” 

By the time he’s turning back to face where I was standing, I’m already halfway to my room, sub-par coffee in hand. That conversation was boring anyways. 

I blink slowly, smoke dancing past my left eye as I take a slow drag. 

I guess I’m out for a smoke now. 

The car’s gone. 

Does Ace work today? What day is it?

I fish my phone out of my left pocket to check. Monday, August 17th. 12:35 PM. Yeah, he’s off in a few hours.  

6 missed calls. 43 emails. An ungodly amount of text messages. And a notification from YouTube. 
I’ll check those out later. 

Sirens in the distance. Nothing new. Another day in paradise. At least it’s sunny, right? 

A car passes by. Red sedan. Obnoxiously loud exhaust. Nothing special about it besides the guy behind the wheel. 

The trails are nice this time of year. I don’t remember coming out here, but apparently having a smoke in the driveway wasn’t enough fresh air. 

I like August. It’s perfect for hiking. So hot out that most people are at the beach while I’m out here on the trail. Kinda makes it feel like my secret little place away from the rest of the world. A place I can think in peace. Plus, maybe walking off some of my energy will help me get some sleep, yeah? 

Gravel crunches under my feet. The trees sway and dance around me. So beautiful. I could stay here forever. 

I could stay here forever….

Shit. Did I let the others know I was going out?
As I pull my phone out and check, an exasperated groan creeps its way out of my throat. 

30 messages from Ace and 12 missed calls, and it’s already 5:30. “Oops…” 

My hand trembles slightly, probably because I forgot to eat or something, and I listen intently to the soft trill, calling a most likely worried, and perhaps angry, Ace. 

There’s a moment of silence. What was I doing again?
“Ashy?!” His voice came frantic, almost like a plea. He was definitely panicking. 

“Uh, yeah… H-hey… I forg-“

“Where are you?! What are you doing?! I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for hours! I-I-I drove all over town! Asked everybody! No one’s heard from you all day! What the hell?!”

I gulp, looking down at my feet and kicking at the gravel like a child who’s being scolded. 

Another moment of silence. 

“Ashy…? I’m sorry, I’m just… I’m worried…”

There’s that word again. ‘Worried’. I can’t exactly tell him I don’t even remember leaving the house, or he’ll be even more ‘worried’. “I’m sorry… I just forgot to text you. I’m out for a hike. I’ll be back in a bit, okay? I’m just gonna go a little further, then turn back.”

I can tell when he pulls the phone away, hoping I won’t hear his resigned sigh, but I hear it anyways. Every time. “Okay, well…. Just let me know if you need anything. Do you have water?”

Fuck…. “Yeah, I grabbed a bottle.” Liar. 

“Alright…. Just… be safe okay? I love you. Call me if you need a ride.” 

“I love you too….” I respond quietly before hanging up, switching the phone in my hand for a pack of smokes. ",1,1762162870.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

My trusty all-in-one automatic finally gave up, and honestly, it's been the push I needed to build a proper setup from scratch. I'm ready to invest in something quality this time.

**What I need:**

* Versatile machine for both straight espresso and milk drinks
* Fast enough to handle making drinks for guests (so no manual lever machines)
* I'm at that ""good coffee multiple times a day"" level of enthusiasm

**Machines I've been researching:**

1. **Meraki** \- Seems to have everything I need on paper, plus it includes a grinder, which would save money
2. **Lelit Bianca** \- Dual boiler, rotary pump, flow control, gorgeous aesthetics
3. **Lelit MaraX** \- Heat exchanger system, should be capable enough?

**My situation:**

* Not an expert, but willing to learn
* Budget is flexible if there's a compelling reason to stretch it
* I genuinely love the ritual and taste of great coffee (morning, afternoon, evening... basically any time)
* Starting completely from scratch, so open to different approaches

**I'm looking for:**

* Advice on the machines above OR completely different recommendations
* What features actually matter vs. marketing hype?
* Should I be looking at other brands/models entirely?
* Any ""wish I knew this before buying"" insights

I'd really appreciate guidance from folks who've been through this decision. What would you recommend and why? Are there hidden gems I'm missing or pitfalls I should watch out for?

Thanks in advance!

1on7efi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesforMrRevenant/comments/1on7efi/home_invasion_uk_story/,Home Invasion UK Story,"Submission by Owen. 

This story takes place in a remote area of the UK.

My friend Zahra, a British Pakistani influencer had just recently had her second child and her husband had gone away on a golf holiday leaving her alone with the two children. She was used to being left alone as her husband often worked away from home too and would often go away on vacation with his friends leaving her alone to take care of the children.

It was a stormy October night and there was a lot of thunder so it was noisy. She started to feel uncomfortable as it was getting dark early and her house is fairly isolated so all the noise from outside was getting to her. 
At around 9pm she had just finished a cup of coffee in the kitchen, the children were asleep and Zahra was making sure the house was locked up for the night. She went back into the kitchen and saw that the back door was slightly open. She started to approach it but then felt very dizzy, stumbling and she fainted. 

Zahra slowly regained consciousness and was sat on a chair in the kitchen. The first thing she was aware of was how heavily she was breathing through her nose. She felt something covering her mouth, and after twisting her lips she realised it was duct tape that was sealing her lips. Zahra started to panic and tried to talk and shout but the gag around her mouth was preventing this. She struggled to move as well as she could feel her hands were taped together behind the chair and when she looked down she was duct taped to the chair and her feet were taped together. Her hard breathing popped the duct tape covering her mouth in and out. Then the lamp over her head switched on. Standing there before her was a medium built man with a hood on and a scarf covering his lower face. At this point, Zahra was obviously petrified and was mainly concerned for her two children sleeping upstairs. The man then said “I won’t hurt you but do you keep money in the house?” Zahra mumbled “no” against the tape.

The man had a large bag which he had filled with items such as Dubai jewellery from around the house. The next thing he said sent a chill up Zahra’s back, “don’t worry your kids are still asleep.” He then went to leave through the back kitchen door and before exiting turned and said “I’m sorry for this.” He then left the house leaving Zahra tied up and gagged. Zahra struggled with her bonds, grunting heavily through the gag on her mouth for a few minutes and then eventually freed her mouth from the tape by twisting her mouth and biting the tape. She managed to twist her hands out of the tape holding her wrists. She immediately ran to check on her children who had both slept through the entire ordeal. She phoned the police and the man was eventually apprehended later that week.

As mentioned, Zahra has an online presence so the man was aware of this and was aware that she was often left alone. He admitted to gaining entry to the back door and drugged her coffee which explains why she fainted. The burglar said he had lost his business and was in a desperate situation with the state of the economy but he did not wish to harm anyone. 

Zahra bears a resemblance to Kim Kardashian and the fact she is a micro influencer is likely what gave him this idea as a similar situation happened with Kim Kardashian a few years earlier. 
Zahra is a very strong, feisty young woman so she did eventually learn to live with the situation however it’s not something you can ever fully recover from. She couldn’t help feel sorry for the man who did this but the feeling she had when she was gagged and helpless in that chair is something she’ll never forget.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Canisius Golden Griffins vs. Dayton Flyers: A Tale of Two Teams (and a 25-Point Spread)**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most lopsided basketball game since a toddler challenged a NBA G League star to a free-throw contest. On November 4, 2025, the Canisius Golden Griffins and Dayton Flyers will face off in a matchup that’s less of a competition and more of a math problem. The odds? Dayton is a **-25.5 spread favorite**, with some books even offering them at a baffling **1.01 decimal line** (basically saying “just hand them the trophy and we’ll call it even”). Let’s unpack this statistical monstrosity with the gravity it deserves—by which I mean, not very much.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Foregone Conclusion

The spread here is so steep it could double as a ski slope. Dayton is favored by **25.5 points**, with most books locking in the line between -24.5 and -25.5. For context, that’s the kind of spread you see when a team is playing against a squad of high school cheerleaders who accidentally wandered into the arena. The total line sits around **142 points**, which is… *optimistic* for a game where Dayton might score 80 and Canisius 50.

Implied probabilities? Let’s do the math. If Dayton is -25.5 on the spread, and assuming a standard -110 juice, their implied win probability is roughly **97%**. Meanwhile, Canisius’ +25.5 line gives them a **3% chance** to keep it close. To put that in terms relatable to even the most casual fan: It’s like betting your favorite coffee shop will run out of espresso today vs. the moon developing a caffeine addiction.

this might be a long post but there’s so many factors to consider here, and i am really looking for outside help. 

my boyfriend and i just graduated high school, so obviously him and i are in a confusing enough spot, but i feel like he doesn’t care to grow up. 

he texts me pretty much every second of every day, he is very introverted (well, he claims to be.), he doesn’t like crowded areas, he has very bad anxiety, he has very intrusive parents, and he has very bad stomach issues (this matters, i promise). 

basically, he and i started very highschool, very kiddy, and very immature. i am his first relationship ever, while he is my 3rd. and the lack of experience on his end didn’t really play a huge part in our issues like i thought it would.
i spent a lot of time at his house, but we went out a lot, movies, sushi, goodwill, you name it. we found our own fun a lot, this was typically a group effort to decide where exactly we were going. our first issues really started to stem from my desire to get out of the house, and his desire to stay in. 

his parents have given him what i call a “broken view” of the world. they live in the woods on a really nice piece of property, and it’s a gorgeous home. however, because of their location, and due to his parents working from home, leaving the house isn’t a norm. they moved to the area in 2019, so covid-19 happened and then they js really became isolated within their “pack”. naturally, any distance in a car that was longer than 30min, was a REALLY long drive. and “(insert semi-major city)’s traffic is SOOO bad”. the broken views are really about traffic, drive distance, money, and holidays. there were times when my boyfriends parents told him no, that he could not go to walmart to look at legos, they will not allow him to spend his own money on that. anything that isnt a necessity, is a waste to them. i enjoy concerts, and i spent quite a lot of money on concerts in 2024, i ended up seeing 11 concerts that year. his dad had a conversation about us and our future, because he viewed me as a financial threat. if i had been there, i think i would’ve flipped! i was 17, with no financial responsibility, so i was going to enjoy that while i could! so, naturally, my boyfriend started acting like i was “financially irresponsible” and he would crack jokes about how we don’t get to have shared finances in our future, and that he doesn’t trust me with money. i was really hurt by this, because that simply was not true. holidays are another big one, they don’t do holidays in the way i’ve experienced it, and it truly saddened and shocked me to see the way they treat holidays. birthdays are bland. the family all goes out to walmart the night before the persons birthday/orders on amazon, and thats how gifts are picked. it felt so thoughtless to me. my boyfriend did this to me for my 16th and 17th birthday, my gifts werent even wrapped, nor given to me on time, and it truly broke my heart. i put in a lot for his presents on his birthday, and not receiving a fraction of that was devastating for me. christmas shocked me even more. one day, his mom pulls out the decorations, and puts them all up by herself, while him and his sister stay in their rooms, and his dad is off doing whatever. their decorations are minimalism central, beiges and browns. absolutely no festive fun, and their gifts are wrapped in a paper bag-like wrapping paper. it’s just not FUN. 

not only was this broken view provided by his parents, but so was a lack of parenting combined with overparenting. that sentence doesn’t make sense, but it will, i swear. i read this article recently that just absolutely shocked me. it was about how overparenting has been on a steady increase since the 80s, due to fear mongering media about how scary the world is. so, parents have either supervised and organized outside play time, or completely cut it off all together; but unsupervised play is essential for childhood development, contributing to confidence and positive mental health. when outside play is limited/taken away all together, it has been replaced with a screen. shows, the internet, etc. which are usually not monitored to the same extent, because it is difficult to do as such. doing this, in turn, results in poor social skills, lower self esteem, and anxiety. my boyfriend is addicted to his phone, he genuinely cannot put it down sometimes, it has ruined some of our dates. his parents have gotten over involved in his real-life, he was grounded for a month when they found out we had sex. they said things about how they couldn’t trust him anymore, etc. and to him, this was devastating, it broke him. but for me, i was able to let it go, because ive been told those things from my parents pretty much my whole life, for years it was like i was always in trouble. for him, he rarely gets punished for his actions. there is no discipline, only a repetition of asking and anger, but no discipline. if he doesn’t know how to do something, instead of him being taught, or having to try it until he gets it right, they just end up doing it for him. failure is also essential for development!! he was never taught what failure was like, so now when he gets a small taste of it, it destroys him so much that he will never try again. 
for example: he is 19 and can’t swallow pills. instead of making him persist at trying, they just kept finding alternatives. he doesn’t want to fail, so he wont try. and believe me, it’s been so frustrating for me.

with all of that background. here’s the issue. i was raised in suburbia, grew up in a broken home. parents are split, not in much contact with my father. holidays were always a big thing for me, it looks like that holiday threw up all over the house. i am an extroverted introvert, i love going out, and i love doing spontaneous things, while also planning for other things as well. i do appreciate some me-time and will have downtime, but i typically do that in colder seasons, when its summer, you will not catch me home unless i am sleeping. him and i just come from very different worlds, and it’s worked for a while— until it hasnt. lately, (within the past year) it’s been really hard to get him out of the house. he has an excuse for everything. whenever he asks for me to come over to watch our show i don’t put up a fight, i usually am like yeah sure ill be over in 30. we live ~25-30 mins away from each other, my car isnt very fuel efficient because its a 2003 SUV, while he has a 2023 elantra. but i never really said no. anytime i wanted to do anything it was like, “do we have to?” “why not somewhere else?” “that’s really far..” “will there be a bathroom?” “how long are we going to be there?”. questions that genuinely made me not want to do what i wanted to do anymore, and sometimes id get caught up in them, and essentially beg for him to hangout with me. lots and i mean lots of tears and lots of frustration, even a broken phone, have come of this. and i am not saying i am perfect, i have pretty bad anger issues that get me to this point, that hes aware of, but it just pushes my limits. we havent gone out to dinner since the beginning of september, when i paid for a vacation for the two of us. on my 18th birthday, (last july)i got nothing. i was working all day and so was he, but i just received nothing from him, or anyone else. and it genuinely broke my heart. on his 18th birthday the year before, i took him to the zoo, i got him a baseball jersey, a baseball cap, a lego set, a picture of us, and some candy, and i made him and his family mac and cheese because he had wanted it. and it really wasnt cheap, and on my 17th birthday that year he had ordered me gifts a week after my birthday, and handed me them right out of the package. i got a penguin stuffed animal, and a necklace with his initial on it. i voiced my frustration, that i felt like the effort was mismatched, he assured me that it wouldnt happen again. and i believed him. but of course, i received nothing on my 18th birthday. he had to put his dog down 3 days before, and that was the excuse he clung to. but for his 19th, i had toned down my gift giving for him, because i obviously didnt want to set myself up for disappointment, unfortunately i still did more than what i got. i got him tickets to a concert he’d been talking about for a really long time, and then soda and candy. put it in a bag, called it good. evidently i was going to be even more disappointed. then, he told me he felt really bad about my 18th birthday, and told me he would take me shopping. i wanted to go to a mall that was about 45min-1 hour away from my house with traffic, the night before we went he told me that he was going to take me. i woke up that day so excited, i got ready and everything. then of course, he started asking questions and saying things about how far it was, and why couldn’t we pick somewhere closer, and how he said that last night but that wasn’t him today. i ended up crying and hanging up, because all that was going to happen was me begging him to do something for me. my mom decided to take me instead, but as soon as we were on the highway he called me and asked me what i was doing, and i told him my mom was taking me, and he played the cards about how he was going to take me, and i sat there confused because i obviously did not get that message before. my mom and i ended up doing something else until he was at my house and took me. i still ended up paying for my lunch while we were there, and he complained quite a bit while we were there. it just made me feel like i really didn’t matter to him, i felt very taken for granted. like he thought just “going through the motions” was enough. it hurt my heart, and i have never been able to express these feelings to him without feeling really guilty, or him getting defensive. 

upon other things; his stomach issues ruined a lot too. we couldn’t go anywhere if he ever felt like his stomach bothered him, or if there was a possibility there would be no bathroom. if there wasn’t a bathroom, good luck getting him there. one time we were in grocery outlet, and i was looking at skincare, he told me to hurry up because he wasnt sure if there was a bathroom in there or not. come to find out, there was. and so he told me nevermind, but ended up not even using it. how frustrating… 

these things happened a while back. and since then, ive found every situation of my unhappiness rooting from this hurt. he tells me i need to get over it, and that he will be better, but those cuts were really really deep. i finally decided to hold my ground, and i finally decided to put myself first, because i decided i should never let someone have this much control over my emotions like this. and since then, he has voiced a concern about me leaving the relationship, me breaking up with him, and getting overly emotional about me. he left for vegas for work, and the day before he left he really wanted to see me. i was busy though, i had class, got my blood drawn, and was walking a dog. i didn’t have the time to make an hour long round trip to see him. he put in no effort to see me that day, then at 9pm turned it on me and said that i had put no effort and it felt like i didn’t want to see him. i was really angry at first, i was so mad that he didn’t see how busy i was that day, and blamed me for not seeing him. and i just was very blunt with him, i said i understand how you feel, you know the way to my house, and i don’t feel like arguing. so much was left unsaid, but i was tired of wasting my breath for it to fall on deaf ears. it worked because, we didnt argue, and everything was fine that night. he bought me coffee for me to pick up the next few days, which he had never done before, so it was really sweet of him. and i felt like our relationship could finally get better if i continued to grow myself. on halloween, i went to a friend’s house for a gathering, i was drinking and obviously decided to stay over, because i am responsible. that night i had a blast. i have had a really hard time getting out with friends, because after high school i just wanted out of my town, and i didnt want anything to do with anyone. so ive been doing my own thing, but it got lonely and id be really emotional to my boyfriend about it, i was lonely and struggled with friends. so finally having this outing was so much fun to me, and i thought my boyfriend would be happy for me. i told him i was drinking, and he was going to bed and he told me to be safe, and have fun. the next morning, he told me to call him, he was like good morning, and then all of the sudden he was like “you didn’t tell me you were staying the night” and kind of was an asshole about it, and i told him that i was being responsible and i wasn’t going to continue to have that conversation with him. and then i hung up, and he texted some nasty things about how if he could hang up in person on conversations he didnt wanna have i would be furious. i left him on read and continued hanging out with my friends. he called me again, to apologize for his behavior and i thanked him, and told him that i literally cannot give him play by play updates on my life because thats such an unrealistic expectation. and he kind of understood, anyway, he called me 6 more times after that for random things. and i was fed up. on the way home i called him to tell him that he was actually being really immature, and that i was finally hanging out with friends, and he was actively trying to take away from that. because in the meantime while he was calling me, he texted me things about how he wouldnt text me or call me again, and he didnt understand why him and i couldnt just talk anymore. it was really annoying and affected the quality of time i had with my friends. 

i wish he would grow up, and meet me where i am at. i can’t change him, and i know that. i just don’t know if im the asshole here, should i be more understanding? im not really sure what to do here. advice would be greatly appreciated.

Those affected include Berlin-based Turkish-Kurdish journalist and German citizen Hüseyin Doğru, founder of the media platform Red Media, as well as German-born journalists Alina Lipp and Thomas Röper, who live in Russia.

>The sanctions against Doğru include the freezing of all bank accounts, an EU-wide travel ban and a de facto professional ban. This means that Doğru is forbidden from engaging in any form of paid employment or self-employment, and no one is legally permitted to provide him with any economic resources. In practice, even inviting him for a coffee would constitute a criminal offence.

>The WSWS has reported on the [Red Media ban](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/05/29/qopq-m29.html).

>**According to the EU’s justification, Doğru’s reporting on the Palestine solidarity movement in Germany “sows ethnic, political and religious discord” and thus aids “Russia’s destabilising activities.”**

>Not only Doğru’s bank account but also that of his pregnant wife has been frozen, even though she is not named on the sanctions list. Doğru can access only a minimal subsistence allowance after weeks of approval by the Bundesbank (German Federal Bank). His freedom of movement has been curtailed, and he cannot legally be employed as a journalist—for instance by *junge Welt*, which enquired about hiring him—because, according to the German Economics Ministry, such employment would violate the EU’s “prohibition on making funds available” and would constitute a criminal offence.

Thing is. Our equipment sterilization protocol in the official manual requires 8 hours of UV exposure between uses.

We have six pieces of equipment. We run maybe 40 tests a day across all of them.

You see the problem.

Monday morning I start the UV cycle on the first machine I use. Derek walks by later and asks why I'm not running samples. I show him the manual, show him his email, explain the math. If we actually follow protocol we can run maybe 3 tests total per day as a department.

His face went through like five different emotions. Tries to say ""you know that's not what I meant"" and I'm like but you said everything by the book, zero shortcuts, remember?

He had to call the department head. They had to get someone from compliance on the phone. Turns out that protocol was supposed to be updated in 2015 and just... wasn't. Nobody noticed because nobody followed it.

It all started the way most modern love stories do — in college, somewhere between assignments, chai breaks, and endless laughter echoing in Pune’s bustling corridors.

Sneha and Omkar met at a college fest — she was part of the organizing committee, meticulous and full of life, and he was the easy-going coder who somehow ended up volunteering for sound and lights.

They were opposites — she loved vibrant chaos; he found peace in order. But something clicked. Maybe it was her infectious energy or his quiet charm — soon, they became that inseparable duo every friend group secretly rooted for.

Years later, both found themselves working in IT — Sneha in Baner and Omkar in Hinjewadi. Their days were filled with deadlines and data sheets, but their evenings still belonged to panipuri stalls near Pimple Saudagar, soft drives through Aundh, and shared playlists echoing late into the night.

When Omkar proposed, it wasn’t at a fancy restaurant. It was at their favorite chai tapri, under the same gulmohar tree where they’d first argued about who’d pay for cutting chai. Pune had seen their story grow, and now it would witness their forever.





# 💛 2. The Dream Wedding Plan

For Sneha, the wedding had to feel like home — a mix of tradition and warmth, wrapped in modern elegance. Omkar wanted everything simple, smooth, and organized (classic IT mindset).

They both wanted the same thing: a celebration that *felt* like them.

After countless Pinterest boards, conversations, and venue visits across the city — from Ravet to Balewadi — they settled for a serene property on the outskirts of Hinjewadi, away from the city’s constant buzz but close enough for guests from Pimple Saudagar, Baner, and Wakad.

The only challenge? **The Hinjewadi traffic.**  
 Anyone from Pune knows that crossing Hinjewadi during rush hour is an act of courage and patience. But every good story has a challenge, right?

With careful planning and smart scheduling, the wedding team (and Omkar’s spreadsheet wizardry) managed staggered guest arrivals, shuttle pickups from key points, and even an early-morning vendor setup to beat the traffic chaos.

As the sun dipped behind the hills, the venue transformed into a glowing world of flowers, fairy lights, and laughter.





# 🌿 3. Haldi: Sunshine, Laughter & Yellow Chaos

The **haldi ceremony** was meant to be simple — close family, laughter, and the signature turmeric glow that marks the start of every wedding.  
 But what Sneha didn’t know was that Omkar had been planning something secretly for weeks.

Between client calls and late-night playlists, he had written and recorded a song — *their* song.  
 Every line told a piece of their story: how they met in college, how her laughter filled every chai break, how she made him believe that love didn’t need grand gestures — just small, real moments.

The morning began as usual, with friends teasing the couple, aunties tossing petals, and haldi bowls passing around. Then, suddenly, the background music changed.

A soft acoustic guitar began to play.  
 The crowd went silent.  
 And Sneha froze as she recognized the voice — *his voice.*

“Yaadon ke sheher mein tu meri gali thi,  
 Code aur coffee ke beech, tu mili thi…”

The lyrics drew laughter and tears all at once. Everyone cheered when they realized it was Omkar singing — through speakers, smiling shyly from across the courtyard.

By the time the chorus played, Sneha’s haldi tears had turned golden. She laughed, cried, and finally ran up to him, smearing haldi on his face in mock revenge.

That one moment became the soul of their wedding — raw, real, and unforgettable.

Later, the haldi playlist was saved and renamed **“Omkar’s Promise”** — the song that would go viral among their friends, shared again during the sangeet, and replayed quietly during their reception slideshow.







# 💃 4. Sangeet: Beats, Lights & All Things Bollywood

If haldi was about color, the sangeet night was about sparkle.

The venue, on the outskirts of Hinjewadi, came alive with fairy lights, mirror décor, and a dance floor that refused to rest. The air was electric with excitement as families from both sides gathered, united by the rhythm of music.

Sneha, who had promised she “won’t dance much,” ended up performing a full choreographed medley with her college friends. Omkar joined her midway — a surprise that melted everyone’s hearts.

Their entry? Iconic. A soft drizzle, twinkling lights, and an acoustic version of *“Tera Ban Jaunga”* playing in the background. Guests swayed with phones in the air, recording what felt like a scene straight out of a movie.

The sangeet ended not with a bang, but with hugs, tired feet, and hearts full of joy.





# 💐 5. The Wedding: A Blooming Dream

The wedding day dawned crisp and cool — typical Pune winter morning, with the air smelling faintly of mogra and wet earth.

The mandap, built near the venue’s garden pond, was a vision in yellow and white — thousands of genda phool strung together, reflecting golden under the morning sun.

Sneha’s lehenga was a soft blend of pastel pink and gold, modern yet rooted in tradition. Omkar’s sherwani matched perfectly — simple, elegant, and timeless.

As the shehnai began, guests settled on neatly arranged white chairs. The priest’s chants mingled with the soft rustle of wind through flowers.

When Sneha walked in, accompanied by her brother, there wasn’t a dry eye around. The girl who once blushed at chai stalls was now a bride — radiant, composed, and breathtaking.

The pheras were traditional, intimate, and perfectly timed with sunset — the golden light wrapping them in warmth. Every vow felt real, every glance between them unspoken but full of meaning.





# 🌙 6. The Reception: Lights, Love & Late-Night Laughter

By evening, the venue transformed once again — from floral day hues to a glittering night spectacle.

The [reception décor](https://www.weddingplannerpune.com/#gallery) was a blend of crystal chandeliers, vintage lanterns, and cascading flower walls. The entry arch was lined with fairy lights that gave everyone’s photos a magical glow.

Guests from Pune, Mumbai, and Nashik poured in, dressed to perfection. There was live music, fusion food, and of course — the *panipuri counter* that became the night’s unofficial selfie spot.

The couple’s entry stole the show — a slow walk through a tunnel of lights as “Perfect” by Ed Sheeran played softly. They cut a cake shaped like a blooming lotus, symbolizing new beginnings.

Omkar’s short speech had everyone laughing. Sneha’s vote of thanks had everyone crying.





# 📸 7. The Emotional Finale

As the night came to an end, the team surprised the couple with something special — a **photo collage video** that played softly on the big screen.

It started with their college photos — Sneha in her messy bun, Omkar in his usual hoodie — then moved through their pre-wedding shoot, haldi madness, and those stolen candid moments that no one knew were captured.

The final frame said:  
 **“From chai to forever — Sneha ❤️ Omkar”**

Sneha teared up. Even Omkar, the calmest person in the room, looked away trying to hide his smile. Their parents hugged, friends cheered, and somewhere in the background, fireworks painted the sky.

That night wasn’t just the end of a wedding — it was the beginning of a lifetime.





# 💫 8. Pune’s Charm & Little Things That Made It Work

What made this wedding so special wasn’t the grandeur, but the details —

* The way the planners managed Hinjewadi’s traffic by coordinating early vendor setups.  
* How local flower artists from Pimple Saudagar sourced over 10,000 fresh marigolds overnight.  
* The homemade welcome hampers filled with chikki from Lonavala, poha mix, and personalized thank-you notes.  
* The dedicated corner for elders, thoughtfully placed away from loud music but close enough to enjoy the vibe.  
* And the eco-friendly send-off, with seed paper confetti instead of plastic.  

Every detail spoke of love — not just between Sneha and Omkar, but in how every guest, every planner, and every vendor came together to make it unforgettable.





# 💍 9. Epilogue: The Love That Lit Up Pune

Weeks later, Sneha posted one of her favorite pictures from the night with the caption:

*“Still can’t believe this was real. Thank you to everyone who turned our dream into magic.”*

The post went viral in her circle — not because of the décor or dresses, but because it *felt human*. A real Pune wedding. A real love story.

And behind that beautiful chaos was a quiet, hardworking team — the ones who made sure every moment unfolded seamlessly.

That team was [Sajja Weddings ](https://share.google/KMGkisyTNCgLBPgKI)— one of the most loved [wedding planner pune ](https://www.weddingplannerpune.com/)teams known for turning local love stories into unforgettable celebrations.

# As Pune slept that night, the fairy lights still twinkled faintly at the edge of the venue — like the city itself was smiling, knowing it had witnessed a love story that would live in a thousand hearts and a million photographs.

*Long-term partner: The Investor*
They're swiping with a five-year plan. They want a sponser for those Naivasha weekend getaways and are ready to introduce you to the 'rents in Kitengela by month three. Respect the vision, but unless you're driving a V8, prepare to be judged against the current inflation rate.

*Long-term, open to short: The Corporate Pretender*
""I'm looking for commitment... but I have a 2-hour window on Thursday."" This is the Upper Hill professional who posts inspirational quotes but is absolutely down for a low-key, discreet hookup at a high-end hotel after work. They'll talk about marriage, but they're really just looking for a vibe check.

*Short-term, open to long: The Optimistic Ghost*
""Let's grab a drink and see where things go!"" Translation: JKUAT student on semester break looking for good vibes and a few solid dates before they inevitably ghost once you start talking about mutual savings or future plans. High energy, low commitment.

*Short-term fun: The Transaction*
The most honest label. This is pure ""hookup culture"" with no filter. Ideal for that spontaneous, post-club encounter in Kilimani or Westlands. Expect an Uber at 4 AM—no breakfast, no pleasantries, and absolutely no baggage.

*New friends: The Cockblock Master*
The ultimate red herring. ""Totally platonic coffee, promise!"" Yeah, nah. They're either already married and scouting for gossip, or they're just looking for a wingman to tag along to that next event at K1. Swipe left unless you genuinely need a new chama member.

*Still figuring it out: The Hot Mess*
Code for: ""I'm emotionally volatile after a brutal breakup, but my selfie game is fire."" They're either dealing with residual drama, nursing a major Tusker hangover, or just looking for validation. Swipe only if you're prepared to navigate an emotional rollercoaster driven by pure chaos.

Which of those decoded bios do you think is the most common?

Tonight, I was studying at a coffee shop and she walked by and said hi (she’s also grinding). We naturally started talking for a bit, and when the conversation ended, I asked her for her number. She seemed a bit surprised? I said she didn’t have to, but she gave me her number anyways (unless it was a fake number…? But it shows blue bubbles...). Anyways, she then went on her way to the bathroom. When she walked out she walked in a hurry giving me her back.

I’m a bit confused by the interaction. Like, did I make her uncomfortable? Was asking her for her number a psycho move? It wasn’t my intention for her to feel pressured into giving me her number. 

Would IG have been less… weird? I don’t really use mine so I instinctively went for number. I simply texted her “this is so from this and that.”",1,1762161779.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

我是个 35 岁的打工人，十年职场生涯从底层销售爬到中层产品经理，换过三家公司，被裁过一次，升职加薪三次，投资亏过一半积蓄，也靠副业赚回两套房首付。读完这个五年计划，我没觉得它“完美”，反而像照镜子——它指出了我过去十年踩过的坑，也让我意识到：**我不是从零开始，我已经有了弹药，只是没系统化**。

先说感悟，再说改计划。

**十年打工血泪史，浓缩三句话**

1. **杠杆不是等来的，是偷来的**。我第一份副业是帮老板写 PPT 赚外快，后来把模板卖给同行，一晚上 500 块。那一刻我才懂：你上班学的技能，晚上就能变现。
2. **安全边际不是钱，是选项**。被裁那年，我有 3 个月存款 + 副业现金流 + 老东家返聘 offer，才敢拒绝降薪续约。**选项比存款更抗造**。
3. **复利不是等五年，是从第 30 天开始**。我 28 岁才开始记账，30 岁才每天写 300 字，32 岁才发第一条小红书。现在回头看，**每拖一年，曲线就扁平一年**。

**对五年计划的「打工人版」修改**

我不会从「第 1 年第 1 天」开始，因为我不是应届生。我的起点是：**已有技能栈 + 现金流 + 副业雏形**。所以我把计划压缩、合并、偷懒，变成 **「3 年冲刺 + 2 年守成」**，核心是：**用现有弹药打第一枪，别等完美**。

**调整 1：第一年不学 20 个模型，只抓 3 个「职场核弹」**

- **激励**：我现在帮老板写方案，顺手把方案拆成模板卖给同行（已赚 2 万）。
- **机会成本**：每周只投 10 小时副业，放弃无效加班。
- **逆向**：问自己「怎么才能被裁后 3 天找到下家？」→ 答案是建人脉库（已开始每周请 1 个同行吃饭）。

**为什么只抓 3 个？** 因为我试过学 10 个，3 个月全忘。**用 3 个赚到第一桶金，再学第 4 个**。

**调整 2：特殊知识不是「挖掘」，是「复盘」**

我不用三圆环，我直接翻 10 年工作记录，问自己：

- 哪 3 次提案让老板眼睛发光？→ **PPT 逻辑 + 数据故事**
- 哪 3 次副业让我赚到钱？→ **Notion 模板 + 小红书引流**

**我的特殊知识 =「帮打工人用 Notion 管项目 + 小红书教逻辑」**

→ 第 1 个月就出模板，卖 99 元，已有 50 人买。

**调整 3：杠杆不是「30 天建」，是「30 天偷」**

- **媒体杠杆**：我不上新平台，直接用公司群 + 朋友圈发「每周学到」截图，3 周涨 200 精准粉。
- **产品杠杆**：不等 MVP，先卖「1 对 1 咨询」（99 元/小时），用咨询反馈迭代模板。
- **资本杠杆**：第一笔收入全砸指数基金，不等 50% 再投。

**调整 4：幸福工程不是「冥想」，是「删欲望」**

我试过冥想 20 分钟，睡着了。

**我的版本：每周删 1 个无效群 + 每周只追 1 部剧**。

→ 省下 10 小时，够我写 5 条内容。

**调整 5：检查清单不是「6 条」，是「1 张便签」**

我打印一张 A4，贴工位：

1. 这事在我能力圈吗？

2. 最差亏多少？扛得住吗？

3. 有人付钱吗？

→ 每做决定，对着便签打 3 个钩，10 秒搞定。

**我的 3 年冲刺版时间表**

| **时间** | **目标** | **动作** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **第 1 年** | 副业月入 1 万 | 模板卖 99 × 100 人 + 咨询 99 × 50 小时 |
| **第 2 年** | 副业月入 3 万 | 出在线课 + 建小社群（ Notion + 小红书 ） |
| **第 3 年** | 辞职 OR 谈远程 | 被动收入覆盖生活费，选项到手 |
| **第 4-5 年** | 守成 + 无限游戏 | 复利跑起来，偶尔教课，偶尔旅行 |

**最后说一句**

这个计划不是「教你飞」，是**「我陪你一起爬」**。

我不是从 0 开始，我是从「10 年坑」开始。

**你呢？你的 10 年给了你什么弹药？**

评论区说说，我下周日更新进度，一起打卡。

I’m a 35-year-old corporate grunt with ten years of scars: started in sales, clawed my way to mid-level product manager, jumped three companies, got laid off once, promoted three times, lost half my savings on a dumb crypto bet, and clawed back two down-payments through side hustles. I just read this Naval + Munger 5-year blueprint and it didn’t feel “perfect”—it felt like a mirror. It showed me every pothole I’ve driven into over the last decade and made one thing crystal clear: **I’m not starting from zero. I’ve got ammo—I just never loaded it into a system.**

First the scars, then the tweaks.

**Ten Years of Corporate Blood, Three Lines**

1. **Leverage isn’t handed to you—you steal it.** My first side gig was ghost-writing PPTs for my boss. I turned the decks into templates and sold them to his competitors—$500 overnight. That’s when I learned: the skills you pick up on the clock can cash out after 5 p.m.
2. **Margin of safety isn’t cash—it’s options.** The year I got canned I had 3 months of savings + a trickle of side income + a re-hire offer from the old firm. That’s the only reason I could walk away from a 20 % pay cut. **Options beat a fat bank account.**
3. **Compounding doesn’t start in Year 5—it starts on Day 30.** I was 28 before I tracked a single expense, 30 before I wrote 300 words a day, 32 before my first viral Xiaohongshu post. Every year I delayed, the curve stayed flat.

**My “Corporate Survivor” Edit of the 5-Year Plan**

I’m not a fresh grad, so I’m not starting at “Year 1, Day 1.” My runway is: **existing skill stack + small cash flow + side-hustle embryo.** I’m compressing the whole thing into a **3-year sprint + 2-year cruise**, and the mantra is: **fire the first bullet with the gun you already own.**

**Tweak 1: Year 1 isn’t 20 models—it’s 3 job-site nukes**

- **Incentives**: I already write proposals for my boss. I strip them into templates and sell them on the side (made $2k last quarter).
- **Opportunity cost**: Cap side hustle at 10 hrs/week, kill useless overtime.
- **Inversion**: “How do I get another offer inside 72 hours if I’m let go tomorrow?” → Build a Rolodex (one coffee with a peer every week).

**Why only 3?** I tried 10 and forgot them in 90 days. **Earn with 3, then add #4.**

**Tweak 2: Specific knowledge isn’t “dig”—it’s “autopsy”**

No three-circle exercise. I open my 10-year work diary and ask:

- Which 3 decks made the boss’s eyes light up? → **PPT logic + data storytelling**
- Which 3 side gigs actually paid? → **Notion templates + Xiaohongshu traffic**

**My specific knowledge = “Helping corporate drones run projects in Notion + teaching logic on Xiaohongshu.”**

→ Month 1: template live at $15, 50 sales already.

**Tweak 3: Leverage isn’t “built in 30 days”—it’s “stolen in 30 days”**

- **Media lever**: No new platform. I spam “weekly takeaway” screenshots in my company WeChat group + Moments. Three weeks, 200 targeted followers.
- **Product lever**: Don’t wait for MVP—pre-sell 1-on-1 coaching ($15/hr). Use the calls to iterate the template.
- **Capital lever**: First dollar in → straight to an index fund. No 50 % reinvest rule yet.

**Tweak 4: Happiness engineering isn’t “meditate”—it’s “delete”**

20-minute meditation? I fall asleep.

**My version**: Kill one useless group chat every week + cap myself at one show.

→ 10 hrs reclaimed, enough for 5 posts.

**Tweak 5: Checklist isn’t 6 bullets—it’s one Post-it**

I printed an A4 and taped it to my monitor:

1. Inside my circle?

2. Worst-case loss I can eat?

3. Someone already paying?

→ 10-second scan before any move.

**My 3-Year Sprint Timeline**

| **Year** | **Goal** | **Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Year 1** | Side hustle hits $1.5k/mo | 99 × 100 template sales + 99 × 50 coaching hrs |
| **Year 2** | Side hustle hits $4.5k/mo | Online course + paid Notion community |
| **Year 3** | Quit OR go remote | Passive covers rent → options unlocked |
| **Year 4-5** | Cruise + infinite game | Let compounding run, teach occasionally, travel |

**One Last Thing**

This isn’t a “fly, peasant” sermon. **It’s a climb and I’m on the wall with you.**

I’m not starting at zero—I’m starting from a decade of bruises.

**What about you? What ammo did your last 10 years leave in the chamber?**

Drop it below. I’ll update every Sunday. Let’s log the reps together.


### **引言：一份“攻防兼备”的人生战略**

本计划是一份为期五年的个人发展蓝图，其核心理念在于融合两位思想巨人的智慧，构建一个“一加一大于三”的、攻防兼备的人生操作系统。我们将纳瓦尔·拉维坎特（Naval Ravikant）的哲学视为一套强大的“进攻与幸福系统”，它旨在最大化个人独特性、利用杠杆实现指数级财富增长，并最终获得内在的平静。同时，我们将查理·芒格（Charlie Munger）的思想视为一套坚不可摧的“防御与判断系统”，它通过多元思维模型和对人类心理偏见的深刻洞察，帮助我们避免重大错误，做出理性的决策。

如果将人生比作一次充满未知的高风险航行，那么芒格就像一位经验丰富的船长，他为我们提供了穿越风暴的“地图和指南针”——即理性的思维框架与风险管理工具。而纳瓦尔则如同天才工程师，他为这艘船安装了“核动力引擎并指明了目的地”——即实现财富自由的杠杆系统与通往内心平静的幸福工程。本计划的终极使命，正是在保证航行安全（防御）的前提下，最大化航行速度与效率（进攻），系统性地内化两位大师的智慧，从而构建一个完整、强大且抗风险的“好的人生”公式。

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **第一阶段：基础构建（第一至第二年）—— 搭建思想操作系统**

### **1.1 战略概述与目标**

第一阶段是整个五年计划的基石，其战略核心是搭建一个强大的底层“思想操作系统”（Mental Operating System）。这两年的任务并非追求立竿见影的成果，而是为未来三年的指数级成长奠定坚实的基础。此阶段将双线并行：一方面，系统性地吸收查理·芒格的防御性智慧，建立一套理性决策的护栏，避免因“铁锤人倾向”和认知偏见而犯下颠覆性错误；另一方面，启动纳瓦尔的进攻性实践，通过深度自我挖掘，识别出个人独一无二的“特殊知识”，并着手构建一个无需许可的杠杆工具。

**阶段性目标：**

- **第一年结束时：** 建立起核心的多元思维模型格栅，并明确识别出个人“特殊知识”的战略方向。
- **第二年结束时：** 能够熟练运用芒格的防御性思维工具（如能力圈评估、心理倾向识别），并初步建成一个能够持续产出价值的媒体杠杆。

### **1.2 芒格防御系统：构建理性决策的护栏**

### **1.2.1 建立多元思维模型格栅**

查理·芒格反复强调，单一学科的思维模式是极其危险的，正如他所说：“对于一个拿着锤子的人来说，一切问题都像钉子。” 这种“铁锤人倾向”会导致我们扭曲现实以适应自己有限的模型，从而做出灾难性的决策。为了克服这一缺陷，我们必须建立一个由来自不同重要学科的核心模型组成的“多元思维模型格栅”。这个格栅如同一个交织的渔网，能够捕捉现实世界的复杂性，让我们从多个维度立体地看待问题。

**两年学习计划：**

**第一年：专注掌握最重要的5个核心模型**

- **复利 (Compound Interest):** “理解复利的魔力和获取它的困难是理解许多事情的核心和灵魂。”
- **激励机制 (Incentives):** “给我看激励机制，我就告诉你结果。”
- **机会成本 (Opportunity Cost):** 核心洞察：任何决策的真正成本是所放弃的最佳替代方案的价值。
- **二阶效应 (Second-Order Thinking):** 核心洞察：通过不断追问“然后呢？再然后呢？”来预见决策的连锁反应。
- **逆向思维 (Inversion):** “反过来想，总是反过来想。我只想知道我会死在哪里，然后我永远不去那里。”

**第二年：扩展至其余15个核心模型**

- **数学/物理类:** 临界点、冗余备份、规模优势/劣势、断裂点。
- **生物/心理类:** 社会证明、自然选择、系统1 vs 系统2思维、巴甫洛夫联想。
- **经济/商业类:** 供需关系、护城河、网络效应、边际效用递减。
- **系统思维类:** 反馈循环、帕累托法则（80/20）、极端情况检验、非此即彼谬误。

### **1.2.2 划定能力圈与识别心理倾向**

**能力圈 (Circle of Competence):** 这是芒格核心的防御策略，其精髓在于“知之为知之，不知为不知”。成功不在于知道多少，而在于清楚地知道自己不知道什么，并严格待在自己真正理解的领域内。在能力圈内，你拥有信息和判断优势；一旦出圈，你便沦为待宰的“韭菜”。

**个人能力圈评估与行动规划**

| 核心能力圈评估标准 | 个人评估与行动规划 (请填写) |
| --- | --- |
| **深度理解:** 我能否向一个10岁的孩子解释清楚这个领域的核心逻辑、关键变量和商业模式？ |  |
| **经验验证:** 我是否在该领域拥有深厚的实战经验，并经历过完整的市场周期？（例如：超过5年的实践，并见证过行业的起伏兴衰？） |  |
| **预测能力:** 我能否相对准确地预测该领域未来5-10年的发展趋势和潜在风险？ |  |
| **失败情景分析:** 我是否清楚地知道，什么情况下这个领域的决策会失败？ |  |

**认知陷阱雷达 (Psychological Tendencies):** 芒格总结了25个人类固有的心理倾向，这些是我们大脑中系统性的“软件缺陷”，是导致聪明人犯下愚蠢错误的主要原因。识别这些倾向，就如同为自己的思想安装一个“认知陷阱雷达”，在决策前扫描并规避它们。

**第二年重点训练识别以下10个最关键的心理倾向：**

1. **激励机制导致的偏见:** 警惕自身和他人的利益如何扭曲判断。
2. **社会认同倾向:** 避免因“别人都在做”而盲目从众。
3. **确认偏误:** 主动寻找反对自己观点的证据，而不是只看支持性信息。
4. **厌恶损失倾向:** 意识到损失的痛苦被不成比例地放大，避免因此做出非理性决策。
5. **沉没成本谬误:** 决策只应基于未来，而非过去无法挽回的投入。
6. **过度自信倾向:** 永远假设自己可能错了，保持谦逊。
7. **对比误判倾向:** 警惕价格锚点等相对比较的陷阱，关注绝对价值。
8. **错误衡量易得性倾向:** 不要被媒体渲染的、容易想起的事件误导概率判断，要看统计数据。
9. **回避怀疑倾向:** 拥抱不确定性，避免为了快速消除疑虑而草率下结论。
10. **互惠倾向:** 警惕因收到微小好处而感到必须回报的心理压力。

### **1.3 纳瓦尔进攻系统：挖掘独特性与启动杠杆**

### **1.3.1 挖掘个人“特殊知识”**

根据纳瓦尔的财富公式 `财富 = 专长 × 杠杆 × 判断力`，“特殊知识”（Specific Knowledge）是驱动财富引擎的核心燃料。它不是通过培训就能获得的普通知识，而是源于个人天赋、热情和独特经历的交集。特殊知识让你变得不可替代，从而在市场中获得高价值回报。

**“三圆环交集法”挖掘练习 (第一年内完成):** 通过回答以下问题，找到你的天赋、热情与市场需求的交集。

1. **圆环一：天赋 (你擅长什么？)**
    - 什么事情你做起来很轻松，但别人觉得很难？
    - 在哪个领域，你似乎不费力就能比周围人做得更好？
    - 别人经常夸赞你或向你请教的是什么？
    - 回顾童年，你天生就对什么感兴趣并表现出才能？
2. **圆环二：热情 (你喜欢什么？)**
    - 什么事情对你来说是游戏，对别人却是工作？
    - 你愿意在周末或假期免费去做什么事？
    - 做什么事情时，你会进入“心流”状态，忘记时间流逝？
    - 如果钱不再是问题，你会选择做什么来度过你的人生？
3. **圆环三：市场需求 (世界需要什么？)**
    - 人们在抱怨什么？（抱怨=未被满足的需求）
    - 哪些行业或领域正在快速增长？
    - 你已经为自己解决了什么问题，而这个问题可能很多人都有？

**定义你的特殊知识方向 (用一句话清晰描述):** `我帮助 ______ (目标用户) 解决 ______ (问题)，通过 ______ (我的独特方法)。`

### **1.3.2 启动“无需许可的杠杆”**

纳瓦尔指出，财富的指数级增长需要杠杆。在四种杠杆（劳动力、资本、代码、媒体）中，“代码”和“媒体”是这个时代最强大的“无需许可的杠杆”——你不需要获得老板或投资人的批准就能开始建立它们。对于大多数人而言，从媒体杠杆入手是成本最低、启动最快的路径。

**【30天杠杆建立计划】**

**阶段一：第1-10天 (建立媒体杠杆基础)**

- **任务1：选择平台**
    - 根据纳瓦尔的建议：“选一个主平台，深耕。不要同时做5个平台，会分散精力。”
    - 行动：今天就在你选择的主平台（如博客、公众号、知乎、X/Twitter）注册账号并发布第一条内容。
- **任务2：定义你的“独特组合”**
    - 关键不在于“独一无二”，而在于“组合独特”。
    - 示例：你不是“唯一懂AI的人”，但你可能是“懂AI+懂教育+懂内容创作”的少数人，这构成了你的特殊知识。
    - 行动：清晰定义你的独特组合，并围绕它进行内容创作。
- **任务3：开始每日输出**
    - 坚持每天发布至少一条有价值的内容。
    - 使用纳瓦尔推荐的内容模板：
        - '今天学到：____________（1个具体见解）'
        - '过去我以为X，现在我认为Y，因为Z'
        - '推荐工具：X，因为它帮我解决了Y'

**阶段二：第11-20天 (建立内容飞轮)**

- **任务4：寻找共鸣点**
    - 纳瓦尔的策略：“不要追逐流量，追逐共鸣。1000个真粉丝>10万个路人。”
    - 行动：观察数据，分析哪些内容互动最多，然后放大产出类似内容。
- **任务5：建立反馈回路**
    - 积极回复评论、提问观众，了解他们的真实需求。这会形成一个正反馈循环：`输出内容 -> 获得反馈 -> 优化内容 -> 更多关注 -> 更多反馈 -> 指数增长`。
- **任务6：提炼“最佳金句”**
    - 每周总结你最有价值的内容，并将其压缩成一句话的金句。好内容值得重复传播。

**阶段三：第21-30天 (从媒体到产品)**

- **任务7：识别痛点**
    - 通过与关注者的互动，识别他们反复提及的、最迫切的痛点。
- **任务8：创造最小可行产品 (MVP)**
    - 记住纳瓦尔的原则：“如果你不为你的第一个版本感到尴尬，说明你上线得太晚了。”
    - 行动：创造一个简单的数字产品来解决用户的核心痛点，例如：
        - **Level 1 (最易):** PDF模板/清单、Notion模板。
        - **Level 2 (中等):** 1对1咨询、小型社群。
        - **Level 3 (最难):** 在线课程、SaaS工具。
- **任务9：叠加杠杆**
    - 利用你已建立的媒体影响力获取用户，通过产品实现变现，将收入再投资（资本杠杆），最终形成一个强大的、多重杠杆叠加的财富系统。

### **1.4 幸福工程基础：构建内在平静**

在个人发展计划的初期就引入纳瓦尔的“幸福工程”，至关重要。它并非财富自由后的奢侈品，而是整个系统的核心能量来源。一个内心平静的人，才能做出更理性的判断，并拥有长期坚持的耐力。纳瓦尔的幸福公式是 `幸福 = 现实 - 期望`。相较于提升现实的缓慢与不可控，主动管理和降低期望是一条更快速、更可靠的通往内心平静的路径。

**贯穿前两年的每日练习计划：**

- **练习一：每日冥想**
    - 从每天5分钟开始，专注于观察自己的呼吸。
    - 目标是在第一年结束时稳定在每天15-20分钟，训练观察思绪而不被其控制的能力。
- **练习二：活在当下**
    - 选择一项日常活动（如吃饭、走路、洗漱），进行刻意的正念练习。
    - 在这段时间里，将100%的注意力集中于当下的感官体验，不思考过去或未来。
- **练习三：感恩练习**
    - 每天睡前，写下3件当天值得感恩的事情，无论大小。
    - 这个练习能有效地将你的焦点从“匮乏”转向“富足”，从而降低不必要的欲望。

*在坚实的思想操作系统构建完成后，我们将进入全面执行与加速复利的第二阶段。*

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **第二阶段：执行与复利（第三至第四年）—— 部署引擎并加速**

### **2.1 战略概述与目标**

第二阶段的战略核心是从“学习和构建”转向“执行和放大”。我们将在第一阶段搭建的思想操作系统之上，深度融合芒格的防御性智慧与纳瓦尔的进攻性策略。本阶段的目标是在确保风险可控的前提下，将“特殊知识”的价值通过杠杆最大化，实现个人品牌、技能和财富的指数级增长，让各项复利进入显著的加速期。

**阶段性目标：**

- **第三年结束时：** 成功将“特殊知识”转化为至少一个数字产品（MVP），并获得稳定、可持续的现金流。
- **第四年结束时：** 实现媒体、产品、资本等多重杠杆的叠加效应，让财富、技能、声誉的复利曲线开始呈现陡峭上扬的趋势。

### **2.2 进攻加速：从影响力到产品化**

### **2.2.1 规模化杠杆**

将“特殊知识”产品化，是从媒体杠杆升级到代码/产品杠杆的关键一步。在线课程、电子书、模板、SaaS工具等数字产品，其“边际成本趋近于零”，这意味着一旦创造完成，服务100个用户和10000个用户的成本几乎没有差别。这是放大个人价值、摆脱时间限制的最佳方式。根据前两年媒体杠杆积累的用户反馈和痛点洞察，在第三年内，必须创造并发布一个“最小可行产品”（Minimum Viable Product, MVP）。记住纳瓦尔的原则：“如果你不为你的第一个版本感到尴尬，说明你上线得太晚了。”

### **2.2.2 叠加杠杆系统**

单一杠杆的力量是有限的，真正的指数级增长来自于杠杆的叠加。纳瓦尔的杠杆叠加系统形成了一个强大的正反馈循环。第四年的核心任务就是优化这个循环，让产品收入逐渐成为主要的被动或半被动收入来源。

**杠杆叠加路径：** `媒体影响力 (通过持续内容输出，获取精准用户) -> 产品收入 (将影响力转化为可规模化的产品，实现变现) -> 资本积累 (将产品收入进行再投资，或用于扩大再生产) -> 劳动力 (在规模化阶段，可选地雇佣他人来放大你的时间)`

### **2.3 防御护航：系统化决策与风险管理**

### **2.3.1 应用检查清单法**

查理·芒格认为，聪明人之所以犯愚蠢的错误，往往是因为在压力下遗漏了关键的思考步骤。源自航空业的“检查清单法”是对此最有效的防御工具。它强制我们在重大决策前，进行系统、全面的思考。在第三年和第四年，所有个人重大决策（如创业、重大投资、职业转换）都必须强制使用以下通用检查清单。

**个人重大决策通用检查清单：**

- **能力圈检查:** 这个决策是否严格处于我的核心能力圈之内？我是否对所有关键变量都有深度理解？
- **逆向检查:** 假如这个决策的目标是彻底失败，我该怎么做？我是否正在做这些导致失败的事情？
- **激励机制检查:** 我做出这个决策的真实激励是什么？是否存在扭曲我判断的潜在利益？
- **二阶效应检查:** 这个决策的直接后果是什么？“然后呢？”它的间接和长期后果可能是什么？
- **心理偏见检查:** 我是否可能受到社会认同、过度自信、确认偏误或沉没成本等心理倾向的影响？
- **安全边际检查:** 最坏的情况是什么？我能否承受这个最坏情况而“不会致命”？

### **2.3.2 实践安全边际**

“安全边际”是芒格投资哲学的基石，正如他所说：“如果要造一座承重1万吨的桥，我会按照能承重2万吨的标准来设计。” 这个原则同样适用于个人发展，为未知风险和自身判断的错误预留充足的缓冲空间。

- **财务安全边际:** 建立至少6-12个月生活开销的紧急储备金。避免高风险、高利息的消费性负债，确保即使收入中断，生活也不会陷入绝境。
- **职业安全边际:** 发展T型知识结构（一专多能），避免将所有职业前途押注在单一雇主或单一技能上。拥有Plan B，甚至Plan C。
- **项目安全边际:** 在启动任何新项目（如创业、产品开发）时，必须评估最坏情况下的损失，并确保这个损失是你可以承受的，不会导致你“出局”。

### **2.4 全面复利：耐心等待指数增长**

纳瓦尔和芒格都将“复利”视为宇宙中最强大的力量之一。复利不仅适用于财富，更适用于知识、技能和声誉。第二阶段的核心纪律就是“对行动要急，对结果要耐心”，为复利效应的出现提供足够长的时间（`n`），同时通过进攻性策略提升增长率（`r`）。

**攻防结合的复利行动计划**

| 复利领域 | 纳瓦尔的进攻策略 (最大化 `r`) | 芒格的防御纪律 (最大化 `n`) | 组合行动计划 (Year 3-4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **知识复利** | 追随个人好奇心，建立“特殊知识”的深度。 | 跨学科阅读，建立多元思维模型的广度。 | **形成T型知识结构：** 80%时间主攻特殊知识领域，20%时间辅修2-3个其他学科的核心思维模型。 |
| **财富复利** | 利用代码/媒体杠杆创造高增长率的收入来源。 | 避免因愚蠢错误（如投机、高杠杆）而不必要地中断复利过程，耐心持有优质资产。 | 将产品收入的至少50%用于再投资（如指数基金或业务扩张），并坚持长期持有，不做短期择时。 |
| **声誉复利** | 通过媒体持续输出有价值内容，建立鲜明的个人品牌。 | 在每一次互动和交付中都做到绝对的可靠与诚实，不为短期利益损害长期信任。 | 持续输出高质量内容，并对所有承诺（产品质量、服务响应）都超预期交付，建立坚不可摧的长期信任。 |

*在成功部署并加速增长系统后，计划的最后一年将专注于整合、精炼，并达到两大哲学思想协同的最高境界。*

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **第三阶段：整合与飞跃（第五年）—— 实现协同与人生公式**

### **3.1 战略概述与目标**

计划的最后一年，是从“优秀到卓越”的关键飞跃。其战略核心任务不再是构建或执行，而是将前四年分别打磨的进攻与防御系统进行无缝整合，使其从两套独立的工具，内化为一个统一、自洽且高效的个人操作系统。这个阶段的目标是系统性地复盘过去四年的成果，固化个人的“好的人生”公式，并为未来十年的“无限游戏”设定新的航向。

### **3.2 智慧融合：从“攻防兼备”到“浑然一体”**

### **3.2.1 融合“判断力”系统**

纳瓦尔与芒格都将“判断力”置于极高的位置。纳瓦尔的判断力侧重于“知道行动的长期后果”，并强调“在杠杆时代，一个正确的决定可以赢得一切”。而芒格则提供了做出这个正确决定的系统化方法——多元思维模型格栅。二者的融合创造了巨大的协同效应：芒格的体系提供了做出高质量决策的“方法论”，而纳瓦尔的体系则为这个决策提供了“放大器”（杠杆）。

在第五年，你的决策流程应从“刻意使用检查清单”升级为“思维模型成为直觉”。你需要进行至少两次重大决策的复盘，深入分析你的判断力是如何被纳瓦尔的长期主义视角和芒格的跨学科模型共同塑造的，最终达到一种“不假思索的深刻”。

### **3.2.2 融合“幸福”系统**

芒格的智慧在于“避免痛苦”，他通过揭示25个心理倾向，帮助我们避开导致痛苦的认知陷阱，这是幸福的“地基”。纳瓦尔的智慧在于“追求平静”，他通过幸福工程（降低欲望、活在当下）为我们构建幸福的“顶层建筑”。二者结合，形成了一个从“避免负分”到“追求正分”的完整幸福架构。

在第五年，你需要进行一次深度的自我审视，评估自己在摆脱心理陷阱（如社会认同、损失厌恶）和维持内心平静（即使在外部环境动荡时）两方面的能力。基于此，撰写一份个人的“幸福维护手册”，总结出最适合自己的、能够长期坚持的心理和行为习惯。

### **3.3 复盘与展望：定义你的“无限游戏”**

### **3.3.1 评估五年成果**

创建一个全面的复盘框架，诚实地评估过去五年的成长与不足。

**五年计划成果评估表**

| 评估维度 | 目标达成情况 (请填写) | 关键收获与不足 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **知识体系** | T型知识结构的广度与深度如何？是否能熟练运用20个核心思维模型？ |  |
| **财富系统** | 杠杆系统（媒体/产品）的成熟度如何？被动收入占总收入的比例是多少？ |  |
| **决策系统** | 判断力的提升体现在哪些方面？是否成功规避了至少一次重大错误？ |  |
| **幸福系统** | 内心平静的稳定程度如何？应对压力和欲望的能力是否显著提升？ |  |

### **3.3.2 固化个人“好的人生”公式**

基于五年的实践，为这个融合了两大智慧的终极公式赋予你个人化的定义。

`好的人生 = (特殊知识 × 杠杆 × 判断力) × (内心平静 + 避免愚蠢)`

- **特殊知识:** 我的特殊知识是 ______，其市场价值体现在 ______。
- **杠杆:** 我主要的杠杆是 ______，其放大效应为 ______。
- **判断力:** 我的判断力系统体现在 ______，下一个阶段的目标是 ______。
- **内心平静:** 我维持内心平静的核心方法是 ______，稳定性评分为 ______/10。
- **避免愚蠢:** 我最需要警惕的3个心理倾向是 ______，我的防御机制是 ______。

### **3.3.3 设定下一个十年的“无限游戏”**

人生不是一场有限游戏（有明确的终点和赢家），而是一场无限游戏（目标是让游戏永远进行下去）。基于纳瓦尔“玩长期游戏”的理念，在五年计划的终点，为自己设定下一个十年甚至更长时间的“无限游戏”。这个游戏应同时满足纳瓦尔和芒格的严苛标准：

- **正和博弈:** 你的成功不以他人的失败为代价。
- **自带杠杆:** 你的投入可以产生非线性回报。
- **享受过程:** 这件事对你来说是玩，对别人是工作。
- **复利效应:** 随着时间的推移，你的优势会指数级积累。
- **能力圈内:** 它基于你已经建立的“特殊知识”和核心能力。
- **安全边际:** 即使遭遇挫折，也不会让你出局。

### **结论：成为自己人生的船长与工程师**

**1. Sign up for their loyalty programs**.  Every grocery store has  a loyalty program.  Sign up for the program at the customer service counter, online or through their app. 

**2. Earn and Redeem points for your needs.** Grocery stores have everyday points to redeem for free items such as eggs, milk, produce, bakery items and seasonal points to redeem on a free turkey and/or ham. Gas stations and grocery stores may save money off at the gas pump.  

**3.**.  [Cash Back Apps](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/cash-back-apps) \- Back in the day they were called rebates but these apps provide cash back on everyday purchases using uploaded receipts or scanning barcodes of purchased products.

**5.  Make a list based on weekly ads and what you have at home.**  

**6.  Check out the clearance section of your grocery stores.**  Most clearance sections are located in the back of the store.  However some stores have specific locations and/or stickers for cold items. At Giant grocery stores the cold items on clearance are located in the front or back portion of the refrigerated items; reduced produce is usually on a tray and yellow stickers on meat and poultry means a reduced price.  At Safeway look at the ends of the freezer sections for discounted frozen items and the packaged meats and cheeses for reduced deli items.  

**7.  Invest in a food saver.** For less than $100 you can vacuum seal those items you purchased that were a great deal that are able to be frozen.  Examples include meat, poultry, leftovers, and fruits.

1on71j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/G_Gourry/comments/1on71j2/35yearold_corporate_survivors_wakeup_call_a/,35-Year-Old Corporate Survivor’s Wake-Up Call: A Decade of Office Battle Scars Turned Into a 5-Year “Head-Start” Cheat Code,"I’m a 35-year-old corporate grunt with ten years of scars: started in sales, clawed my way to mid-level product manager, jumped three companies, got laid off once, promoted three times, lost half my savings on a dumb crypto bet, and clawed back two down-payments through side hustles. I just read this Naval + Munger 5-year blueprint and it didn’t feel “perfect”—it felt like a mirror. It showed me every pothole I’ve driven into over the last decade and made one thing crystal clear: **I’m not starting from zero. I’ve got ammo—I just never loaded it into a system.**

First the scars, then the tweaks.

**Ten Years of Corporate Blood, Three Lines**

1. **Leverage isn’t handed to you—you steal it.** My first side gig was ghost-writing PPTs for my boss. I turned the decks into templates and sold them to his competitors—$500 overnight. That’s when I learned: the skills you pick up on the clock can cash out after 5 p.m.
2. **Margin of safety isn’t cash—it’s options.** The year I got canned I had 3 months of savings + a trickle of side income + a re-hire offer from the old firm. That’s the only reason I could walk away from a 20 % pay cut. **Options beat a fat bank account.**
3. **Compounding doesn’t start in Year 5—it starts on Day 30.** I was 28 before I tracked a single expense, 30 before I wrote 300 words a day, 32 before my first viral Xiaohongshu post. Every year I delayed, the curve stayed flat.

**My “Corporate Survivor” Edit of the 5-Year Plan**

I’m not a fresh grad, so I’m not starting at “Year 1, Day 1.” My runway is: **existing skill stack + small cash flow + side-hustle embryo.** I’m compressing the whole thing into a **3-year sprint + 2-year cruise**, and the mantra is: **fire the first bullet with the gun you already own.**

**Tweak 1: Year 1 isn’t 20 models—it’s 3 job-site nukes**

- **Incentives**: I already write proposals for my boss. I strip them into templates and sell them on the side (made $2k last quarter).
- **Opportunity cost**: Cap side hustle at 10 hrs/week, kill useless overtime.
- **Inversion**: “How do I get another offer inside 72 hours if I’m let go tomorrow?” → Build a Rolodex (one coffee with a peer every week).

**Why only 3?** I tried 10 and forgot them in 90 days. **Earn with 3, then add #4.**

**Tweak 2: Specific knowledge isn’t “dig”—it’s “autopsy”**

No three-circle exercise. I open my 10-year work diary and ask:

- Which 3 decks made the boss’s eyes light up? → **PPT logic + data storytelling**
- Which 3 side gigs actually paid? → **Notion templates + Xiaohongshu traffic**

**My specific knowledge = “Helping corporate drones run projects in Notion + teaching logic on Xiaohongshu.”**

→ Month 1: template live at $15, 50 sales already.

**Tweak 3: Leverage isn’t “built in 30 days”—it’s “stolen in 30 days”**

- **Media lever**: No new platform. I spam “weekly takeaway” screenshots in my company WeChat group + Moments. Three weeks, 200 targeted followers.
- **Product lever**: Don’t wait for MVP—pre-sell 1-on-1 coaching ($15/hr). Use the calls to iterate the template.
- **Capital lever**: First dollar in → straight to an index fund. No 50 % reinvest rule yet.

**Tweak 4: Happiness engineering isn’t “meditate”—it’s “delete”**

20-minute meditation? I fall asleep.

**My version**: Kill one useless group chat every week + cap myself at one show.

→ 10 hrs reclaimed, enough for 5 posts.

**Tweak 5: Checklist isn’t 6 bullets—it’s one Post-it**

I printed an A4 and taped it to my monitor:

1. Inside my circle?

2. Worst-case loss I can eat?

3. Someone already paying?

→ 10-second scan before any move.

**My 3-Year Sprint Timeline**

| **Year** | **Goal** | **Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Year 1** | Side hustle hits $1.5k/mo | 99 × 100 template sales + 99 × 50 coaching hrs |

| **Year 3** | Quit OR go remote | Passive covers rent → options unlocked |

Naval Ravikant’s Offense + Charlie Munger’s Defense: My 5-Year Blueprint to Build Anti-Fragile Wealth (2024-2029)

# **TL;DR**

- **Years 1-2**: Install a rock-solid Mental OS—master Munger’s 20 mental models, ID your “specific knowledge,” spin up daily media leverage, and lock in inner peace habits.
- **Years 3-4**: Productize your specific knowledge, stack media → product → capital levers, run every big bet through Munger’s checklist + margin of safety.
- **Year 5**: Fuse judgment + happiness into reflex; retro the 5 years; define your 10-year “infinite game.”
- **End State**: Knowledge, cash-flow, reputation, and calm compounding at 30%+ YoY with zero catastrophic errors.

# **Introduction: An Attack-and-Defense Life OS**

This plan is a five-year personal development blueprint. Its core idea is to fuse the wisdom of two intellectual giants to build a “1+1>3,” attack-and-defense life operating system. We treat **Naval Ravikant’s** philosophy as a powerful **offense and happiness system**—maximizing personal uniqueness, using leverage for exponential wealth growth, and ultimately achieving inner peace. At the same time, we treat **Charlie Munger’s** thinking as an unbreakable **defense and judgment system**—using multidisciplinary mental models and deep insight into human psychological biases to avoid major mistakes and make rational decisions.

If life is compared to a high-risk voyage full of unknowns, **Munger** is like an experienced captain who provides us with a “map and compass” to navigate storms—rational thinking frameworks and risk-management tools. **Naval** is like a genius engineer who installs a “nuclear-power engine and points out the destination” for the ship—leverage systems for financial freedom and happiness engineering toward inner peace. The ultimate mission of this plan is, under the premise of ensuring navigational safety (defense), to maximize speed and efficiency (offense), systematically internalize the wisdom of both masters, and thereby construct a complete, powerful, and risk-resilient “good life” formula.

# **Phase I: Foundation Building (Years 1-2) — Install the Mental Operating System**

**1.1 Strategy Overview & Goals**

The first phase is the cornerstone of the entire five-year plan. Its strategic core is to build a powerful underlying **Mental Operating System**. These two years are not about pursuing immediate results but about laying a rock-solid foundation for the exponential growth of the next three years. This phase runs on dual tracks:

- On one side, systematically absorb Charlie Munger’s defensive wisdom to establish rational decision guardrails and avoid catastrophic errors caused by “man-with-a-hammer syndrome” and cognitive biases.
- On the other side, launch Naval’s offensive practice—through deep self-exploration, identify your one-of-a-kind **specific knowledge** and begin building a **permissionless leverage** tool.

**Milestone Goals**

- **End of Year 1**: Establish a core multidisciplinary mental model lattice and clearly identify the strategic direction of your personal “specific knowledge.”
- **End of Year 2**: Proficiently apply Munger’s defensive thinking tools (e.g., circle-of-competence evaluation, psychological-tendency recognition) and initially build a media leverage that continuously produces value.

**1.2 Munger Defense System: Build Rational Decision Guardrails**

**1.2.1 Establish the Multidisciplinary Mental Model Lattice**

Charlie Munger repeatedly emphasized that a single-discipline thinking mode is extremely dangerous. As he said: **“To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.”** This “man-with-a-hammer tendency” causes us to distort reality to fit our limited models, leading to catastrophic decisions. To overcome this flaw, we must build a **multidisciplinary mental model lattice** composed of core models from different major disciplines. This lattice is like an interwoven fishing net that captures the complexity of the real world, allowing us to view problems stereoscopically from multiple dimensions.

**Two-Year Learning Plan**

**Year 1: Focus on mastering the 5 most important core models**

- **Compound Interest**: “Understanding the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding many things.”
- **Incentives**: “Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.”
- **Opportunity Cost**: Core insight: The true cost of any decision is the value of the best alternative forgone.
- **Second-Order Thinking**: Core insight: Continuously ask “And then what? And then what?” to foresee the chain reactions of decisions.
- **Inversion**: “Invert, always invert. I just want to know where I’ll die, so I’ll never go there.”

**Year 2: Expand to the remaining 15 core models**

- **Math/Physics**: Critical mass, backup systems, scale advantages/disadvantages, breaking points.
- **Biology/Psychology**: Social proof, natural selection, System 1 vs System 2 thinking, Pavlovian association.
- **Economics/Business**: Supply/demand, moats, network effects, diminishing marginal utility.
- **Systems Thinking**: Feedback loops, Pareto principle (80/20), edge-case testing, false dichotomy.

**1.2.2 Define Circle of Competence & Identify Psychological Tendencies**

**Circle of Competence**: This is Munger’s core defensive strategy. Its essence is **“know what you know, know what you don’t.”** Success is not about knowing a lot, but about clearly knowing what you don’t know and strictly staying within the areas you truly understand. Inside your circle, you have information and judgment advantages; once outside, you become “leeks to be cut.”

**Personal Circle of Competence Assessment & Action Plan**

| **Core Assessment Criterion** | **Personal Assessment & Action Plan (please fill in)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Depth of Understanding**: Can I explain the core logic, key variables, and business model of this field to a 10-year-old child? |  |
| **Experience Validation**: Do I have deep practical experience in this field and have I gone through a complete market cycle? (e.g., >5 years of practice and witnessed industry ups and downs?) |  |
| **Predictive Ability**: Can I relatively accurately predict the trends and potential risks in this field over the next 5–10 years? |  |
| **Failure Scenario Analysis**: Do I clearly know under what circumstances decisions in this field will fail? |  |

**Cognitive Trap Radar (Psychological Tendencies)**: Munger summarized 25 inherent human psychological tendencies—these are systematic “software bugs” in our brains and the main reason smart people make stupid mistakes. Identifying these tendencies is like installing a **cognitive trap radar** in your mind, scanning and avoiding them before decisions.

**Year 2 focus training on recognizing the 10 most critical psychological tendencies**:

1. **Incentive-caused bias**: Beware how self-interest and others’ interests distort judgment.
2. **Social proof tendency**: Avoid blindly following the crowd just because “everyone is doing it.”
3. **Confirmation bias**: Actively seek evidence that opposes your view, not just supporting information.
4. **Loss aversion tendency**: Recognize that the pain of loss is disproportionately amplified; avoid irrational decisions because of it.
5. **Sunk-cost fallacy**: Decisions should be based only on the future, not on unrecoverable past investments.
6. **Overconfidence tendency**: Always assume you might be wrong; stay humble.
7. **Contrast misreaction tendency**: Beware traps of relative comparison like price anchors; focus on absolute value.
8. **Availability misjudgment tendency**: Don’t let media-hyped, easily recalled events mislead probability judgment; look at statistics.
9. **Doubt-avoidance tendency**: Embrace uncertainty; avoid hasty conclusions just to quickly eliminate doubt.
10. **Reciprocity tendency**: Beware the psychological pressure to return even small favors.

**1.3 Naval Offense System: Mine Specific Knowledge & Launch Leverage**

**1.3.1 Mine Personal “Specific Knowledge”**

According to Naval’s wealth equation **Wealth = Specific Knowledge × Leverage × Judgment**, **specific knowledge** is the core fuel driving the wealth engine. It is not ordinary knowledge obtainable through training, but the intersection of personal talent, passion, and unique experience. Specific knowledge makes you irreplaceable, thus commanding high-value returns in the market.

**“Three-Circle Intersection Method” Mining Exercise (complete within Year 1)**: Answer the following questions to find the intersection of talent, passion, and market demand.

1. **Circle 1: Talent (What are you good at?)**
    - What do you do effortlessly that others find difficult?
    - In which field do you seem to outperform those around you without effort?
    - What do people often praise you for or ask you about?
    - Looking back at childhood, what were you naturally interested in and talented at?
2. **Circle 2: Passion (What do you love?)**
    - What feels like play to you but work to others?
    - What would you do for free on weekends or holidays?
    - When do you enter a “flow” state and forget the passage of time?
    - If money were no object, how would you choose to spend your life?
3. **Circle 3: Market Demand (What does the world need?)**
    - What are people complaining about? (Complaints = unmet needs)
    - Which industries or fields are growing rapidly?
    - What problem have you already solved for yourself that many others might have?

**Define your specific knowledge direction (one clear sentence)**:

I help ______ (target users) solve ______ (problem) through ______ (my unique method).

**1.3.2 Launch “Permissionless Leverage”**

Naval points out that exponential wealth growth requires leverage. Among the four types of leverage (labor, capital, code, media), **code** and **media** are the most powerful **permissionless leverages** of this era—you don’t need a boss or investor’s approval to start building them. For most people, starting with media leverage is the lowest-cost, fastest-to-launch path.

**【30-Day Leverage Build Plan】**

**Phase 1: Days 1-10 (Build Media Leverage Foundation)**

- **Task 1: Choose Platform**
    - Per Naval: “Pick one main platform and go deep. Don’t do 5 platforms at once; it scatters energy.”
    - **Action**: Register on your chosen main platform (e.g., blog, WeChat public account, Zhihu, X/Twitter) today and publish your first piece of content.
- **Task 2: Define Your “Unique Combination”**
    - The key is not “one-of-a-kind” but “combination-unique.”
    - Example: You’re not “the only one who understands AI,” but you might be one of the few who “understands AI + education + content creation”—that’s your specific knowledge.
    - **Action**: Clearly define your unique combination and create content around it.
- **Task 3: Start Daily Output**
    - Commit to publishing at least one valuable piece of content daily.
    - Use Naval’s recommended content templates:
        - “Learned today: ____________ (one specific insight)”
        - “Used to think X, now I think Y because Z”
        - “Tool rec: X because it solved Y for me”

**Phase 2: Days 11-20 (Build Content Flywheel)**

- **Task 4: Seek Resonance**
    - Naval’s strategy: “Don’t chase traffic; chase resonance. 1,000 true fans > 100,000 passers-by.”
    - **Action**: Observe data, analyze which content gets the most engagement, then amplify similar content.
- **Task 5: Build Feedback Loop**
    - Actively reply to comments, ask the audience questions, understand their real needs. This forms a positive feedback loop: output content → get feedback → optimize content → more attention → more feedback → exponential growth.
- **Task 6: Distill “Golden Nuggets”**
    - Weekly summarize your most valuable content and compress it into one-sentence golden nuggets. Good content deserves repeated sharing.

**Phase 3: Days 21-30 (From Media to Product)**

- **Task 7: Identify Pain Points**
    - Through interactions with followers, identify the most urgent pain points they repeatedly mention.
- **Task 8: Create Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
    - Remember Naval’s principle: “If you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late.”
    - **Action**: Create a simple digital product to solve the user’s core pain point, e.g.:
        - **Level 1 (easiest)**: PDF template/checklist, Notion template.
        - **Level 2 (medium)**: 1-on-1 consulting, small community.
        - **Level 3 (hardest)**: Online course, SaaS tool.
- **Task 9: Stack Leverage**
    - Use your established media influence to acquire users, monetize through products, reinvest revenue (capital leverage), and ultimately form a powerful, multi-leverage wealth system.

**1.4 Happiness Engineering Foundation: Build Inner Peace**

Introducing Naval’s **happiness engineering** early in the personal development plan is crucial. It is not a luxury after financial freedom but the core energy source of the entire system. A person with inner peace can make more rational judgments and have the endurance to persist long-term. Naval’s happiness formula is **Happiness = Reality – Expectations**. Compared to the slow and uncontrollable process of improving reality, actively managing and lowering expectations is a faster, more reliable path to inner peace.

**Daily Practice Plan Throughout the First Two Years**

- **Practice 1: Daily Meditation**
    - Start with 5 minutes daily, focusing on observing your breath.
    - Goal: Stabilize at 15–20 minutes daily by the end of Year 1, training the ability to observe thoughts without being controlled by them.
- **Practice 2: Live in the Present**
    - Choose one daily activity (e.g., eating, walking, brushing teeth) for deliberate mindfulness practice.
    - During this time, focus 100% attention on the present sensory experience; do not think about the past or future.
- **Practice 3: Gratitude Practice**
    - Every night before bed, write down 3 things you’re grateful for that day, big or small.
    - This practice effectively shifts your focus from “scarcity” to “abundance,” thereby reducing unnecessary desires.

After the solid Mental Operating System is built, we will enter the second phase of full execution and compound acceleration.

# **Phase II: Execution & Compounding (Years 3-4) — Deploy Engines and Accelerate**

**2.1 Strategy Overview & Goals**

The strategic core of the second phase is to shift from “learning and building” to “execution and amplification.” We will deeply integrate Munger’s defensive wisdom and Naval’s offensive strategy on top of the Mental OS built in Phase I. The goal of this phase is to maximize the value of “specific knowledge” through leverage while keeping risks controllable, achieving exponential growth in personal brand, skills, and wealth, and letting all compounding effects enter a significant acceleration period.

**Milestone Goals**

- **End of Year 3**: Successfully transform “specific knowledge” into at least one digital product (MVP) and achieve stable, sustainable cash flow.
- **End of Year 4**: Achieve stacking effects of media, product, capital, and other leverages, causing the compounding curves of wealth, skills, and reputation to show a steep upward trend.

**2.2 Offense Acceleration: From Influence to Productization**

**2.2.1 Scale Leverage**

Productizing “specific knowledge” is the key step from media leverage to code/product leverage. Online courses, e-books, templates, SaaS tools, and other digital products have **near-zero marginal cost**—meaning once created, the cost of serving 100 users vs. 10,000 users is almost the same. This is the best way to amplify personal value and break free from time constraints. Based on user feedback and pain point insights accumulated from the media leverage of the first two years, **a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) must be created and launched in Year 3**. Remember Naval’s principle: **“If you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late.”**

**2.2.2 Stack Leverage System**

The power of a single leverage is limited; true exponential growth comes from **leveraging stacking**. Naval’s leverage stacking system forms a powerful positive feedback loop. The core task of Year 4 is to optimize this loop, gradually making product revenue the main passive or semi-passive income source.

**Leverage Stacking Path**:

Media influence (through continuous content output, acquire precise users) → Product revenue (turn influence into scalable products, achieve monetization) → Capital accumulation (reinvest product revenue or expand production) → Labor (in the scaling phase, optionally hire others to amplify your time)

**2.3 Defense Escort: Systematize Decisions & Risk Management**

**2.3.1 Apply the Checklist Method**

Charlie Munger believes that smart people make stupid mistakes often because they omit key thinking steps under pressure. The **checklist method** from aviation is the most effective defensive tool against this. It forces us to think systematically and comprehensively before major decisions. In Years 3 and 4, **all major personal decisions (e.g., starting a business, major investments, career changes) must mandatorily use the following universal checklist**.

**Universal Checklist for Major Personal Decisions**

- **Circle of Competence Check**: Is this decision strictly within my core circle of competence? Do I have deep understanding of all key variables?
- **Inversion Check**: If the goal of this decision were to fail completely, what would I do? Am I doing those things that lead to failure?
- **Incentives Check**: What is the real incentive for me to make this decision? Is there potential interest distorting my judgment?
- **Second-Order Effects Check**: What are the direct consequences of this decision? “And then what?” What might be the indirect and long-term consequences?
- **Psychological Bias Check**: Am I possibly influenced by social proof, overconfidence, confirmation bias, or sunk-cost fallacy?
- **Margin of Safety Check**: What is the worst case? Can I withstand the worst case without it being “fatal”?

**2.3.2 Practice Margin of Safety**

**Margin of safety** is the cornerstone of Munger’s investment philosophy. As he said: **“If I’m going to build a bridge to hold 10,000 tons, I’ll design it to hold 20,000 tons.”** This principle applies equally to personal development, leaving ample buffer for unknown risks and errors in one’s own judgment.

- **Financial Margin of Safety**: Build an emergency reserve of at least 6–12 months of living expenses. Avoid high-risk, high-interest consumer debt to ensure that even if income is interrupted, life will not fall into desperation.
- **Career Margin of Safety**: Develop a T-shaped knowledge structure (one specialty, multiple abilities) to avoid betting all career prospects on a single employer or single skill. Have Plan B, even Plan C.
- **Project Margin of Safety**: When starting any new project (e.g., entrepreneurship, product development), must evaluate the loss in the worst case and ensure that this loss is bearable and will not “knock you out.”

**2.4 Full Compounding: Patiently Await Exponential Growth**

Both Naval and Munger regard **compounding** as one of the most powerful forces in the universe. Compounding applies not only to wealth but also to knowledge, skills, and reputation. The core discipline of Phase II is **“be impatient with actions, patient with results”**, providing enough time (n) for compounding effects to emerge while increasing the growth rate (r) through offensive strategies.

**Attack-Defense Combined Compounding Action Plan**

| **Compounding Domain** | **Naval’s Offense Strategy (maximize r)** | **Munger’s Defense Discipline (maximize n)** | **Combined Action Plan (Years 3-4)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Knowledge Compounding** | Follow personal curiosity to build depth in “specific knowledge.” | Cross-disciplinary reading to build breadth in the multidisciplinary model lattice. | Form T-shaped knowledge structure: 80% time on specific knowledge domain, 20% time on core mental models from 2-3 other disciplines. |
| **Wealth Compounding** | Use code/media leverage to create high-growth-rate income sources. | Avoid unnecessary interruptions to compounding due to stupid mistakes (e.g., speculation, high leverage); patiently hold quality assets. | Reinvest at least 50% of product revenue (e.g., index funds or business expansion) and hold long-term without short-term timing. |
| **Reputation Compounding** | Continuously output valuable content via media to build a distinct personal brand. | Be absolutely reliable and honest in every interaction and delivery; do not damage long-term trust for short-term gains. | Continuously output high-quality content and over-deliver on all promises (product quality, service response) to build unbreakable long-term trust. |

After successfully deploying and accelerating the growth system, the final year of the plan will focus on integration, refinement, and achieving the highest synergy of the two philosophical thoughts.

# **Phase III: Integration & Leap (Year 5) — Achieve Synergy and Life Formula**

**3.1 Strategy Overview & Goals**

The final year of the plan is the critical leap from “excellent to extraordinary.” Its strategic core task is no longer building or executing, but seamlessly integrating the offense and defense systems polished over the previous four years, internalizing them from two separate toolsets into a unified, self-consistent, and efficient personal operating system. The goals of this phase are to systematically review the results of the past four years, solidify your personal “good life” formula, and set a new course for the “infinite game” of the next decade.

**3.2 Wisdom Fusion: From “Attack-Defense Combined” to “Seamlessly Integrated”**

**3.2.1 Fuse the “Judgment” System**

Both Naval and Munger place **judgment** at the highest level. Naval’s judgment focuses on **“knowing the long-term consequences of actions”** and emphasizes **“in the leverage era, one correct decision can win everything.”** Munger provides a systematized method to make that correct decision—the multidisciplinary mental model lattice. The fusion of the two creates huge synergy: Munger’s system provides the **methodology** for making high-quality decisions, while Naval’s system provides the **amplifier** (leverage) for that decision.

In Year 5, your decision-making process should upgrade from “deliberately using checklists” to **“mental models become intuition.”** You need to conduct at least two post-mortems of major decisions, deeply analyzing how your judgment was shaped jointly by Naval’s long-termism perspective and Munger’s cross-disciplinary models, ultimately achieving a **“profound without thinking.”**

**3.2.2 Fuse the “Happiness” System**

Munger’s wisdom lies in **“avoiding pain”**—by revealing 25 psychological tendencies, he helps us avoid cognitive traps that lead to pain; this is the **foundation** of happiness. Naval’s wisdom lies in **“pursuing peace”**—through happiness engineering (reducing desires, living in the present), he builds the **superstructure** of happiness. Combined, they form a complete happiness architecture from **“avoiding negative points”** to **“pursuing positive points.”**

In Year 5, you need to conduct a deep self-examination, evaluating your ability in two aspects: escaping psychological traps (e.g., social proof, loss aversion) and maintaining inner peace (even when the external environment is turbulent). Based on this, write a personal **“Happiness Maintenance Manual”**, summarizing the psychological and behavioral habits most suitable for you that can be sustained long-term.

**3.3 Review & Outlook: Define Your “Infinite Game”**

**3.3.1 Evaluate Five-Year Results**

Create a comprehensive review framework to honestly assess the growth and shortcomings of the past five years.

**Five-Year Plan Results Evaluation Table**

| **Evaluation Dimension** | **Target Achievement (please fill in)** | **Key Wins & Gaps** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Knowledge System** | How are the breadth and depth of the T-shaped knowledge structure? Can you proficiently use 20 core mental models? |  |
| **Wealth System** | How mature is the leverage system (media/product)? What percentage of total income is passive income? |  |
| **Decision System** | In what ways has judgment improved? Have you successfully avoided at least one major mistake? |  |
| **Happiness System** | How stable is inner peace? Has the ability to cope with stress and desires significantly improved? |  |

**3.3.2 Solidify Your Personal “Good Life” Formula**

Based on five years of practice, give this ultimate formula fusing the two wisdoms your personalized definition.

**Good Life = (Specific Knowledge × Leverage × Judgment) × (Inner Peace + Avoid Stupidity)**

- **Specific Knowledge**: My specific knowledge is ______, its market value is reflected in ______.
- **Leverage**: My main leverage is ______, its amplification effect is ______.
- **Judgment**: My judgment system is reflected in ______, the next phase goal is ______.
- **Inner Peace**: My core method for maintaining inner peace is ______, stability score _____/10.
- **Avoid Stupidity**: The 3 psychological tendencies I need to be most vigilant about are ______, my defense mechanism is ______.

**3.3.3 Set the Next Decade’s “Infinite Game”**

Life is not a finite game (with a clear endpoint and winner) but an **infinite game** (the goal is to keep the game going forever). Based on Naval’s “play long-term games” philosophy, at the end of the five-year plan, set your **infinite game** for the next decade or even longer. This game must simultaneously meet the stringent standards of both Naval and Munger:

- **Positive-sum**: Your success does not come at the expense of others’ failure.
- **Built-in leverage**: Your input can produce non-linear returns.
- **Enjoy the process**: This is play to you, work to others.
- **Compounding effect**: Over time, your advantages accumulate exponentially.
- **Within circle of competence**: It is based on your established “specific knowledge” and core abilities.
- **Margin of safety**: Even if you encounter setbacks, it will not knock you out.

# **Conclusion: Become the Captain and Engineer of Your Own Life**

These five years are a journey of internalizing external wisdom into intrinsic ability. Through systematic planning and practice, you have successfully fused **Charlie Munger**, the “captain’s” prudence and foresight, with **Naval Ravikant**, the “engineer’s” innovation and drive, into one. Now, you not only have the ability to sail the ship of life at high speed, but also the wisdom to avoid risks and move forward steadily in stormy seas. You have become the captain and engineer of your own life, able to safely, quickly, and calmly sail toward the ideal shore.

Set sail—your infinite game has only just begun.

I work part-time at a coffee shop, and today was one of those mornings. Rush hour, espresso machine screaming, people yelling mobile orders over each other. A guy comes up, super polite, orders a cappuccino, and hands me his card. I run it through, and the machine beeps, that ominous “declined” sound.

So I tell him, “Sorry sir, your card didn’t go through.”

He looks confused, tries again. Same sound. I shrug and say, “Yeah, looks like it’s declined.”

He sighs, takes out his phone, opens his banking app, and shows me a perfectly healthy balance. That’s when my coworker leans over and says, “Uh, that beep means approved.”

I’d spent the entire morning telling half the city their cards were declined. People probably think I was judging them for being broke.

TL;DR: Misinterpreted the payment machine’s beep sound and told multiple customers their cards were declined when they weren’t.",0,1762160933.0,tifu,4,0.17,False

Why a Cash Challenge?
Using cash is one of the simplest, most effective ways to push back against the march toward an all-digital financial system. Over the next 60 days, pay with cash as often as possible when buying groceries, coffee, when eating out, or with purchases from your local brick-and-mortar merchants.

Beyond using cash whenever possible, consider taking some time to raise awareness about using cash and why it’s important to do so.

It is critically important to preserve cash as a cornerstone of financial freedom and privacy.

Whenever I take Magnesium or a multivitamin syrup or pill, I get so tired that I have to lay down and then I fall asleep. Like physically and mentally, I become exhausted. 

The label on the Magnesium says it's for energy, so I don't understand why it's making me sleepy.

Sugary foods, coffee, and energy drinks don't help whatsoever. 

Does anyone else experience this?

I have considered that I may be anemic / low iron, which may be aggravating my sleepiness. I'm a lot more tired during 'that' time of the month as well.

I eat plenty of meat and animal products and am not on birth control, so not even sure why/how I'm low in iron, however I experience the symptoms.

I’m f40 and my whole life has been like a fucking fever dream. 

I resigned from my job a few months ago because I went through a lot of mental exhaustion, in a car accident and been incredibly sick and on top of that, management were not supportive at all and didn’t really see me as a human being. I decided to leave that place so I could give myself a break before I start working somewhere else, I now cannot find a job anywhere, I constantly get rejected, I have zero money to my name, no car, no driving license and I live with my parents who are both super narcissistic. I’m just so incredibly drained from everything going on and there’s nothing I feel I can do about it. I also don’t have any friends, no partner. I have no support in my life and it’s really fucking painful. I can’t even remember the last time I had a hug from someone. I can’t do the things I like anymore, can’t get my nails done can’t get my hair done or get fancy coffee etc, I used to be able to do all that for myself and treat myself. I don’t feel like myself anymore, I have quite a feminine personality so I like doing all of those girly things. I’m trying my absolute best to apply to every damn job in any sector, I spend most of my waking hours applying for jobs and it’s driving me up the wall. 

The past few weeks I have either been sleeping throughout the entire day and night or not sleeping at all for days at a time. Two nights ago I slept for around 32 hours, my mum came to check on me and she thought I was just coming down with some sort of sickness, I woke up once or twice to shut my window because it got cold

I don’t wanna do this anymore. I don’t know where to start and I don’t know when this cycle will end. I completely give up. 

I’d really appreciate some nice words from you guys or if you could give me any advice on what I should do. The truth is I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this",14,1762160233.0,confession,19,0.71,False

M 39 in Ireland here. I have had an overly busy weekend of travel and being social and juggling childcare and generally racing around… I am finally home and I’m on the couch, with zero plans to move for the day. It is my ideal day to maybe make a new friend or two.

A little bit about me: I love to read, mainly old school fantasy things lately. There is nothing better than being halfway through a book and knowing that there are 10 more of them to come. I am open to any genre with a recommendation, and have been trying to mix it up more of late. Let me know if there is anything I should add to my list?

I am mostly to be found with a coffee in my hand, but I am far from a snob about it. As long as it is hot and refills are available, I am sold. 

I watch a lot of sports, mainly football, rugby and NFL. Like everybody, I watch a lot of TV shows. Slow horses is the best thing on TV at the moment, with celebrity traitors coming in at a close second. I know, that surprised me too.

My life is generally busy. Wife, kids, Work, general adult commitments… I feel like I don’t have the free time to keep up the social side of my life, so I am hoping that I can find somebody to chat with who is in the same boat.

For context I’m a SAHM. I do get an income from IHSS because my oldest son has a disability. I’m his primary caretaker, I do therapy 2 hours a day with him everyday but Sunday. While also going through the process of my second son who’s having behaviors issues in school(I suspect adhd like his father), so also now in counseling, therapy, in the process of getting a diagnosis or getting him an IEP. I also get an income from special media as well. And I can’t drive. I don’t know how to drive. 

My children’s father works full time, 8-4 pm. He works long hours and takes the kids to, and from school, I acknowledge how hard it is to work like that. He has an office job and his boss can be quite overwhelming so I understand his stressors. 
Especially given he has to pick the kids up from school since our son with a disability physically can’t go in the school bus, and we’ve been through trying it’s just hard.
So we opted to just have his dad drive him. 

I basically take care of managing the finances my S/O sends me because he has ADHD and bipolar, he also acknowledges he gets a dopamine and will spend money on food, and things that bring him momentary gratification. So he agreed overtime in our relationship to send me the money to pay the bills, and navigate how to do this while still having roll over money if I can. And I’ve done that. The car we got was because I managed to save over 9k, and we were able to pay the car in full. 
I bring this up because money and time has a big reason to why I’m upset but I don’t think he sees it this way. 

So, the father of my kids wants to do this trip with his brother who’s leaving the military, and road trip back home to welcome him back. They’ve been talking about it for half a year, but nothing had been confirmed. I didn’t have an issue with it at all, I’m used to my now ex partner taking working trips for 2-3 weeks, so a week trip with his brother would be easy.

The problem that started to arise for me is over time, during the last few months, I’d say starting August-September, he was really pressuring me about finding part time job now that both my kids are in school. I don’t have a problem with that, but it’s the way he’s gone about it with me. He’s called me selfish for not driving(I don’t drive because he has stated it cost money for insurance, another car, gas, etc). Or he just hasn’t wanted to teach me because he’s been tired from work. I get that. But I have tried on my own, with my sister but I’m at the mercy of everyone’s schedule and time and my own with my kids but I have tried. I’ve even been in two minor accidents but I’m still attempting to learn. And classes are out the window because my ex would say it cost too much money.

So during September he would argue with me about finances, which was odd because I didn’t feel behind at all but he would tell me he’s stressed, I truly don’t understand why, and where our money was going at some point. How we were short, then I found out he’s been spending at least 300+$ on just food for himself monthly or things he wants. 300$ is the minimum I found. I didn’t even check for previous months. 

I got upset because I have used my birthday money, holiday money, to use to save and make sure we have more than enough, I do social media, I have my IHSS income, and honestly it should be more than enough and extra, but I’m finding out he’s spending on himself for games, food, new clothes, etc while complaining we don’t have enough. He was keeping money for himself without me knowing. 

Then comes the trip with his brother.
We’ve had these arguments where he says I’m selfish, I don’t do enough, I NEED to get another job to ease his stress but then he spends money for himself. He’s told me we can’t do certain things as a family because “gas is too expensive”, we “just don’t have the money”, and I always have to agree. I always sacrifice, I always have to say okay maybe next time. But now, his brother last month finally said okay let’s do this. 
I told my partner how upset it made me. 
Then his brother canceled because of the government shut down.

At this point it was canceled indefinitely. 
Then, my brother in law was able to get the time and it’s back on as of a week ago.
And my now ex is saying he deserves this trip.
I tell him how unfair it is of him to say we can’t do things as a family, he “cant get the days off” to be with us, we “don’t have money” or to not stress him about money and telling me to get another job, and do night shifts, but
All of a sudden he has 4 days off? he has money for a 300$ ticket? Not including a hotel, and driving back from Kansas to California? 

I brought up who’s going to take both ours kids to school?
How hypothetically if I did get a part time job, would we manage days like this last week where both my kids have HFM disease and I can’t work, I have to watch them and they can’t go to school.
What about summer/winter breaks? If I’m working part time and him full time, we have to get a sitter now? When I was home?

He basically told me, he knows he’s being a hypocrite about the money and time. He is still doing the trip, and I have to basically figure it out.
Am I over reacting wanting him to cancel? I think it’s so unfair that I do everything’s
I manage the money (that I knew about) and how the bills get paid, I do the therapy, I DO MAKE MONEY. I’m here for the summer and winter breaks.  I truly don’t spend money for myself. I cook, I clean. I’m on call for telehealth sessions for my sons, and in person therapy. We do both. I’m on call when the nurse calls me because my son with a disability did something or my youngest needs new clothes or whatever. I’m always here doing sometimes. Then I make social media content, edit and get money from there too. Shit, tomorrow I have an appointment for my youngest at 11am, and I’m thinking 
How does he expect me to get more work, and do all this? He’s only ever done two therapy sessions for our son and he was falling asleep during one.

I feel like I’m not being appreciate and his trip is selfish. I feel like I’m being overworked and that’s not to say I don’t understand why he wants do to the trip. We have two sons, I think it’s nice to do a trip like that with your brother.
I want to be supportive, and I feel I’ve done everything I can to do so. 
Where he lost me is saying I don’t do enough, I need to do more and figure it out. He admitted to me he understands it’s hypocritical but he’s still doing it. He literally said that to me. He said he’s sorry I get it’s wrong but I’m still doing it. 
I’m at my wits end. I’m tired. I’m always so busy. My day with my sons and everything doesn’t end until 8-9pm and he tells me to find a night shift.
I feel like I’m drowning, and it’s honestly insulting he tells me I can’t buy for me, I can’t get myself an iced coffee because it’s too much. He gave me shit for a 2.99 rush hour 2 rental 3 days ago.
I feel like he doesn’t appreciate everything I do and he still wants more.

I am looking for a new machine, either a SBDU or HX machine, that fits into this area. I am currently not using the entire space as the short GCP allows me to even place it in an angle which would be impossible with most deeper machines, so I would have to place them straight and right against the kitchenette back wall. 

I am looking for a robust, really well-built machine with higher quality materials than my GCP. I am generally open to both ring group and E61, however, I feel that a sleeker, more modern design fits better into my apartment. Machines like the Rocket Appartamento TCA or the Profitec Go would fit well design-wise. The look of the machine is important too as I have to look at it several times a day for ideally many many years to come.

I usually drink 2-3 espressi/day and a cappuccino sometimes on weekdays but usually always on a weekend. I'd say overall it's 70% espresso vs. 30% milk-based drink. I usually make coffee for myself but at occasion for my partner who always has a milk-based drink. It's usually medium and dark roast beans.

I am not a fan of the 'mirror' chrome of the likes of ECM machines but like the satin/brushed metal of the e.g. Profitec Jump or the TCA. 

Where I live we often times have only one distributor per brand so I am quite locked in on where to buy the machines. I have prepared a table with the converted machine prices. For ECM machines, the Classika PID is almost as expensive as their HX machines, this is due to taxation for different types of coffee machines.

The Profitec Go sounds like a solid replacement for the GCP as it improves most of the things that I value, but I wonder if I should consider a HX machine with a small footprint instead? I am not sure if my palate would pick up on a temperature deviation of 2-3 degrees, heck I've been making espressos on my unmodified GCP temp surfboard which I consider tasty. So I wonder if a HX machine would offer better quality in terms of functionalities, design and overall built quality? I don't need a super fast heat-up time but at the same time I am not willing to wait 30 or 40 minutes for it to heat up.

I have had an overly busy weekend of travel and being social and juggling childcare and generally racing around… I am finally home and I’m on the couch, with zero plans to move for the day. It is my ideal day to maybe make a new friend or two.

A little bit about me: I love to read, mainly old school fantasy things lately. There is nothing better than being halfway through a book and knowing that there are 10 more of them to come. I am open to any genre with a recommendation, and have been trying to mix it up more of late. Let me know if there is anything I should add to my list?

I am mostly to be found with a coffee in my hand, but I am far from a snob about it. As long as it is hot and refills are available, I am sold. 

I watch a lot of sports, mainly football, rugby and NFL. Like everybody, I watch a lot of TV shows. Slow horses is the best thing on TV at the moment, with celebrity traitors coming in at a close second. I know, that surprised me too.

My life is generally busy. Wife, kids, Work, general adult commitments… I feel like I don’t have the free time to keep up the social side of my life, so I am hoping that I can find somebody to chat with who is in the same boat. 

If you are 30+, chatty, interested in people, and you think we might click, I would love to hear from you. Shoot me a message and see! ",1,1762159999.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

My dad (64M) and I were having coffee last weekend when he randomly said, “I need to tell you something.”

He told me that when I was 8, he almost left. He had packed a bag, drove halfway out of town, and stopped at a gas station. He said he felt like he couldn’t handle the pressure of raising two kids and working nonstop.

He never told my mom. He just came back home, unpacked quietly, and never left again.

He cried when he said, “I’m sorry. I almost walked out on you.”

I didn’t even know how to respond. He’s been a good dad my whole life. He stayed. He’s always stayed.

But now I see every tired look, every hug, every late-night drive to my soccer games differently. He was struggling but he stayed. That realization shattered me in the best way.",6,1762159782.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

1on6oun,https://i.redd.it/lhe4b2w790zf1.png,Total Randomized Island (TRI) (Terrible at Titles),"Praying this doesn't violate the posting rules 🙏

Anyways, this a a fanfic/what if about Total Drama Island's Elimination Order if it were Decided by a wheel! This something I've had in the back of my mind, this isn't completed it only goes up to episode 8 (Up the Creek) but I'm really happy with it and wanted to share the incomplete product for people to see until I finish it.

Rules:

1. Each elimination is decided by the Wheel of Shame (Creative, I know.). There are two wheels. One with the names of all the Gophers and the other with the names of all the Bass.
2. The teams that lost in canon still lose in this AU, except the elimination is different each time. (Example - The Bass lose in the first challenge so they lose here, but Ezekiel won't go home and instead someone else does, e.g. Duncan.)
3. For merge, I first spin the wheel and whoever it lands on wins immunity. For multiple immunity winners I spin the wheel again. For example, in the hide and seek challenge I'll spin the wheel an extra time to grant immunity to whoever gets immunity instead of Heather. The second spin determines the eliminated camper. If the immunity winner/s is landed on, I spin again.

Those are all the rules I’ll be abiding by.

========================================================================

Now, I present... **Total Randomizer Island! (TRI)**

**Episode 1/2. Not So Happy Campers.**

During the episode Harold had annoyed his teammates with his mad skills. Whatever that meant. It didn't help his case that he’d end up complaining all day, wouldn’t bother to jump off the cliff, AND wouldn't push his assigned crate. So when the Bass ended up losing, as the losing team headed to the mess hall in shame, Ezekiel make a sexist remark to DJ as the larger boy was the only one close to him. DJ was surprised by what he heard, after checking that no one heard what Ezekiel said, he then told Ezekiel how he shouldn't say things like that, especially with his bad rep of being the homeschooled guy. After a few minutes of talking and DJ pointing out Eva effortlessly throwing a pair of boulders into the ocean in anger. Ezekiel wasn't so sure about his thoughts on which gender was better. Ezekiel tells DJ that maybe what he was told could be wrong, DJ looking at his confused peer decided to help him out, someone had to teach Ezekiel about the real world. Ezekiel would make a confessional claiming he was excited to have a friend. Shortly after their promise, Duncan grabbed DJ and Geoff, he decided the three of them should team up and vote off Harold. DJ would convince Duncan to have Ezekiel join their little team because DJ had already warmed up to Ezekiel a bit. Duncan didn’t care, it just meant more votes. The votes were spread out between the three who didn’t jump: Courtney, DJ, and Harold. Ultimately, Harold would be the one sent home that night. As he walked down the dock of shame, he claimed that the team would regret voting him off. His mad skills would have saved this team. Duncan would spin a finger around his ear, this action got a laugh out of those nearby.

**Eliminated:** Harold.

**Notes:** Nothing really changed about this episode, besides Harold performing badly.

**Episode 3. Big Sleep.**

The episode started as normal, with the Bass recovering from their loss. Chris would come inside telling them about the 20km run they must do before breakfast. After some outrage both teams began the run. Eva and Tyler would be racing for 1st place while everyone would just run at a moderate pace. After a few hours Owen rushes in with Noah who is flat lining after resuscitating him it's revealed they were the last people to make it here, meaning the Bass won. The team cheered, only for Chris to rain on their parade telling them no one has won immunity and it was time to eat. He reveals a buffet of delicious foods, without question everyone devoured the food. After the food was gone and both teams were as full as full could be, Chris reveals this wasn’t the challenge either, the real challenge was for both teams to stay awake the longest, whichever team falls asleep first loses. 

Everyone now realised that the 20km run and the food was a trap. A trap they fell for. Katie was the first of the Bass to fall asleep, well alongside Sadie. Owen was the first for the Gophers. Shortly into the first night, Ezekiel spots Heather stealing Eva's MP3 player when she went for a bathroom break and informs Eva once she returns. Eva gets her MP3 back in less than civil ways Two days passed and it was now down to Gwen and Trent vs Duncan and Ezekiel. Trent and Ezekiel eventually fell at the same time. After taking a bathroom break Duncan had been found taking a nap on the can. Meaning the Gophers won the challenge once again. When it came to deciding someone to vote out, Duncan and Ezekiel were immediately considered safe by the Bass as they were the last two standing in their team and had done their best. Duncan, still extremely tired, was quick to grab his unofficial alliance. After a short discussion the four group alliance decided to vote for Katie. She and Sadie got some of the other votes but Katie got the majority.

**Eliminated:** Katie

**Notes:** Seeing as Eva still has her MP3 player she avoids elimination for now. I thought that Ezekiel would be able to last long in this challenge because he’d be used to early mornings and late nights on the farm back home. Heather still forms her alliance with Lindsay and Beth, though this happens after the challenge as Heather was knocked out when Eva came to recollect her MP3 player

**Episode 4. Dodgebrawl.** 

In the previous episode Heather formed an alliance with Beth and Lindsay, but unknowingly to Heather, Noah had overheard and the next day he demanded to be a part of it or he'd spill to the rest of the team. Most of the team already didn't like her and when they’d find out she was scheming they’d take the chance to get rid of her. Heather is a little frustrated but decided he could join. She made sure he knew SHE was the leader. Noah didn’t care; he just wanted the safety of numbers. Heather after thinking about it realised this gives her more votes and subsequently more control of the team. This might have worked out in her favour.

The challenge starts and goes the same as in canon, the Gophers dominating and the Bass losing. Even with the addition of Eva, the Bass still struggled as with a simple taunt from Heather Eva would get distracted and then get ganged up on. It was 2-0 the Bass were desperate; they looked to the benches looking at a sleeping Ezekiel and Duncan. They were more focused on Duncan, they needed him. His strength, fierceness, and ability to keep a cool head when it was needed. Duncan had threatened them earlier about waking him up so the team were hesitant, however, Courtney simply forced Tyler to wake him up and after some motivation. (Threat of elimination) Duncan is ready to participate, he first wakes up Ezekiel with a kick to the bench he’s sleeping on. He needs all hands on deck. With some strategies that Duncan picked up in juvie, the Bass managed to bring it to an even 2-2. A tied game. The stress was on, both teams were a hairsbreath away from victory. It was a long and tough game, campers were eliminated, campers were brought back, and eventually it was down to Owen and Ezekiel. The Gophers were confident and the Bass weren’t, they believed it was over, all but DJ. The Brickhouse had confidence in Ezekiel and even voiced it. Ezekiel glared at Owen, the larger boy had stumbled around a lot today, and he wasn’t the most accurate so Ezekiel liked his chances. Owen threw the ball and it hit Ezekiel dead center in the chest. The force made him skid back in a dramatic slow-mo and it was revealed Ezekiel caught it. The Bass won and cheered for Ezekiel. After the challenge the Gophers decided in their own separate groups that they would vote Owen off based on his performance. He was clumsy, hit his teammates, people not playing, and even Chris. Not cool man. It was sad since the guy was full of laughs. But the team needed to get rid of any liabilities.

**Eliminated:** Owen.

**Notes:** Eva would try taking up leadership but her anger issues made it difficult to do so. I know Owen dominated this challenge in canon, but I needed a way to make his elimination here make sense. That’s the kinda challenge the wheel of shame makes. Not much else changes here.

**Episode 5. Not Quite Famous**

The episode starts with the Bass still enjoying their first ever victory, especially after that long losing streak. Ezekiel feels proud of himself for winning for his team. After hearing they’ll be doing a talent show for today’s challenge, Courtney takes up leadership for her team. After a long list of auditions, Courtney ended up choosing herself and her lovely Violin, Geoff and his rad skateboard tricks, and finally Ezekiel and his situationally impressive archery. Ezekiel’s talent would be trying to shoot 7 arrows and trying to hit the 7 targets dead centre.

Heather forcefully took control of the team and picked herself and her ballet (Diary reading), Beth and her flaming baton routine, and finally Justin and his… Jeans. 

The challenge starts and it was VERY rough for the Gophers. Heather received 0 points for reading Gwen's diary and Beth burnt the stage down which earnt her a -1. Chris was not happy that he’d have to use his limited budget on a new stage. Justin earnt them a 10 (Just like him) which was now a 9 (So not like him) thanks to Beth. The Bass did alright but, in this case, alright was enough. Courtney got a 9, Geoff earnt a 5, and Ezekiel surprisingly got a 5. He managed to hit 3 of the targets, 2 were just shy of the centre, 1 barely hit the target, and the last one ended up in one of Chefs butt cheeks so that made him lose a point. Ezekiel doubted that 6 would have been needed. The Bass won a 2nd time. I never doubted those guys! Totally! 

So with the very rough loss it was clear to the team that Heather and Beth were both on the chopping block. Heather's alliance was in a panic, Heather had to do some damage control and comforted Beth telling her that she'd try and steer the team from voting either of them. She would just throw Gwen under the bus or something. Heather just told her to get some rest, it was quite the stressful day for her. Beth smiled in relief and left. After she was out of eye-sight, Noah immediately comments that she would be pinning this on Beth. Heather rolled her eyes, saying it's obvious. 

With the help of Noah spreading the plan to the guys with an almost unanimous vote Beth goes home. Heather isn't too mad; she still has a three person alliance. Of course she'd love for it to be four but she can't beat those numbers without it looking suspicious. Beth felt heartbroken and left with a sad look on her face.

**Eliminated:** Beth

**Notes:** After Beth's elimination, Heather decides to have Noah keep an eye on the guys so she can know what's happening at all times. The Bass is in high spirits and they are all starting to get along.

**Episode 6. The Sucky Outdoors** 

The episode starts with the campers standing in front of Chris for the next challenge. They’d have to survive the wilderness for the night and come back before the other team does. Both teams took their maps from Chris and headed to their campsites. The Bass never noticed Sadie getting distracted by some blueberries that reminded her of Katie because she loved them.

Once the Bass made it to the campsite there was a backpack with instructions and two tents. Courtney and Eva both tried taking the instructions and then they both fought over who would get to take charge. Duncan walked past them picking up the instructions and reading about how they’d get some tents and that's it, they had to figure out how to get food, set up a campfire, and everything else needed to survive the night. Ezekiel decided to go look for some food. He believes he heard a river on the way here which should yield some fish. Tyler was quick to join him, he did not want to be stuck here listening to Eva and Courtney's bickering. 

Things weren’t going so well with the Gophers without Owen there no one would have wanted to search for fish. Cody, feeling hungry, would head back the way they came remembering that he saw a bush of berries. 

The Bass built their campsite under the leadership of Eva and Courtney. They both stepped on each other's toes and would yell at each other or whichever poor sucker was in eyesight. The rest of the team decided to just keep their noses down and set up the tents and fire. Duncan however took any chance he could to tease the two girls, he only stopped when Eva threw a boulder that was inches from hitting his head. Okay he’ll tend to the fire with DJ. Ezekiel and Tyler come back with a backpack of fish. They took the bag that they found with the tents and instructions to put any food they found into it, which was a good idea since they found a massive population of fish in the river. They ate well and just killed some time until it got late enough to fall asleep. 

The Gophers weren’t fairing so well. They had no food, Izzy was gone (Much to Heather’s relief), and they were just getting a fire started. Thankfully the tents were an easy job but everything else was hell. That was until Cody came back carrying an armfull of raspberries. Everyone was starving so they immediately devoured them. Izzy still scares them with the bear suit and her roars attract a real bear which traps them in the tree for the night. 

The sun had just risen and the Bass were already heading back. They were making record pace as Eva had memorised the way they came and it was a simple task of backtracking their path. They made it back before the Gophers and they even beat Chris as he was just walking over with his morning coffee. He vocalised his surprise on seeing them here so early. Ezekiel looks around and doesn’t see any of the Gophers. He realised they won, he and his teammates cheered, only for Chris to rain on their parade. He reminds them that the WHOLE team had to make it back, and he couldn’t help but notice they were missing a fish. He was talking about Sadie. Duncan said she was mauled by a bear, Courtney shook her head faking sadness, and Eva stated that she saw it eat her. The Gophers then arrived with Heather getting angry at Izzy for wasting their time with the snake she found, then to rub salt in the wound, Sadie comes running over claiming how her teammates wouldn’t guess the kind of night she had. She stopped in her tracks when seeing the angry looks on their faces. Chris announced the Gophers won and their reward was the tuckshop which held many goodies, goodies that the Bass would’ve been enjoying. Once again everyone glares at Sadie with Sadie chuckling nervously. 

It was now night time and the Bass were sitting in front of the campfire again. Though it wasn’t a difficult choice as Sadie was voted out in an 8-1 vote.

**Eliminated:** Sadie

**Notes:** I like to think Ezekiel's dad would have taken him camping often, so he'd have the knowledge to help out his team. This skill earns him a bit of respect from his teammates.

**Episode 7. Phobia Factor.**

The episode starts as normal with the Gophers coming out to share their treats with the Bass (Mainly because Cody ate too much and threw up everywhere). But hey that didn’t matter. After Courtney shrieked at the sight of a plate of green jelly, Duncan smirked asking if she was scared, Courtney denies it but DJ placed a hand on her shoulder and told her that he was terrified of snakes. This caused a chain reaction as the campers all began sharing their fears. With encouragement from Lindsay, Noah admits he hates dolls. He has 8 older sisters so there were dolls everywhere and the things always creeped him out. Eva grunts stating she fears nothing. Ezekiel told her everyone’s scared of something, he’s constantly terrified. Eva raised her brow, but seeing as Ezekiel was doing his best to relate, she contributed. To everyone's shock, Eva revealed she was scared of small animals. Duncan snorted, he couldn’t believe she feared puppies. Eva shouted that they are little monsters. Justin shivers at the very thought of his fear, he shared that his worst fear is looking bad for a photo op. (Justing looking bad? Get outta here!) The next day its revealed Chris watched everyone and plans on using their fears for the challenge. 

With the Gophers, like normal Heather, Lindsay, Gwen, Leshawna, Trent, and Izzy complete their fears with the addition of Noah confronting his fear which was spending an hour in a small room filled with dolls, there were audios of giggles playing every so often. Noah would try finding origin of the noise but couldn’t. Noah managed to barely hold on as soon as his timer was up he bolted out of there. Cody and Justin fail their fears. Cody's bomb goes off and Justin refuses to take a photo with the terrible clothes, make up, and wig he’s forced to wear. (Justin don’t listen to them, you still look pretty!)

For the Bass DJ and Duncan would complete their fears. Chris reveals Ezekiel also completed his fear, the team was surprised having not seen Ezekiel complete a challenge, however they end up shrugging it off, a points a point, DJ however hung back and asked Chris what his fear was, Chris reveals that he’s terrified of being on live TV, which he’s had to face every day since he got here. DJ nodded not knowing Eva slowed her pace so she was close enough to overhear. Next up was Tyler who had to stay in a pen with chickens for 8 minutes. He struggled but with encouragement from Ezekiel and DJ he made it through the 8 minutes and moved on. Eva was face to face with a puppy, she stared the evil creature in the eyes. She had to let it sit on her lap for five minutes without a complaint. She was going to forfeit but remembered how Ezekiel had to face his fear constantly and decided her fear was stupid. She roughly grabbed the puppy and sat it on her lap. 5 minutes passed and she got a point. After beating her fear, she gives Ezekiel a nod of respect, Ezekiel didn’t know the meaning of it. Bridgette and Geoff fail their fears. Courtney was faced with her fear, she’d gain an extra 4 points if she faced the fear making her team win. The Bass cheered her, Duncan told her that she’s been telling everyone all day to suck it up and face their fears. It’s her turn to face hers. Even with Duncan’s point, she still backs out making her team lose. 

The team wasn’t happy and really the only choices for elimination were Bridgette, Geoff, and Courtney. Seeing as Geoff and by extension Bridgette were close with Duncan their alliance chose to vote for Courtney. Eva and Tyler seemed to think the same as Courtney was voted with a 7-1 total. Courtney had to be dragged off saying her team would regret this.

**Eliminated:** Courtney

**Notes:** So, in this AU Duncan wouldn’t have that attraction for Courtney like he did in canon. It’s more like a passing attraction with Duncan getting annoyed with her by the end here. 

**Episode 8. Up The Creek.** 

The episode starts with DJ sitting down at the table next to Ezekiel. He noticed the boy was staring out a window deep in thought and asked what was on his mind. Ezekiel shook his head saying it was nothing, just tired. DJ raised a brow and took a gander out the window, he saw Eva doing her morning workout. He hummed, narrowing his eyes at Eva and then to Ezekiel. Back to Eva, back to Ezekiel, and then he shrugged it off as he ate breakfast. 

Chris comes in and explains the challenge telling everyone they had to canoe to Boney island, portage their canoes across the island to the beach, light a fire, canoe home and the first team that crosses the finish line wins. Simple? Cool, Chris isn’t repeating it. The teams split up to make teams of 2-3 to ride over. DJ is quick to ask if Ezekiel wants to team up, the homeschooled boy was quick to accept. Geoff was wanting to team up with Bridgette, but in a panic she quickly teamed up with Eva much to Geoff’s disappointment. Duncan and Tyler walked over, the latter asking if he wanted to join them. Geoff smiled at the two.

With the Gophers, Gwen tries teaming up with Trent who gets grabbed by Lindsay asking if he wanted to team up. Trent didn't have a choice as he was pulled away. Gwen then went to Leshawna who was also being dragged away by Lindsay. Gwen glared at Heather; she knew this was her idea. Gwen was approached by Cody asking if she wanted to team up. She said no, she decided to go with Noah seeing as he was the only person she could tolerate. Cody teams up with Justin leaving Heather with Izzy. It was going to be a long ride over for her. 

The Bass were having a good ride over, Geoff tells Tyler and Duncan about the gift he left for Bridgette. Tyler was baffled, Duncan laughed. Through his laughter, Duncan had to explain why that would be considered off putting. Geoff realising his mistake wonders how he could make it up to her. Duncan shrugged. Tyler told him he just had to impress her with his natural talents. Geoff watched Tyler stand up and try to do… Something. Geoff wasn’t sure because the boy immediately tripped and fell into the water. Duncan howled in laughter. Geoff had such good friends. 

DJ and Ezekiel were canoeing in relative silence, just enjoying the peace of nature. Well Ezekiel did sometimes have to ease DJ’s nerves if the larger teen saw something that scared him. After calming down DJ noticed Ezekiel was staring at something, he followed his gaze and saw Eva who seemed to be listening to something Bridgette was ranting about. It must have been serious because Bridgette looked spooked. If only he knew. DJ tells Ezekiel that he believes Geoff already fancies Bridgette. Ezekiel was confused which DJ simplified making Ezekiel nod in realisation. He then states he doesn’t like her like that. DJ confused goes to ask who when he realises-

[DJ: ](https://tenor.com/view/shit-22jump-street-realization-gif-5465233)

DJ loudly questions that he likes Eva. Ezekiel was quick to quiet his large friend before slowly nodding. DJ is at a loss for words. It’s not that he had anything bad against Eva its that he believes Eva has something against *everyone* Ezekiel just shrugged he said that she seems to be rather nice to him and he gets excited when he sees her lift her two boulders during her warm ups. DJ hummed respecting his buddies type. DJ nodded in approval and tells him as long as he’s happy then that's good enough for him. Ezekiel asks if he should say something or- DJ was quick to shut it down. He needs to tread carefully around these types of situations, say something wrong and BAM. It’s over. DJ told him he’d do his best to be his wingman. Ezekiel thanked DJ. DJ makes a confessional stating that he feels that he owes it to Ezekiel for being supportive of his fear of water. He tells Ezekiel that he should try grabbing her attention by being confident. Based on what he saw back home, confidence made girls swoon. Then most importantly being himself. Ezekiel nodded, diligently taking notes. (Wait, where did he get the paper and pen?)

There wasn’t much of note going on with the Gophers. Leshawna and Trent just rowed in silence sharing looks as Lindsay ‘Tanned’. Cody rowed by himself while Justin admired himself in a mirror. Cody asks if he’ll help. Justin replied that he couldn't strain his arms (Don’t hurt those arms!), the ladies love them. He flexed his arms causing the nearby wildlife to swoon. Izzy was driving Heather insane. Telling her things she didn’t want to know and tipping the canoe over several times. Somewhere, Gwen was punching the air. Speaking of Gwen, she and Noah were canoeing in silence. No small talk. No chaos. Just silence. The two felt like they were in heaven.

Both teams make it to the beach. The Bass wasted no time, lifting their canoes above their heads and rushed for the forest. The Gophers scrambled out of their boats to try and catch up. The Bass charges through the forest and reaches a crossroads. Bridgette wonders where they should go. Ezekiel, remembering DJ’s advice confidently states they should go right. Eva nodded in agreement and they moved on. They were still in the lead until Geoff was brutally injured. The team gasped in horror. Tyler vomits. Ezekiel questions how he’s still conscious. The camera reveals the tiny splinter in Geoff’s leg. (*gag*) Geoff tells the team they have to keep going. Duncan states that he’s too injured to be moving. Geoff tells his teammates that he’ll endure, they’ll win this! Motivated by Geoff’s toughness charged onwards, Geoff was laying on top of DJ’s canoe. Bridgette made a confessional about how she’s seen surfers being eaten by sharks and this was far worse, yet Geoff kept going. (What a Hero)

The Gophers were running behind. They reached the same crossroad the Bass were at minutes ago. Trent was quick to tell everyone to go left stating that he saw Tyler head this way. As they ran, Trent found himself sinking in quicksand. Chris from the safety of the island was laughing. Lindsay tries saving him but she gets stuck

The team makes it over and head through the jungle. DJ carefully places Geoff on the ground so Bridgette could administer First-Aid. The rest of the Bass ran all over the place gathering fire wood while Duncan stayed with the growing pile of firewood to use his lighter to make it burn easier. Heather who just arrived called that cheating. Chris riding in a helicopter states that there are no rules about how the fire should be started. Duncan smirks and sticks a certain finger in the air that must be blurred in post. (Thanks Duncan). The Bass’s fire is almost completed and the Gophers are struggling to keep their flame alive. Heather scowled thinking they could lose. However, an unlikely Hero appears: Izzy. In her hands was a massive ball of leaves?. Izzy states its a fire starter, she made it out of tree sap and other miscellaneous ingredients that she shouldn’t say for legal reasons. Heather didn’t care as long as it did the job.

[ Izzy grins and threw it at the small fire-](https://imgur.com/a/6bI4xub)

[(Huh? What is tha-): ](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/518481496/disintegrating-skeleton)

Now both fires were fully lit. It was now a race to the finish line. The Gophers climbed into their canoes and were off. The Bass were quick to do the same only to realise their oars are gone. It’s revealed that Heather had used them as a fire starter. Duncan scowled, he watched her pass by sticking up a finger that will also require blurring in post. (Thanks). The Bass scrambled to come up with an idea. Bridgette thinks they should have someone jump in the water and push them to the finish line. Duncan thinks DJ should do it; he's the only one strong enough to do it. Eva scoffs saying she’s right here. Ezekiel was quick to say DJ was scared of the water and he wouldn’t let his friend do that. Ezekiel volunteers himself. Also he might impress Eva, but that wasn’t the point! Duncan pointed out that he isn’t as strong as he thinks he is. Eva tried to speak up again but Tyler then walked over stating he’d help Ezekiel while ripping his sweater off. (What a bad ass.) Duncan saw they were quickly falling behind and decided to agree. Eva rolled her eyes she gave up trying and instead helped Duncan. After quickly tying the canoes together with some nearby vines, everyone climbed atop the canoes, sans Ezekiel and Tyler. The two teens jumped into the water and began pushing, surprisingly they were doing well. They started to catch up. Trent saw the Bass were catching up and brought it to everyone's attention. The Gophers started to speed up and the Bass fell behind again. At this rate the Bass would lose. DJ looked at the finish line, to Geoff’s mangled foot, and his friend who volunteered for this physically demanding task because he wanted to save DJ from doing this. He looked determined and jumped into the water. He squeezed in between Ezekiel and Tyler, he immediately began pushing. With DJ’s overwhelming strength the Bass shot past the Gophers and crashed into the shore. Chris lands his helicopter announcing the Bass as the winners. Atop their pile of canoes, the Bass cheered. Ezekiel, DJ, and Tyler exchanged high fives. The Gophers arrived shortly after bummed about the loss.

Heather and Noah were off in the forest just outside the cabins discussing the vote. Heather thinks Trent and Gwen are getting too close. They needed to get rid of one of them. Noah thinks she’ll suggest they voted Gwen. Heather declined thinking Trent is the better option, she planned on dragging Gwen along until her friends are voted off and then give her the boot. Heather orders Noah to get Justin and Cody to join their vote. She’s not stupid enough to approach Gwen or Leshawna about this but she’ll try and get Izzy’s vote. Noah would approach Cody stating they should vote for Trent tonight. He’s gotten awful close to Gwen but not too close, if he was gone Noah thinks Cody might have a chance. Cody hummed in thought. Noah then found Justin doing his 20 step skin care routine. (It takes effort looking that good). Noah *really* didn't like the guy. Getting through life with his looks. He'd swallow his pride for the moment. He convinces Justin that the girls might be losing interest in him. Trent's popular, really popular. Gwen and Leshawna spent a lot of time with him. Which means a lot less time oogling at him. Izzy has even started to drift away from him. Noah thinks Heather might even find Trent more appealing then Justin. Justin is horrified, he hasn’t been this scared since one of his nails were chipped when he did that halloween special! (Oh the horror!) it'd be a massive hit to his brand if the girls don't like him. Noah suggests getting rid of that threat. Justin nodded desperate to keep his popularity with the women and his fanbase. Noah makes a confessional stating that this is too easy. With a 5-4 vote Trent goes home. Gwen is upset, Cody comforts her with a pat on the back.

**Eliminated:** Trent

**Notes:** Ezekiel's crush on Eva is fully realised.

Anyways, this a a fanfic/what if about Total Drama Island's Elimination Order if it were Decided by a wheel! This something I've had in the back of my mind, this isn't completed it only goes up to episode 8 (Up the Creek) but I'm really happy with it and wanted to share the incomplete product for people to see until I finish it.

Rules:

1. Each elimination is decided by the Wheel of Shame (Creative, I know.). There are two wheels. One with the names of all the Gophers and the other with the names of all the Bass.

2. The teams that lost in canon still lose in this AU, except the elimination is different each time. (Example - The Bass lose in the first challenge so they lose here, but Ezekiel won't go home and instead someone else does, e.g. Duncan.)

3. For merge, I first spin the wheel and whoever it lands on wins immunity. For multiple immunity winners I spin the wheel again. For example, in the hide and seek challenge I'll spin the wheel an extra time to grant immunity to whoever gets immunity instead of Heather. The second spin determines the eliminated camper. If the immunity winner/s is landed on, I spin again.

Those are all the rules I’ll be abiding by.

========================================================================



Now, I present... **Total Randomizer Island! (TRI)**



**Episode 1/2. Not So Happy Campers.**

During the episode Harold had annoyed his teammates with his mad skills. Whatever that meant. It didn't help his case that he’d end up complaining all day, wouldn’t bother to jump off the cliff, AND wouldn't push his assigned crate. So when the Bass ended up losing, as the losing team headed to the mess hall in shame, Ezekiel make a sexist remark to DJ as the larger boy was the only one close to him. DJ was surprised by what he heard, after checking that no one heard what Ezekiel said, he then told Ezekiel how he shouldn't say things like that, especially with his bad rep of being the homeschooled guy. After a few minutes of talking and DJ pointing out Eva effortlessly throwing a pair of boulders into the ocean in anger. Ezekiel wasn't so sure about his thoughts on which gender was better. Ezekiel tells DJ that maybe what he was told could be wrong, DJ looking at his confused peer decided to help him out, someone had to teach Ezekiel about the real world. Ezekiel would make a confessional claiming he was excited to have a friend. Shortly after their promise, Duncan grabbed DJ and Geoff, he decided the three of them should team up and vote off Harold. DJ would convince Duncan to have Ezekiel join their little team because DJ had already warmed up to Ezekiel a bit. Duncan didn’t care, it just meant more votes. The votes were spread out between the three who didn’t jump: Courtney, DJ, and Harold. Ultimately, Harold would be the one sent home that night. As he walked down the dock of shame, he claimed that the team would regret voting him off. His mad skills would have saved this team. Duncan would spin a finger around his ear, this action got a laugh out of those nearby.

**Eliminated:** Harold.

**Notes:** Nothing really changed about this episode, besides Harold performing badly.



**Episode 3. Big Sleep.**

The episode started as normal, with the Bass recovering from their loss. Chris would come inside telling them about the 20km run they must do before breakfast. After some outrage both teams began the run. Eva and Tyler would be racing for 1st place while everyone would just run at a moderate pace. After a few hours Owen rushes in with Noah who is flat lining after resuscitating him it's revealed they were the last people to make it here, meaning the Bass won. The team cheered, only for Chris to rain on their parade telling them no one has won immunity and it was time to eat. He reveals a buffet of delicious foods, without question everyone devoured the food. After the food was gone and both teams were as full as full could be, Chris reveals this wasn’t the challenge either, the real challenge was for both teams to stay awake the longest, whichever team falls asleep first loses. 

Everyone now realised that the 20km run and the food was a trap. A trap they fell for. Katie was the first of the Bass to fall asleep, well alongside Sadie. Owen was the first for the Gophers. Shortly into the first night, Ezekiel spots Heather stealing Eva's MP3 player when she went for a bathroom break and informs Eva once she returns. Eva gets her MP3 back in less than civil ways Two days passed and it was now down to Gwen and Trent vs Duncan and Ezekiel. Trent and Ezekiel eventually fell at the same time. After taking a bathroom break Duncan had been found taking a nap on the can. Meaning the Gophers won the challenge once again. When it came to deciding someone to vote out, Duncan and Ezekiel were immediately considered safe by the Bass as they were the last two standing in their team and had done their best. Duncan, still extremely tired, was quick to grab his unofficial alliance. After a short discussion the four group alliance decided to vote for Katie. She and Sadie got some of the other votes but Katie got the majority.

**Eliminated:** Katie

**Notes:** Seeing as Eva still has her MP3 player she avoids elimination for now. I thought that Ezekiel would be able to last long in this challenge because he’d be used to early mornings and late nights on the farm back home. Heather still forms her alliance with Lindsay and Beth, though this happens after the challenge as Heather was knocked out when Eva came to recollect her MP3 player

**Episode 4. Dodgebrawl.** 

In the previous episode Heather formed an alliance with Beth and Lindsay, but unknowingly to Heather, Noah had overheard and the next day he demanded to be a part of it or he'd spill to the rest of the team. Most of the team already didn't like her and when they’d find out she was scheming they’d take the chance to get rid of her. Heather is a little frustrated but decided he could join. She made sure he knew SHE was the leader. Noah didn’t care; he just wanted the safety of numbers. Heather after thinking about it realised this gives her more votes and subsequently more control of the team. This might have worked out in her favour.

The challenge starts and goes the same as in canon, the Gophers dominating and the Bass losing. Even with the addition of Eva, the Bass still struggled as with a simple taunt from Heather Eva would get distracted and then get ganged up on. It was 2-0 the Bass were desperate; they looked to the benches looking at a sleeping Ezekiel and Duncan. They were more focused on Duncan, they needed him. His strength, fierceness, and ability to keep a cool head when it was needed. Duncan had threatened them earlier about waking him up so the team were hesitant, however, Courtney simply forced Tyler to wake him up and after some motivation. (Threat of elimination) Duncan is ready to participate, he first wakes up Ezekiel with a kick to the bench he’s sleeping on. He needs all hands on deck. With some strategies that Duncan picked up in juvie, the Bass managed to bring it to an even 2-2. A tied game. The stress was on, both teams were a hairsbreath away from victory. It was a long and tough game, campers were eliminated, campers were brought back, and eventually it was down to Owen and Ezekiel. The Gophers were confident and the Bass weren’t, they believed it was over, all but DJ. The Brickhouse had confidence in Ezekiel and even voiced it. Ezekiel glared at Owen, the larger boy had stumbled around a lot today, and he wasn’t the most accurate so Ezekiel liked his chances. Owen threw the ball and it hit Ezekiel dead center in the chest. The force made him skid back in a dramatic slow-mo and it was revealed Ezekiel caught it. The Bass won and cheered for Ezekiel. After the challenge the Gophers decided in their own separate groups that they would vote Owen off based on his performance. He was clumsy, hit his teammates, people not playing, and even Chris. Not cool man. It was sad since the guy was full of laughs. But the team needed to get rid of any liabilities.

**Eliminated:** Owen.

**Notes:** Eva would try taking up leadership but her anger issues made it difficult to do so. I know Owen dominated this challenge in canon, but I needed a way to make his elimination here make sense. That’s the kinda challenge the wheel of shame makes. Not much else changes here.

**Episode 5. Not Quite Famous**

The episode starts with the Bass still enjoying their first ever victory, especially after that long losing streak. Ezekiel feels proud of himself for winning for his team. After hearing they’ll be doing a talent show for today’s challenge, Courtney takes up leadership for her team. After a long list of auditions, Courtney ended up choosing herself and her lovely Violin, Geoff and his rad skateboard tricks, and finally Ezekiel and his situationally impressive archery. Ezekiel’s talent would be trying to shoot 7 arrows and trying to hit the 7 targets dead centre.

Heather forcefully took control of the team and picked herself and her ballet (Diary reading), Beth and her flaming baton routine, and finally Justin and his… Jeans. 

The challenge starts and it was VERY rough for the Gophers. Heather received 0 points for reading Gwen's diary and Beth burnt the stage down which earnt her a -1. Chris was not happy that he’d have to use his limited budget on a new stage. Justin earnt them a 10 (Just like him) which was now a 9 (So not like him) thanks to Beth. The Bass did alright but, in this case, alright was enough. Courtney got a 9, Geoff earnt a 5, and Ezekiel surprisingly got a 5. He managed to hit 3 of the targets, 2 were just shy of the centre, 1 barely hit the target, and the last one ended up in one of Chefs butt cheeks so that made him lose a point. Ezekiel doubted that 6 would have been needed. The Bass won a 2nd time. I never doubted those guys! Totally! 

So with the very rough loss it was clear to the team that Heather and Beth were both on the chopping block. Heather's alliance was in a panic, Heather had to do some damage control and comforted Beth telling her that she'd try and steer the team from voting either of them. She would just throw Gwen under the bus or something. Heather just told her to get some rest, it was quite the stressful day for her. Beth smiled in relief and left. After she was out of eye-sight, Noah immediately comments that she would be pinning this on Beth. Heather rolled her eyes, saying it's obvious. 

With the help of Noah spreading the plan to the guys with an almost unanimous vote Beth goes home. Heather isn't too mad; she still has a three person alliance. Of course she'd love for it to be four but she can't beat those numbers without it looking suspicious. Beth felt heartbroken and left with a sad look on her face.

**Eliminated:** Beth

**Notes:** After Beth's elimination, Heather decides to have Noah keep an eye on the guys so she can know what's happening at all times. The Bass is in high spirits and they are all starting to get along.

**Episode 6. The Sucky Outdoors** 

The episode starts with the campers standing in front of Chris for the next challenge. They’d have to survive the wilderness for the night and come back before the other team does. Both teams took their maps from Chris and headed to their campsites. The Bass never noticed Sadie getting distracted by some blueberries that reminded her of Katie because she loved them.

Once the Bass made it to the campsite there was a backpack with instructions and two tents. Courtney and Eva both tried taking the instructions and then they both fought over who would get to take charge. Duncan walked past them picking up the instructions and reading about how they’d get some tents and that's it, they had to figure out how to get food, set up a campfire, and everything else needed to survive the night. Ezekiel decided to go look for some food. He believes he heard a river on the way here which should yield some fish. Tyler was quick to join him, he did not want to be stuck here listening to Eva and Courtney's bickering. 

Things weren’t going so well with the Gophers without Owen there no one would have wanted to search for fish. Cody, feeling hungry, would head back the way they came remembering that he saw a bush of berries. 

The Bass built their campsite under the leadership of Eva and Courtney. They both stepped on each other's toes and would yell at each other or whichever poor sucker was in eyesight. The rest of the team decided to just keep their noses down and set up the tents and fire. Duncan however took any chance he could to tease the two girls, he only stopped when Eva threw a boulder that was inches from hitting his head. Okay he’ll tend to the fire with DJ. Ezekiel and Tyler come back with a backpack of fish. They took the bag that they found with the tents and instructions to put any food they found into it, which was a good idea since they found a massive population of fish in the river. They ate well and just killed some time until it got late enough to fall asleep. 

The Gophers weren’t fairing so well. They had no food, Izzy was gone (Much to Heather’s relief), and they were just getting a fire started. Thankfully the tents were an easy job but everything else was hell. That was until Cody came back carrying an armfull of raspberries. Everyone was starving so they immediately devoured them. Izzy still scares them with the bear suit and her roars attract a real bear which traps them in the tree for the night. 

The sun had just risen and the Bass were already heading back. They were making record pace as Eva had memorised the way they came and it was a simple task of backtracking their path. They made it back before the Gophers and they even beat Chris as he was just walking over with his morning coffee. He vocalised his surprise on seeing them here so early. Ezekiel looks around and doesn’t see any of the Gophers. He realised they won, he and his teammates cheered, only for Chris to rain on their parade. He reminds them that the WHOLE team had to make it back, and he couldn’t help but notice they were missing a fish. He was talking about Sadie. Duncan said she was mauled by a bear, Courtney shook her head faking sadness, and Eva stated that she saw it eat her. The Gophers then arrived with Heather getting angry at Izzy for wasting their time with the snake she found, then to rub salt in the wound, Sadie comes running over claiming how her teammates wouldn’t guess the kind of night she had. She stopped in her tracks when seeing the angry looks on their faces. Chris announced the Gophers won and their reward was the tuckshop which held many goodies, goodies that the Bass would’ve been enjoying. Once again everyone glares at Sadie with Sadie chuckling nervously. 

It was now night time and the Bass were sitting in front of the campfire again. Though it wasn’t a difficult choice as Sadie was voted out in an 8-1 vote.

**Eliminated:** Sadie

**Notes:** I like to think Ezekiel's dad would have taken him camping often, so he'd have the knowledge to help out his team. This skill earns him a bit of respect from his teammates.

**Episode 7. Phobia Factor.**

The episode starts as normal with the Gophers coming out to share their treats with the Bass (Mainly because Cody ate too much and threw up everywhere). But hey that didn’t matter. After Courtney shrieked at the sight of a plate of green jelly, Duncan smirked asking if she was scared, Courtney denies it but DJ placed a hand on her shoulder and told her that he was terrified of snakes. This caused a chain reaction as the campers all began sharing their fears. With encouragement from Lindsay, Noah admits he hates dolls. He has 8 older sisters so there were dolls everywhere and the things always creeped him out. Eva grunts stating she fears nothing. Ezekiel told her everyone’s scared of something, he’s constantly terrified. Eva raised her brow, but seeing as Ezekiel was doing his best to relate, she contributed. To everyone's shock, Eva revealed she was scared of small animals. Duncan snorted, he couldn’t believe she feared puppies. Eva shouted that they are little monsters. Justin shivers at the very thought of his fear, he shared that his worst fear is looking bad for a photo op. (Justing looking bad? Get outta here!) The next day its revealed Chris watched everyone and plans on using their fears for the challenge. 

With the Gophers, like normal Heather, Lindsay, Gwen, Leshawna, Trent, and Izzy complete their fears with the addition of Noah confronting his fear which was spending an hour in a small room filled with dolls, there were audios of giggles playing every so often. Noah would try finding origin of the noise but couldn’t. Noah managed to barely hold on as soon as his timer was up he bolted out of there. Cody and Justin fail their fears. Cody's bomb goes off and Justin refuses to take a photo with the terrible clothes, make up, and wig he’s forced to wear. (Justin don’t listen to them, you still look pretty!)

For the Bass DJ and Duncan would complete their fears. Chris reveals Ezekiel also completed his fear, the team was surprised having not seen Ezekiel complete a challenge, however they end up shrugging it off, a points a point, DJ however hung back and asked Chris what his fear was, Chris reveals that he’s terrified of being on live TV, which he’s had to face every day since he got here. DJ nodded not knowing Eva slowed her pace so she was close enough to overhear. Next up was Tyler who had to stay in a pen with chickens for 8 minutes. He struggled but with encouragement from Ezekiel and DJ he made it through the 8 minutes and moved on. Eva was face to face with a puppy, she stared the evil creature in the eyes. She had to let it sit on her lap for five minutes without a complaint. She was going to forfeit but remembered how Ezekiel had to face his fear constantly and decided her fear was stupid. She roughly grabbed the puppy and sat it on her lap. 5 minutes passed and she got a point. After beating her fear, she gives Ezekiel a nod of respect, Ezekiel didn’t know the meaning of it. Bridgette and Geoff fail their fears. Courtney was faced with her fear, she’d gain an extra 4 points if she faced the fear making her team win. The Bass cheered her, Duncan told her that she’s been telling everyone all day to suck it up and face their fears. It’s her turn to face hers. Even with Duncan’s point, she still backs out making her team lose. 

The team wasn’t happy and really the only choices for elimination were Bridgette, Geoff, and Courtney. Seeing as Geoff and by extension Bridgette were close with Duncan their alliance chose to vote for Courtney. Eva and Tyler seemed to think the same as Courtney was voted with a 7-1 total. Courtney had to be dragged off saying her team would regret this.

**Eliminated:** Courtney

**Notes:** So, in this AU Duncan wouldn’t have that attraction for Courtney like he did in canon. It’s more like a passing attraction with Duncan getting annoyed with her by the end here. 

**Episode 8. Up The Creek.** 

The episode starts with DJ sitting down at the table next to Ezekiel. He noticed the boy was staring out a window deep in thought and asked what was on his mind. Ezekiel shook his head saying it was nothing, just tired. DJ raised a brow and took a gander out the window, he saw Eva doing her morning workout. He hummed, narrowing his eyes at Eva and then to Ezekiel. Back to Eva, back to Ezekiel, and then he shrugged it off as he ate breakfast. 

Chris comes in and explains the challenge telling everyone they had to canoe to Boney island, portage their canoes across the island to the beach, light a fire, canoe home and the first team that crosses the finish line wins. Simple? Cool, Chris isn’t repeating it. The teams split up to make teams of 2-3 to ride over. DJ is quick to ask if Ezekiel wants to team up, the homeschooled boy was quick to accept. Geoff was wanting to team up with Bridgette, but in a panic she quickly teamed up with Eva much to Geoff’s disappointment. Duncan and Tyler walked over, the latter asking if he wanted to join them. Geoff smiled at the two.

With the Gophers, Gwen tries teaming up with Trent who gets grabbed by Lindsay asking if he wanted to team up. Trent didn't have a choice as he was pulled away. Gwen then went to Leshawna who was also being dragged away by Lindsay. Gwen glared at Heather; she knew this was her idea. Gwen was approached by Cody asking if she wanted to team up. She said no, she decided to go with Noah seeing as he was the only person she could tolerate. Cody teams up with Justin leaving Heather with Izzy. It was going to be a long ride over for her. 

The Bass were having a good ride over, Geoff tells Tyler and Duncan about the gift he left for Bridgette. Tyler was baffled, Duncan laughed. Through his laughter, Duncan had to explain why that would be considered off putting. Geoff realising his mistake wonders how he could make it up to her. Duncan shrugged. Tyler told him he just had to impress her with his natural talents. Geoff watched Tyler stand up and try to do… Something. Geoff wasn’t sure because the boy immediately tripped and fell into the water. Duncan howled in laughter. Geoff had such good friends. 

DJ and Ezekiel were canoeing in relative silence, just enjoying the peace of nature. Well Ezekiel did sometimes have to ease DJ’s nerves if the larger teen saw something that scared him. After calming down DJ noticed Ezekiel was staring at something, he followed his gaze and saw Eva who seemed to be listening to something Bridgette was ranting about. It must have been serious because Bridgette looked spooked. If only he knew. DJ tells Ezekiel that he believes Geoff already fancies Bridgette. Ezekiel was confused which DJ simplified making Ezekiel nod in realisation. He then states he doesn’t like her like that. DJ confused goes to ask who when he realises-

[DJ: ](https://tenor.com/view/shit-22jump-street-realization-gif-5465233)

DJ loudly questions that he likes Eva. Ezekiel was quick to quiet his large friend before slowly nodding. DJ is at a loss for words. It’s not that he had anything bad against Eva its that he believes Eva has something against *everyone* Ezekiel just shrugged he said that she seems to be rather nice to him and he gets excited when he sees her lift her two boulders during her warm ups. DJ hummed respecting his buddies type. DJ nodded in approval and tells him as long as he’s happy then that's good enough for him. Ezekiel asks if he should say something or- DJ was quick to shut it down. He needs to tread carefully around these types of situations, say something wrong and BAM. It’s over. DJ told him he’d do his best to be his wingman. Ezekiel thanked DJ. DJ makes a confessional stating that he feels that he owes it to Ezekiel for being supportive of his fear of water. He tells Ezekiel that he should try grabbing her attention by being confident. Based on what he saw back home, confidence made girls swoon. Then most importantly being himself. Ezekiel nodded, diligently taking notes. (Wait, where did he get the paper and pen?)



There wasn’t much of note going on with the Gophers. Leshawna and Trent just rowed in silence sharing looks as Lindsay ‘Tanned’. Cody rowed by himself while Justin admired himself in a mirror. Cody asks if he’ll help. Justin replied that he couldn't strain his arms (Don’t hurt those arms!), the ladies love them. He flexed his arms causing the nearby wildlife to swoon. Izzy was driving Heather insane. Telling her things she didn’t want to know and tipping the canoe over several times. Somewhere, Gwen was punching the air. Speaking of Gwen, she and Noah were canoeing in silence. No small talk. No chaos. Just silence. The two felt like they were in heaven.



Both teams make it to the beach. The Bass wasted no time, lifting their canoes above their heads and rushed for the forest. The Gophers scrambled out of their boats to try and catch up. The Bass charges through the forest and reaches a crossroads. Bridgette wonders where they should go. Ezekiel, remembering DJ’s advice confidently states they should go right. Eva nodded in agreement and they moved on. They were still in the lead until Geoff was brutally injured. The team gasped in horror. Tyler vomits. Ezekiel questions how he’s still conscious. The camera reveals the tiny splinter in Geoff’s leg. (*gag*) Geoff tells the team they have to keep going. Duncan states that he’s too injured to be moving. Geoff tells his teammates that he’ll endure, they’ll win this! Motivated by Geoff’s toughness charged onwards, Geoff was laying on top of DJ’s canoe. Bridgette made a confessional about how she’s seen surfers being eaten by sharks and this was far worse, yet Geoff kept going. (What a Hero)

The Gophers were running behind. They reached the same crossroad the Bass were at minutes ago. Trent was quick to tell everyone to go left stating that he saw Tyler head this way. As they ran, Trent found himself sinking in quicksand. Chris from the safety of the island was laughing. Lindsay tries saving him but she gets stuck



The team makes it over and head through the jungle. DJ carefully places Geoff on the ground so Bridgette could administer First-Aid. The rest of the Bass ran all over the place gathering fire wood while Duncan stayed with the growing pile of firewood to use his lighter to make it burn easier. Heather who just arrived called that cheating. Chris riding in a helicopter states that there are no rules about how the fire should be started. Duncan smirks and sticks a certain finger in the air that must be blurred in post. (Thanks Duncan). The Bass’s fire is almost completed and the Gophers are struggling to keep their flame alive. Heather scowled thinking they could lose. However, an unlikely Hero appears: Izzy. In her hands was a massive ball of leaves?. Izzy states its a fire starter, she made it out of tree sap and other miscellaneous ingredients that she shouldn’t say for legal reasons. Heather didn’t care as long as it did the job. 

[ Izzy grins and threw it at the small fire-](https://imgur.com/a/6bI4xub)



[(Huh? What is tha-): ](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/518481496/disintegrating-skeleton)

Now both fires were fully lit. It was now a race to the finish line. The Gophers climbed into their canoes and were off. The Bass were quick to do the same only to realise their oars are gone. It’s revealed that Heather had used them as a fire starter. Duncan scowled, he watched her pass by sticking up a finger that will also require blurring in post. (Thanks). The Bass scrambled to come up with an idea. Bridgette thinks they should have someone jump in the water and push them to the finish line. Duncan thinks DJ should do it; he's the only one strong enough to do it. Eva scoffs saying she’s right here. Ezekiel was quick to say DJ was scared of the water and he wouldn’t let his friend do that. Ezekiel volunteers himself. Also he might impress Eva, but that wasn’t the point! Duncan pointed out that he isn’t as strong as he thinks he is. Eva tried to speak up again but Tyler then walked over stating he’d help Ezekiel while ripping his sweater off. (What a bad ass.) Duncan saw they were quickly falling behind and decided to agree. Eva rolled her eyes she gave up trying and instead helped Duncan. After quickly tying the canoes together with some nearby vines, everyone climbed atop the canoes, sans Ezekiel and Tyler. The two teens jumped into the water and began pushing, surprisingly they were doing well. They started to catch up. Trent saw the Bass were catching up and brought it to everyone's attention. The Gophers started to speed up and the Bass fell behind again. At this rate the Bass would lose. DJ looked at the finish line, to Geoff’s mangled foot, and his friend who volunteered for this physically demanding task because he wanted to save DJ from doing this. He looked determined and jumped into the water. He squeezed in between Ezekiel and Tyler, he immediately began pushing. With DJ’s overwhelming strength the Bass shot past the Gophers and crashed into the shore. Chris lands his helicopter announcing the Bass as the winners. Atop their pile of canoes, the Bass cheered. Ezekiel, DJ, and Tyler exchanged high fives. The Gophers arrived shortly after bummed about the loss.

Heather and Noah were off in the forest just outside the cabins discussing the vote. Heather thinks Trent and Gwen are getting too close. They needed to get rid of one of them. Noah thinks she’ll suggest they voted Gwen. Heather declined thinking Trent is the better option, she planned on dragging Gwen along until her friends are voted off and then give her the boot. Heather orders Noah to get Justin and Cody to join their vote. She’s not stupid enough to approach Gwen or Leshawna about this but she’ll try and get Izzy’s vote. Noah would approach Cody stating they should vote for Trent tonight. He’s gotten awful close to Gwen but not too close, if he was gone Noah thinks Cody might have a chance. Cody hummed in thought. Noah then found Justin doing his 20 step skin care routine. (It takes effort looking that good). Noah *really* didn't like the guy. Getting through life with his looks. He'd swallow his pride for the moment. He convinces Justin that the girls might be losing interest in him. Trent's popular, really popular. Gwen and Leshawna spent a lot of time with him. Which means a lot less time oogling at him. Izzy has even started to drift away from him. Noah thinks Heather might even find Trent more appealing then Justin. Justin is horrified, he hasn’t been this scared since one of his nails were chipped when he did that halloween special! (Oh the horror!) it'd be a massive hit to his brand if the girls don't like him. Noah suggests getting rid of that threat. Justin nodded desperate to keep his popularity with the women and his fanbase. Noah makes a confessional stating that this is too easy. With a 5-4 vote Trent goes home. Gwen is upset, Cody comforts her with a pat on the back.

**Eliminated:** Trent

**Notes:** Ezekiel's crush on Eva is fully realised.

As for the flavor, it tastes of mugicha with coffee notes. Very warming feeling. Nostalgic kahit di Naman Ako nagkakape.

Suddenly things started taking a downward spiral. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with. Progressive disease that doesn't have a great outcome. My tenant moved out on me. The home i inherited from my late father became too expensive to maintain. I lost my job. I don't know anyone here. I moved here to help my father after a stroke and he passed about 9months after that. I had to sell my car to get a lawyer for probate court (I tried doing it myself and got very sick). I thought I'd be able to sell my home and get another car. This didn't happen the way I thought would.

2 months ago I woke up to my power being shot off. I contacted all the places that offer help and keep running into red-tape.  I asked a neighbor to help me get an old generator started (an older ma who claimed to get along great with my father). He offerd me an extension cord and I told him it would take me awhile. He told me not to worry about it. 
To speed things up a bit... About 2 weeks later he texted me a (what I thought was a joke) dirty comment. I laughed it off. A few days later he asked me to give him a sexual act. I had not told him I am trans because I normally only tell potential sexual partners and when I'm safe. I kept inventing ways to tell him no. Or I would say before anything happens we t need to talk privately. As soon as I said that he would back off but always hot nasty. I put myself into high gear. I called churches and govement agencies I keep running into things. I even tried to get my medical needs to be a reason not cancel buy my PC nurse practioner wants me to make an appointment. The lady is only there 4 times a month and I don't have a ride to her (though I could catch an Uber if I plan for it) but I wasn't able to get an appointment until mid December (🙄😡)

This man is relentless. He plays games by shutting off the electric. I start making plans to live without electricity. Shelf stable things, charging my devices at public locations (if I'm able to walk those days). I also work from home and depend on a laptop and phone foru job. 

A few days ago I'm trying to gather things up to sell on Market place or where ever I can. I noticed my power is off. I had just bought 250 dollars worth of food and I planned accordingly to get me through the month. I do get a few dollars in food stamps I wasn't going to have this month. I'm not new to being poor so I only bought meal ingredients and I had to get at least 3 meals out what I was making. I purchased ground turkey, a ton of frozen veggies, a few seasonings a bottle of olive oil, coffee and evaporated milk. I had processed most of that stuff to freeze. But now it was all gonna go bad. I texted my neighbor and told him I can't afford to loose this food this month. He told me I know what I needed to do. I am scared to tell him trans because he's already made racist daragotory comments about how he wants a ""black girl to sick his dick"". I've heard him make extremist hate group comments about ""queers"". He also has a huge gun collection and I do believe he's racist. I won't tell him trans because I'm not safe. In a normal situation when a man hits on me I say it right away. I always have to be weary of my surroundings so if I'm not safe I'll get their number and tell them on the phone. But by this time I'm safe however my neighbor knows where I live and don't feel safe enough to disclose. 
He has knocked on my door in the middle of the night, he has tried to get me to come to his home and I've caught him lurking in my back yard. 
I'm scared, I am scared to tell him trans and I'm scared he will try to get into my home. This man is a registered SO. I can't run away. 
I've sat her all night thinking of ways to self exit. I'm just tired of fighting. Maybe it's my Karma. I have made bad choices in my earlier years. This could be my Karma and I accept it. 
I have been fighting my entire life. O have been violated, abused, manipulated, lied to and gaslight my entire existence and I've reached my limit. 
I tried to reach out for help and I keep hitting dead ends. Maybe I'm ignoring all the clues my existence isn't desired or needed. 
I want folks to now I did fight as much as I could and I promise I didn't give up easily. 
I have two dogs, well one dog and I'm fostering one. They are people friendly but not good wot other pets. (The male that is. The female is very good).  I hope someone will see the good in them. Even the male isnt aggressive in a mean way. He gets pushy when he's excited. My father would have trained al. This out of him but he passed shortly after he adopted.

The autumn leaves in Hu Lin Park have already fallen. There are not many places to visit in the city. But it’s really nice to watch the sunset and the blue hour at Tuofeng Mountain

⛰️ To get to the mountain, just navigate directly to Tuofeng Mountain. There will be signs on the road indicating where to go up the mountain. It’s a zigzag road. At 7 p.m., the lights will be on, so you don’t have to worry about the road being difficult to walk at night

* **Picture 1 is the blues moment at night in Altay, isn't it beautiful～**

There are a total of 936 steps. It doesn’t seem like a lot, but the steps are very dense. There is almost no flat ground. This means that you have to climb the stairs of a 50 - story building in one go

🚶 The most important thing is that the steps are not of uniform height. Sometimes they are high, and sometimes they are low. You need to pay attention while climbing to avoid tripping.

🌄 Both the sunset and the blue hour are very beautiful. Recently, the best time is around 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. (Later on, it may be around 6:00 p.m.?)

☕️ After coming down the mountain, you can go to the Travel Book Bar. It’s only a 5 - minute walk away. They have coffee and cultural and creative products. It’s a pretty cool place, and there are two cats there. You can stamp your postcards and even send them in the following year (Picture 5)

👍👍👍 In front of the shop is the Kela River, which is similar to the Kamogawa River in Kyoto. The sound of the water is so soothing that it will make you feel comfortable (Picture 4)

Last year I gave my cousin Lila 27F a spare key for true emergencies because she lived in the same building then and was going through a rough patch. She moved out in March but I never asked for the key back since we are close, and she watched my cat once. Over the summer I noticed weird little things. Towels slightly damp in the hamper when I had not showered that day. The coffee canister half full when I swore I made tea. My Apple TV showed a profile named “Guest” and episodes of a reality show I dont watch. I brushed it off like the classic I must be tired. Two weeks ago I came home at 6.40 from work and found the dryer running with a load of clothes that were not mine. At first I panicked thinking someone broke in. Then I saw Lila’s purple hoodie hanging on a chair. I called her and she said she was “just popping by to do laundry” since her apartment’s machines are coins only. She said she left a note on the counter. The note was a ripped receipt that said thanks cuz. I told her this is not ok and to ask first next time. She said I was being dramatic, that family helps each other.

I go out of town last weekend and I took my cat to a sitter. Sunday night I get a text from my neighbor that a woman was in my unit earlier. When I got home Monday my bathroom drawer was partially open, my expensive serum had a new finger line in it, and a thrifted sweater I planned to resell was missing. Lila replied oh I wore the sweater to brunch, remembered you bought it for five dollars, and said she will wash and return. I told her I dont care about the price, it is my home and it feels gross that she just comes in and uses things. She doubled down that it is literally family property since we always shared in childhood. The next morning I called a locksmith and changed the deadbolt. I also put a small camera at the entry that points only at the door for my own peace. Lila found out when her key did not work and blew up the group chat saying I humiliated her and made her feel unsafe. My aunt says I overreacted and should have just asked for the key back nicely. Now the family is split and I am wondering if I escalated too fast. Was changing the locks too much or is it normal to want a clear boundary when someone treats your place like a free laundromat and closet.

4. **Yercaud, Tamil Nadu** – Calm lake town with colonial bungalows and pine forests; feels like a small British countryside.

6. **Valparai, Tamil Nadu** – Tea gardens everywhere, clean roads, and misty viewpoints — you’d swear you’re in Scotland.
7. **Coorg’s Madikeri Town, Karnataka** – Cozy cottages, local wine, and foggy roads that make it feel like a European village in monsoon.

10. **Kotagiri, Tamil Nadu** – Quieter than Ooty, with quaint homestays and cobblestone paths through tea hills.

Each of these places offers the **beauty and serenity** of Europe — minus the expensive flight ticket ✈️

1on6dg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1on6dg6/43t_gardening_cooking_archery_and_books/,"43T Gardening, cooking, archery and books","There is a calm moment on Monday mornings where I can drink a cup of coffee before the day and week come rushing at me. I'll sit in my garden and scroll a bit on my phone, and inevitably feel the pull to have a friend to chat with. I'm a parent, so socializing has become an unusual endeavor outside of meeting parents for kid related activities, with whom I have nothing in common apart from school and parenting. Maybe they'll have a bit of interest in gardening, or share a family recipe they cooked, but after a few polite words the conversation ends and each moves on with their lives. I'll talk to my wife, but it's mostly the day to day planning, house stuff, organizing, and all the adult things we have to do, and then maybe, at the end of the day if we're not too tired, we'll hang out and talk for a bit. Joining discord servers feels like my voice is just a drop in the sea. And sometimes I just want a friend to chat with, silly things like what books we enjoy, send each other pictures of flowers and plants, talk about sci-fi and fantasy or what hobbies we have. Vent to each other, offer a friendly ear or a distraction.

If you are a housewife like me, a parent, an adult feeling a similar way, I would love to hear from you. I'm in the EU time zone so hopefully you are too. Tell me something about yourself, or what you love about autumn.",1,1762158344.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False
1on6dey,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1on6dey/the_teacups_new_home/,The Teacups' New Home,"On Sundays, my family typically goes to church in town about 45 minutes away from where we live.  I'm an Atheist myself, but with four children I opt to be around to help my wife out so she isn't overwhelmed, and I'll admit this church is pretty special - a decent community that has a meal every week: something rare from what I've seen (families or groups take turns doing the meal for everyone each week).  It's nice to sit down and talk to people after the service over an actual *meal* instead of just leaving or having a coffee and a sugar cookie, and *then* leaving.

Once it seems like things are mostly under control (my children are settled, or in the play room, or whatever), when I've had enough of the service I'll typically go for a walk, usually ending in the kitchen and dining area (where the coffee and sugar cookies from the previous service are located).

Now having been to this church for a while, there's a peculiar thing I've noticed both at the after-service meals and a number of the more ""formal"" meals - very often, there are no pitchers of water to be found anywhere.  Honestly, it's really weird.  At some point - I don't know exactly when - I had had enough of visiting the kitchen sink to get water in my glass, or asking someone for water, that I ended up using this ""walk"" time to just put out the pitchers myself while the service is going on.  I'll fill up about 5 pitchers of water, and also put out the glasses, bowls, plates, cutlery, and coffee cups.  (No, I don't want to be a volunteer.  And I'm not committing to anything.  I'm not signing anything!  Leave me alone!!!)  I do this whenever I'm there at this point and just make it part of my routine, and I'm quite happy with it. 

So a number of weeks ago I was at home with my wife and we were discussing what was in our kitchen cupboards and wanting to make more room as things were a little tight.  Attention gravitated to our teacups.  We both readily agreed that we had too many of them and could do away with some.  We did not agree on *which ones* to do away with.  My wife wanted to get rid of certain ones I liked that didn't match or were ugly or whatever, and said that we can probably just donate them somewhere instead of throwing them out.

I paused, thought about it, didn't argue.  Okay, let's donate them, all the ones you don't like.

As it happens, since I'm the guy who is putting out all the meal items, like teacups, I knew that the church had somewhat of a shortage of teacups and coffee cups that usually forced us to use a backup of paper cups to cover the need.  Also, most of the cups there were too small.  So one week when we were going to church, I quietly packed the box of tea cups into our van.

When my routine resumed as usual in the kitchen, I took out our teacups and placed them with the church's teacups - but not just that, I made sure ours were at the FRONT of the group of cups, where they are easy to see, every week.  I have not mentioned to anyone where the cups came from.

My wife hasn't either.

We're still married.  ",38,1762158341.0,MaliciousCompliance,3,0.87,False

One of my techs, 31M, is nice in person but always late since school drop off. For months he asked folks to hit the time clock for him, just two minutes, just five, you know the vibe. I told him no, company policy says everyone clocks themselves. He got salty and told me I was being inflexible because I do not have kids. Last week it escalated. He pinged me at 8.12 asking me to log him into the VPN with my token because he left his key at home and would be in by 9. I said no again, I cant use my credentials for someone else, also it would make his login look like it came from my device. He said I should be a team player, he would bring me coffee, very funny.

Two days later HR emails me and two managers. They saw weird login times tied to my queue, tickets opened at 8.01 from a machine that is not mine and then reassigned to him at 9.10. Turns out another coworker had been clocking him in, then parking a fake ticket under my team queue so it looked like work started at 8. I did not know they were doing that. HR asked for a timeline and any messages. I gave the screenshots. Now the late guy has a written warning, and the other coworker got one too. People are being chilly to me in chat, implying I threw him under the bus. He posted a paragraph in the general channel about how parents need grace, and how single people have more bandwidth so we should step up when needed. My manager backs me, but also asked me to be ""mindful"" of morale. Which feels like code for let it slide next time.

I get that childcare is hard, I really do, my sister is a nurse and I watched her juggle shifts and daycare waitlists. But I am not comfortable risking my job or committing time fraud so someone can slide past the badge reader. I offered actual solutions, ask for a formal shift change, use PTO for the mornings he needs, talk to HR about flex. He said that was unrealistic and that I dont understand because I go to the gym at 6.30 and have time for hobbies. So, am I the jerk for refusing to clock him in and for cooperating with HR when asked.

TLDR, coworker asked me to fake time and VPN, I refused, HR found a pattern and warned him, now the team thinks I snitched, am I the jerk",29,1762158204.0,AmITheJerk,23,0.91,False
1on6bta,https://i.redd.it/c2awog9x40zf1.jpeg,Reviews of some milk perfumes I’ve worn lately 🥛 pt. 2,"Alright ladies, part two of my milk perfume review series has been served 🥛. Let’s get on with it:

**Isabelle Larignon Milky Dragon**
At the end of August, my decant of Isabelle Larignon Milky Dragon arrived. According to LuckyScent, Milky Dragon has notes of bergamot, bucchu, cardamom, rose ketones, cis-jasmone, ionones, lactones, hazelnut, ozonic note, clary sage, Virginia cedar, fir balsam, and evernyl (oak moss). 

Bucchu is a low shrub native to the Cape region of South Africa with an aromatic, minty, green, and woody scent profile that can also have a scent reminiscent of black currant. I have never smelled bucchu but there is definitely a prominent aromatic minty, green, and woody aspect to Milky Dragon. 

From what I can find on cis-jasmone, it is a molecule that can be utilized to recreate jasmine notes or other floral notes and provides them with a soft, creamy, petal-like quality. There is some soft creaminess to Milky Dragon, so I would say the cis-jasmone is detectable. I’m sure the lactones are also responsible for the creaminess in Milky Dragon, and the sour, slightly acrid quality as well (although the black currant may be giving Milky Dragon that sour, slightly acrid quality). 

The lactones come across as very buttery and combine with the bucchu to give Milky Dragon a butter mint like scent - but if the butter mint were to be made with bucchu and a pinch of cane sugar (Milky Dragon isn’t very sweet to me). The sour quality reminds me of plain yogurt and is quite off-putting to be frank. 

Rose ketones are chemical compounds extracted from rose flowers (typically Damascene roses) from what I found online. The rose ketones combined with the aromatic bucchu, warm resinous fir balsam, spicy cardamom, and lactones remind me of a warm cup of English Rose tea with a splash of milk spiced with cardamom. I want to take a moment to note that I picked up the rose ketones on the first two wears, but not the last two!

The clary sage adds to the aromatic scent profile of Milky Dragon. There is something about Milky Dragon that smells like tumeric - giving it a savory, earthy, bitter twist. The ozonic note, Virginia cedar, warm resinous balsam fir, and oak moss are prominent in Milky Dragon as well. They create a damp, earthy, woody back drop to the fragrance - like a walk in the woods after it’s been raining for a few days. 

The oak moss also has a leathery facet. I don’t detect the hazelnut individually, but nutty notes can come across as earthy and savory. So, perhaps the hazelnut note just contributes to those facets of the fragrance. 

There is something about Milky Dragon that reminds me of a vintage chypre. I’m guessing it’s the prominent, earthy, leathery oak moss, overall aromatic scent profile, and although I do not smell it, the bergamot. 

Milky Dragon projects more intimately (I put on 1-2 dabs with the applicator). I can smell it with my hand 2-3 inches from my face. If I hold my hand away further than that, I cannot smell it. Milky Dragon lasts for three hours before disappearing from the skin completely. 

Although I liked Milky Dragon well enough and it’s very unique and interesting, it just isn’t the type of fragrance that I’d wear enough to ever finish the sample. Plus, I like to keep my collection of samples relatively small. So, after wearing Milky Dragon four more times and feeling the same way about it each time, I sold it. I would categorize Milky Dragon as a milk perfume, but maybe more so as a butter one!

**Chabaud Lait De Vanille**
At the end of August, I also purchased two Chabaud samples: Lait De Vanille and Lait De Biscuit. Reviews with both fragrances are from eight or so wears each, with 1-2 sprays worn during each wear. 

According to the Chabaud website, Lait De Vanille has notes of milk, benzoin, vanilla, and caramel. Chabaud describes Lait De Vanille as having notes of confiture de lait (a French spread made from milk, sugar, and vanilla), chocolate-balsamic notes of benzoin, vanilla, and caramel. 

Lait De Vanille is a milky, sweet, aromatic, spicy vanilla fragrance that opens up with a burst of cooling, aromatic spices. Despite there not being any spice notes listed for Lait De Vanille, I definitely get aromatic spicy notes from it - specifically cardamom, clove, and nutmeg. Originally, I didn’t mind the cardamom but I’m not the biggest fan of cardamom in fragrances on myself as it makes fragrances smell masculine to me. Over time the cardamom-like scent in Lait De Vanille became so strong that it became bothersome. 

Also, I must note that I would 110% categorize Lait De Vanilla as a play dough vanilla. The play dough scent was always there, but on my first four wears it hummed in the background. The milkiness and spices were at the forefront. So, the play dough scent didn’t bother me. Unfortunately, over time, the play dough scent stole the limelight alongside the spiciness. On my last four wears, whenever I wore Lait De Vanille it smelled like I’d rubbed a vanilla and cardamom scented playdough all over my wrists.

Lait De Vanille wears intimately in a linear fashion for five hours. In the tail end of the fourth hour, it can only be smelled if I put my nose directly on my skin. As previously mentioned, I would categorize Lait De Vanille as a vanilla perfume (specifically a play dough vanilla!), but it does fit into the milk perfume category as well. 

**Chabaud Lait De Biscuit**
According to the Chabaud website, Lait De Biscuit has notes of gourmand notes (a biscuit is pictured), caramel, and vanilla. Chabaud describes Lait De Biscuit as a triumvirate of the finest sweets with pastry notes, caramel notes reminiscent of toffee and roasted almonds, and subtle vanilla notes. 

Upon first spray, Lait De Biscuit opens up with a fluffy, cozy, vanillic sweetness and warmth reminiscent of the vanilla Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere. On the first three wears, Lait De Biscuit had a creamy caramelized, slightly smoky sweetness to it that reminded me of the top of a just flamed Creme brûlée and a soft, fluffy powderiness that reminds me of marshmallows! 

On the first three wears, the creme brûlée and marshmallow scent gave way to the scent of a warm, golden honey drizzled buttermilk biscuit after the first ten minutes. The biscuit scent reminds me specifically of the pre-cut canned buttered biscuits that you can peel apart and pop into the oven for a quick addition to a meal. 

On later wears, I didn’t detect anything smoky, caramelized, or creamy, nor did I detect anything powdery that reminded me of marshmallows. Instead Lait De Biscuit just opened up with that cozy, Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere style vanilla and then started smelling like a honey drizzled buttermilk biscuit a few minutes later (and for the remainder of the wear time).

Lait De Biscuit for about four hours, and is an intimate skin scent throughout the entire wear time. On my first three wears, Lait De Biscuit became a very subtle creamy, powdery, honeyed vanilla skin scent in the third hour. On my last few wears, Lait De Biscuit smelled like a honey drizzled biscuit and vanilla from the first thirty minutes onward. It just became a lighter and lighter version of itself until it became undetectable. 

I would not categorize Lait De Biscuit as a milk perfume. I would categorize it as a gourmand vanilla perfume, and more specifically a bread perfume.

**Lancôme Lavandes Trianon**
At the end of August, I also purchased a decant of the discontinued beauty that is Lancôme Lavandes Trianon. According to Parfumo, Lavandes Trianon has notes of lavender absolute, bourbon vanilla, caramel, Provençal lavender, and milk. 

Lavandes Trianon is a gorgeous sweet, milky lavender dream! It reminds me of a vanilla frappe with a shot of lavender syrup topped with whipped cream, which is my favorite drink from a little coffee shop that I like to frequent at the mall! I’d say that the lavender absolute reminds me of the typical culinary variety, English lavender, as it reminds me of the lavender syrups used to flavor coffees and teas. The Provençal lavender in Lavandes Trianon is very bright, natural, and fragrant! It reminds me of lavender essential oils and keeps Lavandes Trianon from smelling entirely edible. 

Lavandes Trianon wears for six hours in a linear fashion with intimate to moderate projection depending on how many dabs I apply with the wand. I would definitely categorize Lavandes Trianon as a milk perfume, and an extremely pretty and special one at that! It’s truly a shame that it was discontinued! I’d love to buy a full size bottle, but it’s just so expensive! Maybe one day I’ll bite the bullet and drop the $500 for a full size bottle! 

**Fleurit Gâteau Des Anges**
I purchased the Fleurit discovery set at the beginning of September, and posted a full review of it a few days ago. So, I will not be providing a full on review of Gâteau Des Anges in this post. 

I will, however, provide the spark notes here. Gateau Des Anges is a delicate, ethereal, powdery, milky, warm gourmand fragrance. It smells like powdery candies, candied fruits, peach ring candies laden with sugar crystals, orange cupcakes, and the cereal milk left in the bowl after eating Fruity Pebbles (and the actual cereal) - and it’s all been served to you on a porcelain tray by the most beautiful, delicate angel. It reminds me of a cross between Chanel No. 5 L’Eau and Dolce & Gabbana Devotion, but lighter, far more intimate (in terms of projection), and more dainty. 

Gâteau Des Anges wears intimately in a linear fashion for 6-6.5 hours even when applied liberally (6 dabs). I would definitely categorize Gâteau Des Anges as a milk perfume! I would love to purchase a full-size bottle after I finish my sample. I just wish the bottle was more my style! 

**Sugar Milk Co. Almond Cookies & Milk**
In the middle of September, I purchased a bundle of Sugar Milk Co. perfume samples that included a few milk perfumes: Almond Cookies & Milk, Strawberry Milk, and Banana Milk. According to Sugar Milk Co., Almond Cookies & Milk has notes of yummy almonds, rich buttercream, cookie dough, delicious warm spices, and sweet vanilla.

Almond Cookies & Milk smells exactly like this vanilla cupcakes scented Yummyland toy that I had as a child - including that PVC smell. It doesn’t smell bad or anything, it just smells like a vanilla scented soft plastic toy… and I don’t want to smell like that. 

Unfortunately, as I was sampling all of the Sugar Milk Co. samples that came in the bundle I bought (20 fragrances!), this-smells-like-a-scented-toy has been a common theme with the exception of Powdered Donuts and Banana Pudding. 

Also, I wanted to mention the scented toy thing because I’ve noticed that doll-skin/scented plastic doll perfumes are a common recommendation request in this sub. So, quick side bar! For those of y’all that want to smell like a scented plastic doll, I highly recommend trying out some Sugar Milk Co. samples! 

I will say that they’re kinda spendy at $5 each plus shipping, and the brand doesn’t label the sample vials which is annoying. They do label the package though. You can peel off the label pretty easily and stick it to the sample vials, but for $5 you shouldn’t have to do that. Sometimes they run nice sales on Etsy, but they do not sell their entire line on Etsy. Some scents can only be purchased on their website. 

Anyways, Almond Cookies & Milk is very short-lived and wears close to the skin in a linear fashion. I only get one hour of wear - even with generous application. I would not categorize Almond Cookies & Milk as a milk perfume, or an almond perfume for that matter. I would categorize it as a vanilla scented doll-skin perfume though! I ended up selling my sample.

**Sugar Milk Co. Strawberry Milk**
According to Sugar Milk Co., Strawberry Milk has notes of sweet strawberries blended with whipped cream and milk. On my first two wears, Strawberry Milk smelled like strawberry pop tarts, strawberry milk, and those frosted pink sugar cookies that you either hate or love (there is no in-between). I was very pleased. 

However, after those first two wears, Strawberry Milk started smelling less like food and started smelling EXACTLY like the strawberry scented Latso Huggy Bear stuffed animal! This tickled me so much, and still does. Strawberry Milk would make for a super cute thematic perfume for someone to wear on Halloween dressed as Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (or while watching Toy Story 3 for the upteenth time as one does). Smelling like a scented toy is just not really my thing, so I don’t know if I’ll keep it long term. For now, it’s cute and maybe I’ll wear it again. 

Strawberry Milk wears close to the skin in a linear fashion for about four to five hours. 
I would categorize Strawberry Milk as a milk perfume, but it’s better categorized as THE Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear Perfume™️. 

**Sugar Milk Co. Banana Milk**
According to Sugar Milk Co. Banana Milk has notes of candied bananas blended with lots of sweet vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon, and milk. Banana Milk smells like a green, unripe banana to me, vanilla scented play dough, and doll hair. I don’t get anything milky, spicy, or candy-like/caramelized from it. Banana Milk wears close to the skin for two hours in a linear fashion. Applying Banana Milk generously does not increase longevity or projection. I would not categorize Banana Milk as milk perfume. I would categorize it as a banana perfume and a vanilla perfume though. 

**Hey Sugar Summer Sugar Milk**
In a recent decant swap, I received a decant of Hey Sugar Summer Sugar Milk. Summer Sugar Milk has notes of sugar cane, coconut milk, vanilla orchid, and white musk. Summer Sugar Milk is a clean, sharp, milky, white musk scent with a sour, metallic quality and a hint of coconut flesh. It reminds me a lot of Bath & Body Works Milk, but lighter, sharper, and with the addition of a fleshy coconut note and a soapy white musk. 

It’s nice overall, and reminds me of the Pure body wash that I’ve been using from Dollar Tree. Unfortunately, Summer Sugar Milk is just a bit too sharp and a touch too sour for my tastes. It makes it smell like a yogurt drink. The sourness is not bad enough to make Summer Sugar Milk a scrubber, but it is prominent enough for me to not want to wear it again after the third wear.

Summer Sugar Milk lasts for about four hours with intimate projection. It wears in a linear fashion. I would categorize Summer Sugar Milk as a milk perfume. I would put it into the coconut milk and soapy categories as well. ",9,1762158165.0,FemFragLab,2,1.0,False

Sorry for any punctuation errors, I’m on mobile. Myself and my gf have been dating for the past three months. To give context to what’s going on now. We have known each other for the past 3 years, and use to date. Also she does have children, and I’m childless. I originally met her at a gas station I use to stop at on my way into work. We got to talking and it took me a lot of time to build up the courage to ask for her number. One day she complimented my tattoos and it gave me the courage to finally ask her out, and for her number. It started out great, and we talk ever everyday about everything. We go out to dates and everything seemed great. We officially started dating. However not long into the relationship (like 3ish weeks) she grew distant and cold. One instance I drove an hour into town to pick her up on a date, mind you we both agreed on, and she wouldn’t answer my calls or texts when I made over. I sat for an hour then drove back home. She called on my way home to let me know she had a family emergency. That’s totally alright and understandable, but I felt a heads up would have been polite. After this dates began being cancelled on her end. Texts became less frequent. I knew by that point she lost interest and she eventually ghosted me. I’d still come to the gas station on my way to work (it was the only one between my job and house) and it’d kill me seeing her. Months passed she quit and I felt it was all in the past. Eventually I caved and reached back out to her (stupid I know). We started talking again and things seemed great. She started making an effort to come see me. I began to feel we could potentially start dating again. The same pattern started back up. We’d make plans and she’d cancel them. However during this time I was scrolling through social media and it recommended her as a friend. I didn’t know she was on the platform so I thought why not check her page. I clicked on her account and found a link to her spicy page. I was in shock. I hate it but I clicked the link. I couldn’t see anything, but I was able to see dates and time of her post on there. Turns out the times she bailed on our plans she was posting on the page. That was an instant stab to the heart. I messaged her about it, and was upset. She was extremely defensive, and told me she could do what she wants. That’s is true, and I wasn’t okay with it. So I told her I couldn’t continue being in her life, and I was hoping things would have been different this time around. I then blocked her on social media, and her phone number. This brings us to recently. I’ve since moved out of state, and started a new life. About 5 months ago I was drinking with a co worker and was buzzed. I was curious and added her on Snap. She literally added me back instantly. I panicked, and told my buddy I may have messed up. After I sobered up I decided I made my choice and I’d leave her on it. During that month every time I posted, I noticed she was always the first to look at it. It wasn’t until a month later on my bday she messaged me, wishing me a happy birthday. I was polite, thanked her, and left it at that. About a week later I posted about my motorcycle, and she messaged me. Asking if it was a new one or the one I took her out on. From then on we started talking every day. I found out she doesn’t make her spicy content anymore. She went back into a job she enjoys, and overall changed a lot. With the distance between us now, I felt there was no chance for us to work, so I was genuinely enjoying her company. We have so much in common from our interests to music, it felt like we’ve known each other forever. One week I decided I wanted to come see her. We shared our locations on Snap, so she knew where I was, and so I could find her house(we keep the feature on since then). So we made plans for a weekend, and I booked a hotel down the road from her house. That night we chose to go to the movies. I picked her up at her house, it went well. I returned to the hotel, and was excited for the next day. The following day I picked her up, we went shopping, walking around downtown, and even checked out an arcade. We played air hockey for hours, and that’s when the spark hit me. I held myself back from giving her a hug because I didn’t want to cross any line. I told myself there’s no way this could work, with the distance and all. I stayed over at her house for the first time ever that night. Overall all It was an amazing weekend. She told me in 2 weeks she’d travel down to see me. I didn’t want to hold my breath due to our past. She proved me wrong though. She showed up, and we spent another amazing weekend together. She told me she wanted to make plans for a big event coming up by me in 2 months, and of course I said yes(this is important later). She came down again a few weeks later, and officially asked to be my gf. She met my family, told me if she didn’t have kids she’d move down here in a heart beat. It’s moving fast for sure, but I was on cloud 9 at this point. She then told me she wanted me to meet her kids, and of course I wanted to. Mind you I’m extremely nervous/terrified, I’ve never met a significant others kids. I went up on her weekend with the kids, and overall it was a good weekend. We took them to the park, to dinner, and I got fancy drawing out of it. I felt a lot better, and started to think I could see a future with her and them. However the weekend after this we were supposed to go to the event by me. She told me she didn’t want to make the drive. I told her it’s alright I can come up and see her. Literally a few days before, she said she’s stressed and needs alone time. She didn’t want me to come up. I understood and said that’s alright I understand. That weekend though I noticed she left me on delivered and got concerned. I checked the Snap map and saw she was at a specific house in another town for a few hours. I was confused, but figured maybe she’s just busy, or with a friend. Once she messaged she had told me she was DoorDashing. It made sense. A week after that I closed on a house, and was busy moving in. I wasn’t messaging as much, due to how hectic it was. She mentioned to me that she understood, but it bothered her that I wasn’t messaging as often. After that our texts became shorter and shorter and I felt something was off. I’d ask how she was doing it it’d be “fine”. It became hard to hold a conversation when there wasn’t much in return. She told me she found out a relative was passing, and was flying out of state with her mom to see her. I understand and that it was a positive. While on the trip I’d message asking how everything was going. I’d be left on read, but Snap would show she was active. I’d get an occasional text from her, and I’d respond, and the same thing. Left on read but active. I was even left on read, but she posted a mirror selfie. I messaged her saying I’m sorry for relative, and how it’s good she’s helping her mom. It just bothered me how I was left on read, but was able to post. She instantly apologized, and said she had to take the pic quickly, before leaving the hotel. She also told me she’s been extremely busy and hasn’t been on her phone (but remember she’s been active a lot). It stuck me as odd but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She said she’ll work on messaging me. After she returned home, she told me her mother may have a terminal illness. I felt for her, and wished more than anything I could be with her during this time. I’d ask how she was holding up, but I’d always get the response “fine”. I wasn’t sure the right questions to ask, and it’d lead to our short convos turning into fights. She’d tell me I’m not calling her anymore, making an effort, and not supporting her emotionally. She’d mention that I didn’t ask about certain situations about her life. A little context I use to call her in the morning before I went to work, but she started sleeping through it. So i stopped. She use to call me when she got off work, because she got off after me, but she  stopped. I felt maybe I should have been calling her, rather than waiting for her to reach out. I  began to feel I was failing as a partner. This leads us up to this last week, and tonight. Originally we had plans for to fly for vacation, but with everything going on she couldn’t take time off. I told her I missed her and I’d like to see her still. If it’s alright I’d like to still come up and see her this weekend. She told me that’s fine. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with my extra days off before the weekend, but I knew I needed to be there by Saturday. I left Wednesday morning, stopping in a new town. That night she was very distant. I called her, and she went off on me. I haven’t made an effort, I don’t listen to her, she always has to repeat herself. That she needs me, but I’m not there emotionally. I told her I’ve been working on it, but I can’t change over night. She acknowledged I didn’t ask about an event in her life and that’s why she messaged me. She also told me she wasn’t originally going to answer my call, and I was lucky she did. Things calmed down and seemed to be normal again. I noticed that we went from super bffs on snap chat, to just best friends. I mentioned to her how I noticed, and how I’m not her number 1 anymore. She said well she must not be mine either. I sent a screenshot showing she was still mine, so I asked who hers was. She said it was her nephews wife. I acknowledged it and the convo shifted to her telling me about an update for her favorite video game. She then said she’d call me back because her sister was calling. About an hour so so later she messaged, saying she’d call doesn’t mean to offend me but am I leaving Sunday. I told her I can if that’s what she wants, but originally I was going to leave Monday morning. She knew I’m off till this coming Tuesday. She then said she has a-lot going on, and is stressed. I asked her what was stressing her out. She then tells me because I didn’t give her a plan, her nephew and his wife invited her to dinner Sunday. She’ll tell them now, since I couldn’t give her my plan. I was taken aback, she knew I was coming up this weekend, and knew I was off till Tuesday. I told her she knew I was going to be there this weekend, and the only thing I didn’t have planned was everything leading up to it. She said it’s fine, it’d be nice if I told her my plans and she’d just cancel. I literally told her my step by step plan I had for Saturday, but the message wasn’t opened till the next morning. I woke up to her saying she didn’t need a step by step just a well be here doing this, and that. That response confused me. We literally didn’t talk much that Thursday. Friday wasn’t much different, except I asked how trick or treating with her kids went, and I was left on read. Come Saturday, I woke up at 8am so I can make it to the florist to pick up my order. I drove to the coffee shop, then headed towards her house around 10am. I called her, no answer. She called me back and turns out she was still sleeping. I expressed my apologies, that I’d assumed she’d be up by then. She said it was fine and how far I was out. I told her 10min, and she freaked. I proceeded to get you didn’t tell me the plan or the time, my house is a mess, I haven’t showered and such. I felt terrible but the plan was to show up with flowers, her coffee, and a stuffed animal as a surprise. I made it to her house, and rang the doorbell. It took her a good 5ish min to open the door. She proceeds to tell me how I failed in planning and slammed her bed room door. She came back out, but kept her distance. Arms crossed and no eye contact whatsoever. We began having a talk about our issues, and she’s telling me how she needed me but I can’t even call her. How I say things will be better when I get up there, but I’m not so I have to do what I can through the phone. I feel terrible, and I apologize. She said she knows she’s a lot, and she told me, and that I said that was alright (it’s true, it’s just been challenging when things feel off. Also when I do ask most responses are fine). I gave her a hug and reassured her I want to be here for her. This long distance is new to me, but I’m trying my best. She gets a dress on, and ask what we’re doing. I told her I had planned to take her to get her nails done. She said she goes to a specific shop, and they’re booked out for a month. I then told her I also thought a spa day would be good. She said any other day she’d like that, but not today. She sit on the couch, so I sit next to her. I give her a hug again, but remains closed off. I get up and sit on the other couch. She appears deep in thought. I asked what was on her mind because her arms/legs are crossed and we haven’t made eye contact this entire time. No response. I the. I ask what would she be doing today, if I didn’t show up. She mentioned a lazy day, reading and such. I asked if she wanted me to leave, no response. I asked if she wanted me to stay, no response. So I asked her if there was anything she needed to tell me about. She gets a super angry look, and states straight into my eyes. She says, what are you getting at? I told her nothing, just she’s in thought, and I’m trying to figure out whats going on. I mentioned I do have insecurities with how things needed last time, and how I don’t want to be hurt again. She then tells me to leave. I said alright, and left. As I’m driving down the road she then posts a provocative pic on her Snapchat, smiling, all dressed up. I messaged her that, that post hurt, and it’s a low blow. She then proceeded to message back, I posted it to prove you’re right about me, I’m the same person, I never changed. I told her I knew she wasn’t like that anymore, but it’s not right she posted that to make me jealous. She then said she didn’t post it to make me jealous. I asked why she posted it then. Then I messaged wait a min, does that mean you’re talking to someone else. She said she isn’t. I told her I’d be booking a hotel by her house if she’d like to talk, or go on a date later. I drove 9 hours to see her, so I wanted to try to work through this before I left. That night I was left on read. I called and went straight to voicemail. She did respond when I asked if she was doing alright, but mentioned how i ruined the entire day. I asked if I could at least bring her a coffee in the morning, before I leave in the morning. She said no, I made her really uncomfortable today, and disrespected her in her house. I said alright, I’ll just head home in the morning, and good night. She then messages me a long text how it hurt her that I brought up her past. I reassured her that’s my issue, and I want us to work. I will start therapy when I get home. Last night I did email 6+ therapist. Today she messages me she’s sorry about what happened. I told her she has nothing to be sorry about. I’ve made my choices, and I have to deal with the consequences. She tells me it affects her too. I acknowledged that it does, and with everything going on it was wrong for me to add to her stress. She told me to drive safe. On my drive home she posted an even more provocative pic of her in a skirt. I knew she had dinner plans but posting that really bothered me. Literally the entire time we’ve started dating again she never posted pics like that. I looked at the snap chat map again and she was back at the house she door-dashed at a few weeks prior. I messaged asking if she was door dashing again. Over an hour later she said yes. Then said she was off to meet her nephew and wife. However her location was at barns and noble. Then she said they were doing to the nephews wife’s parents. The map showed she went back to that same house. Afterwords I called and we talked, discussing our issues again. This time I also emphasized how uncomfortable the post are making me. It seems like it was a bit better. Then she said she was going to bed, and we said our goodnight. I then posted on my snap about a concert I want to see, and she was the first to look at it. I thought she was in bed, clicked on our convo, it said she was two towns over. So I opened the map, then her location turned off. It felt really odd. I messaged her “Are you doing alright? I noticed you were in blank town and now your location is off”. No response so I texted her the same message. She then messages me that her nephews car broke down. Her snap crashed. She trying to log back in, but it won’t let her. She’s heading to get him. She’ll let me know when she gets home. She messaged me 20min later she made it home. Honestly I’m starting to question everything, and idk if there is more going on. Am I over thinking or could she be cheating on me? Also sorry I went a bit long on this post. This is all new to me.",2,1762158020.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball clash so statistically convoluted, it could make a spreadsheet weep. On Monday, November 3, 2025, the Central Michigan Chippewas (14-17 last season, 8-6 at home) host the Appalachian State Mountaineers (17-14 overall, 5-8 on the road) in a season opener that’s less “March Madness” and more “January Ice Age in Mount Pleasant.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s whiteboard and the wit of a halftime comedian.

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

Appalachian State enters as a 2-point favorite, per the BetMGM line, with a total of 138.5 points. Translating that into implied probabilities (because we’re all mathletes here), their moneyline odds hover around **54-57%** (depending on the bookie), while Central Michigan’s sits at **47-49%**. Not exactly a landslide, folks—this is the basketball equivalent of a photo finish in a tortoise race.

Defensively, both teams are sieve enthusiasts. Central Michigan allowed a whopping **72.2 points per game last season**, shooting defense so porous you could plant a garden in their rim. Appalachian State, meanwhile, shot a modest **34.5% from three**—about the accuracy of a sleep-deprived coffee machine. On the bright side, the Mountaineers’ offense averages **67.8 points**, which, while not enough to win a Nobel Prize, should suffice to avoid being shut out… *probably*.

### Digest the News: Injuries, History, and Why Central Michigan’s Court Is Colder Than a Chef’s Freezer

No major injury reports here, but let’s talk about what *is* injured: Central Michigan’s defense. Last season, they averaged **18.1 turnovers per game**—a number so high, it’s practically a second job for their opponents’ ball-hawking guards. Appalachian State’s road record (5-8) is about as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a concrete bunker, but their offense? It’s a steady drip, not a gus

We all have one.

Maybe it's the ""I had a stressful day"" Deliveroo order. Maybe it's the targeted Instagram ad that knows you way too well. Or maybe it's just the siren song of the middle aisle at Aldi.

These are ""spending triggers"", the specific moods, situations, or even times of day that make us reach for our wallets, often without thinking.

Here at GoSaveSum, we're building a tool to help understand these triggers, not to judge them. The first step is always awareness, and we believe talking about it helps everyone.

So, let's open up the floor. What's your kryptonite?

* Is it **boredom scrolling** on Amazon?
* The **""treat yourself""** feeling on payday?
* **FOMO** (Fear Of Missing Out) when you see friends buying something new?
* The classic **coffee and pastry** on the way to work?

No judgment here. Let's share and see how similar we all are. My personal one is buying a new book when I have a stack of unread ones at home!

What's yours?
