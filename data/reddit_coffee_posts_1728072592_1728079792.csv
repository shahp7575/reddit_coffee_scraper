We went to the Saturday morning farmer’s markets. On the way home decided to stop in for a coffee, then when I saw the almond croissants I knew I needed one. 

Amazing croissant, even better coffee. Great vibe inside and plenty of room to sit and chill. My 6 year old son was stoked because he got a marshmallow with his warm milk, so he gives it top marks.

Jeffreeze boasts homemade ice cream but they literally sell Richmans ice cream. The line is very long for a small place for ok servings. Kids play area, but you must bring cash. Kohr's on the other hand takes all kinds of payment's even Apple Pay. Fresh Homemade ice cream I have never seen anywhere else and has a huge variety. Best options I've seen also from food, coffee, soda, baked goods, and candies. Rotating flavors as every time you come back there is a new flavor.

Currently I just take that money and drop it into my personal savings account (which has about $9K in it) but i'm sure there's better ways for me to be investing that money! 🤔 Does anyone have any advice of ways to delegate that money better?! Thanks! 


Here are the answers to some questions I anticipate people may ask: 

- No, I am not contributing to any retirement accounts right now. :/ 

- I feel like i'm already spending my money pretty responsibly... The only ""elective"" things I pay for are the Petco Rewards payment (which actually saves me money per month, i've done the calculations!), the Kindle Unlimited Subscription and my $50 of personal money. If you have any suggestions on ways to tighten the budget up any more i'm all ears but please know that i'm doing the best I can. I rarely buy anything for myself, I don't get coffee or treats, I clip coupons, I use family/friends steaming services, etc. 

- No I do not have a car payment! Luckily I own my car! 

- This monthly budget does not account for any unexpected charges (medical bills, vet bills, car needing service, etc.) I typically have to dip into my savings when those things arise :/ 

- I have a credit card but just pay the listed bills/gas with it and pay it off in full every month to keep my credit score up. I do not use it to buy anything else. ",1,1728079103.0,Money,0,1.0,False

I’m about to start an animal-based diet in a few days and would really appreciate any advice, insights, or success stories to keep me motivated. I have attempted a carnivore diet three times in the past, but unfortunately, I struggled with binge eating (which I’m working on with a support group). I’ve also had a history of yo-yo dieting and have tried almost every diet trick in the book—without long-term success.

A little about me: I’m a 36-year-old mother of two, 5’3”, and currently weigh 170 lbs. My ultimate goal is to regain control over my health and feel amazing, and if I lose weight along the way (my goal weight is between 120-130 lbs), that would be a welcome bonus.

At the moment, I walk about 10,000 steps a day and do a 30-minute workout that includes light cardio and some strength training with 2-5 lb dumbbells. I naturally fast for at least 16 hours a day (life with kids keeps me busy!), and I’m also a big coffee lover. I’m exploring alternatives to pasteurized whole milk for my coffee and would appreciate suggestions.

I recently stocked up on some essentials from Costco, including ribeye steaks, whole-fat yogurt, bananas, blueberries, peaches, apples, avocados, eggs, raw cheese, raw honey, raw maple syrup, and coconut water—all organic, etc.

I’d love to hear about your experiences with this way of eating, any tips for handling cravings, and advice on exercise and staying consistent. Thank you all for your support!",1,1728078910.0,AnimalBased,1,1.0,False

1fwawuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/glioblastoma/comments/1fwawuw/sending_love_to_the_group/,Sending Love to the Group,"Hi everyone. I posted a few days ago about my beautiful father passing away on Monday night, only 4 days ago. We just held the funeral today, and everything from the viewing to the mercy meal was beautiful. My father died at 61, after fighting GBM for just short of 3 years. He was such a strong fighter. He went through a lot. The poor guy had his head open 4 times, went through a lumbar drainage procedure, lost his ability to walk, lost his ability to talk, and even lost his ability to eat because he kept choking which gave him pneumonia at the end of it all. He was fighting this disease, all while battling heart failure and diabetes. He fought long and hard to be present for my mother and I, but the Lord needed him more than we did. During his last two weeks on earth, he managed to pass by with a few sips of apple juice or water before he peacefully took his last breath the night of September 30, 2024. Being only 25 years old, I couldn’t help but ask the Lord, “Why him? Why now?” But, I know what I have to do now. It’s my turn to continue to carry the strength my father passed down to me, and I will continue to fight the same way he did. Not only for my family, but for myself, and especially for his legacy. 

I was his only daughter, and I remember just how much he spoiled me throughout my life. The endless gifts, the endless laughter, the ultimate protection against evil, and most importantly, the endless love he provided me with. I was once afraid of death, but this experience has taught me to not be afraid because we will all meet again on the other side. I will continue to be strong just like he was for me, and one day I will be able to give him a big hug yet again while enjoying our daily morning coffee together.

I wanted to say that this group has helped me tremendously through all of this. I felt so alone prior to joining this group, and now I feel like we are all one big family fighting for a cure to end this disease. While my father was unlucky to fight GBM prior to a cure, I pray that soon a solution will be found so that the rest of you can spend a little longer with your loved ones. This group is full of so many lovely, caring, and genuine people. So many of you have big hearts, and that is one of the biggest reasons why I feel surrounded by love. I wanted to sincerely thank all of you who may have commented on my posts with nice comments, the ones who offered advice, and to the ones who may have silently sent their prayers. I appreciate each and every one of you, and I appreciate the unity within this group. 

Thank you all, and may his memory be eternal. 👼❣️",2,1728078829.0,glioblastoma,2,1.0,False

Which ever bag I choose to open first gets the corner cut to minimise air exposure. I take out my daily portion of beans and it then gets folded over and put in a cupboard. I want to improve this and minimise contamination. If I get a vacuum tub that fits 1kg of beans, I don’t want to be breaking that seal and resealing daily as I use the beans. What about keeping a large vacuum canister on hand for the main bulk and a smaller container that I can use to store, let’s say a week’s worth of beans? If the exposure is limited to a week, will an old jam jar suffice as my ‘weekly storage’?

I feel like she’s a bad example for health and weight loss journey because her diet consists of terrible food. She had two videos recently  of what she eats and how much she eats but a fast food edition. It’s like she’s glorifying fast food. She shows snacks she eats and it’s all processed junk. She posts her drinks which all flavored coffee of protein shake and those are actually high in caloric intake. 

She doesn’t work out, eats garbage and drinks liquor often but talks about weight loss. None of that is conducive to weight loss and most people who’ve had WLS can get sick eating those things. My mom’s friend had WLS, and the one thing she can’t eat any of is fast food. Even if she had only one bite, she gets sick it’s like her body rejects it.

Something about an arm about how I do something with myself and an arm about how I do something with other people. I really need to learn. I didn’t know yoga involved reading. I can read and overthink about it….. eh, everyone’s different. I need a walk. I think yin is a good practice for me. Being in my body is good for me. But yeah…. I have some more arms to think about. If Yin makes me angry maybe I just need to release anger for my own wellness. Maybe there are legitimate things to be angry about and if I express anger at things that are making me angry - maybe that is what I am supposed to do. Maybe therapy is working. Maybe I should talk to my therapist about this 🤣

🙄 Okay whatever. I guess I have homework. Which is good because there is other homework.

Also I REALLY want to stab people in the eyeballs. Still. More than usual. Probably because the hot garbage mess I am cleaning up is disgusting. Just - so much people following orders 🤮 and I’m not going to do that when it isn’t the right thing to do. I guess I’m 10% done with my freshman year. By my senior year things might be good, LOL. So much GD homework but at least I am not alone.

It’s a systemic issue, not a people issue. At least that’s what my neurotypical besty keeps saying - and she seems pretty healthy. At least I get to do high school with besties this time around. Some people don’t even get to have one besty when they start high school.

Also I have therapy and other things, which is great, because this time in my life is not only great - it is also overwhelming today. I had to use my big girl voice. It came out like a woman’s voice and I used it three times. I am not always liked, and I have to learn to not give a shit as long as I am doing my best and being kind. So much homework this weekend. I plan to abuse coffee. But not alcohol or cigarettes so I’m happy for me.",1,1728078032.0,Diary,0,1.0,False
1fwaltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1fwaltq/advice/,Advice ,"I recently started taking Vyvanse for my ADHD and binge eating disorder.

For reference, I am in Australia. I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist but my GP is the one that prescribes the medications. I’m a student, so getting the initial diagnosis was costly enough, and I couldn’t afford to keep going back and forth with a psychiatrist to titrate the doses, so they gave me and my GP advice on doses and left us to titrate ourselves.

I wanted to ask about some symptoms, because I have never taken any medication or any recreational amphetamines before. 

I have been taking it for a week, 30mg at around 8.00-9.00am. I have defiantly noticed an effect on my appetite where I don’t feel the need to constantly snack, but I don’t THINK I feel it in any other way?

I have also had mild headaches at around 3.00-400pm on 5/7 days. I’m not sure if this is associated with the Vyvanse or not, it’s not unbearable, just noticeable.

My question is, if I go to 50mg, is this likely to:

A) suppress appetite even more (don’t need)
B) increase negative side affects 

Any tips or advice would be appreciated. I had a look on the reddit before talking it and I make sure I take it with a high protein breakfast and I have stopped drinking coffee (of which I used to drink 3-5 cups of instant a day) so not sure if the headaches could maybe be caffeine withdrawal.",1,1728078013.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

**I just went on a date with a guy who tried to rob me.**

I can't possibly tell anyone I know about this story, so here it goes:

Two years ago, I returned home from my father's funeral. As soon as I opened the door to my apartment, a guy holding a crowbar came out from my kitchen holding my TV. I live in the city, so robberies are common.

The guy began shouting at me and he clumsily dropped my TV and began holding the crowbar like it was a baseball bat. I was so stunned at what was happening that I didn't move.

The guy screamed at me to empty my pockets. From the stress of the last few days with my father passing away, I simply started crying. Not out of fear at what was happening, but because this was literally the worst time of my life. The worst moment. The worst minute and second.

While crying hysterically, I gave the guy my wallet. I just sat on my floor and hugged my knees and told him, through my tears, to ""take whatever you want."" He hesitated, looked down at me. He dropped my wallet and sat down beside me. Immediately, he began to comfort me. He began to apologize. He put my TV back on the table and told me it wasn't damaged. He told me that he lost his job and that his mom needed medicine that he couldn't afford and that they were homeless.

He told me all of this while I just wailed; I cried for my father, who was lost, I cried for my future, for it was uncertain, and I cried because my home had been intruded on in the most violent way.

For a good 10 minutes I sat in the floor with a guy who had every intent to rob me, telling me that it would be okay and that he was sorry. He begged me not to call the police. I just started screaming at him to get out.

He ran away so fast that he left the crowbar. I threw it after him as he ran down the street.

Two days later, I came home from work and he was sitting in front of my door. I was so terrified that I pulled out my phone, but he had this look on his face of--I'm not sure how to describe it--remorse, regret? He told me that he told his mom what he did, and his mom made me some soup. He handed me this tiny bowl wrapped in tin foil. Again, I was stunned and overwhelmed and angry that I slapped the bowl out of his hands and it shattered on the floor. I told him to leave or I was calling the police. He left. I remember he looked upset. I left the soup and shattered bowl outside my door, almost as a warning for him to not come back.

About three months after that, I got a note in my mail slot from the guy. He told me his mother had passed away and that he was no longer homeless and that he had a job. He wanted to repay me for breaking into my apartment. He wrote down his address and told me that I was welcome to break into his place if I wanted, but he didn't have much stuff.

This all overwhelmed me. I threw away the letter, but I remembered his address. I remember walking by there one day, out of curiosity. It was a ratty apartment building across the city. He was walking up to his room and he saw me. He waved. I turned away and left. He ran after me, apologized again. Told me that he never meant to do what he did. He showed me the program from his mother's funeral that he kept in his wallet. He wasn't lying, she was real. He was real. He was a real person.

I don't know what it was, but I believed him. We slowly began to grow together as people? I can't describe it.

After a year of maintaining communication and learning about who he was, he enrolled in a local community college and began taking courses to earn credits before applying to university. I helped him study for his history class a lot. He's great at math and science, though.

I never invited him over to my apartment, however. No matter how much I got to know him, I was still afraid of him. And he knew that. He knew that I couldn't trust him.

But tonight, we went out for coffee because he said he had an exam in his world civ class. When I got there, he said he forgot his book. We just talked for a bit, we laughed, and then he told me he wanted to cook for me. On a whim, I decided to invite him to my apartment. After picking up some things from the grocery store, he came over. I was so nervous that I was shaking. He noticed, he squeezed my hand, and then he made dinner.

It was amazing. We talked, we laughed, we sat in the floor and watched a movie on the TV he tried to steal. We made jokes about it.

And then he told me that he missed his mom. I gave him a hug. Then he left.

I don't know what I feel, but I do know that I can't give up on people anymore.

Some people just have the shit end of life. Maybe things have a way of working themselves out?

And I miss my dad, too.

**EDIT/UPDATE** I am...beside myself to log on this morning and see this at the top of this page. I have been a redditor for a few years, but never thought this would happen. Also, to those of you who are messaging/commenting to confirm the validity of this--I guess it never occurred to me when I wrote this that it sounded so... ridiculous? It really does, I don't blame you for saying it's false, but it's real. He's real. I'm real. It all happened/is happening currently. Thank you all who have messaged me and commented! And thank you to the two people that gave me gold--this is just insane to me. I'm so grateful, so very grateful.

**EDIT 2** Sorry for neglecting this; today has been insane with work and hosting a friend's bridal shower. I want to clarify a few things about this, because I am getting a *LOT* of messages about a lot of different things.

* People are saying that I am being too ""trusting"" of him after what happened. You're right, I suppose. I mean, I live in the heart of one of the most dangerous cities. My friend was robbed just a few years ago and was actually physically injured as a result of it, so me ""trusting"" him did not constitute me giving him a hug after he broke in. It was much, much more than that.
* My dad died of a brain aneurysm in March 2013. He passed away peacefully in his sleep. The thing about my dad, though, was that he was the most generous, most kindest man in this world. I know people like to say that about their parents, but it's true about my dad. When I was 4, I remember him giving these guys a ride from prison--they were released after serving their sentence, but had to walk to get to where they were going. My dad picked them up, had them hop in the back of his pick-up truck, and took them home. He put his life, and basically mine, at the hands of these people who could have hurt us. They didn't, thank God. My dad taught me to be selfless and understanding of the world, and of people, and I loved him for that. But when I lost him, it shattered me and turned me into an entirely different person.
* After my dad died, I became severely depressed and angry. I was angry at everything. I had to take a leave from my job (I teach second grade). All day, I would lay in bed and think about how much I hated God--or whatever higher power--for taking my dad away. Nothing seemed worth it. After the guy--my *friend*--broke into my apartment, I hated him for a while. I hated my dad for making me so trusting (because I didn't call the cops on the guy). I hated my dad for dying, I hated him for being so incredibly compassionate and better than me. I hated myself for being vulnerable. I just hated everything.
* The guy who tried to rob me is a person. And of course, I constantly ask myself when I'm with him, ""What happens if he tries to hurt me? Or rob me again?"" But the thing about him is that--he *knows* I'm thinking this, and he constantly tries to reassure me. We have grown together as people, as I said. There's a whole two years that I didn't post in this recounting because it would be like a novel-length post. Do I ""like"" him? I don't think so. I don't think he ""likes"" me. I think we both understand, respect and honor the other for our mutual struggles. We're proud of each other, and we're both guilty of things. Me for shutting out my friends, family and students and becoming an awful person after I lost my dad, and him for going to incredible lengths to try and save his mother from experiencing incredible agony in her final moments.
* I intend to show him this post. I want him to know. He doesn't have a computer or internet, but I think he'll find this humorous. His story is not mine to tell; how his mother died is not my story to tell; what exactly drove him to pry open my front door with a crowbar is not for me to tell; what happened to his family is not for me to tell. But what is for me to tell is that he is a human; he is flawed; God, he's so flawed. But after knowing him, and learning about his life--about his childhood and the tiny little child who used to be so passionate about school and learning as he was, as he told me, I know that he has his story. I have my story. You have yours.
* And although I think it is irrelevant, the thought of even dating after the last few years hasn't crossed my mind. Was I involved in relationships prior to my dad's passing? Yes. One was long-term and had a foreseeable end with an engagement, but things happen. Life happens.

I'm meeting with him tomorrow at his work, while he's on break, to give him some old study materials that I have from a literature class I took in college. It's all so normal, and I'm not afraid. My dad was never afraid, so I shouldn't have to be. I choose not to be.

**First Update - Two Days Later**

Hey! So I posted a couple of days ago about how I went on a date with this guy who tried to rob me. This is just a quick follow-up. Nothing major.

Last night, I showed him the post and some of the comments from you guys. He was a little apprehensive about this place, and the fact that I had shared this with the entire world. But the comments really made him so happy. He wanted me to thank you all, and I tried to get him to make a post of his own, but he thinks it's too weird. Plus, he considers himself a ""bad speller.""

I just wanted to update everyone with this little unimportant tidbit. My dad's birthday is in a few weeks. I always have to prepare myself for it year-round, really. But this year is different, because I know I have people to support me. Especially a really close, new friend, who came--well, I'd like to say out of nowhere, but he really just came out of my kitchen holding a crowbar.

One more thing--when I showed him the post, he looked up at me and went, ""Wait...it was a date?"" And I got *so* embarrassed. Then he laughed and told me that he was relieved, because he thought it was a date. We haven't talked about anything else along the lines of dating in the future.

I just wanted to extend my gratitude, my thanks, and my love--as well as his--to you all. Thank you, thank you.

>He wanted me to thank you all, and I tried to get him to make a post of his own, but he thinks it's too weird. Plus, he considers himself a ""bad speller.""

If you're both comfortable with it, you should totally do an AMA here together.

Then again... Maybe not. Leading questions from a few thousand rabid Redditors is a lot of pressure for a new, already complicated, relationship.

Either way, thank you for sharing your story, and the update.

**Second Update - Six Months Later**

I’ve been trying to write this for the past three months, but I always kept getting busy. I truly don’t know what to say because so much has happened in the six months since I wrote all this down for the first time.

I want to say this for me, to get this off my chest: I cared about him. I cared for him. I did, I can’t deny that.

In January, right after the new year started, I got a phone call at half-past two in the morning from *him*. He was in jail; he and two of his friends were arrested for public intoxication and possession of drug paraphernalia. He wanted me to bail him out. I’m a teacher living on a teacher’s salary. I said no, I couldn’t. This is when things fell apart.

Before then, he and I had been incredibly close. We spent Christmas together. I didn’t have enough money for a plane ticket home, so I stayed in the city. He came over, we cooked, watched movies. Before Christmas, we spent Thanksgiving together. I helped him study. I helped him get his finances in order. He had no idea how to do taxes and how to do all of the “adult stuff,” as he said.

But I noticed I started doing things I didn’t normally do. He would come over in the middle of the night, visibly panicked, and ask if he could stay with me. I let him, no questions asked. I stopped asking questions because I *wanted* to believe that he was good and everything was fine. He started asking me that if “others” asked about him if I would lie and say I didn’t know him. This scared me, but I assumed it was about work stuff. I wanted it to be his work stuff.

He was released from jail about a week later. He didn’t talk to me. I called his apartment. Nothing. I came home from work one day and a woman was waiting outside my door. She appeared disheveled. She was wearing a tank top and flip flops in mid-January in the northeast. It was cold. When I tried to key into my apartment, she started verbally attacking me. She told me to “stay away” from *him*. Like she owned him. She told me that she knew “what I did” to him. And that I would “get what’s coming.”

She left. I was scared out of my mind. Before calling the police, I decided to call his apartment one last time. He answered. I told him about the woman. He apologized, said that he was “seeing” her. He didn’t intend for her to come over and interfere. But that led me to another question: how did she know where I live? And how many others had he told where I lived?

He hesitated before answering, I remember that. He just said he was sorry. I immediately packed an overnight bag, grabbed my most valuable items, and went to stay in a hotel. I used my credit card (my “only in case of emergencies” card). Because I no longer felt safe, because of him.

I came back to my apartment the next day. Everything was fine. *He* came over to apologize. I told him to get out. I started crying. When I’m angry, I cry. He tried to hug me, but I remember picking up a piece of wood (I had a dismantled Ikea shelf) to protect myself. I demanded to know what he was doing. He told me he was selling drugs; he told me that he “had” to do it because he knew people that would hurt him. Lies. I guess. I don’t know.

I told him to get out, never want to see him again. Etc. Etc. He got angry, threatened to “come back” with his friends. I was wracked with guilt for trusting him. He apologized again, said he was sorry. I was questioning everything about him. I pushed him out. Locked the door.

The teaching program I’m a part of rotates teachers in and out of schools across the country. Last year I put in a request to move across the country to be closer to home. Two weeks after this encounter with *him*, I found out that my request was accepted and I was set to leave in March.

My apartment was broken into and vandalized in early February. At night, *he* would come and knock on my door. I would call the police but he would always leave before they got there. His “guys” started harassing me. Nothing was ever stolen, just broken. They broke a glass bottle my dad made for me when I was six. He knew how much that meant to me. It was shattered.

The week before I left, I saw him outside my building. I called the police. He was walking over to me, and I remember having this fiery rage in me. It was this impassioned, red, angry heat that washed over me and I took my keys (which are on a lanyard) and I just started hitting him. I ended up cracking his eye socket. When the police questioned him, they realized he was the one that was harassing me. He was wanted for a myriad of other charges.

After he fell down (after I cracked his eye socket with my keys), I started kicking him. I wanted him to die. I really did. Then I thought about what my dad would think.

But then I realized—I’m not my dad. I will never be him. I’m different. This is different. People are different. Not all of them are good. But some of them are. *I am good.* I am a good person.

Right now I’m sitting in my new apartment in a brand new city. It’s warm. Rent is cheaper. I live in a neighborhood of old people. They’re nice. They love that I teach kids. It makes them feel safe, I guess. Some days I leave my front door open and let in a breeze. I’m never afraid.

The beach is literally a seven minute walk (I’ve timed it) from my back door. I’m happy.

So I’m putting this to rest. It’s done. It’s over. I’m tired. I’m posting this and not checking back anymore. I just wanted to tell someone, because no one in my personal life even knew this was happening. I still can’t believe it happened. But it did. And it’s done.

Holy hell I remember reading the first part to your story half a year ago and now seeing this is just all too surreal. It's a shame things turned out the way it did. It's a shame he turned out to just be a manipulative psycho who was only in it for his on pleasure. I'm glad you're in a better place though. Cheers mate!

I'm looking for a 7x9 rug for this space and I just cannot decide a pattern. I really would like a rug that would include the terracotta color of the chairs, but finding one in that size has been challenging. I'm between the distressed modern or maybe a bolder pattern.

Here are my options so far:

Mad, mad busy day today. Two of us on shift, one on food, me on the front, taking orders, making drinks, both of us battling with trying to keep the dishes down & tables clean.
Lady comes up to the counter & orders a drink. She had a walking frame & was the sweetest thing, so despite the queue, I told her to sit down & I'd bring her drink to her.
Customers were really understanding, so far, so good.

On my way back to the counter, there's an empty cup & teapot on a table. Picks them up to bring them in for a wash, and felt 'breath' on my neck. Turns my head, and there she is, this Karen.. ""what do you think you're doing? They're MINE"" *Oh, I'm just clearing the table on my way in so you can sit down* ""THEY ARE MINE""
Puts the empty cup & teapot back on the table and returns to the counter.

Three customers later, I hear ""HER. That's her. She tried to steal my bag"" *Me, wtf?!* 

She proceeds to get louder & louder, telling people I tried to steal from her, so I calls the store manager up. He speaks to her and she denies it, although by this point there's about 5 regulars calling her out on it.

Manager walks into the back, and calls the police. Says there's more than enough people willing to back me, so we'll make it official. Meanwhile, I'd gone out to check on the old dear with the walker & passed Karen's table on the way back. Bent down and told her if she wanted to complain about me moving an empty teapot she was welcome to, but she was to never speak about me or call me out behind my back ever again.

She made a huge pantomime about leaving, clutching the bag to her chest, double checking everything was there - just long enough for her to run into the police coming in, as she was going out.

Long story short, police viewed the CCTV, spoke to customers and then to Karen, telling her that I clearly never touched her bag, and she needed to be careful what she was accusing people of. Something about damaging my reputation & job prospects equalling slander (?)

Karen eventually exits the building, with the store manager running after her. Handed her a banning letter, effective immediately, duration forever.

One point I made clear throughout the interview process is that I would like to have the option to work remotely, at least intermittently (2-3 weeks at a time, for now), to spend time with my partner, who is unable to travel for family/medical reason and my job (in theory) does not require much in-person collaboration, being primarily knowledge-based. Prior to joining MIT, I was working in an (almost) fully remote position, and had to leave due to term requirements.

5 months in, this now seems to be a rather contentious point with my supervisor and I am cautious bringing up the possibility of taking a remote period again, despite having made this point clearly before accepting the position. Further, there are a lot of meetings and lunches arbitrarily strewn throughout the month which require me to be on campus at irregular intervals (to fetch coffee and set up HDMI cables and the like - not in my original job description...), and adds for a lot of stress and frustration managing the Boston commute. Adding more to this, a large portion of the people I work with are largely (may come to campus randing from 1x per week to 1x per month, on average) or entirely (international appanage researchers, but also a large degree of support staff) remote, or simply refuse to come in during mandatory ""in-person"" meetings, with or without an excuse on hand.

Frankly, I will look into other positions in the medium term, as I don't feel being bound to arbitrary in-person days is benefiting me (or anyone else) in any way, but the job market is quite tough at the moment and I am burnt out from endless applications. Are there any of you at MIT who have managed to succeed in remote work arrangements? Is transferring depts as an internal candidate a typical path for many staffers?

How many of us are thinking about joining our partners knowing we won’t be doing anything stupid and kill ourselves. Just so we could see them again. Hear their voice and feel them physically. But we can’t because we still have responsibilities. We need to be there for our children, our pets, parents and siblings and our friends. So what am i supposed to do?
It’s now over 2 years since my wife passed away. Have I somehow moved on? Hell no!
Have I still kept everything you ever owned because after slowly being forced to erase you from this world ( bank account, any type of insurance, cell phone plan etc.) that is all that is left from you. And I can’t picture myself erasing the last proof that you once lived here by my side. Clothes, perfume, puzzles, coffee mugs , everything is still here and handled carefully. 
And at the same time is this supposed to be it?
Staying faithful to you even when you’re gone sounds incredibly romantic to singles and couples but it is so unbelievably hard and difficult mentally and physically. I long for that feeling of love again. But my mind still thinks about you daily. I want to be hugged again. And not a friendly hug, I mean a hug from your partner that is so different. I want to make two cups of coffee in the morning. I want to cook together, make plans for the weekend, redecorate the house again although I don’t see why that is necessary. I miss being a partner because we were so good at it. And I long for that feeling again. And every time only you pop in my head. Can’t really picture my life with somebody else and still get slowly crippled by the loneliness I face every evening, every holiday every fu**Ing day. 
How can I let somebody new in my life while still being so attached to our past? But still we all know, especially us younger widows, life isn’t fair and doesn’t own us anything. I feel as if time is running out in ever finding someone new again that in terms of quality in love would be on paar to our relationship. We all get older, carry more baggage with us and it just isn’t getting easier the older we get. 

If you only knew in what kind of a mess you left me. I am glad that you don’t.

One week before Christmas I get a call from the agency I was contracting with saying that my contract was not going to be renewed.

I live in the UK and had been working from home for about 6 months following the lockdown. I was part of a small team, one member of the team was a weasel in love with his own brain. He used a lot of big words and waffled on in front of the client basically an expert turd polisher of the highest caliber. I was more succinct and just stuck to the facts when reporting on the progress of my analysis.

So the whole project was a bit of a shitshow. Client kept changing their mind about how they wanted this part analysed. I was just a contractor and as such had to do what they said.

I never did find out why it was me they decided to can me but I can guess. I think the multiple changes and delays were put on me and weasel boy obviously convinced them he was very much more valuable than me.

For a bit of background this guy was a serious dick. I was once tasked with checking some of his analysis.

I did.

I found some errors in his calculations.

I corrected them and sent them back.

He didn't like that.

Not. One. Bit.

So, he takes the knife to her laughing as he does it and turns to me and says ""why so Serious!?"", let's put a smile on that face of yours...

... Sorry, lost my train of thought there. ANYWAY, I correct his calculations and give him a much simpler way of doing it.

Rather than use my method (which was correct) he spends TWO DAYS with his weaselly little face buried in a maths textbook looking up a more advanced matrix method (which did the same thing as what I had given him but he was too busy jerking himself off over matricies and how great they are). Bear in mind the following...as contractors we were there to get the job done. He had a method (the one I gave him) and he refused to use it. He wasted two days of the clients money looking up a method that did the same thing.

A few days later we were making a coffee and he says that he had sent his calculation off to the client who was ""really impressed with MY matrix method"". I was gobsmacked.

1. You are a little prick and I hate you
2. You wasted two days you little arsehole
3. It isn't YOUR METHOD. You read what others had done and you took the next step, you didn't earn the knowledge for yourself so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had, you'd patented it, and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now you selling it, well...Sorry

So needless to say he was a weasel and a cerebral narcissist and he just needed dropkicking, but he gets kept on.

Enter dickhead #2. This guy is technically our leader and well he was a prick as well but I won't get into that too much.

About 4 months after being let go, I have been scratching around for work for months. I am married and we have 3 kids. Savings used up, my eldest actually gave us money from his trust fund to tide us over. I had taken a job in a warehouse working Sat-Sun-Mon doing 12 hour shifts. it was tough work and the supervisor was a bastard who needed kneecapping.

So I took this so that I could continue to look for work during the week. One day I am sitting there and my phone rings.

# Dickhead2 - Hi how is it going?

# Me - Oh hi. How's it going?

# Dickhead2 - Do you remember that analysis you did? Well do you still have the analysis files? The client has lost them

(you cheeky CUNT! 4 months and not a word, never once tried to help me find work or even drop me a text and now you want MY help...oh my friend there is a special place in HELL for you, you soulless money grabbing cockwomble!!)

# Me - Yes, I think I do, but they are not the latest iteration, you will have to check for some of the later updates

# Dickhead#2 Oh great, if you can send them that would be great!

(send them? why don't I send you to The Backrooms where you can get a Stick Job from an Entity you fucking wanker!?)

# Me - Sure, will do.

I was gobsmacked. How can people be such pricks? The client lost the files? So? Sounds like a personal problem.

You might wonder why I gave him the files?

Well, because I knew something he didn't know.

The reason why I was able to summarize the results of the analysis so quickly was because I had written some code to go through all the output files of the analysis and strip out only the results that we were interested in.

I gave him 40 files.

Have fun manually looking through them and stripping out what you need (it would take ages).

Oh and like I said...they were old files, out of date.

Take them and shove them up your arse and while you are at it tell that weasel that he is a cuckolded little henpecked sphincter and I am glad that his wife spends all his money and his mother in law lives in his house and complains at him.

**Devotional: Building Bridges of Grace**

**Scripture Reading:**

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)

**Reflection:**

In a world often divided by race, culture, and background, the call to build bridges of grace through faith and love is more crucial than ever. The beauty of the Christian faith lies in its radical inclusivity; Scripture shows us that God’s love knows no boundaries. In Galatians 3:28, we are reminded that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus. This powerful truth invites us to embrace diversity, foster understanding, and cultivate genuine relationships across different cultures.

Consider the life of Jesus. He often crossed societal boundaries — engaging with Samaritans, touching lepers, and inviting tax collectors into fellowship. Jesus modeled the heart of God, demonstrating that love transcends societal limitations. As followers of Christ, we are called to do the same, to cultivate relationships that reflect His love and grace.

**Educational Insight:**

Building cross-racial relationships requires intentionality and humility. Here are some practical steps to help cultivate these connections:

1. **Listen Actively:** Approach conversations with an open heart and mind. Take the time to understand the experiences of others, especially those from different backgrounds. Listening breeds empathy and opens the door for deeper relationships.
2. **Learn Together:** Participate in community events, workshops, or discussions that focus on racial reconciliation and understanding. Learning about each other’s histories and cultures can soften hearts and break down walls.
3. **Serve Together:** Engage in service projects that unite people from different backgrounds. Working toward a common goal can foster unity and a sense of shared purpose.
4. **Pray Together:** Prayer is a powerful tool for healing and understanding. Gather with individuals from different backgrounds to pray for your community, the nation, and the world. Inviting God into these relationships invites His grace.
5. **Speak Gracefully:** Be mindful of the language we use. Words can build bridges or barriers. Choose to speak with kindness and respect, recognizing the dignity of every individual.

**Encouragement:**

Building bridges of grace is not always easy, but it is deeply rewarding. Challenges may arise alongside misunderstandings, and reconciliation can take time. However, every step taken in love brings us closer to God’s heart for unity. Remember that you are not alone in this journey. Holy Spirit empowers us to reach across divides, to bond in love, and to extend grace becomes second nature.

As you embark on cultivating cross-racial relationships, hold onto the promise from Jeremiah 29:11. God has plans for us; His desire is for us to grow in love and understanding, fostering communities that mirror His diverse and beautiful creation. Approach this endeavor with faith, knowing that every small act of kindness builds a more profound impact in bridging gaps and healing wounds.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of diversity in Your creation. Teach us to see one another through Your eyes and to embrace our differences as reflections of Your creativity. Help us to build bridges of grace, compassion, and love that honor You. Guide our hearts and actions as we foster relationships across racial and cultural lines. May our communities reflect the unity and peace found in You. In Jesus’ name, we pray, Amen.

**Action Step:**

This week, reach out to someone from a different racial or cultural background. Invite them to share their story over coffee or offer to attend a community event together. Let it be the first step in building a lasting bridge of grace.

1fw9suy,https://www.reddit.com/r/POS/comments/1fw9suy/small_convenience_store_looking_for_new_pos/,Small convenience store looking for new PoS recommendations,"Howdy,

I'm the new owner and manager of a small convenience store. We're on a small (4k full time, 16k summer) island. Incidentally 100% of the profits of the store will be to go support island youth and teens as a teen center is going to be in the upstairs part of the building.

The business used to be part of a single store pharmacy and currently uses RMS. While the RMS customer support has been absolutely exceptional, the software is a bit cobbled together at this point with way more features than we need, the things I would like to be easy are hard, all the staff would like to move away from it, and I worry that it won't support things we want to do in the future.

In looking online for different PoS systems, everything seems like some kind of marketing landing page, especially ones that review PoS systems. So am turning to Reddit for some advice.

Our PoS needs:

* A speedy and great flow for cash (50% of our transactions are cash)
* A speedy general flow, people are coming in for our speed compared to other places
* Hooking up to vendor inventory / speedy inputting of orders etc (EDI either directly or through 3rd party - having to do receiving, invoicing, and ordering manually is a tough to swallow amount of time)
* Customer loyalty / coffee punches (we have a good coffee business and right now use manual punches)
* Online ordering (we don't currently offer it but would like to expand to order and pickup coffee, possibly also moving into more items and locker / box pickup)
* Customer type profiles for discounts / promotions (for example, giving a discount to teens on healthy goods)

Decent reporting is a nice to have.

We're anywhere from 1.5-2.5 million a year in business (still trying to get a sense of the overall business). 

Thanks everyone!

PS: if there are any good trusted sites that do comparisons please also let me know. At this point I assume everything is just one big self-serving marketing thing",1,1728075903.0,POS,0,1.0,False
1fw9spx,https://i.redd.it/0jf3qymu0tsd1.jpeg,Pre-heat a v60,"Hi y’all, I recently discovered a little trick to effectively preheat the v60. 

Using silicone milk bottle caps (very cheap on Amazon) works great. They create an effective seal on the bottom to allow you to let boiling water sit in the v60 while grinding your coffee or otherwise getting set up. Then simply dump out the water right before adding your coffee and you have a pre-heated v60 and rinsed filter ready to go. 

The bottom OD is just about 49mm on the plastic 02. I bought 48mm milk bottle caps for about $5(food safe silicone) and they work great. 

Just thought I’d share as this is a way more effective use of water than running the hot tap as James Hoffman suggests.

This year (previous Post 3 Month ago) i posted a Vid here, hearing my Engine Running and asked for rodknock. Tore the engine out of my NA and opened it up to reseal the whole engine and found no Metalscrapes so far anywhere and it looked cleam but found Oilly residue  and dirt all over the outside of the engineblock. Cleaned it up and swapped out the old Gaskets like Headgasket, Front and rear Crankshaft seals, the O Ring for the CAS aswell as the Valvecover Gasket. Also replaced the Water and Oilpump and resealed the Oilpan after giving it a Good Cleanup. Changed the Timimgbelt with their Pulleys and spring, everything so far so good. 

Now to the Problem: after refilling and Installing a completely new Cooling System (Radiator, Hoses,Themrostat, Waterpump)  i still find Oilstreaks in my Destilled Water.I Found out about it randomly, as i opened up the Radiator cap to look for any Airbubbles still coming out the system. That problem with the Oil occured first time shortly before i got the engine out and tought the Headgasket is failing. Since back then on the highway (german autobahn) i noticed that my NA turned itself into a coffee brewing machine one time and it pushed Darkbrown oily coffe into my coolant reservior tank with Cream. Shortly after, i drove the car and it seemed that the Reservior Tank drained itself and kept driving it for a week never to occur again. Before i took everything apart i flushed the Cooling system 2 times and still had Oil in it. On the 3rd time using Destilled water i also used a Systemcleaner specifically for Car enginecooling systems  to get everything clean before the new cooling system got installed. What can i do now? Headgasket is replaced, no Leakage from the outside, doesnt seem to have any water in my Oil everything from the outside of the Engine is Clean and dry, but also have no noticeable coolant loss but still get Oil in my destilled water? Did i fucked up the Headgasket job?",1,1728075867.0,Miata,0,0.99,False

I planned our wedding in just nine months at a barebones venue that didn’t have preferred vendors, decoration assistance, or catering services. The venue, a historic house from the 1800s, provided the essentials: a bathroom, a reception room, a kitchen (for reheating only), an outdoor ceremony space, parking for 50 guests, and tables, plates, and cutlery.

To save money, we opted for delivered catering and hired separate staff to plate, serve, and clean up. We purchased our own alcohol, and one of the staff members managed that for us. I coordinated all aspects of setup, decor, rentals, and teardown.

I meticulously designed layouts for each buffet table and calculated platter sizes to ensure everything fit perfectly, eliminating any last-minute adjustments. I also wrote the ceremony script, choreographed our first dance, and created the playlist for the evening. I accounted for every detail, from ensuring items were placed at the front of the ceremony right before it started to giving musicians cues for the processional. I made sure the staff knew where to place everything, how to replenish items, and how to prepare the coffee. We even prepared our own veggie and fruit trays, which the staff then plated for our guests.

The only things that did go wrong are because people decided to ignore the timelines thinking they knew better. Hah! Planning a wedding is a huge undertaking, and having worked closely with vendors to create detailed timelines and visual layouts, I know just how crucial it is to get every detail right. I didn’t want to go out in my own until I’d experienced my own wedding firsthand, fully understanding the significance of the day. 

A bad day-of coordinator can derail even the most thoughtful plans. That’s why I want to help people put a solid plan in place, and help on the day so that there’s no room for guesswork, confusion, or delays.

He lives in NYC and has a 2015 Lexus. That’s incredibly high as he 1) hasn’t been in any accidents and 2) barely uses his car. He used to live in a rural area (in a different state) before and his insurance was significantly cheaper. 

The reason why his insurance is so high is because of my 22 year old brother, who lives in the household. I’m trying to help my dad find a new insurance, and I am wondering if it’s okay to omit my brother from it. I know, I know, if my brother is involved in an accident they’re screwed. But honestly, my dad is the kind of guy that doesn’t even let people drink coffee in his car. Never in a million years would he let my brother (or mom, who also lives in the household) drive his car. My brother has been driving since he was 16 and has not once driven my dad’s car, not even to practice driving (my mom and brother had their own cars when they lived in a rural area). If there is an emergency… I think it would be much more likely that they call 911 or an Uber. 

Is it possible to not include my brother when applying for insurance? Or would he be seen by the auto insurance company anyway? Also, if anyone has any recommendations for cheaper insurances, that would be so helpful! Thanks  ",0,1728075331.0,Insurance,9,0.5,False

1fw9gvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1fw9gvk/i_need_a_feel_good_lift/,I need a feel good lift ,"I have focal seizures with impaired awareness that occur almost non-stop. It’s difficult for me to return to normal after these episodes, and during the postictal phase, I experience anger and outbursts. My wife has mentioned she’s never seen me like this before, which is true—I feel like my condition is getting worse. It’s hard to stay calm and composed when I’m having seizures every 30 to 45 minutes. On a good day, I’ll have fewer than five seizures, spaced far apart.

Recently, based on my wife’s concerns, I was prescribed Risperdal (an antipsychotic) and Briviact (related to Keppra, but supposedly gentler). I know I can be difficult when it comes to medications, but I feel there’s too much trial and error involved. Why not use genome data to figure out how I metabolize meds? In my case, I’m an ultra-rapid metabolizer (URM) for certain genes that affect benzodiazepines, AEDs, and opioids. It’s no wonder I survived my teenage years despite experimenting with substances like Quaaludes and Rohypnol—substances that would have scared most people.

I told my wife that she’s seeing all of this because we spend so much time together—24/7. I believe we both need some personal space. My solace comes between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., when I take our dog out, have some coffee, and relax before going back to sleep. When I wake up again, I’m usually okay until another seizure hits. Today, the seizures started around 2 a.m., and I “rescued” myself with 20 mg of Valtoco at 4:00  a.m., but while the intensity of the seizures decreased, their frequency didn’t.  Let’s see know after the second shot, nothing else I can do with Valtoco for the next 4 to 5 days .

One thing I haven’t tried yet is stopping cannabis use. I make my own edibles, which are potent. While cannabis doesn’t solve everything, it helps reduce my seizure-related anxiety. However, it also causes my mind to race uncontrollably unless I’m actively engaged in something, like watching a documentary or movie.

After eight years and two implanted devices, the RNS hasn’t made much of a difference for me. The device doesn’t show how many seizures it successfully interrupts, only how many it detects. It stops trying after five attempts to short-circuit an event. So, things aren’t going well in that regard either. Tomorrow, I’m starting Briviact, which is related to Keppra, but I’m afraid of what might happen if I have an amygdalo-hippocampectomy. I don’t know, I’m soon to be 60 I should just quit and get high like snoop 24/7 
The chart is data from RNS , looks like a downtown of events . Can find the latest which is the same crap . 
I just want to find a way to remain and look calm for others , enough stress that triggers , I live in an endless vortex of Prodrome, Auras , Even , post ictal , repeat and repeat . ",5,1728075029.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

My wife and I regularly attend the PTO meetings at our kid's school and learned a good deal about the levy and why they're asking for the increases. I was already planning to vote for the levy, but hearing the details and seeing how the numbers work made me more sure that this isn't the district just trying to get more money. There's a real plan for things like improving the flow of students through the district by adding a third 6th grade building, and how the operating costs work.

Title : Moha in Paris

Somewhere deep within a respectable neighborhood in Paris, an alarm clock was shouting through the dawn.

Moha reminded himself that he was a responsible and respectable adult, then got up without snoozing the alarm once.

Upon getting out of bed, Moha did 10 push-ups and 10-sits ups, then took a freezing cold shower.

Moha then dried himself up, made himself some eggs with orange juice and took his plate to the balcony to stare at the sky while eating.

Moha reminded himself that the sunrise was indeed a very beautiful thing, even though all he could see were grey clouds.

Moha made his bed, washed his plate, and put on his very adult grey suit that he had ironed himself last night.

He put on his grown-up freshly polished shoes, armed himself with his briefcase, and stepped out into the dusk.

As one could expect from a reasonable adult who had his shit together, Moha was very punctual. He arrived at the bus station at the same time as his bus. He gave a nod towards the driver, put on his headphones, and stared at the window until he arrived at his metro station.

At the metro, Moha found a seat next to a passed-out drunk man. He stared at his polished shoes until he arrived at the station next to his office.

Moha was a very respectable engineer who had graduated from a very respectable engineering school, and therefore held a very respectable job.

Before stepping into the office, Moha liked to order a to-go coffee from a nearby shop which, despite being slightly on the expensive side, made their drinks with coffee beans provided to them by a unicorn. This fact was largely ignored by the Parisian population, including Moha, who just really liked their coffee.

As per his routine, Moha took his plastic cup of unicorn coffee to a nearby bench where he could drink it while staring at the trees.

Moha took a seat, lost his balance for a split second, panicked, and then proceeded to spill the entirety of his cup on the ground.

Moha looked at his empty cup, then looked at the puddle near his feet.

And then Moha started crying uncontrollably.

----

-""Shhh. It’s OK, poor baby, don’t cry.” A soft voice was purring while pulling him close into her chest. “Shhh. Everything is OK. Shhhh. KHADIJA, WILL YOU BRING THE OLIVE OIL OVER HERE, PLEASE? YOUR BROTHER IS CRYING. Shhhh. Mama is here. It’s all right.”

A door opened and a rather annoyed teenager stepped in with a huge bottle in her hands.

-“Why is he crying again? He always cries for no reason.

-That’s not true. Your brother is just very sensitive. He can see things that we don’t, and sometimes those things make him sad.” The soft voice responded while taking the gigantic bottle from the angry teenager’s hands. “Here baby, drink this. It’s good for you. It’s OK. Everything is OK. I’m here.”

 ---

Moha was still bawling his eyes out. His tears and his snot were mixing. He had no idea why he was crying.

-“Oh, you poor baby. It’s OK. Everything is OK.”, a soft voice purred.

Moha looked up, confused, with snot on his mouth.

-""Mom ?""

It was in fact, not his mother. A young woman in her twenties was sitting next to him, and she was gently massaging his shoulder. She was also wearing a very grown-up suit, had polished shoes, a briefcase, and a unicorn coffee.

She had kind eyes, and a face that looked vaguely like a goat. He had never seen her before

-""I am so sorry. This is so embarrassing. What the fuck? I’m so sorry, you don’t have to...” Moha kept repeating while sobbing. He had managed to drink a mixture of snot and tears while he was talking, which made him cry even harder.

The young woman looked at her watch, thought for a few seconds, then put down her briefcase on the ground and put her arms around Moha.

-“You’re having a burnout. It’s all right. I'm here with you. Everything is OK.”

And then, for a second, everything was.",1,1728074633.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I'm a 5'7 female, originally 131 pounds and lost about 7 pounds, down to 124 during this 2 month period. that is about 5% of my body weigh. Some additional context is that I have a very fast metabolism, and I can eat up to 3k calories a day without significant weight gain.

  
The only difference between my diet is that I don't eat snacks anymore (I usually ate unhealthy snacks, ranging from doritos to whatever unhealthy thing was int he pantry) between meal period and I've stopped drinking coffee, which usually had maybe 200\~ calories with the way I make it.

I don't want to drop below 120 pounds as that begins going into the underweight weight range.

1fw8zrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fw8zrj/the_unseen_tenants/,The Unseen Tenants,"One of the phrases that I have grown to loathe over the years is the term “starving artist”. Most people do not know what it is like to be hungry or know where your next meal is coming from, not to mention the fact that you are trying to create your next masterpiece. Have you ever tried to do anything on an empty stomach? If not, I do not recommend it as the only thing you can focus on is your hunger. 

During this part of my career, you could call me successful as the traditional mediums that comprise my art have turned heads in the art community. I am not going to tell you my name however, for reasons that become clearer later the great state of North Dakota is currently my home. I am getting a little ahead of myself so let me start at the beginning. 

When I was young there was a part of me that always loved art as I can recount the times spent in the living room sprawled out on the floor with stacks of paper, crayons and pencils. In fact, our garage was unfinished and myself and my sister were allowed to draw one image on the walls. I chose my favorite Star Wars character at the time which was the bounty hunter Boba Fett as he waved to us every time we left and entered the garage. 

All through school I managed to get satisfactory grades, but art was always my passion as I did everything I could to excel. Anytime there was an art project in class I not only met the teacher’s expectations but also exceeded them. In fact, there was a time that I wanted to submit my artwork to some of the major comic book companies but after facing one or two rejections I decided to take my art in another direction. After graduating from high school and then college I obtained a degree in fine arts. My parents were always supportive of me and knew that I wanted to go out and make my mark on the world. 

After college I managed to scrape up enough to move out on my own. Growing up in the great state of Indiana had its drawbacks and one of them was the winters that were sometimes unforgiving. So, I packed what I owned into my beat-up Hyundai Elantra and headed south until I reached the great state of Florida. My destination was a run-down neighborhood that was just north of Miami called Overtown as I called up a local apartment complex and secured my first month’s rent over the phone. 

“Tree hunnred and fiffy bucks a month” he said in a heavy New York accent as he had escaped from the Bronx, or it might have been Brooklyn at least six years prior. That would give me a few weeks to get settled and find a job while I worked on my art in the meantime. Another bonus was this apartment was already furnished and while it wasn’t the newest it was functional and clean. 

While the neighborhood was not the best it wasn’t rundown, and it wasn’t as dangerous as people were led to believe. Sal, the owner of the apartment complex told me straight out “Eh, don’t let ‘em get ta ya kid. Don’t take any shit and ya won’t be messed with.”  The first few weeks were spent job hunting, and it felt that even the fast-food places did not want to take a chance on me due to my limited experience. However, with a bit of quick thinking and a lot of b.s. I managed to land an interview at a temporary agency. I went professionally dressed and answered their questions and in a few short days I had landed my first job at a logistics company. 

I hate to admit it, but those first few weeks were spent either working, exploring or generally adjusting to my new lifestyle. After work nights were spent cooking, cleaning up dishes and either trying to create art in vain or watching television on the beaten-up couch until I passed out. Routine as always, right? Artists struggle to make a living while creating art on the nights and weekends. Seems straightforward right? 

That is until I thought my place was haunted. 

Now I know you must think that I am crazy to think a rundown apartment complex in Miami was haunted. But I was passed out on the couch on a normal Thursday night when I heard it clear as day. 

“LEAVE!”

My reaction could have been a scene out of a horror movie as I bolted upright eyes whirling around the room looking for whoever shouted that word. Part of me wondered if it came from the television, however, there was some dumb commercial playing for a fast-food chain I had never heard of. Doing a quick sweep of the apartment turned up nothing out of the ordinary as everything was in its place. Could this have been my mind playing tricks on me? Part of me just wanted to write it off as I switched off the television and headed for bed. 

Otherworldly nightmares plagued my dreams as I tried to sleep but eventually gave up after a good two hours of trying. The next day at work seemed to drag on forever as working on no sleep and five cups of coffee was the fuel to get me towards the weekend. Co-workers were asking me if I was alright and even my boss asked me about letting me go home early. Assuring everyone that the culprit was my neighbors having a massive party that kept me awake seemed to work. Eventually quitting time rolled around and the only thing on my mind was sleep. Somehow managing to make it home, park my car and make it up to my apartment was nothing short of a damned miracle. Once my body hit the couch it was lights out for me. 

Instead of being haunted by ghosts, demons or anything else I slept for some time as it was dark outside, and my stomach rumbling was enough to awaken me. Part of me wanted to go out and get something cheap but with the influx of bills due in a week’s time I knew it was another night of spam and ramen for me. Rounding the corner into the kitchen I stopped as my mind thought there was something in front of me. However, after turning on the lights it was clear that there was no one else in the apartment. Going through the phases of prepping my meal, part of me felt that someone was watching me. However, that was impossible as there weren’t any windows in the kitchen. 

Putting the pot on the stove there was a flash of something right on the edge of my peripheral vision. Of course, just like always there was nothing there as I went ahead and scrolled through my phone waiting for the water to boil. 

“GO! NOW!”

A jolt ran through my body as this was no dream and it felt as if the boiling hot water scalded me. Doing a quick sweep through the apartment again turned up nothing that was out of place as part of me wondered if someone was playing a trick on me. Was the reason that rent was so cheap was I was now starring in some weird reality internet show? The water was boiling over by the time my exploration was completed and just like last time nothing was amiss. Part of me was curious wondering if it was my neighbors playing some movie or worse some prank as I put my ear to the wall. 

It was as if I was listening to a crowded room of people whispering something undecipherable. 

The next morning, I was determined to get to the bottom of this as I saw my landlord hanging around the front of the building talking to his friends.  

“I’ll come out and say it.” I said with a bit of hesitation in my voice “is this place haunted?”

He blinked and then laughed long and hard which caused his friends to laugh as well. “Kid, yer rich. There’s no such things as ghosts. When yer dead yer dead. Period. Finito. End of story.” 

I smirked and then hit back with “then what about my noisy next-door neighbor?” 

He looked at me as if I had two heads. “Kid, the apartment next ta you is empty. Has been for the past tree months.” 

“What? What are you talking about?”

He got up and made his way inside as he walked down the hall and to the right. He sorted through the keys until finding the right one and unlocked the door. It opened with an audible creak as he flicked on the lights. 

Empty. 

“See?” He said gruffly before closing the door and locking it “no one here.” 

I had heard something I was sure of, but I couldn’t prove it. I thanked him and I went back down the hall to  fume in silence listening to the echoes of their laughter. Part of me wanted to use this day to try and create something, however, it was just like the other times I tried to create something. The shadows grew longer as morning transitioned into afternoon and then dusk. I seethed still remembering the empty apartment, wishing I had some evidence to present to him to prove them all wrong. 

“YOU GO NOW!”

Whirling around the only thing that was visible was a blank wall and this coupled with the humilation that I had suffered earlier brought my anger to a boiling point. Next to my easel there was a well used mason jar and without a second thought I scooped it up and threw it hard against the wall. The glass shattered into a thousand pieces, but it also tore a deep gash into the drywall. 

Instead of showing off insulation or exposed wires or even wooden beams the only thing that was there was darkness. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light however, I couldn’t be more mistaken as the darkness seemed to move and writhe within the hole. A pair of probing antennae poked from out of the hole followed by another and even more as the first of a glistening black roach scuttled forth. The creature hurriedly crawled down the wall as it seemed to stare at me and that voice returned. 

“LEAVE!”

The voice boomed in my ears as more of his bretheren poured from the new found hold in the wall. Two first appeared followed by three more and then more than I could even count as they all shouted in a cacophony of voices. 

“GO! GO NOW! LEAVE! GET OUT! OUT!”

Roaches poured out onto the floor creating a black wave that seemed to obsucre everything that was on the floor. Antennae twitched and mandibles clacked together as these creatures started to shout one message. However, I finally realized that these things were not talking with their mouths. 

Their thoughts boomed inside of my head threatening to bore into my skull.

“our home! Our Home!! OUR HOME!!!”

I could no longer endure this as my legs threatened to give out beneath me as a revulsion started to rise up from my gut. Bile and sweat mixed in an unforgiving cocktail as I scrambled towards the door and flung it open running screaming out of the complex. Tenants and other curious onlookers saw a crazed person run towards their car, fling open the door and drive away as if the devil themself were chasing them. 

It seemed like hours however, it was only a few minutes as I managed to pull into a fast food parking lot as my mind was still processing what had happened. Picking up my phone and dialing one of my friends I asked them if I could crash on their couch for a few days and they were kind enough to help out. The next few days were extremely hard as I had to tell the landlord that I was moving out. He was concerned, asking me a bunch of questions such as if I was in trouble and gave me back my deposit telling me not to worry about the hole in the drywall. 

The most embarrassing part was asking him to help me load my meager possessions into my car as I wanted him there if anything else happened. Of course there was nothing going on and even the hole showed some exposed wood and wires beyond. We parted ways as he shook my hand and said “Yer a good kid, don’t let this place get ta ya so much y’hear?” Karma seemed to be on my side as my friend was losing a roommate and asked if I wanted to fill their slot and of course I jumped at the chance. 

Sleep at first didn’t come easy as those things haunted my nightmares as there were times I could not sleep. However, unlike other times this incident seemed to have unlocked something deep inside of me. Whereas I could not create any art for weeks in a matter of days I had a series of paintings done. One of my roommates saw the paintings which was more of an abstract showing different tones of gray on a lighter background and wanted to show his friends. I thought nothing of it at the time and said sure and that jump started my career. 

Now my work has been featured in magazines as it can be found in galleries all over the world. The prices for my work may not be as exorbitant as some, however, with a bit of shrewd investing and a lot of luck I was able to secure myself a great homestead in a small town in North Dakota. When people ask me why I chose to move to this state instead of a busy city such as New York or Los Angeles I tell them the same thing I have told everyone in every interview. 

“No bugs.” 

However, something has happened recently that inspired me to write all of this and I hope to god it is my mind playing tricks on me. I was on my front porch creating another piece of art as the last remnants of the day cast their long shadows when I saw it. 

A singular black roach scuttled across the planks as it looked around for something. 

Enraged that this creature had intruded on my home I lifted my foot to squash it into oblivion when I heard a faint voice inside of my head before it splattered under my boot.

I know this is going to be complicated to get into....

My Q was in the hospital for 6 weeks..due initially to jaundice and was out into the ICU, then general population where his ammonia levels rose too high and he aspirated into his lungs and had pneumonia for a couple of days and was on a ventilator for 9 days.
He then was in PT rehab for another 2 weeks due to losing close to 30 lbs and needing to learn to walk again.

While he was in the hospital I had to move houses. While looking for roommates and interviewing candidates, I met one for coffee.
I then left this candidate at a bus stop.
They texted me later saying that the bus wasn't running and has no way home.
I had to drop off thing at my Q's place while he was in hospital and offered to put up this candidate in my Q's place for the night.
But the candidate did end up eventually finding an alternative ride home fo the night.

I spent every single day I had off of work at that hospital, from noon-7pm, when visiting hours where over.
If I had to work, I would go to hospital after work I until visiting hours were over.
I cleaned out his place when he couldn't afford it any longer.
I did everything for him: wiped his ass, got him tobacco, got him food and snacks, kept him company when nobody else would visit him.

Now that he is out and back to work others in his bubble are telling him I let people stay in his place, which is not true.
He would rather believe the people who were not there for him while he was at his lowest.point.
But has now blocked.me and won't have anything to do with me.

For starters, the entire place smells like literal farts and eggs. People will always walk in & say the building stinks. I think it has something to do with the sewers? I’m not sure, but that’s what the city has said. We have it the worst out of all the business around us. I will walk back there & it smells SO bad.

Most of our staff smell like horrible B.O. I know this isn’t that serious but I’ve read our corporate rules & we aren’t allowed to come in stinky. I refuse to work by them because they all smell so bad. We have a set of lockers in the back for staff & I’ve literally seen a toothbrush & toothpaste back there.

Speaking of lockers, this same staff hoards all the lockers. This is more of me just ranting but they‘re your standard standing lockers probably around 10 or so. Only one locker is available. The staff hoards them because they take their uniform shirts & put it over their regular shirts & at the end of their shifts just leave them there, along with their huge, obese winter coats (I mean obese as in they’re so big they’re busting out the locker, not obese as in the owners of the jackets are fat!).

This is very rare on occasion (so far has happened 4-5 times that I’ve seen) but our donut makers & our store owner will walk in barefoot & make donuts. This is so nasty to me & I just don’t want to see my bosses pigs while I’m working or trying to not run them over with our broken wheeled mop. I’ve literally filmed them walking with their feet out because I don’t think that’s allowed but maybe it is. I don’t know, I’m not educated.

Flies get all over the food. If you’ve ever eaten a donut from my location, chances are, there is so much fly poo on your donut. My boss is a cheap one & I had to point it out to her that there was a fly on a muffin, & even then she didn’t throw it away she just put it in a bag & waited for me to walk away.

That‘s pretty much it. It’s not much compared to some I’ve seen but the egg & poop smell mix so much & when you smell it often, it makes you mad.",5,1728073741.0,FastFoodHorrorStories,1,1.0,False

It is technically & fundamentally superior to all other L1's, has a founder that is literally world renowned/ award winning in the field of Computer Science, and has more real world institutional/ corporate adoption than ANY OTHER coin even those with 10 or 20X larger marketcap...

Just consider these real world corporate adoption examples:
- official FIFA NFT's by Fifa Collect, exclusively on algo
- USDC backed Mastercard debit cards via Immersve
- multinational airline nft ticketing via TravelX
- Legal tender EURO on-chain via Quantoz (the only non-stablecoin LEGAL TENDER fiat currency on any chain)
- Coffee bean supply-chain data storage, on chain, by Lavazza
- On-chain tradfi money market funds via Archaex

On top of the immense adoption algorand is getting, while all other chains have literally nothing except memecoins & scams, there has been immense fine-tuning and improvement of the Algorand team in the past 2 years; such as the hiring of John Woods CTO, hiring of Marc CMO former head of Android marketing for Google, and recently hiring ""head of payments"" from Moneygram (i forget his name). 

On top of this, something Algorand has over it's competition is that we have a fixed supply, (sol & eth and many other chains literally have no supply cap), and ON TOP of that our circulating supply is 82% which leaves us with a tiny 3% yearly inflation for the next 6 years by when there will be zero inflation whatsoever. 

The only logical reason algorand is 65th by marketcap is that the cryptocurrency market participants, both retail and isntitutional, are compleletly retarded and literally not paying attention to fundamentals at all.

Here's your guide to navigating this modern frontier, ensuring you find meaningful connections while staying safe and true to yourself.  
The Landscape of Gay Dating Apps

* Variety of Platforms: From Grindr to Tinder, Scruff to OkCupid, each app has its flavor. Some focus on hook-ups, while others aim for deeper connections. Understanding what each app offers can guide your choice.
* Profile Crafting: Your profile is your digital first impression. Be honest about your interests, what you're looking for, and include clear, recent photos. Authenticity attracts.

Strategies for Successful Digital Dating

* Set Clear Goals: Know what you're looking for before you start swiping. Whether it's a casual encounter or a long-term relationship, clarity in your intentions helps attract like-minded individuals.
* Privacy and Safety: Use apps that protect your privacy, avoid sharing personal information too quickly, and consider apps that verify profiles. Always meet in public places initially.
* Engagement: More than just swiping, engage with profiles that interest you. A thoughtful message can set you apart from generic openers.

Dealing with Digital Dating Challenges

* Rejection: It's part of the process. Handle it with grace. Not every match or conversation will lead somewhere, and that's okay.
* Fatigue: App fatigue is real. Take breaks if you feel overwhelmed. Maybe explore apps in phases rather than all at once.
* Ghosting: Unfortunately common. Prepare yourself emotionally for this possibility and try not to take it personally.

From Digital to Real Life

* First Meetings: When moving from app to real-life, keep things light and safe. A coffee, a walk, or a casual activity can be ideal first date scenarios.
* Expectations: Communicate your expectations clearly. This helps avoid misunderstandings, especially in what might start as a casual meeting but could evolve into something deeper.

Building Connections

* Beyond the Physical: Look for shared interests, values, and life goals. Physical attraction is important, but lasting connections are built on more.
* Communication: Effective communication is key. Discuss your feelings, preferences, and boundaries openly.
