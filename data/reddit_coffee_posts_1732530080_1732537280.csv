That’s why we need to keep social welfare programs and to not disincentivize people from having children.  ",1,1732537153.0,JordanPeterson,0,0.99,False

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gu3t6c/bridgebuilder_chapter_114/)

Alex had been formulating a hypothesis about Eleya. Originally, he thought that she had a drinking problem. Before the whole clusterfuck with Sharadi, Sergeant Zenshen confirmed that alcoholism also affected the Tsla’o, her own father included in that count. Surprising no one, it had experienced a sharp increase after the cataclysm as more products had returned to the market. Having attended a few social functions with the Empress had allowed him to refine that.

“I believe he mentioned that he has a brother once, yes!” Eleya was practically beaming at this confirmation. She had seen when she picked his brain against his will, but it had actually been brought up in conversation after the whole thing with Sharadi. “Though he has not told me anything about him.”

She appeared to drink a lot at formal dinners. As with everything Eleya did in view of the public, and particularly the political class, there was some sleight of hand involved. She *appeared* to, but she did not. The wine glass she used at these functions was different. It filled too quickly and a handful of sips emptied it. So while it looked like she was hitting the wine pretty hard, having three or four glasses at a meal, he was quite sure at this point that she never even drank a whole serving. It was a layer of illusion for her to play with.

He wasn’t sure what the illusion was supposed to be, and Carbon didn’t know when he asked about it. She had suggested that it may just be to imply that she was able to tolerate a lot of alcohol, or that the less informed might be tempted to try and put something over on her while they think she’s slightly inebriated. Maybe both. 

“Yes, Peter is his older brother.” Audry looked to Carbon, trying to figure out *why* this was a big deal to Eleya. “He’s married already, and has a son of his own.”

Carbon shook her head. She had no idea what her aunt was on about, either.

Alex couldn’t speak to Eleya’s alcohol consumption when alone, but when it was just family, she actually did drink. Actual glasses of wine. Those sour citrus mixed drinks she liked, or just a lowball of liquor, neat. He wouldn’t call it excessive drinking, exactly, but it tended to be heavy. It appeared to relax her, eased back the carefully built façade for a time. Her words came more quickly, less carefully considered. Carbon had said it reminded her of when they were younger, before Navaren had been assassinated and she had taken up the role of Sovereign alone.

Alex surmised that the root of Eleya’s behavior was that she wanted to have a family again. While she hadn’t explicitly said this, all her actions pointed to it. She risked a lot, possibly *everything* up to and including the Empire, vetting Alex and bringing him into the fold just to appease Carbon. He could have easily turned that introductory assault into something that withdrew Human aid from them, if not that kicked off that hot war that she wanted to avoid. Alex believed that she wanted to be able to shrug off her duties, sit around a table and enjoy being with people she cared about, who cared about her. The main problem there was that after decades of gripping the reins of the Empire by herself, the only way she could manage that now was to be in an altered state of mind.

Eleya clearly considered this dinner to be one of those times where she wanted that. In this quiet moment, she was sitting here with her niece, nephew, and the closest thing Carbon had to a mother now. This was a family dinner, even including the stranger Alex brought along.

They hadn’t even ordered food and she just finished that Titan Tea, setting the empty pint glass down on the coaster with a thump. “Good, good. What does he do? Is he also a Pilot?”

His new, refined theory? Getting slightly drunk surrounded by the people she trusted implicitly was the closest she could get to being vulnerable with them. The only way she could feel close to someone anymore.

“No, Peter is an architect. He’s been with his company for about a decade now, right out of college.” Audry was obviously proud of Pete’s accomplishments, and rightly so. He had busted his ass to excel and the owner of the company recognized that.

“Is it so?” The gears behind Eleya’s slightly glazed eyes turned, antenna lifting just a little bit as she schemed. “A creator with a young family and devotion to a cause. Yes... That is very good.”

The table drew silent, no one sure what to make of that comment. Carbon turned to Audry, interested in moving the conversation somewhere else. “I have been negligent in my inquiry today. How are Peter and his family doing?”

“They’re doing well. Gaspari is gearing up for a new project and he’s stressed about that, but that’s just how Peter is. The bigger the venture, the more it weighs on him. He was like that all through school.” She took a sip of her Last Word, the drink barely touched compared to Eleya’s. “Jason’s going to be starting pre-k soon, he’s actually excited about it.”

“I am pleased to know that.” Carbon bowed a little bit. She had a tendency to swing towards more formal as Eleya became more drunk. “Next time you see them, would you send our regards and be sure that they are still at ease about the accident with Jason. I know he had no ill intentions.”

In that moment where Carbon and Audry spoke to each other so easily, Eleya looked like she was in pain. It was brief - even getting drunk she had impressive control over herself - but there was a moment of sorrow clear in her eyes. The relationship she had given up and so desperately wanted back, right there in front of her.

Alex felt bad for her, but she had dug that hole herself. At least 30 years down the line, she was starting to fill it back in.

“What is this accident? Who is Jason?” Eleya inquired.

“Jason is Pete’s son. He got over excited and came running at Carbon as fast as he could to hug her. You might say running into things is a bit of a family trait.” Alex was very mindful to not mention that Jason unintentionally and very enthusiastically dropped a slur. Nobody expected a four year old to be a diplomat.

“Who is Pete?” She asked immediately after he got done speaking.

Oh yeah, Tsla’o didn’t really do nicknames the same way. “That’s just a short way of saying Peter.”

“Ah. It is only one letter shorter?” She puzzled that out, shaking her head slowly until she noticed the waiter, Derek, return. She *clapped* at him. “Server. This drink is empty, I require another one immediately.”

The reactions to this varied significantly around the table. Ed was about to start dying, hiding a barely restrained smirk behind his pint. Alex sucked in a breath through his teeth and he was pretty sure Carbon did the same. Audry was shocked, which was fair. No one really expects that sort of behavior, particularly when the person doing it hadn't seemed so petty.

Alex wasn’t going to let that slide. “Hey, we don’t do that here.” You could tell a lot about someone based on how they treated waitstaff. Normally Eleya didn’t order anyone around like that. Normally she didn’t drink like this around people. 

“*You* do not do that.” She chose obstinate as the way to respond. Great. Drunk Eleya was getting downgraded from pitiable to annoying right this very second. 

“*We* do not.” All right. Picking a Royal We fight with the Empress was probably not the best idea in the world, but he had some protection on his side. A lot of her plans had him as a central component now, and he could not be easily replaced for several of them. Carbon was within striking range, as well. In less violent options, Eleya’s insistence that Alex pay attention to things he didn’t care about had taught him a few things about *her*. “Is that the example you set for your people? For those who may someday take your place? Clapping at a professional who is clearly working alone, to get a drink a little faster?”

Invoking leadership was something she did all the time, and the Tsla’o took the chain of command very seriously. Alex framed himself as the subordinate in this case, which he was as the Crown Prince. Making her look at plainly disrespectful behavior over something as petty as getting a refill, from a different point of view. Coercing her military background into the picture. Asking her if this is really how she wants him to treat random Tsla’o when he wants something, without saying it directly.

It was unsettling that he felt like he was channeling Eleya when he said all that, though.

Eleya glanced up at his ears where the piercings marking his station would normally reside as she thought that over, slowly rubbing her teeth together. “No. Perhaps not. You are wise beyond your years, Pilot. Your council is appreciated.” 

She turned to Derek, giving him a shallow bow. “I beg your forgiveness. My behavior was needlessly rude, unfitting of my station and your dignity alike.”

Derek was caught off guard. The situation had turned on a dime, and he was clearly not used to belligerent people coming around so fast. He looked to Alex, who was trying to get him to bow in pantomime. Derek picked that up and returned the bow. “Thank you, you have my forgiveness.”

Alex gave him a discreet thumbs up. Perfect.

Derek was also ready to get this behind him. “Are you all ready to order?”

Turns out they were. Alex and Ed both went for the double bacon cheeseburger. Classic, couldn’t go wrong with it. Audry had been about to order the Irish stew when they both jumped to warn her this place was Irish pub *themed*. She got a cheeseburger as well. Carbon tentatively asked if it was possible to get the ribeye, rare, from *Gardien de Phare* as they were not actually in Noonan’s. Turns out it was possible. Eleya ordered what Carbon was having, and another Titan Tea.

“Hey, maybe you’d like to try some other Human specialties while you’re here.” Eleya with a few drinks was fine. Eleya with half a pint of spirits after who knows how much champagne was already annoying and it probably hadn't even hit yet. “Maybe a Shirley Temple? It's got several kinds of fruit. Centuries old recipe, as well.”

Another little bit of manipulation he’d learned from Eleya. She did actually like old things. History interested her. It was baby steps compared to what she did, but it was effective.

She looked from Alex to Derek. “Is this so?”

Derek nodded. “I would say that is an accurate assessment. It is a very old recipe, and makes effective use of grenadine, cherry, and citrus to produce a bright, effervescent drink.”

“Cherry is like *tamaks*, they are both a sweet pit-fruit.” Carbon added, intuiting what Alex was doing.

“Very well, I will try that.” She relented, and Derek departed with their order.

Eleya turned her attention to Audry again, getting back to their original conversation. “This Jason, he is a small child? Four years, was it?”

Alex excused himself to use the restroom.

Not that he was going to use the restroom, he just wanted to talk to their waiter. He dipped out the service door, the room beyond it actually nearly as large as the dining room itself. Suppose they might be staging food for dozens of people sometimes.

The security crew inside stopped talking and turned to look at him as one, which was impressive for two separate groups who had never met before. He couldn’t be sure but it sounded like they had been discussing their issued equipment before his trespass had been noticed. “Hey, uh, did you guys see the waiter? I need to talk to him.”

The closest DSS suit jerked his head towards the back door. “Down the hall, left is the kitchen, right is the service bar. If you leave the secured area, we will have to scan you on the way back in.”

“Alright, I can dig that.” Derek had just taken orders, so the kitchen would probably be the first stop. Alex went left, peeking in the window on the swinging doors. Busy, but no waiter in sight. He turned around and nearly ran straight into the guy coming back from the service bar. “Ah hey. I just wanted to apologize for that scene. She doesn’t get out a lot.”

Derek once again looked surprised. “Accepted. I must say, it was very mild even before her apology. Diplomats tend to think extremely highly of themselves and it comes out in some interesting ways, and they do not reverse course so readily.”

“That’s- Sorry to hear that. Just, whatever she orders from now on, get her an alcohol free version of it?” That was the real reason he was back here. Keeping Eleya from getting more drunk. “And could we get an appetizer platter? Biggest one they can make.”

“Will do. Anything else?” He was the definition of professional about all this.

“Yeah, can I give you my card and get this paid for without bringing the check out?” They couldn’t be spending *that* much, and he had hardly bought anything since he got back.

“DSS has it expensed already.”

“Oh, shit. Okay. Well, I’ll stop holding you up then, thank you.” Alex stepped out of Derek’s way with a shallow bow and headed back up the hallway. Apparently he was going to continue not buying anything.

Scans only took a couple of seconds, even with both teams doing their own.

While he had been gone for only a few minutes, the conversation had moved on to Ed. “No, you’re right. My background isn’t too different from Alex’s, with a few notable exceptions. All my runs in the Scout program ended with very little fanfare. I do have one planet being terraformed under my belt, but that’s the big one. Otherwise it’s lots of natural resources and a couple of interesting gas giants.”

“And you have spent fifteen years engaged in training the next generations of Pilots after that?” Eleya had leaned in, resting her chin on her knuckles as she dug into what Ed had been getting up to until now, bright blue eyes alight with interest despite looking a little more drunk than before. “It may be forward of me to ask - and I understand that this question is more appropriately taken to those in control of the program as a whole, I am merely gauging your interest at this moment - would you be willing to impart some of this experience unto the Tsla’o Empire? Even with the expedition cut short, the yields exceeded our usual exploration returns.”

“I don’t-” He stopped talking as Derek returned, dispensing a platter of fried food to the table and a glass of vibrant red liquid for Eleya. Sharp gray eyes tracking their waiter until he was out of sight again. “I don’t mind the idea at all. I’m biased, of course, but I find the program to be a good use of money - both in material returns and as a testbed for technology. I do have a trainee right now that I would prefer to see to the end of their course first, but this doesn’t sound like something that will be set up overnight anyway.”

“No, bureaucracy moves at its own pace.” Eleya tried her Shirley Temple, giving it a curious look that turned into a sidelong glance aimed at Alex. Obviously not drunk enough to miss the lack of alcohol. “I will see to opening channels about another partnership. Even without such deals brokered, if you have time available, I bid you to visit *The Sword of the Morning Light* and tour our training facilities. They are aimed more at maintaining and improving skills rather than teaching, but wise words are always appreciated.”

As he perused the selection of deep fried goods in the middle of the table, Alex wondered how he would *covertly* notify someone that if they got their hardware upgraded, the ONI would absolutely be fucking with it. Not just blurting it out like he wanted to do right now. “Don’t spend too much time over there or Section Seven is gonna poach you too.”

“Yeah, they can try if they want to make an actual enemy out of the CPP. It’s tolerated when they rustle a pilot every now and then, but I am in way too deep. I’ve seen Admirals sweat when I talk about retirement.” He reached out and plucked a fried ravioli off the plate, not talking while he eats it. Always was a stickler for not talking with his mouth full. “I would actually very much like to see your ship and facilities. Alex seems no worse for wear from his time in your care, and I’ve heard generally good things coming from friends in the Trailblazer community.”

No worse for wear. Alex did not laugh at that, knowing it would have been sarcastic and strained. A couple of meetings with a therapist did not undo multiple near death experiences, or any of the manifold other things he had been working on. He just let them talk and pointed out the crab rangoons to Carbon. She was aware of crab and the other large sea bugs that forest spider reminded him of, but hadn’t had a chance to try yet. He went for the mozzarella sticks. Nostalgic, more than anything. Hadn’t had one of those since he was a kid.

It was good, it just didn’t land the same as an adult.

“I will formally extend an invitation when we return to the ship.” She nodded once, the statement made and to be carried out with the authority of the Empress. “I assume the young Pilot will be able to assist me in spelling your name correctly, I suspect it does not translate well to Tsla.”

Everybody had a chuckle at that except Carbon, now stuck between rigid formality and curiosity about the little packet of fried food Alex had indicated she should try.

“Even if he couldn’t, I’m the only Edwin in the CPP training department so it won’t be hard to track me down.” He gave her an affable smile and went for another ravioli.

“Speaking of visiting places... I was recently invited along to Na’o, the Tsla’o home system. Carbon is meeting with the first class of *Lan* to graduate since the Cataclysm, and not a lot of Humans have had the opportunity to visit there as guests.” By his estimation it was zero. No Human had actually ever been allowed into Tsla’o space without a specific reason, and he wasn’t actually an outlier here. He was doing Prince stuff, like escorting prisoners. “Just a quick trip. With transit time back and forth there’s enough time for a few days there before we have to be back in Sol for other ongoing business.”

“I expect pictures.” His mother took that pretty well, all things considered. The idea of Alex jetting off to distant parts of the galaxy *was* old hat to her now. “Maybe a new mug.”

They both got a laugh out of that, no one else at the table privy to the fact that Alex had been buying his parents novelty tourist mugs from pretty much every place he had gone to off Earth. Having a souvenir from the seat of an alien Empire would be one of those things you trot out whenever the annoying neighbors start boasting about having been all the way out to New Austin or something. There would be no way to top it. 

“At least a keychain, if I can find one.” That actually got him wondering... He looked to Carbon, just now tentatively biting into that crab rangoon. He was not going to interrupt his wife while she was eating. Eleya was still perusing the options, so he aimed the question at her. “Do the Tsla’o have souvenirs? Like keepsakes or mementos from places that have been visited?”

“Yes, though it is often less functional than a mug. Small art pieces, usually reflecting the local culture in some way, were the most common.” She settled on a fried ravioli, inspecting it as she continued. “Telucten, the province I am from, was known for its livestock and used a sleeping *Rakaro* as the base for its traditional memento. Pictures, paintings, carvings, little stuffed toys for children. I am sure it would be easy enough to find an artisan interested in ceramics to make something specific.”

Having something custom made kind of defeated the purpose of the souvenir mug, but he would certainly ask for some kind of visual pun. A joke that was incomprehensible to a Human would actually fit the novelty mug genre perfectly, at least. “I’ll be sure to ask around once we’re in the area.”

“I can put you in contact with a few people.” She popped the little fried square into her mouth and seemed to enjoy it.

“Thanks.” He would still ask around.

The conversation stayed light as the appetizers disappeared. Three of the people at the table were aware of the full level of the deceit being engaged in at the moment, a fourth just keeping the fact Alex and Carbon were married on the low for now. Ed was completely unaware of anything other than them not being able to discuss the ongoing work with the Confederation.

Eleya got the full explanation of what a research librarian was, which as it turned out was close to what they called Conservators. A librarian with specialized knowledge or experience. This was also met with earnest approval by the Empress. There were dozens of Conservators in the employ of the royal court, though much of their work now focused on restoration. The palace library had been fully destroyed in the Cataclysm, and many other libraries that survived are not expected to be evacuated until they’ve run out of living survivors, which probably meant they’d be considering digging them out of collapsed cities in fifty years. 

A bit of a downer to reach as dinner arrived. Eleya ordered a Last Word as she had finished the Shirley Temple.

“This is from a cow, correct?” Eleya inspected a slice of ribeye stuck on the end of her fork, pink through the middle and still dripping juice. “It is a larger livestock animal?”

“Yeah, I think some of them get up to like a thousand kilos. Most are probably not that big.” Alex was entirely unfamiliar with the process of raising cattle and the exact details of such, but he had written a report on cows in grade school. 

“A thousand...” Her eyes widened slightly, looking back down at the slab of grilled meat otherwise untouched. “That is enormous. More than five *Rakaro*. Do they serve any other purpose aside from being used for meat?”

That third grade report was getting a workout today. “Used to be used to pull carts or plows, they produce milk, hides can be tanned for leather... Those are the biggest traditional uses, at least.”

“Very similar in use to the *Rakaro*, just massive.” She popped the slice of beef into her mouth and savored it. “Quite a lot of fat, too. What an interesting creature.”

“The fat striations - it is referred to as marbling - create a flavor profile that is generally not found in Tsla’o cuisine.” Carbon was a third done with her steak already. While she was speaking in a very formal cadence right now, she was not waiting to finish eating before she started sharing this with Eleya. 

“So it is. We will have to revisit this at some time, I suspect the chefs will find many interesting uses for it.” Eleya seemed just as sold on beef as Carbon.

“Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the first time you’ve had Human food?” Alex was almost certain that was a yes.

“It is. I leaned on Carbon’s knowledge of your cuisines, and she has certainly lead me down an agreeable path.”

“Everything we had from *Gardien* while in debrief was excellent.” It was, but it wasn’t Alex’s sort of thing. Too fancy. This time the steaks came with broccolini and truffled gnocchi. He wasn’t even sure what broccolini actually was. 

His burger had garlic fries on the side. That was perfect for him. It was familiar and comfortable and still made him feel homesick even though they had never had garlic fries at home.

“Wish they would have put me in the diplomatic suites for debrief at least once.” Ed grumbled into his burger. There was still mirth crinkling the corners of his eyes, the complaint all in fun.

“Careful what you ask for.” Alex shot back with a chuckle. Getting sent up there was a security thing, and had come after a week in quarantine. He wouldn’t say that exactly balanced out.

The conversation hit a lull there, everyone eating in silence. It was strange. Normally, any combination of this group would be fairly talkative. Things had changed a lot in the last few months.

It would have been nice if his dad had come along, even though the trip originally started as a girls day out. It would have just left him sitting around most of the day or acting as a third wheel, both of which Alex knew he didn’t particularly like. There would be other times, other meals shared. He’d see to that. 

Ambrose also had a ton of stories to tell that didn’t involve things that they were keeping secret as well, which would have been nice right now. Everything Alex could think of to talk about inevitably had to be heavily censored or simply not spoken of. Carbon was in the same boat and frankly he was a little worried about what Eleya would say if he tried to get her to keep talking about something. Audry loved engaging people in *conversations*, but usually shied away from just talking. Ed, on the other hand... “Hey, Ed. I am reasonably sure no one else at the table has heard about the *Easy-E*.”

He held up a finger, hands still gripping his burger as he was mid-bite. This was his favorite story. “Ok, ok. My first outing was on an original first generation Scoutship, right? The last one that was in service, the *Ernest Shackleton*. It was named before they started letting Pilots name them, they were on this kick of explorers who hadn’t killed a bunch of people with disease and war. Shackleton was perfect for that, absolute legend for what he went through to keep his crew alive. Keep that in mind. It had the nickname *Easy-E*, because it was not easy to work with at all. Fully and intentionally ironic, nothing ever worked exactly right...”

That got them through dinner. Ed’s bombastic retelling of the various things that plagued his first expedition and how close they had gotten to having to request a recovery on the ship was actually pretty entertaining. Alex was sure he was embellishing it a little bit, but all of it felt reasonable. He had just gotten to the point where the primary sensor bus caught fire while on approach to an F-type main sequence star when dessert arrived.

Apple pie à la mode. It didn’t really make sense for Noonan’s to be a bastion of pies, but somebody in the kitchen absolutely knocked it out of the park every time.

By the time Alex was done with his coffee, Ed and Vikas, his engineer, were limping the *Easy-E* home at a quarter of maximum speed to keep the Waveride array from collapsing itself.

“It was great seeing you guys again.” He hugged his mom tightly, and gave Ed a slap on the back. “When we get back from Na’o, I’ll be sure to find some time to catch up, all right?”

“I’ll bother Carbon about it until you do.” His mom smiled, always a troublemaker at heart.

Carbon got a laugh out of that as she leaned in and gave Audry a hug. “I will gladly bother him until he does.”

“See you, man. Take care and have fun, right?” He shook Alex’s hand, and put a little bit of jive on it.

Having fun wasn’t really on the itinerary in Na’o.  “You know I always take care, time will tell about having fun.” 

“It was lovely to make both of your acquaintances.” Eleya bowed to both Audry and Ed, who bowed back. 

His mom held her arms out to Eleya, eyebrows raised, and gestured for her to bring it on in. Audry was perceptive, always had been. If Alex had noticed his aunt-in-law feeling left out once, she had probably seen it three or four times.

There was a moment there where Eleya looked nervous, a brief flicker across her features before it was quashed. She went for the hug.

It was short, of course. A quick squeeze and friendly pat on the shoulder, and they were done. Just like when one of Alex’s regular aunts visited on holidays. Carbon was staring, wide-eyed with surprise the whole time.

DSS escorted Audry and Ed from the dining room, and the trio left gathered their own security agents before heading back down to the hanger. Alex stood between Carbon and her aunt, keeping the pair physically separated. He wasn’t sure if he inserted himself there despite how well things had gone, or because they had gone well and he now expected some sort of fuckery to occur.

“Would you allow me to accompany you back on the Masamune? I assume you will be piloting it, Alex, as we do not have anyone else trained on it.” Eleya spoke softly as they passed through the still-secured halls. “I direct that question to both of you.”

“Fine by me. Carbon?” He had stopped drinking after that one beer, which had been over an hour ago now, specifically because he had intended to fly it back. He also knew that question was actually aimed at Carbon. Mind getting trapped in a wee little can with the aunt you’re on questionable terms with for a few hours?

She actually thought about it, several meters of hallway passing by before she spoke. “I agree, it will be fine.”

“Thank you.” Despite having retained her usual level of self control after the Titan, Eleya sounded surprised. “It was...”

The Empress hesitated there, and then went silent as they approached the hanger. The Royal Guard were still there by the hatch to the GX8, and a little hive of activity fired up as they approached the Tsla’o ships. A gesture told her security team which ship she was taking, all of the guards splitting up as necessary, only the pair in power armor coming into the Masamune with them.

Eleya waited until the hatch was closed before she spoke again. “A moment, please. It was nice to spend time with you both, without the pretense of the court. Thank you. Alex, your mother is a treasure, be sure you treat her as such.” Her voice was still soft and felt as though she was still ruminating on the evening, devoid of the usual imperious tones that she was fond of.

Neither Alex or Carbon had really been prepared for that, exactly. Alex found his reply first, “of course, you’re welcome. I wish we could have been a bit more open about everything, but... Agreed, it was nice.”

“Yes. We are in agreement. I would like to speak as family more.” Carbon was surprised that those words had just come out of her own mouth.

Eleya looked happy. Strange as it was, a smile that appeared genuine and even continued up into her eyes was plastered on her face as she gave them a little bow. “I will be seated. I assume you do not require assistance with handling Human traffic control, young Prince?”

That did get a short chuckle out of him. “Yeah, I got them.” He turned to head up to the flight deck. Should get the thing fired up sooner rather than later. It was a two hour burn.

“Alex, before it slips my mind...” Eleya stopped him with a hand on his arm. She held up her index and middle fingers.  “You owe me two real Human drinks.”

He sighed. Can’t pull one over on a professional drinker. “Fine. You can avail yourself of  the bar on the way back.”

She clicked her tongue. “I will, but I am owed two *mixed* drinks. One of them must be the one your mother had.”

Alex rolled his eyes. Well, the Berkmann could do that easily enough. Just have to figure out what absurd other drink she was going to end up with. It had to have an extensive list. “Alright, I’ll figure it out. In the meantime, I gotta get this ship underway.”

Up the stairs he went, half expecting to hear Carbon follow him. No dice, but he could hear the two of them talking as he slipped into the pilot’s chair. He slid a finger under the row of switches to bring the ship to life, the hum of the engines peaking before settling to a low, distant drone.

He grabbed the headset and pulled it on, the last thing he heard from the cabin being Eleya asking Carbon to sit with her and discuss something long overdue.

I am doing this slowly as I know will succeed by doing things increments.

I ask some questions here as i find people in this sub to be more educated then people in keto subs. I'm still learning.

I know people on carnivore diets generally keep to large ruminate animals. 

Would eating fish fit a carnivore diet - are there any draw backs from fish and would eating it stop me from reaping the rewards of a carnivore diet?
Also would like opinions on chicken too.

I appreciate your collective knowledge. 

Edit.
Just wanted to add some details .
My reason for the diet choice is general health.
I have inflammation issues all over my body, joint pain, mouth ulcers.  Raised  immune globulins in my blood.


Since going keto, I have almost lost every single health issue ( it amazing) I have struggled for years. Been to all kinds if Dr's had no answers.

1gzhacr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gzhacr/what_is_the_best_espresso_coffee_machine_for_the/,What Is The Best Espresso Coffee Machine For The Home?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a wild journey trying to find the perfect espresso machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

After spending countless hours researching and testing different machines (and drinking way too much caffeine in the process), I've finally found what I believe is the perfect balance between quality and value for home brewing.

Let me tell you, making cafe-quality espresso at home isn't just about saving money – it's about the whole experience. There's something magical about being your own barista and pulling that perfect shot of espresso first thing in the morning.

I've discovered that the best espresso machines for home use need to hit a few key points:
- Easy to use (because who wants a complicated machine at 6 AM?)
- Consistent results (every. single. time.)
- Durable construction (it's an investment, after all)
- Good pressure control (crucial for that perfect crema)
- Steam wand for milk frothing (if you're into lattes and cappuccinos)

You can check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

One thing I learned the hard way is that cheaper isn't always better. Those budget machines might look tempting, but they often lack the pressure consistency needed for proper espresso extraction. Trust me, I learned this lesson after wasting money on two different budget machines.

The sweet spot seems to be in the mid-range category, where you get commercial-grade features without the commercial price tag. These machines typically have:
- 15-bar pressure pumps
- PID temperature control
- Proper portafilters
- Quality grinders (if it's an all-in-one)

Here's what really matters: good espresso at home isn't just about the machine. You need fresh beans, a decent grinder, and some basic knowledge about extraction. But with the right machine as your foundation, you're already halfway there.

If you're serious about upgrading your home coffee game, I'd strongly recommend checking out some reliable options here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

I've found that most people who invest in a quality espresso machine end up saving money in the long run. Think about it – those daily coffee shop visits add up quick! Plus, there's something satisfying about mastering the art of espresso making.

Remember, the best machine for you depends on your specific needs. Are you a straight espresso person? Do you love lattes? How many drinks do you make per day? Consider these questions when making your choice.

From my experience, starting with a solid semi-automatic machine is the way to go. They give you enough control to learn the craft while still being forgiving for beginners. It's like having training wheels that you can eventually take off as you get more confident.

Don't forget about maintenance either - a little care goes a long way in keeping your machine running perfectly for years. Regular cleaning and descaling are key!

What started as a simple quest for better coffee has turned into a full-blown passion for me, and I hope this helps you find your perfect espresso companion. Happy brewing!",1,1732536244.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Rue - Parallel Inspection LP [Yamatai Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: Yatuza, Kalane, Genic*  

What is this? Another entry under the ruebric **Yamatai is amazing**, where I rueminate about all the ruede duede ruebys of the underground scene the now Bristol-based imprint, which was crowned Beatport Label Of The Month this September and is set to take off on a rather special international tour next year, has been polishing up for us since its inception a mere three years ago? You're goddamn right. 

As you can tell from the endless punnery I'm feeling not a single shred of rue about or from simply reading the title of this section, this week's deep dive concerns **Rue**. Not the Middle English, Merriam Webster's [_Word Of The Day_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/rue-2024-09-23) winning word _(also in September, by the way)_, no no, I'm of course referring to British newcomer **Rue** and his truely fantastic new mini album! But first, let's jump back in time and see how we got here.

**1.1. Can you smell what the Rupert is Cooklin? (2000 - 2016)**

Growing up in the rather rueral Chalfont Saint Peter near London, **Rupert Cooklin** was arguably more concerned with _AMAZING_ Modern Warfare 3 Sniper Montages, epic Minecraft PvP fights and building pyramids out of Dr Pepper cans with his brother James than making it big in DnB, at least as far as I can tell from decyphering the ruenes of his early social media postings. However, in the midst of cycling through CS:GO clans as if they were underwear _(to be fair - some were simply ""shit"", as he put it)_, he also started sharing his very first musical creations as **State** as early as 2013! Not a whole lot could be uncovered from these archaeological sites, except for his _""synth-step""_ banger _Metronomy_ and his piano chord experimentation _Uprising_. While young Rupert seems to have hit the hiatus button on his early production journey, he _did_ return to share his piano work for his _Extended Project Qualification_ - a big project making up a lot of your final grade in your A-Levels - so he was clearly still very fond of this whole music thingy. 

**1.2. Crossing The Ruebicon (2016 - 2022)**

In fact, after school, he started his music-related studies in the DnB stronghold that is port city Bristol! Perhaps inspired by his brother's regular renaming shenanigans, from _Pure_ to _Sushido_ to the multi-disciplinary art overlord _Gaijin_ we have come to know and love nowadays, Rupert first temporarily rebranded himself to **Tempural** in 2019, before switching to **KTRL** just a year later. Cutting his teeth by playing out at Bristol's own _Take 5 Cafe_ for now defunct independent music brand _Wax Forms_, and by participating in the Southampton-based charity livestream series _Seshampton_, he was slowly but surely making a name for himself, and as 2022 rolled around, that (final) name would finally be revealed to the world: **Rue**! 

**1.3. Through The Ruef (2022 - 2024)**

After kicking things off with his very first _100% Rue Mix_ packed with tunes created during his time in uni, he would unleash one freebie after the other, from his bootleg of _Brent Faiyaz_' _Jackie Brown_ to _Midnight Blue_ and _Purpose_. While most of these were simply put out via his own SoundCloud, he also supplied the label arm of the aforementioned _Wax Forms_ with one of his early gems, _Games_. They weren't the only imprint keen to work with him though, none other than mister _James ""Illusive"" Williams_, a long-time friend of Rupert, also thought the Ruperfections would fit in very nicely over at his label **Yamatai**! Since the imprint's go-to stunning artwork wizard, Rupert's brother, the other James, was already an integral part of the machinery over there anyway, it only made sense really, and once 2024 rolled around, Rue joined the family fully.

Not only did he drop his highly anticipated _Attraction Complex EP_, with which he landed a spot on the legendary _VISION Radio_, he was also part of their third entry into the _Genesis_ saga, worked as sound tech for the charity project _PhilanthroPunks_ and participated in _Skydiving for Scannappeal_. Now, Rue once again spins his Future Bass, Dubstep and Neo-Soul inspirations into gold, both on his own and together with several of his talented mates, for his largest project as of yet, his mini album **Parallel Introspection**. So let's check it out!

**1.4. Parallel Inspection**

After a gentle, extended introduction to our love interest on the Prologue **We First Met**, we begin **Falling** for them, hard. Our bassy heart rumbling underneath, and our constantly, unpredictably evolving butterfly percussion floating all over the place, we practice our big confession in all sorts of different tones and intensities, until the uncontrollable yet beautiful synths take control. It's almost like an outright **Possession** has taken hold over our mind, banging on our door with hefty kicks, weaseling its intricately snappy snares and shaky hi-hats into every little part of our brain, before the obsessively bassy energy sweeps all across, wreaking havoc wherever it goes. 

Good thing that Rue can always count on his friends to help him out when he's up **Against The Wall** like this. With Austrian talent and fellow Yamatai family member Leon **Acris** Bernhard by his side, he takes us on a weighty train journey full of sharp-edged, (a)crispy snare action, rumbly bass stabs and all sorts of hectic sonic attacks on the duo. While this Austrian had to jump off at the nearest exit, Rue is joined by fellow _Wax Forms_ alumni **Pseuro** for the next bit of our ride, **Do You Even Know**, which accelerates from the rave siren filled steppes until we feel the full impact of these rolling stocks, before finally unleashing its deeply unsettling machinery sounds. To get this minimal train safely to its destination before the sun sets, Rue employs the help of yet another Empathy Audio resident, Austrian talent Gabriel **Dub Ten** Kirchebner, on project **SOL**. Dub Pistens pumping, pressure valves howling, not quite well-oiled gears turning and turning, pebbles flying off into the distance - and we have arrived.

After this tumultous ride, Rue meets up with brand new British talent Murray **M2K** McLarnon to slow us down a bit, with the dubby, steppy vibes of **To Be Better**. For maximum trippiness, check out Gaijin's [audiovisual journey for the tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqOPHcsUwQE)! Now that we're getting close to the finish line, it's time for some solo **Reflection**. Back at home, looking at the rainy outside under our comfy blanket, our inside thoughts start to come to light, wandering from softly rolling, gently synthy sonics to dubby stabs of (cook)lingering self-doubt piercing through our lovely protection layer of bass. Luckily, we have **Left** these thoughts **In Nirvana**, on our super vibey extended outro finale of the same name.

**1.5. Conclusion**

A relatively short yet all the more impactful story of congruent self reflection, emotionally exploring our truest selves with tightly produced (ru)percussion and on-point deep and dark viberey. This rueles.

####**2. Dapreme - Speechless [In The Lab Recordings]**  
*Recommended if you like: Notequal, Aduken, Manta*  

Of course, when I decide to dedicate my first pick to the homies at Yamatai, the homies at the almost-award-winning **In The Lab Recordings** just a few cities over also drop an absolutely crazy tune. Well, double homie feature week it is. For this one, we'll take a look at one of _the_ rising stars on the DnB horizon, Patrick Prem, better known as **Dapreme**!

**2.1. Patrick's World Premiere (2000 - 2021)**

Born around the millenium and raised in the Innsbruckian municipality of Wildermiming, Patrick has never been very far from the bustling music scenes of the district's capital namesake he would later move to anyway. Not all too long after winning the _Iron Bowl Championship_ with his American Football team, i.e. towards the tail end of 2019, he began playing around with producing super serious Hip-Hop beats, and once Covid hit, he dove into it head-first. Lucky for us, he soon stumbled upon this thing called drum and bass, and, inspired by the likes of _Waeys_, _Annix_ and _DLR_, sought to take a crack at it as well. While his mate Benni allowed him to sharpen his skills on the decks at various house parties, he would continue to slave away at the production side of things, until he was finally ready to unleash his first tune as **Dapreme**, _Turn off the Lights_, into the world in 2021. 

**2.2. Malwhere It All Took Off (2021 - 2023)**

Amidst bootlegs and Dapremixes for an unknown-to-me _Euphoria_ and _Josspoop_ _(I will never get over the name)_, and even some Hip-Hop with _AndrewX_, 2022 also saw him put out more and more originals like _Adaptation_, which not only put him on _my_ radar, but also caught the eye of _Phase Records_' _Gifta_, who promptly urged him to send through some tunes. As Patrick was slowly but surely becoming more and more involved with the local music scene, by playing various _Afterglow_ raves at _Club Cubique_, providing Austrian DnBrand _The Sixth Circle_ with a sick guest mix and even, from the ashes of the _Same Roots_ event brand, joining and co-creating the **Malware Audio** collective, he was also pushing his music to alpine heights, from the excellent reworks of _JP tuat wild_'s _Leberkas Intravenös_ and _Ludwig Göransson_'s Oppenheimer soundtrack, to his collaborative work with _Default Noise_, _Camo & Krooked_ lure _Come Around_, and a rather big contribution to _Venjent_'s _Another Monday_ remix competition. 

**2.3. Honeymoon Phase (2023 - 2024)**

However, perhaps the biggest thing happening that year was, after meeting up and getting along su(da)premely well with them on a visit to London, Patrick's official inauguration as resident of the _Phase Records_ family. After soft launching his involvement with the freebie _Hypnosis_ and his bootleg for T.I. and Rihanna's _Live Your Life_, he not only became a regular on the label with _two_ contributions to their massive _Perspective II_ compilation, which earned him his first play on _VISION Radio_, his _Gimmie That_ EP, and _Lost Lover_ on _Charis_' EP, earning them both their first _UKF_ upload, he also played his first festival set at _Hospitality on The Beach 2024_ (!), and became Phase's A&R Manager! That's not all there was to this year though, no no, earlier this year he also participated in Bishu's legendary _BishBattle_ sample flip with some heavy-duty Dubstep, deb-you-ted on the one and only _Stellar Audio_, and, well, now he's made it all the way over to the **In The Lab** chaps!

**2.4. Speechless**

I was tempted to just leave this review of **Speechless** blank, but not only have I already done that joke in the promo blurb, it would also just not be fair to the insanity unfolding on these four and a half minutes. With _lovely_ pianos and a classic, catchy vocal sample setting the mood, one might not expect the impending madness, but the dramatic synths do raise suspicion. Right as the vocal hits its powerful peak, Patrick unleashes a lethal combo of thorny yet rolling drums, outright _all-consuming_ distorted basses and rhythmically hypnotising interjections, immediatelly winning me over. That's not all though, we're also treated to some pounding 4x4 action leading us to an supercharged second drop that, even on the 20th listen, still blows me away. 

If I hadn't just spent hours writing the above paragraphs, I would say it left me speechless. Patrickdiculously good.

Other techy things from this week:  
- YOSHUU - Outset EP  
- Drumsik - When It's Right  
- BULC - Fading Away... 💎  
- Internal_ERROR - Unbroken 💎  
- Jade Sierra - let me down 💎

As a tattoo artist, I've spent countless hours hunched over clients, my back aching, and my wrists screaming. That is, until I discovered the ergonomic tattoo chair. Let me walk you through my journey, from back pain to bliss, in the quest for the perfect chair.
  
  
## The Wake-Up Call

It was a typical Tuesday morning, and I was gearing up for a long day of inking. As I settled into my chair, I felt a familiar twinge in my lower back. You know that feeling when you sit down and your body just goes, “Whoa, hold on there, buddy!”? Yeah, that was me. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was just a little stiffness from the previous day. But as the hours dragged on, that twinge turned into a full-blown protest. My neck felt like it was in a wrestling match, and my shoulders were screaming louder than my clients when I hit the needle just right. 

I realized I couldn’t keep ignoring it. I mean, how could I create masterpieces when I felt like a pretzel? So, I decided it was time for a change. I dove into research mode, armed with a cup of coffee and a determination that could rival a caffeine-fueled squirrel. I scoured the internet, reading reviews, watching videos, and even chatting with fellow artists. I learned about the wonders of ergonomic design—how a chair could support my back, keep my posture in check, and even make my clients more comfortable. It was like discovering a hidden treasure map, leading me to the perfect chair that could save my back and my artistry.

## Debunking Myths

You know, when I first heard about ergonomic tattoo chairs, I thought, “What a load of nonsense!” I mean, how could a chair really make that much of a difference? I pictured a fancy throne that would make me feel like a king while I inked my clients. But let me tell you, there are some wild myths floating around that kept me from investing in one for way too long.

First off, a lot of folks think ergonomic chairs are just for office workers. Seriously? I used to believe that too. But here’s the kicker: these chairs are designed to support your body, no matter what you’re doing. Whether you’re tattooing a dragon on someone’s back or a tiny heart on a wrist, comfort is key.

Another myth is that ergonomic chairs are super expensive and not worth the investment. I get it; tattoo artists often have tight budgets. But let me tell you, after a long day of tattooing, my back used to feel like I’d been wrestling a bear. Once I switched to an ergonomic chair, I felt like I could take on the world—or at least finish my next tattoo without wincing. 

So, if you’re still on the fence about getting one, just remember: comfort isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity. Trust me, your back will thank you!

## The Quest Begins

When I first set out on my quest for the perfect ergonomic tattoo chair, I felt like a kid in a candy store—except the candy was made of leather and metal, and the store was filled with chairs that looked like they could double as a spaceship. I knew I needed something that would keep both me and my clients comfortable during those long sessions. So, I started my research, diving into the world of ergonomic chairs like a detective on a mission.

First off, adjustability was a must. I mean, who wants to be stuck in a chair that feels like a medieval torture device? I found models like the _Tattoo Chair Pro 3000_ (okay, I might have made that name up, but you get the idea) that boasted multiple height settings and reclining options. I also looked for support—my back has been through enough already! Chairs with lumbar support and padded armrests caught my eye, like the _Inked Comfort Series_. 

Durability was another key feature. I didn’t want a chair that would fall apart after a few months of heavy use. Brands like _Tattoo Tech_ and _Ergo Ink_ seemed promising, with their sturdy frames and high-quality materials. I even read reviews from other artists who swore by them. It was like gathering intel before a big mission!

## The Game-Changer

When I first laid eyes on the ergonomic tattoo chair that eventually stole my heart, I thought, “This is it! This is the throne I’ve been waiting for!” It had this sleek design that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie, but what really caught my attention were its unique features. The chair was adjustable in every possible way—height, backrest angle, and even the footrest! I mean, who knew a chair could be so versatile? 

As a tattoo artist, I often found myself hunched over for hours, and let me tell you, my back was not a fan. But this chair? It cradled me like a supportive friend. The memory foam padding was like sitting on a cloud, and the breathable fabric kept me cool, even during those marathon sessions. I could finally focus on my art instead of my aching back!

Setting it up was a breeze. I just had to adjust the height to match my workstation, and voilà! I even added a little cushion for my lower back because, well, comfort is key. I felt like I was in my own little comfort zone, ready to create masterpieces without the usual discomfort. It was a game-changer, and I couldn’t be happier!

## The Transformation

When I finally made the leap to an ergonomic tattoo chair, it felt like I was stepping into a whole new world. Seriously, it was like going from a rickety old bicycle to a shiny new sports car. The first thing I noticed was how much less my back ached after a long day of inking. I used to feel like a pretzel by the end of my sessions, but now? I could actually stand up straight without looking like I was auditioning for a role in a zombie movie.

One day, I had a client who was a bit of a chatterbox—let’s call her “Tattoo Tina.” As I was working on her sleeve, she commented, “Wow, you seem so much more relaxed today!” I chuckled and told her about my new chair. She said it made a noticeable difference in my focus and energy. I mean, if Tina noticed, it had to be real, right?

Not only did my physical health improve, but my work performance skyrocketed. I found myself more creative and less fatigued. I could spend hours perfecting details without feeling like I needed a nap halfway through. It was like my brain had been given a comfy chair of its own! Plus, my clients seemed to appreciate the extra attention to detail. Who knew a chair could change so much?

## Lessons Learned

You know, looking back on my journey with ergonomic tattoo chairs, I can’t help but chuckle at how naive I was at first. I thought, “A chair is just a chair, right?” Oh, how wrong I was! The importance of ergonomics in our industry is like the secret sauce in a good burger—without it, you’re just left with a sad, dry patty. 

One of the biggest lessons I learned is that comfort isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity. Long hours hunched over clients can lead to some serious back pain. I remember one session where I was so uncomfortable that I could barely focus on the art. My advice? Invest in a good ergonomic chair. It’s like trading in your old clunker for a shiny new ride. You’ll feel the difference in your back and your work.

Now, let’s talk challenges. Switching to an ergonomic chair can feel a bit like learning to ride a bike again. It takes time to adjust. You might feel a bit wobbly at first, but stick with it! Give yourself a few sessions to get used to the new setup. And don’t forget to tweak the height and angle to fit your style. Trust me, your body will thank you later!

## Conclusions
  
  
After years of back pain and discomfort, I finally found my holy grail: the ergonomic tattoo chair. It's not just a chair; it's an investment in my health, my career, and my clients' experience. So, fellow artists, listen to your body, do your research, and find your perfect fit. Your body (and your tattoos) will thank you!

Inside, it’s just as inviting, and the second floor is definitely the spot to chill and also work. While the indoor space is a bit snug, the alfresco seating makes up for it, giving you the perfect spot to enjoy the exterior view with your coffee.

As for the coffee, I’ve already tried all their signature creations before, so this time I went for the **Brown Butter Latte** again since I couldn’t quite remember the taste. It’s a bit on the sweeter side for me, but it could easily be a comfort pick for others.

Hope all are well and I apologize if this seems out of order but I have been having difficulty with a ""friend"" that has gotten to a point now where I am beginning to question my own sanity when it comes to connections with people.

Half a year ago I joined a hobby group where I met 26F and rather quickly we became good hobby friends. As the hobby group came to an end her and I began to talk behind the scenes about how badly things ended in the hobby group. One thing leading to another where her and I caught up for coffee where she admitted to having feelings for me. I was rather caught off guard as she does have a partner but they are in a poly relationship which I am none the wiser about. Few weeks go by and she agrees to see a show with me and after we have a talk about us. For context I swore off dating for the year due to circumstances. At the end of the night however she says that upon thinking more about things she doesn't actually have feelings for me which leaves me frustrated due to the back and forth on this decision but ultimately we go past it.

Several IRL interactions and meet ups are fine but always seem either distant or cold. Eventually for me stepping back, leaving messages on read or very brief responses (Not the best way to handle things I know.)

That half a year now is where we are. I joined a new hobby group with all new people with different online usernames. Hobby night arrives however and she is there. In fact she went out of her way to make sure she made a fake name in case I would see her and make a reason not to join the group. Four weeks go by to where we land here today.

Driving her home she says how she wants to be a close friend of mine but she would never date me (in fact going as far to almost insult me at the notion of ever dating). Yet wants to be close and in my life. Then a few minutes later being fully fine if we aren't friends and hopes we can be friends in the future if I would ever allow it as I said I might be leaving the hobby group.

I don't understand these weird behaviors and back and forth on feelings and not sure really on how to proceed or even if I should proceed?

1gzgj6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1gzgj6y/am_i_normal/,Am I normal?,"It all started as a kid, I always wondered why people are afraid of trying things out and instead of swallowing in their own misery. Soon enough I figured out why, often I get beat by my father as a kid, before I thought it was just a normal thing to do for discipline. But thinking back now I guess being thrown of hot coffee, punch in the mouth, and blamed for everything was normal to me. 

I'm not a perfect child

As a kid I never had someone teach me about anything related about emotions, so when someone is crying my family would joke around saying how weak people when they cry, and I never had my father teach me about mostly anything so I had to figure out things on my own. (sure my father taught me about how to drive his motorcycle and I should be respect everyone and pretty much let me grow that's all).

I never understand the value of feelings that people feels. Often I just ignore it or take advantage of it. How am I supposed to know if I myself get beat up often by my father? Everytime I try to speak to him he always bounce back and say things like, ""you should have listen to me"" or ""it's your fault"", when I try to talk things out he often just disregard me and just say things that bounce it off. 

Me and my father went through exploration of having different step mother. I never even saw my real mother, or even know her own name to be exact. My first memory was my father and my first step mother.


I feel distant to everyone, even when I'm surrounded by them. I can't blend in or even just be with them. I'm afraid they'll use it against me. 

Everytime I made friends they often have to be cut off (only message I'm able to connect with them) to the point of I just don't see any value to making friends anymore.


Everytime I open up to my father he always say things like how you shouldn't be doing that or this etc.., to the point of I don't care anymore. (Sure I feel scared that he might hit me again) 

As of now I'm in with my step mother house due to their poor choices relating to their job. 

We lost our previous house because my father  broke the negotiation with my uncle.

Now I'm stuck in my step mother house.


It's hell.


I'm tired.



It started in 2020, where everything started to fall apart. After moving to my step mother's house all fall apart. My grandma (from my step mom) made everything hell for me. Now they call me useless, worthless, and garbage.

And when they see me happy or just smile I immediately can tell that they are planning something to take it away. To make me feel miserable. To remind me of who I am.


I remember being yelled by my step mother out of nowhere because my grandma would say things that she didn't like or feel like rude that I did even though I know nothing of it. 

I tried speaking to her of course but she doesn't listen. She justify her actions of making me feel miserable by saying things ""if you're going to disrespect someone, disrespect me not my parents"" 

Though like I said, I tried  saying my side of the argument but she always disregard it.

It's unfair. And my conviction was bottling up, I want to cry and to say how I didn't know ANYTHING about what's happening and why I'm being blame. It was like being blame for something you don't even know of. 

This continue for 4 years now (will be 5 years after this year). 

Being blamed, being punish, being treated shit . Majority of it I don't even know anything about.

They always gossip about me. How I'm fucked up. 

And my father isn't helping at all. He would always say things ""You should apologize, we don't own this house and they can kick us at any moment).


So I have no choice but to stay silent about everything. Having to keep everything inside, to the point of I don't speak much anymore, and when they noticed how I'm often quite, they ask why. Like they just forget what happened. 

It make sense considering it will be weeks or months before they talk to me.

My father always hits me when I was a kid. So I didn't know anything about being genuine. That's where I also learn how to manipulate others when they about to punish me.

As of now I'm just stuck in my bed. Wondering if I can even make it. I'm probably gonna get beat up soon considering how I'd procrastinate to my school work. I'm about to fail, again.


After all, I don't feel like it's important anymore. I don't care about everything. I don't see any reason why I should keep trying.

Oh speaking of trying, everytime I try to be in their good side they will always find a way to say something. Especially my grandma from my step mom.

Washing plates they would say how it's messy or how I'm wasting too much soap. Always complaining about pretty much everything. 

And when they see me doing well about myself they would always find a way things to say or remind me.

""You're useless, fucking bitch you don't even wash the plates or help in this house at all""

""Why are you still here?""

""You should be kick out, I don't even know why you're still here""

""The next time you fail school you're not gonna try again""

""You always in your room doing nothing""

..

..

.

For years. As they move on I'm stuck with it.
The way they smile, reminds me of the things happened. 


Yesterday I went for a job with my friends, after a month of staying mostly in my room due to my fuck up mental health. 

Me and my friends were enjoying our morning jog when I saw my grandpa (from my step mom as well) outside the house taking care of my new born sibling. 

.

I then ignore and focus to my friends and walk by and talk to them.

Then night time came and he start throwing tantrum at me.

""YOU'RE FUCKING USELESS, YOU SHOULD MOVE OUT, AFTER ALL YOU'RE NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING OR PROVIDING ANY AT ALL, YOU'RE WORTHLESS LAZY SHIT""

Hahahhahahaha, now looking back it sounds funny why he even saying these things, after all I consider it normal that my family often say painful things to me. I mean that's normal., right?

Years of continuesly of this and I just think it's normal. Until I search it out on Reddit for people who went through the same.

Now I don't do anything, I don't wash nor provide anything at all. I just stay at my room doing my own thing. And of course, I get call useless and worthless from time to time.

It's normal after all.


......


....


...


Is it really?


....


.



I'm tired. I get bullied from school for being too nice. I didn't know how to act when I'm around others so I'm just being nice. I got bullied for it.

Now I just don't care anymore.

I'm apathetic, I'm selfish. 

I'm always wrong and I don't feel like doing anything at all. Everything is pointless anyway. why waste your time chasing your dream when you're just gonna fall?

Why try when you're going to die anyway?

I don't have anyone who is ""normal"" to talk to.

What I consider normal is different from the average perspective of others.

After all, I never had a healthy relationship with my family.

Now I'm just afraid.

I'm going to be hit again by my father. I procrastinated my school work after all.


....


Should I cry again and let it pass by, or should I take my revenge?

After all I don't even know what I should feel about this.

I'm confused.

I hate them, I hate every single one of them I despise them I want to see them fall apart I want them to fall, they always complain about my flaws when they can't even look at themselves without lying. They act like they are rightous and disregard others. Hypocrites.

I hate them. At the same time I can't do anything. My options are tied up. If I try to speak they will shoot me with their reasonings.


 And god is just watching me.

As of now, I'm selfish,apathetic,probably depressed, failure, insecure, quiet, and will take advantage of you.

I don't care anymore after all.

And yet I'm here. Venting it out. There's still a lot to say but mostly are this.

As of now I just have the desire to burn everything. Literally. 

I feel like I'm being edgy for saying this, sorry if it cringes you out. 

After all I don't even know what normal is from others.

To summarize, I'm fucked.

I turned 18 this year without celebrating and I just want to know if this is normal too?

I havent stopped thinking of you.

These past few days I've been thinking about writing you, I just didn't know what to write. My thoughts of you are just all over the place. I'm also trying to let you go but it seems like you're the new cycle I have myself entangled in.

My thoughts of you are like short stories, of a whole story, and I can't put it into chapters 'cause my mind wanders from one place to another.

I remember you in Pasig.
I remember you when I walk I ride the train.
I remember you when I see the malls we used to walk in.
I remember you in Antipolo.
I remember you when I try to get to know someone.
I remember you in After Sunset.
I remember you when I'm drinking my coffee.
I remember you when I try to think about what kind of guy I want to be with.
I remember you when I'm outside my house.
I remember you in Cubao.

I think about you in every shadows, 'cause I hope it's you. Now I can't go any deeper when I try building connections. It's just different around you. Though it's unfortunate that you don't feel the same, I'm just glad I met you. You were, for a while, my significant other, but I can't hide the fact that we are now strangers. Maybe we'll stay like that from hereon.

I miss you. I dont know for how long, but I'll work it out.

1gzgi37,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1gzgi37/bad_experience/,Bad experience,"We literally finished our 2 day test of VV and all I can say is - we’ll never be back.

Embarkation 

We upgraded to a suite via LevelUP, hence we had the rockstar entrance experience. Rockstar entrance was filled with TV crew and celebs cutting the rockstars, and we had about a 15 minute wait to get into the check in desks because their marketing dept thought it’s more important to let other people in before us. 
The lounge is a sad excuse of a lounge. Dirty. Poor offerings. Pretty sad. Competition has done a much better job.

Room

We upgraded into a brilliant suite. I have nothing bad to say about the room itself. It’s ok, equipped well. The only issue would be the pillows.

Food

Where do I even start. The worst food I’ve had on a cruise line, to the extent that RCLs main dinning is a Michelin compared to this. 
First night - the wake - that and a steakhouse are coincidental. The appetizers were low grade fish and a wedge salad. Both of our steaks were not cooked correctly and I’d say USDA choice at best even if that, might just be even lower grade.

Deck 16s food court (which let’s face it, it’s a sophisticated buffet) has low standards as well. Ramen was absolutely unedible, sushi was ok, the only good thing on that floor was the salad.

Pizza place is nice however we’ve been having stomach pain since we got on board, I’m assuming it is because of VERY poor ingredients they use here

The dockhouse and Italian restaurant had the best food, but still, not anything like any speciality dining in other cruise lines.

Noise

We understand this is a party cruise line. We understand their DJ starts at 1030PM. What we don’t understand is how in the world guests and the cruise line feels it’s ok to party next door to us, put their record player on high, and slam the door right and left at 2:15AM. These walls are made of thin paper, and only after calling twice did security ask them to stop, and that was 3am.

Rockstar

Our agent was fabulous and helped us with whatever we needed. Did we feel like Rockstar gives you anything? Nope. Richard’s rooftop is a poor excuse for a private deck. The two jacuzzis can host 4 people unless you want to rub other people. The day beds layout is that if one loud couple decides to join in your relaxation is done. Apart from priority boarding and priority debarkation - I do not feel like being a rockstar gives you much. Of course the size of the room, but other than that nothing. Not even a lounge to go and have some snacks and coffee throughout the day, which we knew, but what a waste.

Service

Very mixed service on board this cruise line. Very different than other staff members on other lines. I would say it was either very good or very bad, no in between.

1gzghvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1gzghvl/seeking_advice_on_training_generative_models_for/,Seeking Advice on Training Generative Models for Specific Product Photos Without Distortions,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been experimenting with **Flux + LoRa** to train the model to generate photos of specific products. For some objects, like a coffee cup, the results were impressive—almost photorealistic, though with slight dimension distortions.

However, for other products, such as a specific box with a logo that must adhere to precise dimensions, the generated photos were way off. The box shape and proportions often didn’t align with the real-world product, making the results unusable for my needs.

I’m curious if anyone has experience training models specifically for generating accurate photos of products, especially when strict dimensional fidelity is required.

Here are my main questions:

1. Are there specific pre-trained models that are better suited for finetuning on objects requiring precise shapes and dimensions?
2. Does anyone have recommendations for techniques or best practices (e.g., dataset preparation, augmentations, hyperparameters) to improve accuracy for these kinds of products?
3. Are there other methods or tools beyond Flux + LoRa that might perform better for this use case?

Any insights or guidelines would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",1,1732533176.0,StableDiffusion,2,1.0,False

[Green tea has long been hailed as a health elixir](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn), offering numerous benefits, from improving heart health to enhancing brain function. Among its most celebrated properties is its ability to boost metabolism, making it a popular choice for those looking to lose weight or maintain a healthy lifestyle.

[How Does Green Tea Boost Metabolism?](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn)

Green tea contains a combination of caffeine and antioxidants, particularly catechins, which are responsible for its metabolism-boosting effects. These compounds work synergistically to increase fat oxidation, the process by which your body breaks down fat for energy.

1. Catechins (EGCG): The primary antioxidant in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), promotes fat burning by enhancing the activity of norepinephrine, a hormone that signals fat cells to break down fat.
2. Caffeine: While green tea has less caffeine than coffee, its moderate amount provides a gentle energy boost, enhancing physical performance and calorie burning.

Studies suggest that green tea can increase calorie expenditure by 3–4% daily, which may not sound like much but can add up over time.

When to Drink Green Tea for Best Results

* Morning: Start your day with a cup of green tea to kickstart your metabolism and improve focus.
* Before Exercise: Drinking green tea before workouts can enhance fat-burning during exercise.
* Between Meals: Enjoying green tea as a mid-morning or afternoon beverage helps curb hunger and prevents unhealthy snacking.

Additional Benefits Beyond Metabolism

* Improved Digestion: Green tea can aid in digestion, reducing bloating and discomfort.
* Rich in Antioxidants: The antioxidants in green tea combat free radicals, supporting overall health and reducing inflammation.
* Supports Brain Function: The combination of caffeine and L-theanine in[ green tea](https://linktr.ee/balance_burn) improves focus and reduces anxiety.

Tips for Maximizing the Benefits

1. Choose High-Quality Tea: O p t for fresh, organic green tea to ensure maximum nutrient retention.
2. Limit Sugar and Additives: Adding sugar or sweeteners can negate the health benefits. Enjoy it plain or with a splash of lemon.
3. Stay Consistent: Drinking green tea regularly is key to reaping its metabolism-boosting effects.

Conclusion

Green tea is more than just a soothing beverage—it’s a powerful ally in boosting metabolism, aiding weight loss, and supporting overall health. By making it a regular part of your daily routine, you can enjoy its many benefits while staying energized and focused on your wellness goals.

My step mum who i had to move back in with who can be like my best friend, has been giving me a really hard time. When she comes in, as I am not working, chores are left for me to do, which is perfectly fine. I make sure everything is clean and ready when she comes back from work—everything is all done. But I feel so undervalued. I make tea or coffee every morning and am still actively applying for jobs, but I get spoken to like shit—like actual shit.

I am told to ""do the f ***LANDING OR F*** bathrooms."" I feel so low and so beneath everyone. Her daughter is a brat, and my things have been broken and glasses snapped. I feel like a maid. I woke up in a really good mood just to be spoken to like shit again. If I stick up for myself, I get threatened with being kicked out onto the streets.

I cry every day and don't know what to do. Her attitude is so normalized that she doesn't even realize how rude she can be. It's just in her nature to speak to me badly.

Like I just wanna be apricated I contribute in anyway i know how going to the shops for anything, daily cleaning it's like my best isn't good enough and if she's having a bad day I'll have the worst one, I had to cancel plans with a friend cos how I was treated today I was told to "" shut the fuck up"" i am a"" bitch"" "" fuck you"" cos I asked if a gift was delivered for me, My birthday present that was sent got taken and I never saw got thrown cos It didn't have my name on it, all my dad does it stick up for her or I get ganged up on. idk it just makes me so sad",2,1732532861.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

So I put that on bumble as a joke and continued to roam around. 
In some time, I matched with someone and he suggested that if we could find each other there, we should pretend that we are some old friends/exes whatever and then never see each other again. 
I was already bored so I was like sure whatever (he seemed cute and all so I kinda wanted to see him if he was actually there). 
Idiot did find me and without any greetings or hesitation, went on a monologue on how he hasn't seen me in forever and now he got married and it's been sooo long. It took me 10 mins to really grasp his story and then I also told him stuff about me (half lies, half half lies). 

We really made up this stupid universe for 30mins and then had a coffee and sandwich together. Roamed around the airport, making up stories about other people. It was really so spontaneous and fun I coilsnt believe it for half the time. 
He bought me a cute plushie from miniso and I bought him hot wheels, the ford one. 

2hours felt like 20 minutes and that's the most fun I'd had in months. And then my boarding got started so I had to leave. We had a proper goodbye hug (he smelled so good, i didn't wanna let go of). I was the last person in the boarding queue and got all the eyes from other passengers and crew, they must be thinking he's like my bf or something.

Let me introduce you to ELEVATOR JUMPING!

All ores (except diamond) are unable to spawn on normal elevator floors (eg. 65, 70, 75, 80), however, you can take a ladder down to the next floor where they will spawn. We can take advantage of this by using the elevator to go to a floor such as F80, and then take the ladder (guaranteed) down to F81. This strategy is also barely affected by daily luck so you can even do it on very bad luck days.

**ELEVATOR JUMPING FOR GOLD**

1 - Use elevator to Floor 80 and take ladder down to 81

2 - Pause while going down and look around while paused to see if goodies present.

3.1 - Yes ores: Go mine them and then return up the ladder you came from (or take ladder down if available).

3.2 - No ores: Immediately click on the ladder to return to the surface (F0).

4 - Run back to elevator

*Repeat steps 1-4 and amass tons of resources!*

**Example Attempt**

In my demo run, I started with very minimal gear to showcase how effective it is. Mining time was from 6:50 am - 1:50 am and done on a bad luck day (-0.054). Had level 5 mining for miner perk (+1 ore per node).

1. Iron pickaxe
2. Obsidian edge (F90 mines reward)
3. 10 salads
4. 1st backpack upgrade

**Results:**

Nearly 400 gold ores and a bunch of gems (4 diamonds was quite lucky), netting $17k. You can also do this on other floors like F60 for iron ores, or for monster eradication goals.

If you have other things such as a gold/iridium pickaxe, coffee, spicy eel, minecarts unlocked, bombs, animation cancelling, etc, expect a higher yield.

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

COVID happened less than a year after graduating high school and I was at university. I felt so much less lonely and connected to people in my life since then. I almost feel like a tortured soul that tries to talk to strangers as if I was a lonely old person with no family or friends. 

Some girl on tiktok said she told her therapist about her lack of connection problem (and in both of our cases it is just a feeling).and she said her therapist said that that's usually from having a family you're not well connected to? Because she mentioned too how she wants to be constantly social but not in a way where she has to meet up for a coffee for 2 hours with a friend to just socialize.

1gzfyhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gzfyhk/10_furniture_trends_that_will_define_the_next_year/,10 Furniture Trends That Will Define the Next Year,"As we step into a new year, the world of furniture design is gearing up to embrace fresh trends that prioritize style, functionality, and sustainability. Whether you’re revamping your living room, upgrading your [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), or adding chic [stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) to your home, these trends promise to redefine modern interiors and elevate your spaces.

Here’s a look at the top 10 furniture trends that will dominate the next year:

# 1. Sustainable Materials

The demand for eco-friendly [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) continues to rise. Designers are exploring reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metals to craft timeless pieces that don’t compromise on style. This trend extends to **balcony furniture**, where sustainable options like teak and weather-resistant wicker are becoming staples.

# 2. Bold, Sculptural Designs

Furniture is transforming into works of art. Expect to see unique silhouettes in sofas, chairs, and even **stools**, adding dramatic flair to your spaces. Think curves, asymmetry, and unexpected angles that make a statement.

# 3. Multi-Functional Pieces

As spaces become more compact, multi-functional **home furniture** is a must. From foldable tables to storage ottomans, furniture that adapts to various needs is gaining traction. Compact **balcony furniture** that doubles as storage is particularly popular in urban homes.

# 4. Earthy Tones and Natural Finishes

Neutral palettes with earthy tones like terracotta, olive green, and sandy beige are making a comeback. These colors pair beautifully with natural materials, creating a serene and inviting atmosphere for your **home furniture** and outdoor spaces.

# 5. Statement Lighting with Integrated Furniture

Lighting is no longer just a separate element; it’s becoming part of the furniture. Look out for bedside tables with built-in lamps or **stools** that incorporate LED accents for a futuristic touch.

# 6. Balcony as an Extension of Living Spaces

The balcony is evolving into a functional and aesthetic part of the home. Comfortable **balcony furniture** like modular seating, hanging chairs, and compact dining sets are trending as homeowners transform their outdoor areas into mini sanctuaries.

# 7. Maximalism with Patterns and Textures

While minimalism has reigned for years, maximalism is making a bold entry. Patterned upholstery, textured rugs, and vibrant **stools** are perfect for those looking to infuse personality into their interiors.

# 8. Vintage and Retro Revival

Mid-century modern and retro designs are back in vogue. Vintage-inspired **home furniture** with tapered legs, bold patterns, and nostalgic color palettes will be seen across living rooms and dining areas.

# 9. Smart Furniture

Technology is seamlessly blending into furniture design. Smart coffee tables with wireless charging, adjustable-height desks, and voice-controlled **balcony furniture** are just a few examples of how innovation is shaping the furniture of tomorrow.

# 10. Cozy Comfort Meets Luxury

The concept of ""hygge"" is influencing furniture design, with plush, oversized sofas and lounge chairs dominating the scene. Paired with luxurious materials like velvet or leather, these pieces offer the perfect balance of coziness and sophistication. Even **stools** are getting the luxe treatment with padded seats and opulent finishes.

# Conclusion

From eco-friendly materials to smart furniture, the trends for the next year focus on blending style with practicality. Whether you’re updating your indoor **home furniture**, adding charm to your **balcony furniture**, or incorporating trendy **stools**, these ideas will ensure your space stays ahead of the curve.

1gzfy2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gzfy2p/my_contribution_to_the_community_my_po_method/,My contribution to the community -- my PO method,"Among coffee folk, it's well-known that much of the bitter notes in coffee are derived from the oils.   Logically, reducing or eliminating this ingredient would therefore yield a less bitter taste.   Now it's arguable that in doing other aspects that are desirable (though some might argue bitters are desirable), such as texture (oil gives you a more full-bodied taste), and aromatics might also be lost, but in my experience that hasn't been the case. 

I've been using this method for the better part of my pourover experience (going 20+ years now), as it has become my tried and true method over others.

You can adapt the following 8oz cup recipe as needed:

The Recipe:

Grounds: 15g fine, brew temp: 94C.  Total brew time being around 2.5 minutes. ps. this PO method is a 2-1 bypass.

The Brewer: a micromesh Osaka Titanium Gold dripper

The Pour method:  The initial pour should be quick and fully saturate the grounds. Allow to bloom to deflate completely (until dripping stops). Then pour as fine a laminar flow as you can directly down the center until the grounds are fully saturated at the original level of the coffee bed. Once there, reduce your flow to a steady slow drip to maintain the saturation level.  Do not stray away from the center, as tempting as it may seem. Once 2/3rds of the brew is produced (160ml), remove the cup (or brewer). Dilute with 80ml of hot water. 

The key to this method keeping the oils trapped at the surface, while brewing the grounds directly underneath.  In doing so, you've brewed a sweeter, less bitter cup.  I'm hopeful this method will work as well for you as it has for me. 

Please try and let me know how it works out.. Also... I'd love to see more folks share their methods (not this one, but your own post).

I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great have more close friendships. I am based in Northamptonshire, however, it would be great to meet new people and friends in nearby cities to me such as Leicester (which is around 30 minutes away from me by train), and where it is more easy distance-wise to meet up in person  more regularly and where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I like to play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.



If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for friends also, and if anyone shares the same social interests and hobbies, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect. 


**Looking for platonic friendships only.

The tooth slightly below gum line has a greyish/brownish/darker spot. But no pain except from tender gums when brushing. Coffee or tee stains? Enamel in need of mineralization? Just had a dentist visit and an xray three weeks ago and the tooth looked fine. ,1,1732530247.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
